123
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:35,417
[SPEAKER_16]: As a working artist myself, you know it's hard to overstate how important it is to have a community art center actually within our city limits, it's, it's very hard to find.

124
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,422
[SPEAKER_16]: space for arts, for community arts within our communities.

125
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:45,247
[SPEAKER_16]: These spaces are really scarce, they're really precious, they really mean a lot to artists working in all types of media.

126

[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm really excited to see what this can do to leverage a very rich existing arts community in Medford and I just want to wish a very hearty congratulations to everybody who's worked on this project so far.

128
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:57,560

129
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

130
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:00,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Collins for bringing this forward.

131
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:04,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you for this because I started working on this two years ago.

132
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:16,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the one that received the call from that company and the gentleman that I spoke to says he had some space that he would want to donate to the community.

133
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:39,052
[SPEAKER_01]: My first thought was the home for the arts and immediately after that, I reached out to my fellow counselor counselor marks at the time, who was a member of the Arts Council, and him and I, along with Jim silver or rumor, and other people we had several meetings with the people from Gordon group and it ended up be.

134
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:45,374
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to wait until it finally got approved by thing but it's something that you know I'm happy to be part of.

135
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:53,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you know Council marks for all his help because he goes back to the days when they were trying to get the swan school.

136
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:59,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that never happened and I know we tried to get the property on.

137
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:03,404
[SPEAKER_01]: over by the park there, that never came through.

138
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:21,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, this is something that I'm glad that I had a hand in, and I say, I wanna thank all the people in the arts community for all their, we had many meetings down there, and I know it took some time before we finally approved it, but I think that was one of the, that was a good thing when they came to me and we got it done.

139
00:13:22,295 --> 00:13:23,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

140
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:24,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Sanchez.

141
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:25,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Farrell.

142
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:29,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Councilor Caraballo kind of read my mind.

143
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:50,568
[SPEAKER_14]: The talking about arts and how we find a space for arts was one of the things that Councilmarks and I actually talked about a long time ago before I even ran for office, and I wanted to make sure that you got a proper shout out for the work that he's done and the tremendous amount of effort that Councilmarks put into making sure the arts as a space and effort as well.

144
00:13:52,636 --> 00:14:06,983
[SPEAKER_14]: The arts, I think it's not controversial to say, is a benefit to all Medford residents, from youth to adulthood to retirement.

145
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:10,925
[SPEAKER_14]: The arts really, I think, brings out creativity and brings out community.

146
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:18,129
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm someone who benefited from investment in the arts back at Medford High, back in the Medford public schools,

147
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:22,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I miss, I miss the art classes and the music classes.

148
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:35,813
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, as someone who just graduated from school, finding a way to kind of continue to be connected to an arts community is something that I think is at the heart of the front of mind.

149
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,114
[SPEAKER_14]: for a lot of Medford residents.

150
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:46,877
[SPEAKER_14]: When we talk about mental health, which is obviously so important, this is one of the ways that we can work together as a community to address the issue.

151
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:52,879
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm very excited for this, and I thank Councilor Collins for putting this on the agenda.

152
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

153
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

154
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:02,323
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

[SPEAKER_03]: Council Collins.

193
00:16:58,814 --> 00:16:58,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

194
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:00,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Council night.

195
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:00,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

196
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

197
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:03,658
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

198
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:05,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor saying prison room.

199
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:21,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in front of zero negative motion passes motions orders and resolutions to to dash 602 offered by cancer vice president bears just keep reading what's on the paper, be it so resolved in the Metro City Council that the mayor and traffic commission implement a citywide program to put up signage on all public ways

200
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:28,049
[SPEAKER_17]: indicating city policy for snow removal and street sweeping, specifically the odd even snow emergency policy and information on the big sweep.

201
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:35,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Such a program would improve quality of life for residents by reducing tickets and towing and improve the compliance and public safety during snow emergencies.

202
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:36,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Behrs.

203
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:37,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

204
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:43,663
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that ideas like this have been discussed many times in the city.

205
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:51,525
[SPEAKER_13]: As everyone is aware, we have our big sweep twice a year, and there's not really posted signage anywhere in the city indicating when that's going to occur.

206
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,226
[SPEAKER_13]: So for many residents, that means either you're in the know or you're not.

207
00:17:55,746 --> 00:18:05,408
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you're not in the know, that can mean a ticket or a tow, and an inconvenience to say the least, and a significant financial burden on residents of the community.

208
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:18,687
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I have personally spoken to many residents who've been caught up in this, and you know, the answer, well, you sign up for email notifications, and you're not gonna, you know, that's not really the answer that I wanna be able to provide, and I don't think it's the answer that the city should be providing.

209
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:28,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Similarly, during snowstorms, you know, there's always someone who doesn't know about odd even, or what year is which, and we have some streets in the city where you can't get by.

210
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,513
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Bob can't get by if there's a car in the wrong place, so it's a ticket or a tow, and that's only if they catch him before the snow falls.

211
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:45,047
[SPEAKER_13]: So for public safety reasons, for quality of life, for making sure that residents are, you know, not, you don't have to be in the know to avoid a penalty like this.

212
00:18:45,307 --> 00:19:01,440
[SPEAKER_13]: I really think that we should move in the direction of trying to put up signage on all the streets where this applies to the best of our ability so that residents are informed when they, you know, it's a lot easier to say to a resident who gets sick at her toad, the signs right there, you know, you really got to read that sign.

213
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,182
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes the information much more accessible.

214
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:05,423
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of the content itself,

215
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:08,828
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I foresee that it's possible.

216
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:20,310
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I know the big sweep happens on different days and you have odd even in alternating years, but I really think it's possible that we could at least put up a sign that says, these are the months when the big sweep that generally happens.

217
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,851
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, these are the months when we generally have snow.

218
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:27,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Visit the city website for specific details on those days and times.

219
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:30,313
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, it's not the perfect solution.

220
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:35,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the perfect solution would be a better process and more funding to do something more than the big sweep every year.

221
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:48,330
[SPEAKER_13]: I know in neighboring communities, they have, you know, every Tuesday, we do street sweeping, and then it's real easy, because you only have to, you know, you don't have to take that extra step when you look at the sign, all the information you need is right there.

222
00:19:49,430 --> 00:20:04,502
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just think we need to do more on this front, especially for better or worse, now that there's a in-house, you know, parking program at some point that should produce, I would believe, some revenue to potentially support a program like this, and again,

223
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:20,403
[SPEAKER_13]: So many residents so many people you know who have been affected by this have made it a point to reach out and say, can we do something better it's something I hear really often so I would really appreciate my colleagues support and hopefully the support of the mayor and the Traffic Commission as well.

224
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:20,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

225
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:23,284
[SPEAKER_17]: That's great.

226
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:24,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

227
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:29,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand what comes up is coming up this is, this has come up many times before.

228
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:33,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, we only sleep two times a year and we don't even know.

229
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:35,642
[SPEAKER_01]: when the sweep is coming.

230
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:46,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of putting up these signs for sweeping twice a year when they give you the number is quite costly.

231
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather see them spend the money and buy a sweeper.

232
00:20:51,466 --> 00:21:01,009
[SPEAKER_01]: The $200,000 or $300,000 it's going to cost to put up these signs, to sweep twice a year, I'd rather spend that money on a sweeper that'll sweep on a regular basis or about one or two sweepers.

233
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is we're suffering from sign pollution in this city.

234
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,310
[SPEAKER_01]: There's signs everywhere.

235
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,651
[SPEAKER_01]: There's signs for everything.

236
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:14,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you go down the streets, from where I live in West Memphis, there's like 64 signs in a half a mile stretch.

237
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,797
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say, I think we got to stop picking and choosing the signs that we put up.

238
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:21,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're putting up a sign for everything now.

239
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:24,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Some streets have got many signs.

240
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:34,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I understand where you're coming in and the intent is correct, but until we have a program in place where we're sweeping every week, we put up a sign to say we're gonna sweep twice a year.

241
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:36,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just a waste of money.

242
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:38,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather spend that money and buy a sweeper.

243
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpalli.

244
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:43,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

245
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:44,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Council.

246
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:58,957
[SPEAKER_12]: I too understand the concept behind it, because we all get the phone calls from the people that didn't know, and I think a lot has to do with the transparency and the communication from the administration's office.

247
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:00,918
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's where we're lacking.

248
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:08,502
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that I work in a community that the streets get swept every Tuesday, so having those signs up are important.

249
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:20,031
[SPEAKER_12]: even that, being a member of the community there, you still hear people complain because they got towed or because, you know, one thing or the other.

250
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:37,978
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we had an infrastructure in place here that had the times and locations all set, and we know, I mean, imagine even getting the notification today, you know, what process they have today for the twice a year,

251
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:42,498
[SPEAKER_12]: it starts one day, then all of a sudden it's another day.

252
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:46,642
[SPEAKER_12]: So and then changing those on a sign that would be monumental.

253
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:48,684
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that I also agree.

254
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:59,595
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a phone call from one constituent that reminded me over an issue in their neighborhood when they putting up, um, they're putting up crossing, you know, crossing sides.

255
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:00,516
[SPEAKER_12]: They were upset because

256
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:03,518
[SPEAKER_12]: What is Councilor Cabrera assigned pollution?

257
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:09,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it just looks messy when we're trying to clean the streets up.

258
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,980
[SPEAKER_12]: So I personally think, I don't disagree with you.

259
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think there has to be a process from the administration that really spreads the word.

260
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that, what is it?

261
00:23:23,962 --> 00:23:27,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard that there's a new website unveiling soon

262
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:34,416
[SPEAKER_12]: probably 2025, I'm not sure, but as soon as they get an IT department, they're putting together.

263
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:36,983
[SPEAKER_12]: a new site.

264
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:38,704
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's the first step.

265
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:53,690
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, um, you know, something simple as in the old days, they even coming down the street and putting, you know, notices on telephone poles, letting people know that they're coming the next day, having the police come down a little bit earlier, hitting the sirens.

266
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's got to be another way.

267
00:23:55,771 --> 00:24:00,633
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I would recommend is honestly calling for a subcommittee

268
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:21,640
[SPEAKER_12]: that we can actually you know whether it be signs with with myself or traffic that we can meet with all the parties involved and let's let's vet out a process that even right now what we could do immediately before the spring sweep and we so we can look at that process i think i don't disagree with council beers i i hear we get the same phone calls

269
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:25,683
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think there's so many other variables that would impact that.

270
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:33,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're just way too early to look at the cost, the aesthetics of it, and the management of it.

271
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,470
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't know when we're going to do one thing or the other.

272
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:52,514
[SPEAKER_12]: So that that's why I would, I wouldn't support it tonight, but I would support a meeting and bringing this forward to a subcommittee where we could bring all those parties that council is asking for together and say, Hey, this is the extreme in my eyes, but what can we do right now to make it work?

273
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:53,034
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

274
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:53,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

275
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:54,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

276
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:57,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, president Rowland.

277
00:24:57,074 --> 00:24:58,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I really appreciate the discussion around this.

278
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:04,681
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, we all get the emails and the calls when we, you know, usually it's around the big sweep.

279
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:14,848
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I think it's an issue that I'd be really happy if there was a way for the city administration to look at what can we do short term and what can we do long term.

280
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:23,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a call a couple months ago from a constituent who, real recent resident, I think they live in South Medford, just like I do.

281
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:28,218
[SPEAKER_16]: And they said, you know, I just didn't know my car got towed and it was like her whole paycheck.

282
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:30,979
[SPEAKER_16]: know, of course, a lot of people have had that experience.

283
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:32,700
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a one-off.

284
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,563
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I hope that she was able to, you know, bounce back from that.

285
00:25:36,623 --> 00:25:42,747
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, that's the type of thing that I think we have a lot of conversations about and ultimately want to insulate our residents from that kind of penalty.

286
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,068
[SPEAKER_16]: I think people want to do the right thing.

287
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,891
[SPEAKER_16]: I, you know, of course, we're, we sit behind this rail.

288
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:48,572
[SPEAKER_16]: We're counselors.

289
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:49,913
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not policy implementers.

290
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:51,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I don't know how to do the DPW's job.

291
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:52,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Certainly don't know how to do

292
00:25:53,151 --> 00:26:05,943
[SPEAKER_16]: our city staff's job, but I'd really love for this to, whether it's through this resolution, follow-up meeting, you know, either or, I think that this is something that I'd really love to discuss with city administration, just to say, you know, what can we do so that we're bridging that gap?

293
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:18,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think we see the patterns where there are residents, as Councilor Baird says, there are residents who have been on the email list all along, they get the phone calls, and then there are folks who just, they don't know what they don't know.

294
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:26,588
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that ideally would be part of a revamped communication strategy, but I'd love it if we could do as much as we could.

295
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:27,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

296
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:35,921
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of the points on either side of the debate have already been said so I'll keep my statement short.

297
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:37,062
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love.

298
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:40,144
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a, this is an important issue.

299
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:52,432
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think that, you know, we have a responsibility as a city to make sure our residents are well informed about what goes on in our community and how to avoid being ticketed, and I would really

300
00:26:53,645 --> 00:27:14,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I think on issues like this, I think it's important to bring in the stakeholders to the table and see what, as Councilor Collins said, we're not experts on this issue, but I do think that this is a valid idea, and it'd be good to hear about what the city administration has to say about it.

301
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:15,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

302
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:17,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, ma'am.

303
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:18,967
[SPEAKER_01]: This was talked about before.

304
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:30,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was talked about when the person rents a house here, that the real estate people or the landlord should have a packet to give them so they know to sign up for these things.

305
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:35,402
[SPEAKER_01]: For the students that are here from Tufts, Tufts should give them a packet.

306
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:39,205
[SPEAKER_01]: So they sign up for the 911 calls or the email.

307
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about this many years ago.

308
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,759
[SPEAKER_01]: It just never came to pass.

309
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,081
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said, I think that would be a better option.

310
00:27:48,821 --> 00:28:02,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if the city did a mailer to every house with a packet saying, listen, if you want to be notified about these things, sign up, register your phone, your cell phone, or sign up for the notifications.

311
00:28:02,894 --> 00:28:04,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I get calls from some people that

312
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,323
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of a snow storm, they're calling up saying, you know, no one told me it was snowing out.

313
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:13,547
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a story, I said, well, you know, I want to say to people, are you living under a rock sometimes?

314
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:19,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some people just don't want to, you know, don't want to accept responsibility for not parking, you know, when they should be parking.

315
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:21,634
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, you know, maybe the city

316
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:51,476
[SPEAKER_01]: should send out a packet to all the other property owners and tell them give this to your tenants when they move in so they know what the procedure when a person rents from the real estate people should have these the chamber of commerce should have these so i say there is other revenues to get this out there uh then you know the you know to move forward for those who don't you know say you just you know moved in here recently president bears thank you madam president um and thank you councilor carbiello i think um

317
00:28:52,661 --> 00:29:00,904
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, that's a good point about something maybe we could add to the housing stability notification ordinance that we were close on.

318
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:09,886
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we could add that in as something that they should include, you know, not just here's your rights around housing stability, but here's some key city resources around parking, snow removal, et cetera.

319
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:12,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that would be a really easy addition to make to that.

320
00:29:14,008 --> 00:29:16,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd just like to propose an amendment to this resolution.

321
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:20,750
[SPEAKER_13]: I think maybe it sounds like we're all on basically the same page that we just want this to be better than it is now.

322
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,420
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not married to, you know, we must have my $300,000 street sign program.

323
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:37,964
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would propose an amendment first to strike the word implement in the first sentence and replace it with the word explore.

324
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:42,565
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I have a further amendment that I can read out when the clerk's ready.

325
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:45,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

326
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:51,348
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be be it further resolved that the mayor

327
00:29:52,245 --> 00:30:09,776
[SPEAKER_13]: and traffic commission report back on barriers to adding signage as well as current actions.

328
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:13,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

329
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,241
[SPEAKER_13]: To improve communications.

330
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:29,860
[SPEAKER_13]: regarding street sweeping and snow emergencies for discussion with the council.

331
00:30:31,822 --> 00:30:33,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we'll get whatever they send back to us.

332
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:36,987
[SPEAKER_13]: We get a cyber to send it once we get the communication.

333
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:43,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion by the council?

334
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:44,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Sang.

335
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:56,239
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm cancer caravilas suggestion is good one and I would, it would be great to see that in the housing stability notification ordinance.

336
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:04,188
[SPEAKER_14]: I think another aspect that I would like to add to it is adding it onto the city website making sure that it's an easy place to find.

337
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:16,551
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been a big proponent of having a welcome to Medford part of the website, a resource where all the most important documents are all in one place, especially for younger residents who are moving in.

338
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:22,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Oftentimes, internet is the first place that we go to to find information.

339
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:28,594
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when it's easy to find on the internet, I think that would be a benefit to our community.

340
00:31:28,614 --> 00:31:30,214
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may just quickly, that is embarrassing.

341
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:30,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

342
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:30,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

343
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:31,895
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I think to that point,

344
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:38,284
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I was reading, I think, a welcoming committee agenda, something that came through our packet recently.

345
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:40,485
[SPEAKER_13]: And it seemed like they may be sending something to people.

346
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:43,746
[SPEAKER_06]: They're meeting tomorrow.

347
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:47,468
[SPEAKER_06]: That's their first meeting.

348
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:49,169
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

349
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:50,910
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

350
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

351
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,411
[SPEAKER_13]: So I had seen that on the agenda.

352
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:56,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it seemed like they were going to be sending something out.

353
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,394
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe that's something we could try to have a rolling discussion as well.

354
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:13,758
[SPEAKER_06]: of 2,000 people.

355
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:19,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

356
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:23,588
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought I had something else to say, but now I've completely lost.

357
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:24,669
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

358
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Councillor is saying that's an amendment?

359
00:32:27,432 --> 00:32:28,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Or just, I don't know.

360
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:29,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

361
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:42,380
[SPEAKER_12]: neighborhood communities that street sweep every day, their traffic and parking department, their fees and fines go directly to the streets, parks and school department.

362
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,440
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what that money is used for.

363
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:57,062
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you see the action, the reaction of their constituents are pretty pleased when they realize, okay, I messed up, I got a parking ticket, but if it's going to go back to the schools and the parks, it's worth it.

364
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to new growth, but so thank you.

365
00:33:01,163 --> 00:33:02,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

366
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:05,016
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank Bison and Bears for putting this forward.

367
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:06,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I like this resolution so much.

368
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,158
[SPEAKER_17]: I introduced it about eight months ago, something very similar.

369
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:12,840
[SPEAKER_17]: So the point I knew, I knew what Councilor Carvillo was going to say, I knew what Councilor Scarpelli was going to say.

370
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,783
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll put in a plug once again for I know how Somerville does like yard signs that just say it's the odd year, it's the even year, whatever.

371
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:30,889
[SPEAKER_17]: So even if it's temporary signs that say this information is on the website, I know our approach to it is possibly too convoluted to put on a sign, but maybe it's something that could be put, you know, directing people where they can see it.

372
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:46,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

373
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

374
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:55,952
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of vice president bears as amended by vice president bears second by Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

375
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

376
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:10,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

377
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

378
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:17,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

379
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:18,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

380
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:18,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

381
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:19,342
[SPEAKER_17]: 7-4-0-0-9, motion passes.

382
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:22,822
[SPEAKER_17]: 2-3-0-0-6, offered by Councilor Carviello.

383
00:34:22,862 --> 00:34:32,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved, the Medford City Council have the DPW director report to the council on the reason for paving Freedom Way, first, during the school year, and second, for why we are paving and whether that is not preferred for paving.

384
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:37,305
[SPEAKER_17]: What type of warranty will their contractor be responsible for when it starts coming up in the future?

385
00:34:37,485 --> 00:34:38,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this the finished result?

386
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:39,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Carviello?

387
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:41,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

388
00:34:41,155 --> 00:34:48,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get a response from the city engineer, but, you know, I had the opportunity to drive by there last week.

389
00:34:49,477 --> 00:34:50,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it was a patch job.

390
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:52,338
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really all this.

391
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:53,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

392
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:58,299
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had the big fanfare, you know, making this, putting this out there so we can pave it.

393
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:00,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was led to believe that we were going to pave the whole street.

394
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:07,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I drove by there, I mean, we couldn't have come out a few more feet to Riverside Ave for all the bumpy parts, the patches, not patches.

395
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:09,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't happy with what I saw.

396
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:18,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked to some of the workers there, and the workers were saying that, you know, this isn't the time to be doing paving work in the cold weather.

397
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:23,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I want to know when this starts coming up, who's going to pay for it again.

398
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the engineers said this is not a finished result.

399
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when are we going to have a finished result?

400
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:39,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that was the original plan to make it, when they made it a public street, was to pave the whole thing, not just do patchwork.

401
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:40,730
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like we do on all our other streets.

402
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I have that email?

403
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:44,272
[SPEAKER_17]: I can read it.

404
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:46,374
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is from City Engineer Wartella.

405
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you know, Freedom Way recently became a public way to bring the road up to city standards.

406
00:35:50,477 --> 00:35:52,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Freedom Way would need to be completely reconstructed.

407
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:57,096
[SPEAKER_17]: The current conditions of the road would likely pose a safety risk if not repaired before this winter.

408
00:35:57,256 --> 00:36:06,604
[SPEAKER_17]: The city was ready to move forward with this work in late summer, but was delayed since the roadway needed to be accepted by both the city and the state prior to using any Chapter 90 funds for the repairs.

409
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:11,267
[SPEAKER_17]: The state delayed this process into mid-October, which left the window to go to bid very narrow.

410
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:16,291
[SPEAKER_17]: The coordination efforts between multiple city departments were key in achieving this process in such a narrow timeframe.

411
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:21,976
[SPEAKER_17]: The start of the milling and paving operations was delayed many weeks to find a weather window where temperatures were accommodating.

412
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:26,766
[SPEAKER_17]: The engineering division was on site during the entire operations monitoring the milling and patching process.

413
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:32,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Our staff was there to ensure the paving was placed at optimum temperatures and rolled out in accordance with paving specifications.

414
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:36,053
[SPEAKER_17]: The work was done during the daytime to meet the necessary temperature requirements.

415
00:36:36,814 --> 00:36:38,455
[SPEAKER_17]: The pavement patching is only temporary.

416
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:42,318
[SPEAKER_17]: In the next two to three years, we intend to redesign and reconstruct the entire roadway.

417
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:48,102
[SPEAKER_17]: The city has also coordinated numerous communications prior to the start of this work, informing the public of the start and duration of the project.

418
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:59,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Although there was a bit of disruption during the first day of operation, the work always started after morning drop off and ramp down during the afternoon dismissal to accommodate the school schedule.

419
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:06,266
[SPEAKER_17]: The engineering office is working with the city DPW crews to reestablish a yellow center line along the entire roadway, but this work is weather dependent.

420
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:08,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get that.

421
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:13,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to say, I'm just disappointed, Madam President, that again, it's another

422
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:19,286
[SPEAKER_01]: job that's incomplete, and they're saying two to three more years before we finish it.

423
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:21,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just disappointed.

424
00:37:21,868 --> 00:37:25,950
[SPEAKER_01]: All the fanfare of getting it to be made a public way, and that's what we do.

425
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:26,630
[SPEAKER_01]: We just patched it.

426
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:28,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

427
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:34,796
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could, for the record, could we ask the engineer for just a cost breakdown of what that was?

428
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:38,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it'd be interesting to see what that cost.

429
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:41,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want that in the form of a motion?

430
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:46,316
[SPEAKER_17]: amendment.

431
00:37:46,657 --> 00:37:48,098
[SPEAKER_17]: President bears your hand up.

432
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:49,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

433
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:59,526
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of cancer Carvello, as amended amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

434
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:00,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr Clerk, please call the roll.

435
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:08,072
[SPEAKER_17]: One moment.

436
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:11,194
[SPEAKER_17]: I do see Mr Castagnetti has his hand up.

437
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:15,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

438
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:18,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

439
00:38:19,195 --> 00:38:22,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Castagnetti, East Method, Massachusetts.

440
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I getting through?

441
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:25,257
[SPEAKER_17]: You are.

442
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

443
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:32,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come to praise Caesar and not to bury him, as they say.

444
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,560
[SPEAKER_00]: I must praise and commend whoever got Freedom Way repaved.

445
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many kudos.

446
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

447
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,707
[SPEAKER_00]: In the name of safety and humanity.

448
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:46,068
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good night.

449
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:49,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do hope it last a chance Donnie.

450
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:50,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and good night.

451
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:56,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call it.

452
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:57,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President bears.

453
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Council carry all this.

454
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Council calls.

455
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:01,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

456
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:02,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor night.

457
00:39:03,483 --> 00:39:03,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

458
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, 7-0-0 negative motion passes.

459
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,144
[SPEAKER_17]: 3-0-0-7 offered by Councilor Collins.

460
00:39:14,204 --> 00:39:28,175
[SPEAKER_17]: It would involve the Medford City Council to request an update from our federal delegation on the status of the FAA review of block two of the one-way TARNAP study, which includes recommendations for dispersing noise from airplanes departing and arriving from Boston Logan Airport.

461
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:36,942
[SPEAKER_17]: As of September, 2022, the FAA was supposed to have begun a review of these recommendations so as to consider navigation changes that would lessen noise pollution for Medford residents.

462
00:39:36,982 --> 00:39:37,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

463
00:39:37,907 --> 00:39:38,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morrell.

464
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:45,272
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is bringing up a topic that has been brought up innumerable times by, I don't know how many counselors in the past, probably all of them.

465
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,333
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really not sure.

466
00:39:46,353 --> 00:40:00,663
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, as we're all aware, we still are receiving, we're hearing from residents who are experiencing a level of noise pollution from airport traffic that is disruptive to their daily lives.

467
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:07,428
[SPEAKER_16]: The background on why these air transit navigation changes

468
00:40:08,915 --> 00:40:14,478
[SPEAKER_16]: happened and when they happened and why that's now causing additional trouble for certain neighborhoods in Medford.

469
00:40:14,518 --> 00:40:19,861
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all on the city website because it's something that branches of our government have been active in.

470
00:40:28,313 --> 00:40:38,816
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just a following up on some of those recent efforts to follow up on promises that have been made by our federal delegation and the federal agencies that they're trying to work with.

471
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:47,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, we are many, many steps removed from the people with the power to affect the navigation changes from Boston Logan.

472
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,218
[SPEAKER_16]: That could get some relief for our residents.

473
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:54,238
[SPEAKER_16]: but we have to stay on this.

474
00:40:54,418 --> 00:41:07,381
[SPEAKER_16]: One short term step that we can take is just to follow up with that federal delegation and say, where are we at with the FAA reviewing these recommendations that include potential solutions for dispersing this noise pollution and go from there.

475
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:15,824
[SPEAKER_16]: And if constituents who aren't already very active in lodging noise complaints would like to do so, there's a lot of information on how to do so on the city website.

476
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:19,485
[SPEAKER_16]: If you go to airplane noise, there's a couple, there's a few options for where to

477
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:27,104
[SPEAKER_16]: register specific complaints that these all get compiled and eventually make them what make their way to the decision makers.

478
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:27,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

479
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:28,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

480
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:29,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Councillor say.

481
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:34,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morrell, and thank you, Councillor Collins, for introducing this resolution.

482
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:46,550
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, as you said, almost every, if not every councillor that sat in this chamber in recent years has done something to complain to, in effect, done something to try to resolve this issue.

483
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:52,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, as you also acknowledged, the people with power are far removed from us.

484
00:41:54,033 --> 00:42:04,582
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, you know, this goes without saying to everyone who lives in Medford, but I think it's a particularly important point to make is, you know, why is Medford suffering the brunt of this?

485
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:06,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't we see this in other communities?

486
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,921
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not for a lack of complaining, and it's not for want of trying.

487
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:17,102
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think when we talk to the federal delegation, we need to make that clear that this is an equity issue as well.

488
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:22,323
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an issue of respect to our community.

489
00:42:23,523 --> 00:42:34,825
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to work hard and work as a united front to tackle this issue and to make sure that there is that accountability for the people that are making these decisions who have the power.

490
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:54,372
[SPEAKER_14]: We did receive that email from the city administration that they're meeting with Congresswoman Clark's office on January 26th, and that senators, the two senators from Massachusetts, Senator Warren, Senator Markey are co-sponsoring a piece of legislation in Congress.

491
00:42:57,053 --> 00:43:11,254
[SPEAKER_14]: My personal take is that it would have been good for the city administration to inform us before so that we could pass a resolution or express our support for the conversations that they're having with the Congresswoman's office.

492
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:27,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm personally a believer that when all branches of our city government work together, that's more influential and more impactful than if one branch of the city government was to walk into a meeting alone.

493
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:50,468
[SPEAKER_14]: and it would have been good to solicit our feedback and to solicit a statement from either from our city council as a whole or from councillors individually for this meeting, as we did with the MBTA bus network redesign, which did win back several bus lines service to Medford.

494
00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:52,930
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my take on this issue.

495
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,432
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think going forward,

496
00:43:56,374 --> 00:44:04,023
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this council wants to be partners with the city administration when it comes to working to get better results for Metro residents.

497
00:44:04,864 --> 00:44:11,132
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wish that in the future, when it comes to cases like this, we can unite forces.

498
00:44:11,738 --> 00:44:12,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

499
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:13,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Any furthers?

500
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Behrs.

501
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:15,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

502
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you to everyone who spoke.

503
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to echo what everybody else said.

504
00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:28,505
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is an issue, and it's like many issues in the city, where if everyone's on the same page and we can work together as a team, we have a better chance of getting things done.

505
00:44:28,805 --> 00:44:32,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's generally true about most things in life.

506
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:38,330
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have been hearing a lot more from residents lately around the noise.

507
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:41,491
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, it is, if you look at the

508
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:53,099
[SPEAKER_13]: the heat map of flights, it is every flight, if the wind patterns are right, every minute or two minutes, right over a great vast majority of the city.

509
00:44:53,199 --> 00:45:03,822
[SPEAKER_13]: So at the very least, while we may not be able to stop it unilaterally, or even as has been said, we are so far away from the decision making on this where it's at the federal level.

510
00:45:03,842 --> 00:45:10,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we all share an understanding of how impactful this is on so many residents in their daily lives.

511
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:12,608
[SPEAKER_13]: just wanted to share that.

512
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:13,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

513
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:29,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council on the motion of Councilor Collins is seconded by Councilor Scarpelli Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

514
00:45:31,097 --> 00:45:31,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Carribello.

515
00:45:31,818 --> 00:45:32,018

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor saying yes.

523
00:45:39,722 --> 00:45:39,982
[SPEAKER_03]: President

524
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:42,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in favor, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

525
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:46,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Going to public participation.

526
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,177
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a Vice President Behrs.

527
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:53,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, could we take papers under suspension 23-008, 23-009, 23-010, and 22-612?

528
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,021
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, and these are all under suspension?

529
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:58,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Three under suspension, one from the table.

530
00:45:58,403 --> 00:45:58,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

531
00:45:58,603 --> 00:45:58,963
[SPEAKER_13]: And then 612, 2612.

532
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:25,852
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion to take under suspension to take papers in the hands of the clerk, as well as one from the table, and these are 23-009, 23-008, 23-010, and 22-612, that covers them all?

533
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:29,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

534
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:30,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

549
00:46:47,582 --> 00:46:49,263
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm the informant here in the negative.

550
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:51,365
[SPEAKER_17]: The rules are suspended to take these papers.

551
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:54,228
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just gonna take them in the order in our packet and then go to the table.

552
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:56,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

553
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,572
[SPEAKER_17]: 23-009 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

554
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:05,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved the Medford City Council call for a meeting with the mayor, superintendent and school committee to discuss the safety plan implemented at Medford High School.

555
00:47:05,938 --> 00:47:06,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

556
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:08,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

557
00:47:08,229 --> 00:47:18,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, maybe the wording is a little off, but the intent for this resolution isn't really to discuss what has been unveiled to date.

558
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:23,275
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's really too early to see the benefits.

559
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:27,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we hear a lot of great things from the students I've talked to that

560
00:47:29,904 --> 00:47:33,965
[SPEAKER_12]: immediately they felt safer, immediately they appreciated the structure.

561
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:43,348
[SPEAKER_12]: They still, the administration had assemblies with all the kids so they can explain what the process is and what's happening.

562
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:44,848
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was very helpful.

563
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:57,292
[SPEAKER_12]: So we saw a lot of very good movement, but I think that this resolution is really for this council as we move toward the budget season, where the biggest department

564
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:02,002
[SPEAKER_12]: in this community that takes up most of this budget.

565
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:17,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Our city budget is a school department and also understanding the shortfalls that are being mentioned in public arenas from our city administration, how bad the budget is going to look this coming year.

566
00:48:17,953 --> 00:48:25,278
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important that we meet with the mayor, the superintendent and the school committee as they start to put

567
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:41,224
[SPEAKER_12]: their budget together and the understanding where the questions that came about during these concerns and these issues, safety issues, that we're making sure that we're in full support funding-wise when it comes to security processes.

568
00:48:44,451 --> 00:48:53,733
[SPEAKER_12]: the implementation or any maintenance that needs to be done on cameras, the understanding of any processes going through.

569
00:48:54,754 --> 00:49:10,918
[SPEAKER_12]: If the SRO is that they hired, I hear great feedback from the kids that they feel safer because of that and understanding that process and making sure that's funded in the police budget or

570
00:49:11,538 --> 00:49:13,099
[SPEAKER_12]: the school budget or the city budget.

571
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:28,311
[SPEAKER_12]: So a lot of this for this resolution really was meant for setting up that meeting because I believe um someone on the school committee mentioned that this council has never asked for that and and they've never seen us there.

572
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:36,377
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that I'm reaching the olive branch to say let's find find a time to all meet

573
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:49,701
[SPEAKER_12]: and so that we're all on the same page when it comes to this budget for this serious concern and serious issues that we witnessed this past couple of months that we need to make sure that we are on top of that.

574
00:49:49,741 --> 00:50:04,828
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we can, I just hope my fellow councilors, I would make the motion, like I said, that we really, that council president reach out to the mayor's administration and call the superintendency, what we can do to get a meeting

575
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:11,252
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, relatively soon, I mean, we did get some, we will be getting some paperwork, I believe, financial paperwork.

576
00:50:12,412 --> 00:50:12,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it all of it?

577
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:15,213
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was just one, one month, I believe.

578
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:22,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So we still don't know or understand the pattern of our fiscal climate right now.

579
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:34,100
[SPEAKER_12]: That's still unknown to us, but at least we can sit down and understand the process that I know that when I was on the school committee, the process was very clear and it was very open.

580
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:39,302
[SPEAKER_12]: We understood what we were looking for as a school committee.

581
00:50:39,762 --> 00:50:51,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I talked to a few councils earlier, it was very simple that we looked right away as what we were making sure we're maintaining any legal obligations to any programs that were running in the schools.

582
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:56,231
[SPEAKER_12]: and making sure that we had coverage with that, with those programs.

583
00:50:56,251 --> 00:51:01,872
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we listened to every principal to make sure that all the needs were met in each school.

584
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:20,735
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure they do that now, but I think it'll be important for us to understand that process and for us to express support for the budget that they're looking for, the school department's looking for as a partner to make sure that we're all on the same page.

585
00:51:22,607 --> 00:51:29,391
[SPEAKER_12]: This was a very difficult situation that divided our bodies, not everybody, but some people in each body.

586
00:51:31,051 --> 00:51:39,916
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only imagine what's going to happen when the budget comes out and they tell the school department that they have to cut another $2.3 million per se.

587
00:51:40,316 --> 00:51:41,517
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a fictitious number.

588
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:42,658
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a real number.

589
00:51:43,038 --> 00:51:46,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm saying, fictitiously, if that happened, where would we be?

590
00:51:47,592 --> 00:51:51,135
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't want, I wanna make sure that we're on the same page and proactive.

591
00:51:51,615 --> 00:52:03,224
[SPEAKER_12]: It's first of January right now, before we really unveil this and we still get into the nitty gritty of the budget, we really need to hold a meeting with those stakeholders to make sure that we're all on the same page.

592
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:04,505
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you, Madam President.

593
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:05,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

594
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:07,407
[SPEAKER_17]: President Beres.

595
00:52:07,747 --> 00:52:08,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

596
00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:14,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And just, I appreciate what you just said, Councilor Scarpelli.

597
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:44,004
[SPEAKER_13]: to try to capture that in the scope of the resolution, would something, amend the motion to read, be resolved by the Medford City Council that we request a joint meeting with the school committee to discuss the items requested by the council at our December 20th council meeting and funding for Medford public schools, including the FY 24 budget, that council president and chair of the school committee shall coordinate the scheduling of this meeting.

598
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:45,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that'd be that.

599
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:52,839
[SPEAKER_12]: But the intent and that encompasses everything we need to talk about will bring up the safety concerns as part of their budget.

600
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:59,341
[SPEAKER_12]: As long as you know, if you could put if we could put something in there, not only with December, was it December 20th?

601
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:00,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we talked about it.

602
00:53:00,441 --> 00:53:00,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

603
00:53:00,661 --> 00:53:02,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I take that back.

604
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:02,881
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot that date.

605
00:53:02,921 --> 00:53:05,242
[SPEAKER_12]: So no, that would be that would work.

606
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:05,942
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be great.

607
00:53:06,162 --> 00:53:07,062
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be that would work.

608
00:53:07,322 --> 00:53:07,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

609
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:10,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And I you want me to read that I could get you the language email.

610
00:53:10,843 --> 00:53:11,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

611
00:53:11,463 --> 00:53:11,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

612
00:53:11,963 --> 00:53:12,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Too long.

613
00:53:13,408 --> 00:53:13,848
[SPEAKER_13]: too fast.

614
00:53:13,888 --> 00:53:14,469
[SPEAKER_12]: We can get mine.

615
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:16,830
[SPEAKER_12]: I gave you mine in three seconds.

616
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:18,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Collins.

617
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:27,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morrell, and I just want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this forward and for your words in describing the intent behind this resolution.

618
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:36,220
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that, you know, what I feel that the community is looking for is for this whole Medford City government to work together

619
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:41,385
[SPEAKER_16]: to improve the lives of specifically students and those who work in the schools.

620
00:53:41,445 --> 00:53:44,748
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, isn't that the goal of government in general?

621
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:54,135
[SPEAKER_16]: And I see this as a really, just a great way to start off the year saying, you know, we're partners in this, we're equal partners, let's strike the right tone, let's have a collaborative meeting.

622
00:53:54,615 --> 00:53:55,856
[SPEAKER_16]: We all want the same things.

623
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:56,877
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you need?

624
00:53:58,278 --> 00:53:59,359
[SPEAKER_16]: And what can we do to support you.

625
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:02,180
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know from some informal conversations with members of the school committee.

626
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:16,287
[SPEAKER_16]: This process of saying, here's what we need to create the school environment that our students really deserve and then hearing back a number that's different process that's baked into the school committee here, you know, better than I do.

627
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:18,148
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we can

628
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:26,773
[SPEAKER_16]: help shore up, making sure that we get as close as possible to having NPS have what they need to provide the environment that students deserve.

629
00:54:29,495 --> 00:54:33,038
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a great tone to start out the year with, and I really appreciate it.

630
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:34,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

631
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:35,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Kerrio.

632
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

633
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor, the Councilors for bringing this up.

634
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:46,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that this is something that should have happened many years ago, not just now that we have an issue

635
00:54:47,872 --> 00:54:55,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always had the belief, and I brought this up when I first got elected, that city council schools should have met

636
00:54:56,882 --> 00:54:59,924
[SPEAKER_01]: once a year anyways, just discuss common needs and goals.

637
00:55:00,244 --> 00:55:04,086
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get on the same page, not just meet when we're in a time of crisis.

638
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:06,907
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I thank Councilor Caput for bringing this forward.

639
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:13,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope this is something that after we meet, there's something that will be continued on in the future.

640
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:18,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not into this situation of fighting with each other.

641
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:21,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be collaboration amongst all the government bodies.

642
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:21,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

643
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:22,676
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

644
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,073
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I just wanted to echo what Councillor Collins said.

645
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:35,899
[SPEAKER_14]: From my conversations with people in the city, I think people most want us all to work together to develop a solution.

646
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:39,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we work together, that's when we find a more sustainable solution.

647
00:55:40,342 --> 00:55:49,549
[SPEAKER_14]: And that includes more voices, more stakeholders, and keeps in mind the fact that we're all elected

648
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:55,022
[SPEAKER_14]: or we're all hired to do a job and that we are really on the same team.

649
00:55:55,362 --> 00:56:01,726
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think, I hope that this is the start of a fruitful collaboration with the school committee going forward.

650
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:13,871
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, I hope this is the start of a respectful and collaborative relationship between all of our bodies.

651
00:56:14,652 --> 00:56:14,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

652
00:56:16,012 --> 00:56:17,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

653
00:56:19,232 --> 00:56:25,177
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Vice President Ferris, seconded by Councilor Carviel, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

654
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:41,750

656
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:44,232

657
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:44,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Collins?

659
00:56:45,933 --> 00:56:46,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

660
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:47,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight?

661
00:56:47,815 --> 00:56:48,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

662
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:50,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

663
00:56:50,446 --> 00:56:50,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

664
00:56:50,946 --> 00:56:51,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Sang?

665
00:56:51,987 --> 00:56:52,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

666
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:54,610
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morrell?

667
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:54,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

668
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,372
[SPEAKER_17]: 7-8-4-0-0-9, the motion passes.

669
00:56:57,392 --> 00:56:58,794
[SPEAKER_17]: 2-3-0-0-8, offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

670
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:05,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council send the family of Gerald Bradonese our deepest condolences on his passing.

671
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:08,923
[SPEAKER_17]: Gerald was a former Medford firefighter and longtime Medford resident.

672
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

673
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

674
00:57:11,322 --> 00:57:25,132
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, Mr. Bradnese passed, I believe, before Christmas, and we haven't had an opportunity to bring this resolution forward, so that's why it's a little late, and I apologize to the Bradnese family.

675
00:57:26,994 --> 00:57:35,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Bradnese was one of those families that led one of those families in Medford that were stalwarts of our community.

676
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:38,549
[SPEAKER_12]: a U. S. Navy veteran.

677
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:48,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, a longtime method resident, a method firefighter for over 30 years, and, um, he passed away peacefully before Christmas.

678
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:51,452
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, I just wanted to reach out.

679
00:57:52,352 --> 00:57:56,133
[SPEAKER_12]: His son, Mark and I graduated together at Medford High School.

680
00:57:56,913 --> 00:58:04,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, he had a wonderful family, wonderful wife, and, uh, he'll be missed in our community and especially the tap street area.

681
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:05,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

682
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:10,259
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you should get special dispensation for living on that hill anyway.

683
00:58:10,959 --> 00:58:29,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, so I know that, um, uh, he's definitely a loss and I would, uh, ask the, um, the clerk to send out, um, um, uh, memo to the family, just letting them know that if we could honor them by, uh, holding this meeting in his name.

684
00:58:30,129 --> 00:58:33,710
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, and hold the moment of silence from Mr. Brand.

685
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,511
[SPEAKER_12]: He's appreciate it.

686
00:58:34,531 --> 00:58:34,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

687
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other members of the council wish to speak?

688
00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:40,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

689
00:58:53,648 --> 00:58:56,972
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli is seconded by Councilor Carviello.

709
00:59:35,726 --> 00:59:47,168
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a few other champions that I'd like to call on for our next meeting, Mr. Clerk, Madam President, so we can give them a citation and congratulate them on a job well done.

[SPEAKER_17]: 22-612, proposed ARPA project in excess of $250,000.

733
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:08,854
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna pull this up on our previous agenda.

734
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:14,596
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have Peter Cushing here, as well as Shane Pelliquin to speak on this.

735
01:01:14,616 --> 01:01:16,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me find the original paper.

736
01:01:16,417 --> 01:01:24,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so December 14, 2022, to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, regarding the proposed ARPA project in excess of $250,000.

737
01:01:26,614 --> 01:01:40,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear President Morrell and members of the city council, I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body allow time for a presentation by Dr. Peter Cushing and committee member Shanine Pelliquin of the following ARPA project, School McGlynn Playground Project, $750,000.

738
01:01:40,938 --> 01:01:42,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

739
01:01:43,259 --> 01:01:44,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Sincerely, Brown and Longo Kern, Mayor.

740
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:53,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless any councilors have questions or anything they'd like to speak on first, I can hand it over to Dr. Cushing and Ms.

741
01:01:53,682 --> 01:01:54,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Pelliquin.

742
01:01:56,725 --> 01:01:57,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you need to share the screen?

743
01:01:58,586 --> 01:02:01,768
[SPEAKER_17]: That'd be great.

744
01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:07,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Madam President and members of the City Council.

745
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:16,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Really want to thank you for this opportunity to present an absolutely amazing project for the students of the McGlynn Middle School and all children for the City of Medford.

746
01:02:17,556 --> 01:02:22,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here with our co-chair, my co-chair of the McGlynn Playground Redesign Committee.

747
01:02:22,934 --> 01:02:32,331
[SPEAKER_15]: a committee comprised of educators, parents, and really, overall, a great committee that has come together over the last year.

748
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:45,430
[SPEAKER_15]: This project started just about three months before the pandemic hit, when we were awarded a CPC design grant to really take a look at the McGlynn playground.

749
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:55,413
[SPEAKER_15]: We were looking at the port and place surfacing at three of the playgrounds in the city, at the Missittuck, the McGlynn, and the Brooks elementary schools.

750
01:02:55,533 --> 01:02:57,634
[SPEAKER_15]: The Roberts had been done in the previous year.

751
01:02:58,518 --> 01:03:05,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, with the help of the community member and really appreciate that community members help miss Rodriguez helped keep that initial effort.

752
01:03:06,242 --> 01:03:17,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I really do also want to say that when we were looking at the McGlynn, um, it is the largest of the playgrounds at all of our schools and about 26,000 square feet.

753
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:23,490
[SPEAKER_15]: And the port in place that was put in, put in place at its inception about 20 years ago,

754
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:26,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, was definitely overdone.

755
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:41,799
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we really tried to look at, um, we really tried to look at this from a holistic approach and we embarked on a design study, uh, and are grateful to the community preservation of Medford for initially funding that.

756
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:53,745
[SPEAKER_15]: And for madam mayor for utilizing ARPA funds, um, to close the gap so that we could do a comprehensive design study of a universally accessible, inclusive playground

757
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,101
[SPEAKER_15]: that will really benefit all students.

758
01:03:56,442 --> 01:04:10,031
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we talk about all students, we're talking about our typical and our non-typical students who may be having a disability or some other ambulatory or other issue.

759
01:04:10,412 --> 01:04:15,315
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we're trying to really make sure that this playground is the absolute best.

760
01:04:15,415 --> 01:04:19,058
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we'll start our presentation, but I wanted to give you a little bit of background.

761
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:21,540
[SPEAKER_15]: One second.

762
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:32,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have questions about why this particular, like this big overhaul was needed that would make clear through other sources?

763
01:04:33,015 --> 01:04:38,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so poured in place rubber, a protective surface, so I'm a playground safety inspector.

764
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:43,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with all of you in various things, but most recently I've become a certified playground safety inspector.

765
01:04:43,782 --> 01:04:53,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So protective surfacing is supposed to be within a six, like it's a six foot boundary around any piece of elevated equipment.

766
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:57,317
[SPEAKER_02]: for fall protection.

767
01:04:58,218 --> 01:05:01,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to prevent against critical head injury and death.

768
01:05:01,499 --> 01:05:03,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not supposed to prevent against broken arms.

769
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:09,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what it was designed for, but it is like $30 a square foot.

770
01:05:09,463 --> 01:05:20,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when the playground inspector, we had a playground inspector come last February, an independent third party person to confirm what we were pretty sure about, that this wasn't salvageable and what would it cost to try to salvage this?

771
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:21,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, there's too much rust.

772
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,042
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface is just too damaged, and there's very low play value.

773
01:05:27,062 --> 01:05:35,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So despite how big it is, there's really not a lot for the kids to do, and particularly since the school has 160 kids out there at a time.

774
01:05:35,128 --> 01:05:43,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the program, the special education subseparate program for kids who have more severe to moderate disabilities, including ambulatory disabilities.

775
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the autism program is at the Roberts, and that would be a different kind of inclusive playground with lots of sensory stuff, right?

776
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:51,082
[SPEAKER_02]: but this needed to be physically inclusive.

777
01:05:51,703 --> 01:05:57,306
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way that ramped playgrounds are designed, you get a lot of ramp and a lot of very little play value.

778
01:05:58,007 --> 01:05:59,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a couple of slides.

779
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:07,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the things are, the kids reported that they outgrow most of the equipment by the time they're in fourth and fifth grade.

780
01:06:07,613 --> 01:06:14,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So they spend the last two years playing football or soccer, but not because that's what they want to do, it's because that's the only thing that space offers.

781
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:20,235
[SPEAKER_02]: When the inspector came out, you can see in this picture, the dark green above the top edge, that's all flooding.

782
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:28,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So for much of the year, this playground was unusable, like a third of the surface was unusable because of the flooding that comes in.

783
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:37,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Many thanks to Tim McGibbon and the DPW who put in a French drain, a temporary drainage solution, so this year they have been able to use the playground.

784
01:06:38,404 --> 01:06:47,329
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of the freeze-thaw cycles and the lack of drainage underneath the resurfacing, it's really was incredibly cracked and peeling.

785
01:06:48,149 --> 01:06:53,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And those surfaces are really only designed to last about 10 to 15 years anyway, so it was already past its usable life.

786
01:06:54,269 --> 01:07:09,421
[SPEAKER_02]: The inspector, when she came out, said that this place was clearly designed by someone who sells surfacing, because the amount of really expensive rubber surfacing throughout, you can see there's the two structures, the entire center part, there's no reason for that to be protective surfacing.

787
01:07:09,481 --> 01:07:15,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't plow it, so it's really not as usable a playground as it would seem.

788
01:07:17,888 --> 01:07:22,492
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when we were looking at this, we wanted to make sure that we had a safe playground,

789
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:32,112
[SPEAKER_15]: The playground inspector also said on the call, you know, this is a playground that looks fun from afar, but when you get up to it, as Shanine said, there's really no play value.

790
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:38,255
[SPEAKER_15]: As the students get taller and they go down the slides and the slides twist, it actually prevents them from going fast.

791
01:07:38,835 --> 01:07:40,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Kids want to go fast down slides.

792
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:41,316
[SPEAKER_15]: They've told us this.

793
01:07:41,496 --> 01:07:42,817
[SPEAKER_15]: They want to go as fast as possible.

794
01:07:43,717 --> 01:07:44,958
[SPEAKER_15]: And that just adds to the fun.

795
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:48,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, for our teachers, they have been very clear.

796
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:56,440
[SPEAKER_15]: that these concrete structures right here, they are a barrier to supervision.

797
01:07:57,441 --> 01:08:03,609
[SPEAKER_15]: So one of the things that we're going to do is this will be a complete demolition of this entire playground.

798
01:08:04,392 --> 01:08:06,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, there really is nothing salvageable.

799
01:08:07,094 --> 01:08:21,204
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things that we will make sure to salvage, because the students are very clear and articulate, this tree in the center right here will definitely be salvaged, as well as as many trees that are still alive.

800
01:08:21,244 --> 01:08:24,066
[SPEAKER_15]: There are some that are not currently alive at the site.

801
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:29,629
[SPEAKER_15]: But we will salvage all the living trees, and especially that one in the center of the playground.

802
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,352
[SPEAKER_15]: The other, we also conducted head drop testing.

803
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:40,682
[SPEAKER_15]: So the port-in-place surface, while at the end of its life, still does provide safety value.

804
01:08:41,523 --> 01:08:45,926
[SPEAKER_15]: But once again, the entire playground is at the end of its useful life.

805
01:08:46,026 --> 01:08:52,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't need remediation for this school year to be safe, but it's not something that we can repair.

806
01:08:53,290 --> 01:09:01,255
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of the cost of the ramps, the cost of replacing the ramps, plus the cost of replacing the port-in-place, the port-in-place itself would have been $350,000.

807
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:04,804
[SPEAKER_02]: just to replace it, not considering any of the structures.

808
01:09:05,204 --> 01:09:09,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But the kids said that that tree, if we did anything to that tree, they would cry for the rest of their lives.

809
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So that tree is a focal point of the new playground.

810
01:09:13,589 --> 01:09:22,173
[SPEAKER_15]: So our project goals coming out of our committee were that the playground is safe, it's fun, it's accessible, and it reflects the identity of the students.

811
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:27,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Its primary goal was to meet the needs of the Miglin School if there was phased construction needed.

812
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:31,658
[SPEAKER_15]: At this point, because of our funding requests and

813
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:36,161
[SPEAKER_15]: very support from city organizations, city departments.

814
01:09:36,361 --> 01:09:43,506
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't foresee a phase construction, but you never know in these economic times.

815
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:45,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Offers a range of challenges for all users.

816
01:09:46,168 --> 01:09:54,094
[SPEAKER_15]: So one of the challenges with a universally accessible playground is that it'll offer challenges for some students and that it could be boring for all the students.

817
01:09:54,474 --> 01:10:01,800
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've really tried to take into consideration a wide range of play value there for our students.

818
01:10:02,287 --> 01:10:04,748
[SPEAKER_15]: It considers the wider benefit to the broader community.

819
01:10:04,988 --> 01:10:25,472
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a lot of housing options in the area, and this is termed a destination playground for the region, simply because of its access to the Wegmans Plaza, major arteries, and it's an easy stop-on, stop-off for people just looking to have their kids play.

820
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:30,053
[SPEAKER_15]: If you drive by in the summertime, you'll notice that it is crowded pretty much all the time.

821
01:10:31,222 --> 01:10:35,065
[SPEAKER_15]: and it can be maintained within the city and the school's resources.

822
01:10:35,526 --> 01:10:36,907
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a major element.

823
01:10:37,627 --> 01:10:48,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Making sure that our playgrounds are well maintained is a challenge, and it does require budgetary resources to make sure that these structures, which you might think are static, they're not.

824
01:10:48,435 --> 01:10:55,000
[SPEAKER_15]: They have parts that move, they have parts that break, and they have parts that rust and deteriorate over time, and those need to be replaced.

825
01:10:55,761 --> 01:10:57,382
[SPEAKER_15]: A plastic slide that you may think

826
01:10:57,785 --> 01:10:59,525
[SPEAKER_15]: That might last for 50 years.

827
01:11:00,406 --> 01:11:05,306
[SPEAKER_15]: If you visit the Brooks, you'll notice that a slide is worn through because the kids use it so much.

828
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:08,727
[SPEAKER_15]: So just as one example.

829
01:11:09,327 --> 01:11:14,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Significant community outreach was done, and I'll let Shanine speak to this, because she really led the community outreach effort.

830
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:14,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

831
01:11:15,268 --> 01:11:22,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So on-site events included, I personally did about 12 to 15 hours of playground observations and teacher interviews and student interviews.

832
01:11:23,965 --> 01:11:35,575
[SPEAKER_02]: in the spring, so we could get a head start on making sure that those voices, that the children's voices were heard first, and that the teachers' needs for supervision were considered in addition.

833
01:11:35,915 --> 01:11:43,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the supervision of a school playground needs to be much different than if I'm to take my two kids, I can pretty much keep an eye on them.

834
01:11:43,322 --> 01:11:45,443
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be running in different directions, but there are not 20 of them.

835
01:11:46,424 --> 01:11:51,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So teachers need to be able to see across the playground, so the design needs to reflect that.

836
01:11:51,327 --> 01:11:56,550
[SPEAKER_02]: We made sure we heard the teacher concerns from the, and all of the staff, from the very beginning.

837
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:04,734
[SPEAKER_02]: We met with the nursing staff, we met with the therapists, with the adjustment counselors, with multiple grades of teachers off and on the playground.

838
01:12:05,514 --> 01:12:06,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had

839
01:12:08,883 --> 01:12:10,504
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at curriculum night tabling.

840
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:13,327
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an event after school.

841
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:16,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we actually went to the design committee or the

842
01:12:17,618 --> 01:12:23,581
[SPEAKER_02]: The landscape architects went to the afterschool program and did a whole design workshop with multiple grades in the afterschool program.

843
01:12:24,201 --> 01:12:27,142
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at the Harvester Energy Festival.

844
01:12:27,783 --> 01:12:35,466
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a full survey that was sent to all elementary families and particularly the McGlynn families and a staff survey.

845
01:12:35,826 --> 01:12:46,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we reached out to the CPAC, the Special Education Parent Advisory Committee, as well as the autism group at the MFN for input on making sure that it's a really particularly inclusive space.

846
01:12:47,007 --> 01:12:53,833
[SPEAKER_15]: So in that work with our landscape architects, and some people might say, why didn't you just use a playground company?

847
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, a playground company is going to sell you their stuff.

848
01:12:57,255 --> 01:13:02,700
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we wanted to do was we wanted to make sure that we provided the best from a variety of resources and vendors.

849
01:13:03,322 --> 01:13:06,343
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we went with what is termed the pedal loop concept.

850
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:08,424
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna start here at the bottom.

851
01:13:09,064 --> 01:13:17,047
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an outdoor classroom space that students and teachers will be able to use from the McGlynn Elementary and the McGlynn Middle School.

852
01:13:17,067 --> 01:13:28,192
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, over here to the left of the screen, you'll see a stage that has ramped access and will offer outdoor performance spaces

853
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:32,633
[SPEAKER_15]: and then a turf field similar to what is at the Brooks School.

854
01:13:33,113 --> 01:13:49,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, and trust me, we wanted to be as sustainable as possible, but as I'm sure many of you know, little feet carry big impact and growing grass and having a field that is a natural field is unfortunately not feasible.

855
01:13:49,889 --> 01:13:53,353
[SPEAKER_15]: You would have to seed it and let it grow for two to three years.

856
01:13:54,216 --> 01:14:00,441
[SPEAKER_15]: And even then, maintaining a grass field is almost impossible with the amount of use that it would be getting.

857
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:04,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brooks tried for years to get it to be a grass field, and they finally just gave up.

858
01:14:05,064 --> 01:14:08,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But the infill won't be rubber, it will be more sustainable surfacing.

859
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,668
[SPEAKER_15]: This will be a sensory path.

860
01:14:11,643 --> 01:14:12,504
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, along here.

861
01:14:12,524 --> 01:14:17,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and then we have a half basketball court with two shooting options.

862
01:14:18,808 --> 01:14:21,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, over here will be a gaga ball pit.

863
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Up here will be four square.

864
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:38,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, the tree that I mentioned earlier, we'll have decking around it, uh, for quiet space sitting area for those students who want to engage in that, uh, going around the entire playground is a walking track.

865
01:14:39,802 --> 01:14:44,883
[SPEAKER_15]: offering students the opportunity to run, walk, run with moderation.

866
01:14:46,244 --> 01:14:50,525
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have musical instruments available in areas on the outside.

867
01:14:51,425 --> 01:14:57,566
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this right here, we'll get into more detail, is a climbing option.

868
01:14:58,066 --> 01:15:00,387
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this right here is the two to five.

869
01:15:00,607 --> 01:15:05,248
[SPEAKER_15]: You may not know this, but playgrounds have age limits, two to five, five to seven.

870
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,489
[SPEAKER_15]: So our preschool should not be on the larger playground.

871
01:15:08,919 --> 01:15:10,840
[SPEAKER_15]: They should only be on the 2 to 5 structure.

872
01:15:11,241 --> 01:15:20,486
[SPEAKER_15]: There will be gated access for weekends and after school hours for gated access here between the two for parents who want to bring their children.

873
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:23,108
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's just a large overview.

874
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:28,852
[SPEAKER_15]: And then these areas right here, as you know, this is near the river.

875
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:32,194
[SPEAKER_15]: There's significant drainage issues, once again, thanks to the DPP.

876
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:34,399
[SPEAKER_15]: for the temporary fix to help us.

877
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,463
[SPEAKER_15]: The lighter green trees represent existing trees.

878
01:15:39,643 --> 01:15:45,168
[SPEAKER_15]: The dark green trees represent additional foliage that we will put in place.

879
01:15:45,789 --> 01:15:49,833
[SPEAKER_15]: The red sections represent water gardens, essentially.

880
01:15:49,853 --> 01:15:57,039
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, dark green, sorry, dark green, slightly colorblind, represent

881
01:15:59,632 --> 01:16:06,957
[SPEAKER_15]: rain gardens and water retention areas for when we do have rain to pull it away from the playground itself.

882
01:16:07,097 --> 01:16:08,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And those will not be accessible to the children.

883
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:09,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

884
01:16:09,839 --> 01:16:13,061
[SPEAKER_15]: They will look very nice, though, based on the images that we have.

885
01:16:13,681 --> 01:16:14,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And moving forward.

886
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:22,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason, so he said that the preschool playground needs to be separated.

887
01:16:23,868 --> 01:16:25,409
[SPEAKER_02]: We also wanted to make sure that the preschool

888
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:30,045
[SPEAKER_02]: had developmentally appropriate and correct size equipment.

889
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:38,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an image if you're standing at, if you are imagining that half circle, you're standing at the bottom right corner and looking into the two to five area.

890
01:16:38,508 --> 01:16:45,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have an accessible playhouse, a swing that is transfer height so they can put the preschool age kids in there.

891
01:16:45,531 --> 01:16:54,314
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be some sort of like short monkey bar experience for kids to build upper body strength and so that they know what they're doing when they get to the bigger playground.

892
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:58,377
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a nature play area and a hill slide.

893
01:16:58,597 --> 01:17:02,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you couldn't see on the earlier image is that there's two elevation changes.

894
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you go up toward the stage area,

895
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:14,093
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see an elevation change of about two to three feet once you get to the top.

896
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:19,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And it means that the walking path maintains ADA slope throughout.

897
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:21,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's also this elevation change.

898
01:17:21,997 --> 01:17:27,760
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the gray path to the right here that goes up and around to the top of the slide.

899
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:31,162
[SPEAKER_02]: In total, that will be about four and a half feet tall.

900
01:17:31,822 --> 01:17:37,045
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be climbing options for kids to go up the hill, rope climbs and stepping stones, et cetera.

901
01:17:38,606 --> 01:17:39,886
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as plenty of shades.

902
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:44,789
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the number one thing we heard from the school community was that it is brutally hot back there.

903
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:54,734
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an image standing inside the gate looking toward the 5 to 12 play area, so basically standing on the turf field.

904
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the four square, the

905
01:18:00,116 --> 01:18:04,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaga ball pit is going to be inclusive as well.

906
01:18:04,697 --> 01:18:14,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if you've seen Gaga ball is a more low key, but inclusive, really fun dodgeball game that's been put into public parks, et cetera.

907
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can kind of hop in and out over the barrier.

908
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:24,862
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a spot that goes down and you just hop in and out over the wall, but this will also have an ADA gate so that everyone can use it.

909
01:18:25,328 --> 01:18:35,750
[SPEAKER_15]: In sharing this with our high school students on our advisory council, they were very jealous and can't wait for themselves to go and play gaga ball in the gaga ball pit at the McGlynn.

910
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:42,271
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's something that they see as really exciting for their younger peers in the school system.

911
01:18:42,411 --> 01:18:54,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still deciding on the seating, what the seating will actually look like, but there will be multiple different types of seating, some with backs and handrails, some that are just flat, to make sure that there's options for everyone.

912
01:18:56,349 --> 01:18:57,490
[SPEAKER_02]: This is looking toward the field.

913
01:18:57,550 --> 01:19:04,515
[SPEAKER_02]: When the preschool teacher saw this image, the first thing she said was, I can imagine having preschool graduation across that stage.

914
01:19:04,655 --> 01:19:05,575
[SPEAKER_02]: She's so excited.

915
01:19:05,656 --> 01:19:14,262
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire school community can gather here and have a movie or a performance or a guest speaker, in addition to just a place to hang out.

916
01:19:15,665 --> 01:19:25,508
[SPEAKER_02]: This field also separates what's happening now is that because of the two separate playgrounds, the kids who are playing football and soccer are doing so right in the entrance of the playground.

917
01:19:25,848 --> 01:19:33,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this moves that activity to the side so that kids who are walking by aren't getting hit by balls or trying to maneuver their way through that crowd.

918
01:19:35,794 --> 01:19:41,180
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from the top of the horseshoe looking down toward the basketball hoop.

919
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,384
[SPEAKER_02]: The big kids said they wanted to make sure that there was a short hoop as well so the little kids could play it.

920
01:19:45,504 --> 01:19:47,807
[SPEAKER_02]: The considerations of these students was really remarkable.

921
01:19:49,308 --> 01:19:52,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nature play area with the decking around their favorite tree.

922
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:58,331
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the outdoor classroom.

923
01:19:59,371 --> 01:20:03,273
[SPEAKER_02]: The principal, Mr. O'Brien, went over this with multiple grade levels of teachers.

924
01:20:04,013 --> 01:20:16,579
[SPEAKER_02]: There are recommendations that you can see the green roof, they call it a pavilion in there, is stocked with all sorts of equipment from barometers to green gauges and thermometers, rulers, all sorts of things.

925
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:23,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's recommended by the Boston Public Schools Outdoor Classroom or Schoolyard Initiative.

926
01:20:24,818 --> 01:20:29,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And we checked it against our curriculum standards and they'll be able to use each piece of that equipment towards our standards.

927
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:46,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also a sensory path in this space so that kids can go and enjoy quiet time, but also therapists could use it to serve our kids with mobility issues to practice over bricks and cobblestones, et cetera.

928
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:50,592
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some of the up-close images.

929
01:20:51,533 --> 01:20:53,755
[SPEAKER_02]: The basketball, the field, these are the swings.

930
01:20:53,795 --> 01:20:57,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So the staff was really split on whether or not they wanted swings.

931
01:20:57,477 --> 01:21:00,760
[SPEAKER_02]: The children were not split at all, and they were 100% for swings.

932
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:06,284
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to make sure that we addressed the concerns of the staff through design.

933
01:21:06,844 --> 01:21:10,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were concerned about turn-taking, so we have multi-user swings.

934
01:21:10,935 --> 01:21:15,198
[SPEAKER_02]: that are both inclusive, and we'll show you a particularly inclusive swing on the next slide.

935
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:22,183
[SPEAKER_02]: But there will be physical and visual reminders for kids so that they don't just run into the use area.

936
01:21:22,623 --> 01:21:26,906
[SPEAKER_15]: And the swing in the middle and the bottom, one vendor calls it a Viking swing.

937
01:21:27,046 --> 01:21:29,127
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get up to six participants on that.

938
01:21:29,688 --> 01:21:40,095
[SPEAKER_15]: And so just think, if you're a child with ambulatory challenges, your peers can help support you on that swing, and you can partake with your neighbors, with your peers,

939
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:45,679
[SPEAKER_15]: And truly be an inclusive environment Similar to this.

940
01:21:45,919 --> 01:22:03,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always called it the spider-man net swing But a really awesome net swing that hangs low to the ground So the inclusive features include that there will be a ramp up to the deck to hide out to hang out under the tree an inclusive spinner that doubles as pretend play space and

941
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bottom left, you see this new piece of equipment.

942
01:22:06,775 --> 01:22:15,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Most wheelchair swings are not permitted to be on public playgrounds unless they are fenced and separately locked, which means they're not inclusive.

943
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:25,658
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a separate piece of equipment, which is good, but this is the first fully inclusive wheelchair accessible swing that people can play together.

944
01:22:25,978 --> 01:22:27,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really excited to have this piece of equipment.

945
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:32,419
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see the ADA gate for gaga ball and the inclusive playhouse.

946
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:34,179
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the structure.

947
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:51,016
[SPEAKER_02]: The structure is not what I would have envisioned at the beginning, and we were thinking like those giant ramps playground, but the cost of ramps playgrounds is exorbitantly exorbitant because you can only ADA guidelines or you can only go up one foot for every 12 feet of horizontal ramp.

948
01:22:52,077 --> 01:22:55,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take up a whole lot of space on the playground just getting up that high.

949
01:22:56,301 --> 01:22:59,324
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're doing here is we're actually at the top of that four and a half foot hill.

950
01:22:59,845 --> 01:23:02,608
[SPEAKER_02]: The ramp comes off of the hill, so you're already up that high.

951
01:23:03,008 --> 01:23:05,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can see the end of the ramp there, that will be attached to the hill.

952
01:23:06,852 --> 01:23:08,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can get onto the structure.

953
01:23:08,554 --> 01:23:14,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Kids really said that they wanted to be able to do monkey bars, a lot of hanging and climbing.

954
01:23:15,295 --> 01:23:24,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and so just play development for Children swinging, spinning and climbing and hanging are just things our kids need to do.

955
01:23:25,024 --> 01:23:26,605
[SPEAKER_15]: It helps them get their energy out.

956
01:23:27,246 --> 01:23:40,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and there's a lot of research over the last several years about just the fundamental value of play in a child's day and being so critical to their development and their healthy development as members of their school community.

957
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:53,914
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what we've done here is we've tried to incorporate every single suggestion and every single ask and need of our teachers to make sure that their voices were truly heard throughout this whole process.

958
01:23:54,874 --> 01:24:00,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, the kids really wanted tall monkey bars because the fourth and fifth graders are too tall already for the existing ones.

959
01:24:00,817 --> 01:24:08,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have really tall monkey bars that prevent the little kids from getting up there because the distance between the step where you get onto the monkey bar

960
01:24:09,202 --> 01:24:22,526
[SPEAKER_02]: and the top of it is only that you could reach it once you're a certain age, but that there are lower monkey bars for the younger children to be able to practice at a height that they won't have such a hard time falling from.

961
01:24:23,947 --> 01:24:38,932
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted three horizontal bars, so it's actually situated against the hill more so that kids who are running by aren't going to run by someone flipping around on a horizontal bar, and there's a whole bunch of pretend play opportunities underneath the structure.

962
01:24:41,427 --> 01:24:47,211
[SPEAKER_15]: So a couple of master plan and budget projection slides here real quick as we close out.

963
01:24:47,652 --> 01:24:52,415
[SPEAKER_15]: So we need to make sure that we had a separate preschool area, development training, and size appropriate equipment.

964
01:24:52,915 --> 01:25:00,501
[SPEAKER_15]: The ages 5 to 12 playground need to be inclusive, but then also have that true sense of challenge for all.

965
01:25:01,702 --> 01:25:03,543
[SPEAKER_15]: A flexible use field within the play area.

966
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:10,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Artificial turf, as I mentioned, is the only durable option, and an outdoor classroom features requested by the faculty.

967
01:25:11,242 --> 01:25:15,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Trying to get our kids into their environment, even if it is just outside their school door.

968
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:26,054
[SPEAKER_15]: And as we look at the play area, that's $2 million inclusive of pretty much everything you've seen there.

969
01:25:27,695 --> 01:25:29,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Then the preschool play area is another $250,000.

970
01:25:29,436 --> 01:25:33,920
[SPEAKER_15]: The turf field, approximately $250,000.

971
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:41,286
[SPEAKER_15]: And the outdoor classroom for a grand total of $2.6 million for our preliminary pre-bid cost estimates.

972
01:25:41,853 --> 01:25:46,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Our funding requests are $900,000 from the Community Preservation Commission.

973
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:54,828
[SPEAKER_15]: That will more than likely be split between two fiscal years, but where construction will be starting in the summer, this will all work to the overall benefit.

974
01:25:55,519 --> 01:26:12,564
[SPEAKER_15]: This evening, we requested of the mayor $750,000 from ARPA to be able to support this program, $900,000 from CDBG, and somewhere in the neighborhood of $200,000 in linkage fees.

975
01:26:12,624 --> 01:26:23,407
[SPEAKER_15]: But we may be flexing that number as needed and also looking to see about any types of fundraising, corporate grants, or other things to support this project.

976
01:26:24,382 --> 01:26:29,645
[SPEAKER_15]: This represents an amazing opportunity for our students and our community.

977
01:26:30,126 --> 01:26:41,573
[SPEAKER_15]: It also represents the flagship playground that will then serve as a model for the other three playgrounds, which unfortunately are rapidly nearing their end of life cycle as well.

978
01:26:42,714 --> 01:26:56,507
[SPEAKER_15]: I really want to thank you for your time and I want to thank Shanine who has donated her time pro bono as a playground expert to really help us get this project off the ground and land it.

979
01:26:58,328 --> 01:26:59,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you both.

980
01:26:59,209 --> 01:27:00,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Going first to Vice President Behrs.

981
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:04,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Madam President, thank you Shanine, thank you Peter, thank you to everyone else on the team who

982
01:27:06,258 --> 01:27:06,899
[SPEAKER_13]: brought this together.

983
01:27:06,919 --> 01:27:13,864
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a highly detailed plan, clearly a product of a lot of hard work and community conversations.

984
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:27,516
[SPEAKER_13]: One of my first ever things that I did when I was starting to run for office is I was in Mia Mastone's living room with about eight other parents, and we were talking about the flooding and the drainage and the deteriorating conditions of this playground.

985
01:27:27,556 --> 01:27:28,677
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really great to see.

986
01:27:30,873 --> 01:27:35,888
[SPEAKER_13]: that we have something that we think, not only a plan that we think is viable, but that hopefully could be funded.

987
01:27:35,928 --> 01:27:36,891
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's really great to hear.

988
01:27:36,911 --> 01:27:38,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have a couple of questions.

989
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,941
[SPEAKER_13]: on the lifetime of this playground?

990
01:27:42,961 --> 01:27:50,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if we go with this, so I know that was a concern with the previous playground is it's only been 20 or so years, it's really in poor condition.

991
01:27:51,743 --> 01:27:53,503
[SPEAKER_13]: How long will this last the city?

992
01:27:53,783 --> 01:27:57,104
[SPEAKER_02]: So playgrounds are supposed to last between around 20 years.

993
01:27:57,404 --> 01:27:57,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

994
01:27:57,624 --> 01:28:04,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they're well maintained, and that hasn't been happening with either the school playgrounds or the city playgrounds.

995
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:08,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we want this to last, we need to be planning ahead to budget for

996
01:28:09,387 --> 01:28:12,149
[SPEAKER_02]: ongoing preventative maintenance.

997
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:20,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We really minimized the amount of cord in place so that if that needs to be replaced before the structures that it would be a much more affordable project.

998
01:28:22,388 --> 01:28:25,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And turf as well, right, that we have those figures.

999
01:28:25,309 --> 01:28:31,430
[SPEAKER_02]: But the playground itself should last us about 20 years or 25 if we take care of it.

1000
01:28:31,711 --> 01:28:37,512
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing to really think about with this playground is we've really shifted from what's there.

1001
01:28:37,852 --> 01:28:43,074
[SPEAKER_15]: So what was there was a large ramp structure that has a lifespan of 25 years.

1002
01:28:43,954 --> 01:28:48,295
[SPEAKER_15]: A field, while it may have to be replaced, will be replaced with another field.

1003
01:28:49,410 --> 01:29:11,662
[SPEAKER_15]: The stage should not need to be replaced the basketball while you may have to fix some moving parts like the fundamental bones of this won't be need to be replaced and The climber itself is a smaller climber because we've added so much of the play value throughout so It it's not I think it's I think we need to look at it just a little bit differently than your traditional

1004
01:29:12,923 --> 01:29:18,324
[SPEAKER_15]: 20 year, 25 year, there are elements that should last hopefully a little bit longer.

1005
01:29:18,344 --> 01:29:19,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Much longer than that.

1006
01:29:19,285 --> 01:29:19,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1007
01:29:19,705 --> 01:29:20,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Concrete steps.

1008
01:29:21,345 --> 01:29:21,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1009
01:29:21,905 --> 01:29:22,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1010
01:29:22,125 --> 01:29:33,668
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really what I was going at, is because it seems like the design on the first pass of the whole thing was basically wide open space, all of this fill in place, you know, whatever.

1011
01:29:34,148 --> 01:29:50,440
[SPEAKER_13]: the spongy surface and you know some clay structures put on top of it and it sounds like here we're going with a design where you know certainly there may be structures or pieces of structures that need to be replaced in 20 to 25 years but that we feel like the design is more sustainable over the long term as certain elements are.

1012
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:55,235
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as dealing with the drainage, which will cost us much less in maintenance over time.

1013
01:29:55,415 --> 01:29:58,376
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was, you know, maintenance and drainage is my next question.

1014
01:29:58,776 --> 01:30:11,541
[SPEAKER_13]: I know those are major concerns and definitely after the presentation, it sounds like they're being highly considered in the whole design that, you know, long term drainage solution for this area as part of the design and construction and funded through this project.

1015
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:12,602
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's really good to hear.

1016
01:30:14,323 --> 01:30:21,950
[SPEAKER_13]: And Peter, you were saying that maintenance is going to be more of a priority going forward or has been become more of a priority in recent years.

1017
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:27,815
[SPEAKER_13]: So are we confident that the funding within the existing budget is going to be there to maintain this over the long term?

1018
01:30:28,075 --> 01:30:31,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, as budgets were discussed earlier, we know how influx those can be.

1019
01:30:31,498 --> 01:30:35,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, these are these are fundamental parts of our infrastructure that

1020
01:30:35,942 --> 01:30:45,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, not, I mean, all schools and municipalities need to make sure that we are providing for the maintenance upkeep of all of our facilities, but especially these structures.

1021
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:55,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, just having annual playground inspections, I think will go a long way to say, um, here are the critical issues that you need to address, address them.

1022
01:30:55,977 --> 01:30:56,798
[SPEAKER_15]: And through

1023
01:30:57,412 --> 01:31:01,475
[SPEAKER_15]: consistent routine maintenance, we'll be able to have these playgrounds last longer.

1024
01:31:01,935 --> 01:31:02,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1025
01:31:02,736 --> 01:31:15,725
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess just something for me or future people looking at the budget, you know, it may be useful and it may not have the same power that I'm thinking it might have now, just to say, this is how much we think it would probably cost to keep this in good condition every year.

1026
01:31:15,745 --> 01:31:24,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And then that's something that we can try to make sure is in the budget or the school committee can try to make sure isn't there, but you know, however it works out just so that we can look at it and say, okay, we think we're meeting this goal.

1027
01:31:25,033 --> 01:31:26,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking a look at that now.

1028
01:31:26,074 --> 01:31:30,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CPC graciously funded an assessment of all of the remaining school playgrounds.

1029
01:31:30,877 --> 01:31:35,920
[SPEAKER_02]: There are five other playgrounds, two at the high school and the other three elementary schools.

1030
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:52,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the full inspection, so we should be able to, and we've been getting in touch with manufacturers and getting the as-built plans and kind of doing a lot of back work to make sure that we can get a list of equipment that will be needed to be replaced immediately because it's a hazardous situation, which we've already been remedying some of those things.

1031
01:31:54,483 --> 01:31:58,604
[SPEAKER_02]: for which things we just need to be aware of and then a budget for two or three years kind of things.

1032
01:31:58,944 --> 01:31:59,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and that's great.

1033
01:32:00,165 --> 01:32:21,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Just that active, and again, it sounds, I'm really glad to hear that it sounds like that's going on, that active constant, you know, assessment and so that we have the information in good times and bad times to know how much we're going to need to keep these in good condition, you know, I think is a helpful and I think you're, you're correct on the point of, you know, that capital planning has not been the strength of the city for a long time.

1034
01:32:21,352 --> 01:32:21,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And so

1035
01:32:22,142 --> 01:32:25,586
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something we really need to be focusing on when we're looking at investments like this.

1036
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just the replacement.

1037
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:30,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we replace a lot while we don't take care of the existing resources.

1038
01:32:30,631 --> 01:32:32,613
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to have a plan and funding.

1039
01:32:32,653 --> 01:32:41,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know that that funding has been considered across the parks of what we're going to do to make sure that our parks last longer than they've been lasting.

1040
01:32:42,022 --> 01:32:42,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1041
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:44,585
[SPEAKER_13]: And then just my last question and then one comment.

1042
01:32:45,912 --> 01:33:06,162
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I know there's been a lot of concerns lately around artificial turf fields, both from an environmental and a health and safety perspective, and it sounded to me like what we're doing here is we're trying, even though we're going with turf because it's the only durable way, and I was the first fifth grade at the Newbrook School, so that grass field was great for soccer games for my year, even if it didn't last.

1043
01:33:06,882 --> 01:33:13,225
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you said we're not gonna use rubber as the infill material, and if you could just go into that a little bit more, you know,

1044
01:33:14,977 --> 01:33:22,799
[SPEAKER_13]: What are the choices we're making around the turf field to make sure that we're, from an environmental and a health perspective for the students, making sure that it's the best that we can do?

1045
01:33:23,059 --> 01:33:35,621
[SPEAKER_02]: We're waiting on specs, but this was a conversation that we, the committee in no uncertain terms told the landscape architects that we were concerned about this and that we wanted to make sure that it was the safest option that we could get.

1046
01:33:36,301 --> 01:33:41,342
[SPEAKER_02]: The port in place and the... Sorry, Councilor Scarpella, I turned it off.

1047
01:33:41,362 --> 01:33:44,363
[SPEAKER_17]: The port in place and the... Sorry, Councilor Scarpella, sorry.

1048
01:33:44,663 --> 01:33:52,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just to just answer this in my background, what we've done in Somerville, you use this different forms of coconut husks and wood chips.

1049
01:33:52,232 --> 01:33:57,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's it's environmentally safe and it's a better option.

1050
01:33:57,418 --> 01:34:00,762
[SPEAKER_12]: The old Nike black pellets that were poured in.

1051
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:02,645
[SPEAKER_12]: So just to share that.

1052
01:34:02,865 --> 01:34:03,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1053
01:34:03,486 --> 01:34:04,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate that.

1054
01:34:04,789 --> 01:34:30,428
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing too, real quick, on the existing port in place, we had our CCL shop at Medford Vocational actually reach out and the students cut out a section of the port in place, did an investigation on what the substrate material was, and then the students and their teachers reached out to five or six recycling organizations to see if we could recycle that.

1055
01:34:31,397 --> 01:34:33,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, it is not a recyclable material.

1056
01:34:34,459 --> 01:34:38,022
[SPEAKER_15]: And unfortunately, it will go into a landfill.

1057
01:34:38,302 --> 01:34:46,729
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's one of the other reasons why we really want to reduce the footprint of this porting place, because it is not a material that is sustainable.

1058
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:56,276
[SPEAKER_15]: So while it's necessary, we need to reduce its usage from the approximate 25,000 square feet that it is right now.

1059
01:34:57,237 --> 01:34:59,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It is also permeable, which is all I was going to say.

1060
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:14,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Great yeah no and that's super helpful just you know, there's really movements around like, we will not do a turf field again and it sounds like I'm glad to hear from a that we're considering all those effects and be that there's different options that are coming in place that are not, you know, so detrimental to you know,

1061
01:35:15,717 --> 01:35:24,942
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the health piece too, like people saying there's negative health impacts from just the rubber and not just physical injury, but potentially long-term impacts from, yeah, exactly.

1062
01:35:26,803 --> 01:35:44,293
[SPEAKER_13]: And then just finally, you know, and I'm sure Councilor Caviello may say the same thing in one second, I'd say just reach out to friends of the Medford Public Library and see if they can give any tips on the private, and great, because, you know, they just did such a wonderful job raising money for the library, and I can only guess that the folks who supported that would be supportive of a project like this too, so.

1063
01:35:45,007 --> 01:35:45,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

1064
01:35:46,007 --> 01:35:47,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1065
01:35:47,307 --> 01:35:48,528
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

1066
01:35:49,388 --> 01:36:08,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Janine, thank you very much because I think that when you talk about your position, I work very closely with our department and we're fortunate in my community that I work in that we have a whole planning parks division and engineers and designers that are looking into these processes and moving that step forward.

1067
01:36:09,051 --> 01:36:11,311
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that, you know, you've given your time.

1068
01:36:11,331 --> 01:36:13,092
[SPEAKER_12]: That was very impressive and I appreciate that.

1069
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:22,541
[SPEAKER_12]: being the phys ed teacher that started at the McGlynn, this was awful.

1070
01:36:23,682 --> 01:36:25,725
[SPEAKER_12]: This site was tough because you couldn't do much other than

1071
01:36:27,585 --> 01:36:30,726
[SPEAKER_12]: kids bouncing around when it first came out, then the bounce is gone.

1072
01:36:30,806 --> 01:36:34,407
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that it's great to see what we have and we definitely need it.

1073
01:36:35,087 --> 01:36:36,568
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that it's so important.

1074
01:36:36,588 --> 01:36:44,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that, you know, a couple of, you know, as we went through the processes in the community we work in, just be careful of the lower nets.

1075
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:55,073
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it sounds great, but you can start it today and then tomorrow the high school and neighboring older kids come by and they want to do a dunk contest, right?

1076
01:36:56,153 --> 01:36:57,774
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that we should be aware of.

1077
01:36:57,834 --> 01:36:59,895
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, that's going to be the preventive maintenance side.

1078
01:36:59,955 --> 01:37:08,177
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think my concern right now is now if this is all from ARPA, if this is all going to be funded through ARPA, this is great because it's the mayor's decision.

1079
01:37:08,598 --> 01:37:12,279
[SPEAKER_12]: This council really has no leverage or any

1080
01:37:13,018 --> 01:37:16,544
[SPEAKER_12]: word to share with that's all coming from the main office.

1081
01:37:16,884 --> 01:37:18,306
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great for the presentation is great.

1082
01:37:18,687 --> 01:37:26,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's we appreciate that the information, but I, you know, the, I want you to understand as a parent and a volunteer that

1083
01:37:27,103 --> 01:37:35,291
[SPEAKER_12]: We're in a position right now that, I'm sure you've heard it possibly, but we haven't seen a money paper in the city in years, it seems like.

1084
01:37:35,352 --> 01:37:37,414
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't know what's gonna happen.

1085
01:37:38,014 --> 01:37:48,785
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we hear the mayor has gone to different library groups or whatnot and said that the budget's gonna be really dire coming up, it frightens me that here we are, you put all this work into this.

1086
01:37:49,526 --> 01:37:52,748
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've come to us and we're talking about a $2.6 million project.

1087
01:37:53,269 --> 01:37:54,790
[SPEAKER_12]: And in theory, it sounds phenomenal.

1088
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:57,452
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it was going to be funded all from ARPA, there we go.

1089
01:37:57,512 --> 01:37:57,912
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got it.

1090
01:37:57,992 --> 01:37:58,413
[SPEAKER_12]: We have it.

1091
01:37:59,153 --> 01:38:02,276
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the mayor's decision, the committee that she has on that.

1092
01:38:02,696 --> 01:38:14,625
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to be upfront and understanding that without seeing the budget right now, it's tough for this council that if we get started and the organization comes back to us, it's not the fact that we don't need it.

1093
01:38:15,173 --> 01:38:20,177
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the fact that it's probably going to be one of the best parks that are probably going to be utilized from every neighbor and community.

1094
01:38:20,557 --> 01:38:30,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I tell you, when we opened up ours at the Lincoln School, people came over from, I'm telling you, from miles away to be part of the parkour park there and everything.

1095
01:38:31,146 --> 01:38:34,669
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's definitely something we want and we need in this community.

1096
01:38:35,129 --> 01:38:39,133
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that as we move forward, we need to really have everybody understand

1097
01:38:39,838 --> 01:38:40,559
[SPEAKER_12]: the restrictions.

1098
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:45,710
[SPEAKER_12]: We're in this council right now is really not understanding where we fall on the budget because we're talking early.

1099
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:49,777
[SPEAKER_12]: It's why I requested the meeting with the school committee, the mayor and the superintendent.

1100
01:38:49,818 --> 01:38:49,918
[SPEAKER_12]: So

1101
01:38:50,489 --> 01:38:57,936
[SPEAKER_12]: as we get the process going, I would hate to see something that we get to the point in May and say, Hey, we're moving, moving forward with this great project.

1102
01:38:57,957 --> 01:39:05,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we're going to have to tail back because we're looking at cutting teachers and we're looking at cutting safety issues at the high school, but we're looking cutting for security.

1103
01:39:05,884 --> 01:39:08,427
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is why I'm calling for that meeting.

1104
01:39:08,447 --> 01:39:11,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope, you know, spread that word to support that.

1105
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:13,112
[SPEAKER_12]: But because I think this is important.

1106
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:13,912
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that

1107
01:39:14,702 --> 01:39:15,763
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where my kids went.

1108
01:39:16,564 --> 01:39:17,445
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where I taught.

1109
01:39:17,465 --> 01:39:19,448
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of my colleagues are still there.

1110
01:39:19,868 --> 01:39:20,970
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how important it is.

1111
01:39:21,591 --> 01:39:23,933
[SPEAKER_12]: And to see that plan, that's amazing.

1112
01:39:24,274 --> 01:39:27,137
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that it's so exciting to see it.

1113
01:39:27,658 --> 01:39:30,682
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole community is going to use it.

1114
01:39:30,742 --> 01:39:31,443
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't imagine

1115
01:39:33,732 --> 01:39:38,657
[SPEAKER_12]: what not only the school community is going to use, what the recreation department can use, just with that stage in that area.

1116
01:39:39,137 --> 01:39:40,899
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, talk about a community event.

1117
01:39:41,459 --> 01:39:47,905
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, everybody's just, you know, you talk about the Shell, and that's a great place, but a lot of people are afraid of the road.

1118
01:39:48,345 --> 01:39:49,987
[SPEAKER_12]: But now you're putting it into a park.

1119
01:39:51,649 --> 01:39:53,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm giddy just to think about the possibility.

1120
01:39:54,231 --> 01:39:58,275
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just don't want to be the bearer of bad news or the, you know,

1121
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:07,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Debbie Downer, but I just want to make sure that we know that budgetary wise with this breakdown that you showed us, it's a.

1122
01:40:08,688 --> 01:40:10,930
[SPEAKER_12]: If it was all ARPA and the mayor supporting that, that's great.

1123
01:40:11,171 --> 01:40:13,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's nothing that's coming out of the general fund.

1124
01:40:13,373 --> 01:40:13,773
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1125
01:40:13,813 --> 01:40:14,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1126
01:40:14,254 --> 01:40:20,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have CDBG, which we've already, we've met with planning and the ARPA fund manager and the CPC.

1127
01:40:21,221 --> 01:40:26,466
[SPEAKER_02]: CPC has agreed to give us 500,000 this year, and then we'll do an off cycle application next year.

1128
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:31,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar with CDBG and all the next year funding will be coming from the summer.

1129
01:40:31,571 --> 01:40:33,473
[SPEAKER_02]: are in the summer, so it would be within the scope.

1130
01:40:33,493 --> 01:40:37,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, hopefully this won't be affected by any of the budget funds.

1131
01:40:37,296 --> 01:40:37,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope not.

1132
01:40:37,897 --> 01:40:39,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, you've done so much work.

1133
01:40:39,438 --> 01:40:40,379
[SPEAKER_12]: This is amazing.

1134
01:40:40,539 --> 01:40:45,304
[SPEAKER_15]: We do know that moving forward, Councilor Scarpelli, that the other three

1135
01:40:47,163 --> 01:40:50,606
[SPEAKER_15]: won't have these luxuries of ARPA and other funding.

1136
01:40:50,726 --> 01:41:01,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Because to be honest, I mean, CPC has been extraordinarily generous for our playgrounds, but there are other priorities in the city and there are other priorities that we would like to see CPC used for the schools.

1137
01:41:02,154 --> 01:41:09,240
[SPEAKER_15]: And this will have these other three playgrounds and the ones at the high school will have to be really part of a capital plan moving forward.

1138
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:14,264
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate, I just wanted to share that just in case, you know, we're here again in six months, like,

1139
01:41:15,249 --> 01:41:17,690
[SPEAKER_12]: my goodness, this didn't work through and how we're going to make it work.

1140
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,031
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate it.

1141
01:41:19,091 --> 01:41:19,852
[SPEAKER_12]: This is amazing.

1142
01:41:19,952 --> 01:41:25,314
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you again, because especially when you talk about volunteers, this is something we all talked about.

1143
01:41:25,535 --> 01:41:31,418
[SPEAKER_12]: When you talk about creative and educated members of our community that want to give back, this is the end result.

1144
01:41:31,478 --> 01:41:32,418
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's awesome.

1145
01:41:32,438 --> 01:41:32,939
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

1146
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:34,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1147
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:35,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

1148
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:41,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing up the part about replacing the cushions around this.

1149
01:41:41,583 --> 01:41:44,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I belong to an organization where a pediatric head trauma

1150
01:41:45,398 --> 01:41:51,942
[SPEAKER_01]: is their number one concern, and part of the things they do is playgrounds, because that's where a lot of the trauma for kids come from.

1151
01:41:52,543 --> 01:42:03,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you for bringing that up, and I bring my own grandchildren to the playgrounds, and some of them are as good as us, so I'm glad we're bringing all that up to snuff so kids don't get hurt.

1152
01:42:03,649 --> 01:42:07,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also happy about disabled children being able to

1153
01:42:08,223 --> 01:42:11,624
[SPEAKER_01]: use these facilities, which they've never been able to use before.

1154
01:42:12,284 --> 01:42:13,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm real happy about that.

1155
01:42:13,565 --> 01:42:25,949
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as Councilor Behrs mentioned, as we do with the library, as I look at these pictures here, this is a plethora of naming rights, businesses, and things like that.

1156
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:33,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I were you, I would form a foundation similar to like the library did.

1157
01:42:33,392 --> 01:42:34,872
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got like, now you get, okay.

1158
01:42:34,892 --> 01:42:37,653
[SPEAKER_01]: The library, we sold everything.

1159
01:42:39,506 --> 01:42:42,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that wants a paper, we gave you something, we put your name on it.

1160
01:42:42,928 --> 01:42:50,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, from big rooms to chairs to the smallest thing, people are willing to donate.

1161
01:42:51,153 --> 01:42:52,473
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a very generous community.

1162
01:42:53,154 --> 01:42:55,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, you've got like this little park here.

1163
01:42:56,336 --> 01:43:01,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you'll find a family that might want to name it after someone in their family.

1164
01:43:01,178 --> 01:43:02,079
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the house here.

1165
01:43:02,119 --> 01:43:05,801
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all these things that you could put naming rights on

1166
01:43:07,084 --> 01:43:12,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Be surprised, be surprised how much, how generous people are when you go to ask them.

1167
01:43:12,647 --> 01:43:18,030
[SPEAKER_01]: There's businesses, there's foundations, there's anonymous families that just, they do want to help.

1168
01:43:18,671 --> 01:43:28,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to maybe form a, I'd be more than happy to help you figure out how to form a private foundation to help raise some private money.

1169
01:43:29,798 --> 01:43:35,502
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, like I say, just cuts down the cost of city, but people take pride in this when they see these things.

1170
01:43:35,562 --> 01:43:37,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, they like to see their name.

1171
01:43:37,964 --> 01:43:40,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses want to see their names on things.

1172
01:43:40,326 --> 01:43:42,067
[SPEAKER_01]: They want people to know that they're part of the community.

1173
01:43:42,087 --> 01:43:45,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, you've got a good start here.

1174
01:43:45,590 --> 01:43:47,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, you know, you can do this with this.

1175
01:43:48,051 --> 01:43:52,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as you move on, you know, naming rights for things that just, let's say,

1176
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:57,116
[SPEAKER_01]: are a great thing to do, so I apologize for what you're doing.

1177
01:43:57,756 --> 01:44:10,781
[SPEAKER_01]: But especially with the part about the trauma, because I say, I am with a group, and that is what they do, specializes in the head trauma for kids, and they also help design playgrounds for kids so they don't get hurt.

1178
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:11,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1179
01:44:12,041 --> 01:44:12,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1180
01:44:12,721 --> 01:44:12,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1181
01:44:12,961 --> 01:44:14,062
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Councilor Collins.

1182
01:44:14,082 --> 01:44:16,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll give Councilor Sviggum a moment to get back to his seat.

1183
01:44:16,502 --> 01:44:17,203
[SPEAKER_17]: So Councilor Collins.

1184
01:44:18,003 --> 01:44:18,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Rowe.

1185
01:44:18,803 --> 01:44:20,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for being here and for this

1186
01:44:21,655 --> 01:44:23,096
[SPEAKER_16]: found the presentation really interesting.

1187
01:44:23,136 --> 01:44:26,318
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great to hear about a playground from bonafide playground experts.

1188
01:44:26,338 --> 01:44:28,078
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really appreciate you walking us through this.

1189
01:44:29,839 --> 01:44:34,522
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, as Councilor Scarpelli and others have noted, our requests are appropriated by the mayor.

1190
01:44:34,562 --> 01:44:42,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Our vote tonight is, you know, largely symbolic, but I'm really glad that we have the opportunity to do so because this is just, you know, such an inspiring project, really.

1191
01:44:42,786 --> 01:44:49,070
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the need for rehabilitation, you laid it out very clearly, and we're so clearly going beyond that to create a

1192
01:44:50,129 --> 01:44:55,855
[SPEAKER_16]: adaptive and inclusive space, some of the concepts that we love to talk a lot about how to work those into our public spaces.

1193
01:44:56,335 --> 01:45:01,761
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is just such a such a clear example of us, putting that manifesting that in our community.

1194
01:45:01,781 --> 01:45:06,746
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll be really proud to have this playground within men first borders and thank you for your work.

1195
01:45:07,927 --> 01:45:08,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1196
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:10,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1197
01:45:11,230 --> 01:45:15,951
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to, first and foremost, say, again, how excited I am about this project.

1198
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:33,275
[SPEAKER_14]: As someone who went to the McGlynn for nine years and was a part of the McGlynn afterschool program for a very long time, you know, what you were saying about the slides and the rubber and the infrastructure and the flooding, I think that, I mean, that all,

1199
01:45:34,375 --> 01:45:37,039
[SPEAKER_14]: All those were problems when I was there and it's only gotten worse.

1200
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:50,957
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, with your advocacy and with all the work that you guys have been doing, you know, we're finally seeing, you know, something substantive that can make our children's experiences on the playground, much, much better.

1201
01:45:52,755 --> 01:45:56,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Councilor Behrs asked what I wanted to ask about the budget.

1202
01:45:56,457 --> 01:46:00,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems like you guys have, you know, have taken all of that into account.

1203
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:04,942
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the presentation was really, really comprehensive.

1204
01:46:05,202 --> 01:46:10,865
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really appreciate that you guys have thought, you know, long-term to the future about how do we save money over time?

1205
01:46:10,926 --> 01:46:13,727
[SPEAKER_14]: What are the investments we have to make now to do that?

1206
01:46:14,387 --> 01:46:18,430
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's something that every taxpayer in Medford can really appreciate.

1207
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:23,131
[SPEAKER_14]: I had the pleasure of talking to you at the Harvest Your Energy Festival.

1208
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:36,435
[SPEAKER_14]: And I saw you guys engage the kids and ask them for feedback and look at the different simulations and see what aspects of all the different drawings that they liked.

1209
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:44,537
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think seeing that, I think really epitomized how much feedback has gone into this project, which I really wanted to commend you guys for.

1210
01:46:44,737 --> 01:46:47,798
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really been, I think it's a model

1211
01:46:48,578 --> 01:46:53,002
[SPEAKER_14]: for our city to look at when it comes to engaging stakeholders, which I really appreciate.

1212
01:46:53,022 --> 01:47:05,231
[SPEAKER_14]: I also appreciated the environmental lens on this project, how you're salvaging living trees, but also planting more trees for shade, thinking about how to make the whole playground cooler.

1213
01:47:06,973 --> 01:47:15,780
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a meme that I bang on about heat islands, but I think this is something that our city can do to reduce, to mitigate the heat island effect.

1214
01:47:16,921 --> 01:47:27,493
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you guys, you know alluded to in the summer it's, it's a place where kids can go and where families can go to cool down when we have those heat waves that are, you know, only we're only seeing more of.

1215
01:47:29,175 --> 01:47:30,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, the equity lens of it.

1216
01:47:32,295 --> 01:47:47,170
[SPEAKER_14]: McLean, when we look at the income aspect of that neighborhood, when we look at where we're making investments in our physical infrastructure in our city I think it's really meaningful that we're doing work at the McLean and trying to make it better.

1217
01:47:48,410 --> 01:47:52,552
[SPEAKER_14]: and that we're really focusing on accessibility, which I know you're a huge advocate for.

1218
01:47:53,412 --> 01:48:04,236
[SPEAKER_14]: But really, I think we've seen with this project, how much work, how much thinking you've been putting into the very specific kind of aspects of accessibility, which I think I'm particularly touched by.

1219
01:48:04,256 --> 01:48:14,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you guys have also touched on something that we don't always think about when it comes to playground design, which was point four in the project goals, considering whether

1220
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,462
[SPEAKER_14]: considering how we could create a park with a wider benefit to our community.

1221
01:48:20,642 --> 01:48:28,925
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the Harvester Energy Festival kind of shows that there is potential for that space to be a community space, to have more city events there.

1222
01:48:29,726 --> 01:48:40,650
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's something that I've talked with our DEI director about, which is, you know, how can our city hold events outside of the normal places where we hold events, engage more residents?

1223
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:50,475
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know that, you know, there are certain parts of our community that are usually less, that see less events like this and see less engagement.

1224
01:48:50,535 --> 01:49:04,423
[SPEAKER_14]: And to be able to hold, to have a venue where we can hold community events like that, I think can really expand the Medford community and really bring more people back together, which I'm, again, I find really touching.

1225
01:49:05,163 --> 01:49:08,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the only question I had out of curiosity was,

1226
01:49:09,022 --> 01:49:13,304
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the plan for kids whilst the playground is being constructed?

1227
01:49:13,384 --> 01:49:23,988
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're gonna do is Principal O'Brien, the principal of the McGlynn School, is gonna form a committee and he's gonna work with his teachers so that they have voice on it.

1228
01:49:24,408 --> 01:49:35,872
[SPEAKER_15]: We've also worked with our CCL shop and are currently outreaching to, we're gonna work with the Medford Recreation Department to see if there's an option to put a gate

1229
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:44,822
[SPEAKER_15]: into the Hormel fence with ramp access so that we'll have a more direct access to Hormel from the McGlynn main entrance.

1230
01:49:45,203 --> 01:49:48,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Because right now you have to walk all the way down and then all the way back up.

1231
01:49:49,248 --> 01:49:53,694
[SPEAKER_15]: And so little feet, while they move fast, it still takes time away from the recess.

1232
01:49:54,354 --> 01:50:03,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so but we also want to have the teachers really develop and understand that, you know, this playground may not be operational for the start of next year.

1233
01:50:04,417 --> 01:50:08,318
[SPEAKER_15]: So what are our as construction is ongoing, hopefully.

1234
01:50:08,678 --> 01:50:12,579
[SPEAKER_15]: So what are our, um, opportunities for play?

1235
01:50:12,699 --> 01:50:16,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And teachers need to have a voice in that, um, moving forward.

1236
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:17,540
[SPEAKER_15]: And she can also speak to that.

1237
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:38,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I met with the staff this week, actually, at their staff meeting, and Mr. O'Brien had announced this playground logistics committee to talk to the kids about new equipment, to talk to the teachers about how to use new equipment, but predominantly to really plan for this transition, because the teachers and the staff at that building are the experts of how that building works.

1238
01:50:38,549 --> 01:50:45,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have some ideas of strategies to use, whether it's formal or some different approaches to recess that we could implement

1239
01:50:47,032 --> 01:50:51,571
[SPEAKER_02]: in the short term, but the staff will be leading the strategies there.

1240
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:52,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

1241
01:50:53,131 --> 01:50:54,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I really appreciate the presentation.

1242
01:50:54,952 --> 01:50:58,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you guys coming before the public and building that support.

1243
01:50:58,935 --> 01:51:04,258
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope, you know, God forbid that we come into difficulty with the budget when it comes to maintenance fees.

1244
01:51:04,378 --> 01:51:10,882
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the work that you're doing right now, building community support for it is super important in making sure that we have the capability.

1245
01:51:11,203 --> 01:51:14,765
[SPEAKER_15]: And to that end, while we've taken a lot of your time, I do just want to say one thing.

1246
01:51:15,365 --> 01:51:17,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Sang, we really tried to make this a model.

1247
01:51:18,389 --> 01:51:25,973
[SPEAKER_15]: for future playgrounds and future operational design elements for the Metro Public Schools.

1248
01:51:26,293 --> 01:51:34,357
[SPEAKER_15]: So let your imagination run wild, but we wanted to make sure that this is a model process moving forward.

1249
01:51:34,937 --> 01:51:35,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1250
01:51:36,258 --> 01:51:36,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1251
01:51:36,538 --> 01:51:38,939
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just have one quick question before going back to Vice President Barros.

1252
01:51:38,959 --> 01:51:43,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you guys so much for that thorough and detailed and very fun presentation.

1253
01:51:43,861 --> 01:51:47,563
[SPEAKER_17]: In a city that struggles with tree canopy, do you know the net change in trees

1254
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:51,166
[SPEAKER_17]: in the playground, I know some are coming down, but you'll be adding more, so.

1255
01:51:51,366 --> 01:52:00,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get that to you, but also I think there are only, there are two and a half dead trees because of the flooding, so those will come out, but they are being more than replaced.

1256
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:03,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're being selected, obviously, based on what can withstand.

1257
01:52:03,751 --> 01:52:04,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1258
01:52:04,311 --> 01:52:04,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Unique conditions.

1259
01:52:05,572 --> 01:52:06,112
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

1260
01:52:06,812 --> 01:52:07,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Behrs.

1261
01:52:07,712 --> 01:52:09,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

1262
01:52:10,213 --> 01:52:14,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Just wanted to add to Councilor Caraballo's point that potentially,

1263
01:52:15,083 --> 01:52:16,143
[SPEAKER_13]: forming a foundation.

1264
01:52:16,163 --> 01:52:19,944
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if it could just be for school playgrounds or maybe for parks and playgrounds in general in the city.

1265
01:52:20,584 --> 01:52:23,685
[SPEAKER_13]: This could be a way for this project to pay forward to the future projects.

1266
01:52:23,765 --> 01:52:26,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you have secured funding, one-time funding for this project.

1267
01:52:27,206 --> 01:52:32,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe naming rights on the pavilion could be saved and used for one of the future projects.

1268
01:52:32,407 --> 01:52:34,588
[SPEAKER_13]: So just, you know, just wanna throw that out there.

1269
01:52:34,988 --> 01:52:38,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Kerrio knows everybody, but I'm happy to help in any way that I can too.

1270
01:52:38,509 --> 01:52:38,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1271
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:42,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

1272
01:52:43,883 --> 01:52:45,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Any members, Councilor Collins?

1273
01:52:45,285 --> 01:52:46,586
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a motion to approve.

1274
01:52:48,047 --> 01:52:48,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, motion to approve?

1275
01:52:49,008 --> 01:52:51,510
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would just be to receive and place on file.

1276
01:52:51,611 --> 01:52:52,952
[SPEAKER_16]: I would motion that then.

1277
01:52:53,893 --> 01:52:58,497
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1278
01:52:58,837 --> 01:53:02,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to speak on this agenda item?

1279
01:53:03,582 --> 01:53:04,102
[SPEAKER_17]: On this item?

1280
01:53:05,544 --> 01:53:06,445
[SPEAKER_17]: You're speaking on this item?

1281
01:53:06,625 --> 01:53:06,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1282
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Just name and address for the record, please.

1283
01:53:08,948 --> 01:53:11,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Richard Orlando of Winford Way in Bedford.

1284
01:53:11,129 --> 01:53:17,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to commend you both for the work you've done as one of the co-chairs of the Building the Future Committee.

1285
01:53:17,890 --> 01:53:27,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I can say that I'm very excited to see this, and I'm sure other members of the Building the Future Committee from years past would be very appreciative of your work.

1286
01:53:29,233 --> 01:53:35,194
[SPEAKER_11]: As you mentioned, maintenance, ongoing plans, that is perhaps the biggest challenge the city has.

1287
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:38,581
[SPEAKER_11]: not only with the playgrounds, but with the school structures in general.

1288
01:53:39,201 --> 01:53:51,044
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say, uh, if you could pull off an event like this or a project like this, the enthusiasm and excitement and pride it creates in the community is, is something to, to observe and cherish.

1289
01:53:51,464 --> 01:54:02,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember when the schools were open and it was an amazing, amazing feeling for the community beyond the buildings and what the people felt and how they were appreciative of everything went on.

1290
01:54:02,526 --> 01:54:03,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, thank you very much.

1291
01:54:04,047 --> 01:54:04,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Both of you.

1292
01:54:05,547 --> 01:54:05,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1293
01:54:07,612 --> 01:54:15,656
[SPEAKER_17]: So, on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Seng, I do believe Councilor Knight dropped off, so we can, yes.

1294
01:54:16,376 --> 01:54:16,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1295
01:54:19,177 --> 01:54:20,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1296
01:54:20,298 --> 01:54:21,278
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1297
01:54:21,298 --> 01:54:21,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1298
01:54:21,798 --> 01:54:22,699
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1299
01:54:22,819 --> 01:54:23,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1300
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:24,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you both.

1301
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:24,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1302
01:54:27,001 --> 01:54:28,682
[SPEAKER_17]: On to public participation.

1303
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:29,642
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have a...

1304
01:54:33,883 --> 01:54:40,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so yeah, we have one from Sharon Diesso, who says, previous meeting, she's not here tonight, so we're going to take it, receive, and place on file.

1305
01:54:40,828 --> 01:54:45,992
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Councilor Carvello to receive and place on file, seconded by, all those in favor?

1306
01:54:46,012 --> 01:54:47,433
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1307
01:54:47,473 --> 01:54:48,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1308
01:54:48,393 --> 01:54:50,535
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone else who would like to speak for public participation?

1309
01:54:53,117 --> 01:54:56,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Seng.

1310
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:57,400
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1311
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:58,841
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1312
01:54:59,141 --> 01:54:59,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.
