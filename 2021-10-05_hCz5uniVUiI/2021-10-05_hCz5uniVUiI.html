    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=217.521s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=219.642s">It's</a>  nice for me to be back in the chambers with you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=224.172s">and</a>  I'm happy to share a few updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=228.494s">I</a>  wanna share that some of our Mustang science teachers took the opportunity to attend a special training at the end of the summer provided by the Life Science Change Agent Teachers Program, LSCAT. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=244.119s">It's</a>  a free week-long professional development series by Acera EI in partnership with the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=253.092s">This</a>  specialized training included lab activities and gene editing with CRISPR technology, microbiomics and climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=264.543s">All</a>  three units featured relevant cutting edge technology and research aligned to next generation science standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=274.051s">It</a>  is my feeling that this is a great opportunity for teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=278.002s">to</a>  take issues of modern science, like gene editing and climate change, and bring it into the classroom, making a positive impact on what students will be doing in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=290.746s">I'm</a>  proud that Acera EI is partnering with Medford Public Schools to bring hands-on science education to a new level. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=300.329s">As</a>  I stated in our last meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=303.267s">Medford</a>  is very lucky to have such a supportive business community that assists our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=312.195s">Last</a>  week, Mayor Lungo-Koehn and myself were able to visit Members Plus Credit Union and pick up 100 filled backpacks for those students who might be in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=324.826s">Additionally,</a>  we would like to thank Target and Everett <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=329.181s">who</a>  donated hand sanitizer for all our schools, Goldilocks bagels for donating their locks for love, which will benefit each elementary school, and 4 Good Vibes store in South Medford, who ran an online fall craft fair, which benefited the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=351.758s">Also,</a>  I must thank all of the merchants and other organizations who plan to play <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=358.378s">have</a>  donated prizes and or sponsored a hole for the annual Medford family network golf tournament hosted by Yoki restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=370.763s">The</a>  tournament, one of MFN's largest fundraisers will be held next Monday, October 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=377.996s">at</a>  the Sagamore Golf Club facility in Linfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=382.719s">So</a>  if anyone is interested in playing or donating a prize, please contact the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=389.864s">They'd</a>  love to have you join them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=392.185s">I</a>  must say that our Mustang community is truly very blessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=397.643s">We</a>  have a few upcoming events. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=400.105s">This</a>  coming Wednesday, October 6th, is the International Walk, Bike to School Day and kicks off Walk, Bike to School Wednesdays this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=412.593s">These</a>  events encourage physical activity as well as promote pedestrian and bicycle safety in both our neighborhoods and all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=425.233s">This</a>  coming Saturday, the Medford Police Department, working together with Shiloh Baptist Church, will be hosting a free family day this Saturday, October 9th, outside in the City Hall parking lot from 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=440.12s">to</a>  2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=442.061s">This</a>  event will feature a DJ, food, a bike rodeo, car seat checks, and a unity walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=449.885s">The</a>  goal of this event is to bring our community and police together <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=454.639s">Our</a>  vocational side of the house assisted the police department by producing flyers and a banner. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=461.643s">We</a>  were glad to partner with the police on this important initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=467.226s">Also,</a>  October is Italian American Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=473.45s">Over</a>  5.5 million Italians have immigrated to the United States since the 1800s. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=481.934s">As</a>  you probably know, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=483.532s">Our</a>  country, continent, as well as some of our neighboring continents to the south are named after an Italian explorer and geographer by the name of Amerigo Vespucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=497.265s">We</a>  celebrate those of Italian heritage who have richly contributed to America and to the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=505.348s">In</a>  closing, as the weather is changing and the leaves begin to fall, I hope that our Mustang families enjoy making memories, apple picking or pumpkin decorating. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=518.272s">Take</a>  advantage of the outdoor activities while the weather cooperates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=522.994s">Have</a>  a good evening.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=527.816s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=531.598s">We</a>  next up have the public health update, Director of Health Services and Assistant Superintendent of Finance Operations will report on the Medford Public Schools student and staff COVID testing program, state and district mask mandates, Medford Public Schools personnel vaccination status, contact tracing and quarantine communication protocols, and revisions to COVID-19 prevention protocols for all kindergarten classrooms.</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=560.855s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=562.815s">I'll</a>  start with the health services update about our weekly testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=567.216s">Medford</a>  Public Schools continued its pooled testing surveillance last week, conducting a total of 315 pools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=573.797s">Of</a>  those 315 pools, there were four positive pools identified for a percent positivity rate of 1.26%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=580.439s">The</a>  percent positivity rate for the entire state of Massachusetts for the same week was 1.96%, so we were just below that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=589.315s">School</a>  nurses also saw 55 students with symptoms coming into the health offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=593.56s">40</a>  of those students were able to be tested in the health office and school nurses found no additional positive students through their testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=601.268s">The</a>  other 15 symptomatic students were unable to be tested in the nurse's office but were referred to outside testing and all were found to be negative through PCR testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=610.902s">As</a>  a general reminder, please stay home if you're sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=614.345s">We're</a>  still seeing students coming into the office with symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=618.568s">As</a>  much as we want kids to be in school, we want to make sure that they're well enough to be in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=622.291s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=625.822s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=627.983s">We</a>  had some questions at our last public health date with respect to our testing program participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=634.066s">So</a>  in your packets this week, we did provide additional information and a breakdown, both with respect to our school by school consent form completion rate, as well as what we've referred to as our actual participation rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=650.777s">And</a>  that actual participation rate is the percentage of students for whom consent forms have been received that are participating for each time that the testing program is run. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=661.822s">So</a>  generally speaking, we were encouraged by those numbers, both with respect to consent forms that have been received and with regard to the actual participation rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=672.343s">As</a>  you can see, there are a couple of school communities that we need to double down on the communication for in order to get our consent form consent form rates up over 90% across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=683.418s">as</a>  we had by the end of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=685.699s">You'll</a>  remember that that did take some time last year as we continue to sort of beat the testing drum over the course of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=693.522s">I</a>  will point out one anecdote that's probably clear from the numbers that you've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=697.584s">The</a>  school that we had the lowest consent form participation rate in terms of submission, we have the highest percent with respect to actual participation, which is somewhat ironic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=708.669s">And</a>  of course, as you know, we'll never have 100% actual participation because <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=712.877s">That</a>  would be factor in students who are absent on a particular day, or perhaps are being quarantined. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=717.922s">Obviously</a>  those students are not able to participate in the program but generally speaking, we're, we're hovering in around 80%, based on the final numbers that came in after our testing program on Thursday, ended up being at about 78% of the students from we have consent forms are participating in the testing on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=736.729s">Sort</a>  of somewhat noteworthy that our high school numbers are as high as, as they are, as we talked about last year high school students having a little more independence little more agency, they have more flexibility, frankly, whether they participate or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=749.883s">The</a>  mandatory participation for students involved in extracurricular programming is one of the factors we think and make sure that that number stays high. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=759.069s">And</a>  at the lower grade levels, elementary, for instance, students are participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=763.392s">There's</a>  a whole class is being walked down to the testing station. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=766.133s">So</a>  we would expect those numbers to be high and for the most part that they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=770.676s">If</a>  you have any questions, happy to entertain them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=775.198s">Otherwise</a>  I can move into some high level information related to vaccination rates, but won't be going into a high level of detail on those for reasons that I can explain.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=788.37s">Mayor,</a>  I am also. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=789.651s">Okay,</a>  Member McLaughlin, after that.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=791.912s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=792.753s">I</a>  think I should probably read them at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=796.915s">Is</a>  that all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=797.936s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=798.256s">The</a>  first one is from <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=811.038s">Christina</a>  McCourty 24 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=813.762s">She</a>  writes dear members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=817.987s">I'm</a>  the parent of two elementary school students and I'm writing with a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=822.712s">One,</a>  at this point, is there any evidence that points to possible interschool spread of COVID-19? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=829.767s">Watching</a>  the COVID tracker there was an increase in positive cases in a couple of buildings, and many of us are wondering if there were multiple cases in the same classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=839.335s">Do</a>  you want to take this one by one or if we could.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=846.301s">There</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=849.643s">Thank</a>  you, Mary. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=850.103s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. To the member of the community for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=854.187s">So,</a>  last year, one of the, I think, significant points of pride that we had as an organization was that there was minimal in school transmission and for the most part, our health services department at the time concluded that there was really only one instance across the entire district, in which we said that there was a likelihood of in school transmission and <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=873.986s">I</a>  say likelihood because of course, with all these things that our statements have to be qualified because there's no definitive proof one way or another when it comes to this type of tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=883.129s">We</a>  have had more instances this year of suspected in school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=888.37s">They</a>  have been concentrated and besides can go into greater detail about this probably not much greater detail for obvious reasons at the elementary school level where we have a higher population of unvaccinated individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=900.353s">The</a>  real reason I think that as a layperson that the inference you can draw is that with the occupancy restrictions being lifted, we have many more people in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=908.716s">And</a>  so while we have protocols in place around physical distancing, and we make a good faith effort to maintain that physical distancing and extended physical distancing during all meal periods, the reality is that we have more people, they are based on age, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=928.433s">unvaccinated</a>  and they are in close proximity to one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=930.995s">And</a>  so it is definitely true that we have more evidence of in-school transmission this year than we did last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=937.4s">As</a>  the committee knows, this week, this past week, as a result of a pattern that had developed at the kindergarten level, we did institute heightened protocols with respect to distancing, with respect to testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=954.088s">and</a>  a variety of other measures that were spelled out in the memo to you to essentially clamp down on our kindergarten students. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=962.173s">It's</a>  not surprising that that's where we're seeing a concentration of positives and in-school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=968.677s">These</a>  are students who are in a formal education environment form for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=973.6s">Obviously</a>  they are all unvaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=975.681s">And</a>  while there were protocols in place at the beginning of the school year, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=979.437s">And,</a>  you know, maybe to some degree, some of this was inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=983.921s">We</a>  did feel that we needed to ratchet up the protocols that are in place at the elementary school level, specifically with kindergarten students. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=990.186s">And</a>  so those students will be tested on a daily basis for the foreseeable future. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=994.889s">And</a>  we'll continue to monitor that closely.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=998.312s">This</a>  parent goes on to say, is there any update on when buildings can transition back to testing twice per week? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1005.495s">She</a>  mentions that she knows the kindergarten students are being tested daily and says if that's happening, she would think we could handle testing all students twice per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1015.703s">So</a>  if you might.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1017.884s">I</a>  can understand where someone might make that assumption, but I would say it would be an assumption and a flawed one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1023.509s">We</a>  are stretching our staff and resources considerably by heightening the kindergarten testing on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1033.997s">Frankly,</a>  we barely have the resources to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1037.26s">And</a>  so, doing school wide twice weekly testing is is for the same reason that we identified previous meeting of the school committee, not something that's feasible at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1047.953s">That</a>  being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1049.975s">While</a>  there is an uptick with respect to in-school transmission this year, an important qualifying note is that there was only one instance in the entire school year last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1060.864s">And</a>  so it is not the case that we're seeing a dramatic rise either in positivity or in in-school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1068.29s">And</a>  so I think the significant instructional disruption aside, all of us would prefer to test more rather than less. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1077.598s">Currently,</a>  if you look at the data that we're producing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1081.543s">There</a>  isn't, at least by the standards that were established last year when we tested multiple times a week throughout the course of the year, there isn't frankly an urgent need to increase the amount of testing we have district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1092.757s">So,</a>  again, like all things being equal, we would <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1097.587s">prefer</a>  to swab everyone's nose on the way in the door and just make that a matter of routine. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1103.029s">But</a>  based on the resources that we have, we felt that concentrating them with the kindergarten students right now was most consistent with the data that we were seeing coming out of the testing program.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1114.163s">The</a>  third part of the email is, some first grade students have begun unmasking in class for phonics lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1121.188s">Though</a>  this was briefly mentioned in an email communication, no details have been given on what this looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1127.313s">We</a>  have a right to know what risks our students are taking and which health professionals weighed in on this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1133.077s">Going</a>  forward, can someone from the district please give a detailed description of unmasked situations that have been deemed to be necessary for instruction? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1141.347s">before</a>  they happen for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1143.729s">Any</a>  unmasking brings risks, and I think families have the right to know of any increased risks they are facing at school so we can reflect on it, ask questions, and determine whether we decide if the risk is acceptable to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1156.777s">Many</a>  students are also anxious about being unmasked indoors, and knowing in advance would give us caretakers the ability to prepare them and discuss it in a safe place.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1166.069s">I</a>  think with respect to the specific phonics lesson at third grade I'm going to defer for the time being we'll, we'll follow up with the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1172.239s">It</a>  sounds as though there was a communication that went out related to that and as we discussed at the beginning of the year from an instructional perspective there are certain times in which. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1181.439s">different</a>  protocols will have to be followed, generally speaking that involves either shields or additional distancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1188.365s">In</a>  order to mitigate any risk that is absorbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1191.768s">But</a>  just to be clear, just to speak on a more general basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1196.392s">We</a>  are balancing the educational interests of students with the public health risks of students in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1202.757s">Every</a>  hour of every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1204.518s">There</a>  is no decision related to the operation of the Metro schools or frankly any other school district in which there is not some degree of balancing that's taking place, similar to in the professional world, people are going into work in our resuming in person activities and so I think it's important that we communicate and be as clear as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1225.664s">and</a>  as transparent as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1228.085s">But</a>  one of the ways we do that I think is acknowledging the fact that there's there about this balancing taking place and there's going to be the remainder of the school year.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1237.429s">Okay,</a>  I'll turn to the next person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1242.391s">This</a>  one is Ingrid Moncada 131 virgin have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1249.336s">I</a>  have a few questions regarding COVID protocols at MPS, and she writes in parentheses, a comprehensive document with MPS current policies would be ideal, so we'd have to keep asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1260.965s">One,</a>  what's the data that supports the decision of testing kindergarten in such a different way than the rest of the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1268.891s">Why</a>  now? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1269.431s">Was</a>  there evidence of in-school transmissions?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1271.869s">So</a>  the answer to that is yes, as I said previously, and the pattern and the data was that we had our fifth kindergarten class that was required to transition into temporary virtual learning because of positivity in the class and close contacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1288.939s">And</a>  frankly, just speaking in a very practical sense, it is challenging to determine <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1295.383s">amongst</a>  a group of five-year-olds who have never been in school exactly who the close contacts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1300.127s">And</a>  while sometimes we have concrete evidence and we can say that's exactly what happened, this is exactly the protocol we have to follow, sometimes we have to err on the side of caution, which is what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1309.694s">And</a>  by the fifth time we did it, we determined that we were going to have to revamp the protocols that were put in place to keep students safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1315.738s">With</a>  regard to the document, we have that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1318.16s">I</a>  think it does need to be recirculated, and that's something we'll work on during this week's communication.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1322.767s">Okay,</a>  this one touches on what you've just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1326.948s">What's</a>  the criteria for quarantining a whole class? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1329.849s">Is</a>  it because the whole class is considered close contact? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1332.93s">How</a>  can that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1334.33s">How</a>  often does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1335.85s">Is</a>  it only in kindergarten classes?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1337.991s">Well,</a>  not by rule, it's only in kindergarten classes, it would happen where it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1341.712s">But</a>  this year, it's only happened in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1345.233s">And</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1346.811s">The</a>  conclusion that we drew was that that's not a coincidence that if it had happened only in fifth grade, you probably would have drawn a different conclusion and probably needed to kindergarten, you have students that are in a brand new environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1363.404s">and</a>  teachers who are working tirelessly to try to provide them with as normal an experience as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1371.228s">It's</a>  not in any way a reflection on the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1373.53s">It's</a>  a reflection on what it's like to manage 18 to 21 five-year-olds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1380.133s">It's</a>  nothing against the five-year-olds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1382.655s">If</a>  anything, we're watching it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1385.576s">We</a>  are operating within the circumstances that <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1392.545s">being</a>  dictated to us.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1395.188s">Part</a>  three, what are the guidelines for students returning to school after being sick at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1399.832s">I've</a>  heard reports of people having to provide proof of coven negative and pay for a private PCR test. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1406.065s">before</a>  being accepted back in school, and others that are not told anything, and just bring the kids back as soon as they feel better.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1413.31s">So</a>  I'm going to defer to Miss signs with regard to the specific protocols and pointing, I will just. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1418.093s">I</a>  do want to say, note this for the committee that, well, I think it's important that we answer as many questions as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1425.111s">There</a>  are times when someone could draw an inference that something is happening with regularity, that it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1433.996s">And</a>  so if the only thing you know about the Medford Public Schools and the work that we're doing to keep students and staff safe from COVID-19 is that a report that there was some inconsistency with regard to communication, I think that would not truly reflect the consistency and the thoroughness with which we've executed these protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1454.348s">I</a>  have to put that disqualifier out there because I do think that there could be disproportionate conclusions drawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1461.094s">If</a>  this is the only piece of information that the public has but I think the science can speak to the specifics with regard to how the quarantine works and their communication or close contacts.</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1470.876s">Yes,</a>  so if we have student or staff that is symptomatic, obviously we would like to know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1475.92s">That</a>  is how we are able to tell you what is required to come back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1479.823s">We</a>  are finding that some parents and students, they make the decision to get their own PCR test without speaking to a nurse and then tell us after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1489.09s">That's</a>  also great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1489.79s">We</a>  want to make sure we're getting that PCR test if we're having symptoms related to COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1493.971s">But</a>  we would like to know beforehand, because we also want to make sure that students are symptom free for 24 hours before returning to school without the use of medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1501.673s">So</a>  you know, no Tylenol, Ibuprofen, that would bring a fever down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1504.794s">We</a>  want to make sure that your body is naturally returning to its <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1507.683s">baseline</a>  state of health. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1509.264s">And</a>  then we also want to make sure that you spoke to your primary care physician and made sure that there wasn't anything else going on you know they're still strep throat, they're still mono they're still the flu. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1518.229s">We</a>  want to make sure that you were seen by a health care provider before returning to school because there are other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1523.152s">that</a>  it could be and not just COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1525.153s">In</a>  terms of a COVID PCR test, the school nurses have a laundry list of available testing sites that offer free PCR tests, so please use your building-based nurses as a resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1536.398s">We're</a>  here to help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1537.739s">We</a>  have those lists printed out and ready to hand out or email to families as needed, but the requirement really is if you're having any of those symptoms, you need to be symptom-free for 24 hours before returning to school, have a negative PCR test, and have reached out to your primary health care provider. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1553.275s">make</a>  sure that you're good to come back.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1556.218s">The</a>  parent goes on to say, has the district or city considered providing free COVID testing for NPS families at schools after hours City Hall or other Medford location. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1567.088s">If</a>  families are indeed required to provide proof of negative test before returning to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1571.572s">This</a>  would be essential.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1574.888s">We</a>  did consider last year having a satellite location for situations like this at the time that was primarily focused on staff, because of the staffing challenges that we were facing given the number of staff that were out on either short or long term basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1589.256s">I</a>  would say that it is something we can that we could consider but it's it's not an easy lift and as I said, we're relatively stretched with respect to resources, and I say that I'm referring more to human capital than financial <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1603.446s">frankly,</a>  in this particular instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1606.047s">And</a>  so it's something we could consider, but it's something that we'd have to look at pretty closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1610.649s">And</a>  I can't say with certainty that it's something we'd be able to execute in a way that will truly be effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1617.131s">Just</a>  a quick example, we might be able to do something like that once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1620.952s">but</a>  so much of the protocols are tied to specific timelines that we would end up in a situation in which we're making it very easy for families who have a student who tested positive on a Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1633.101s">But</a>  if you tested positive on a Wednesday through Friday, we wouldn't be able to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1637.544s">And</a>  that's the type of inconsistency or inequity that we're trying to take out of the system as opposed to perpetuate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1647.551s">Having</a>  a satellite location for families <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1650.655s">It's</a>  something that I think we might want to speak with the Board of Health about, since I think in many respects, it's more of a, it would be a community service as opposed to a school-based one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1658.779s">I</a>  think it's worthy of consideration, but I think one that we'd have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1662.962s">And</a>  I just want to say again, if you look at our numbers, we're in a relatively good spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1668.505s">I</a>  think, well, you know, we have to take all of these seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1671.366s">We</a>  have to be vigilant. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1672.207s">We</a>  have to maintain the protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1673.367s">We</a>  have to do all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1675.768s">I</a>  don't want to lose sight of the fact that we're nowhere close to where we were <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1681.482s">a</a>  year ago, certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1682.943s">And</a>  in some respects, the numbers are trending in a positive direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1690.27s">And</a>  so what makes sense for us right now in terms of the use of resources may not make sense six weeks from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1697.097s">That's</a>  one of the things we'd have to take into account as we look at it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1702.042s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1702.622s">That's</a>  all the letters that I received. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1706.252s">on</a>  the school committee mailbox.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1707.853s">I</a>  think we were gonna touch base on vaccination status, but if there are any other testing related.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1724.086s">It's</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1724.887s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1726.328s">It's</a>  difficult to find the consent form on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1729.85s">I</a>  know the superintendent includes it in her weekly letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1733.393s">Is</a>  there any way to put <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1734.872s">Like</a>  a special button on the website with the link to all the corporate information. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1740.876s">The</a>  consent form the Testing program frequently asked questions testing program schedule things like that short answer is yes, and it is located, but I think.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1754.79s">we</a>  can make it more easily accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1756.41s">And</a>  I think your suggestion about concentrating some of the materials in a place that's slightly easier to find, I think we can make improvements there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1764.212s">So</a>  we can commit to that within the next 24 to 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1767.333s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1770.794s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1774.775s">If</a>  a student has symptoms but cannot be tested since they don't have a consent form, are they isolated and sent home immediately?</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1783.07s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1783.53s">So</a>  first and foremost, our nurses would also try and reach the parent and get a verbal consent because they will have to be dismissed ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1790.235s">And</a>  then the parent could physically sign the consent when they come for the dismissal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1793.958s">So</a>  we always try and get that consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1796.199s">If</a>  a parent is not willing to give consent for school, they are dismissed immediately after being isolated and, you know, assessed by a nurse to make sure they're safe to go home and not to another provider, like say being transported to the ER or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1810.048s">They</a>  would be immediately dismissed after isolated and being with a nurse and referred to outside testing if they do not consent to in school testing.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1817.813s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1818.513s">And</a>  you answered my next question, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1821.895s">How</a>  are we handling a positive student that was positive in school who has siblings in another classroom or in a different school? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1830.4s">How</a>  are we contact tracing that?</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1832.972s">So</a>  for a student that is positive and has siblings in another school or in another classroom, which happens quite frequently in this district, they are then considered close contacts to their positive sibling. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1844.498s">And</a>  they would follow the same quarantine guidelines as anyone else where we would request that you get tested day five after your last day of exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1854.163s">or</a>  sooner if you have symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1856.024s">And</a>  then depending on that test result, if the siblings are 18 and five, they might not have that much interaction, might have separate bedrooms and the sibling might actually not become positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1867.373s">And</a>  after their quarantine, they're able to return to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1870.836s">But</a>  it might also be the case that that student then becomes positive and they start a 10 day isolation, but they would be in that quarantine period at home in a separate area from their positive sibling until they were determined safe to come back to school.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1882.947s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1884.168s">So</a>  if it was a five-year-old who tested positive and there's a seven-year-old, I mean, not all five-year-olds and seven-year-olds are rough and tumble all day long, but a lot of them probably are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1896.818s">And</a>  so would we immediately, assuming we have consents, of course, would we immediately be testing that seven-year-old before the day's out so we could do close contacts on that classroom?</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1908.457s">It</a>  really is a case by case basis, depending on the age and the interaction of the students and the siblings and what their contacts in school might also be and if you know they were seen in the nursing office two days prior for a little runny nose that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1921.768s">you</a>  know, subsided after half an hour, we really look at each individual case very closely and make a nursing decision on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1929.953s">And</a>  we usually err on the side of caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1931.494s">So</a>  there have been instances where a sibling tested positive or a parent that's also a staff member test positive, and we're testing those kids before we even send them out of the building, just to make sure we're doing our due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1942.08s">That</a>  has happened on multiple occasions already this school year.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1945.101s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1945.702s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1946.162s">And</a>  then my last question is, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1949.856s">Well,</a>  I was really surprised we could ramp up the daily kindergarten testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1953.778s">I</a>  was happy with the memo, but my first thought was we still don't have cloning technology to duplicate the nurses.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1963.785s">Yeah,</a>  nurses were surprised we could do that too.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1965.746s">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1968.187s">Sorry,</a>  just trying to make light of what I'm sure is not a polite situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1972.59s">Have</a>  we considered, you know, I know that I was reading something in, I don't know if it was the Globe or the New York Times about <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1979.468s">The</a>  very active traveling nurse programs that are out there, nurses can, frankly, traveling nurses right now can pretty much write their own checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1989.557s">Have</a>  we considered, it sounds like we're at the edge of staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1995.922s">And,</a>  you know, when I looked at the testing numbers, one of the things about the elementary school, so in the elementary grades, I sort of think of the students as captives, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2008.578s">the</a>  whole classroom goes to get tested, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2011.26s">So</a>  if 90% of those students have a consent, then 90% of those students should get tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2019.205s">Looking</a>  at the numbers that we got, unless we have a 25% absenteeism in elementary, which I think is not realistic, it looks to me like whole classes just didn't go get tested.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2032.413s">Well,</a>  there's a couple of caveats there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2036.255s">And</a>  I apologize, I should have said this at the outset. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2039.236s">The</a>  actual participation numbers are a snapshot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2042.617s">So</a>  the numbers that were represented to you with respect to actual participation were for last week, September 27th till October 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2055.079s">So</a>  three days of testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2056.88s">So</a>  in an elementary school, if you take the students that happen to be absent for that day, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2063.085s">and</a>  a class perhaps the students that are quarantined because they're close contacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2068.588s">I</a>  imagine a few outliers along the lines of the class went down and the student was out of class getting services. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2077.512s">I</a>  don't think we had anyone like in the restroom or anything along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2079.913s">Usually</a>  we'd get them before we head down to the testing site, but like there could be some outliers like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2086.036s">And</a>  that's generally what should represent that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2088.717s">I</a>  don't disagree that if it's at 25% of elementary school, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2093.501s">There</a>  should be another variable and it's something that we can dig into the data on a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2097.384s">But</a>  you should know that this represents a single week of actual participation and we intend at the end of October, assuming that, you know, and I think we will be that our program, our testing program is still operating at the same capacity and with the same frequency and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2114.267s">will</a>  take another snapshot and that this is essentially baseline data to determine whether or not additional communication efforts and drilling down on exactly the point that you raised can can remedy those numbers to some degree.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2126.875s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2127.856s">I</a>  just, you know, two of the elementary schools I mean I know that each elementary school is getting tested on one day so it's a snapshot for a week but really like <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2135.872s">the</a>  MISA took on the day that they do testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2139.713s">And</a>  to use that just as an example, 28% of the kids who could have been tested on that day, 103 of them didn't get tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2151.956s">And</a>  to me, it seems unreasonable to imagine that that larger portion of students <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2162.447s">we're</a>  absent, I just think that's outside the realm of possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2165.248s">Dessie</a>  would be at our door if we had 28% absenteeism. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2169.469s">So</a>  I'm just thinking, 103 students to me is not a few absent kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2175.751s">To</a>  me, it's several classrooms just didn't go get tested.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2179.552s">And</a>  I think that- I don't think that that's true, but we will look into it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2184.414s">We'll</a>  drill down on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2185.814s">But</a>  I think if there was a class that just didn't test, absent a class that's quarantined, <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2191.407s">And</a>  I don't think that that would apply to Mr. But in that particular week, but I will, I'll look at that closely.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2197.955s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2198.275s">Because</a>  I mean, I not this isn't about blame. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2201.198s">It's</a>  just about like, you know, are the nurses running out of time and the classes they're in line and now it's now it's like</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2251.425s">It</a>  is on the website, but we'll make it more accessible.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2254.009s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2255.07s">And</a>  honestly, I know it's on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2257.113s">I</a>  don't even know where it is myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2258.615s">So</a>  I will use that as a criteria to determine it needs to be more accessible.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2263.076s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2264.117s">And</a>  when students are out for the 10 days for quarantine, when they come back, do they, I know that they need a negative COVID test, but you also talked about whether or not they had something else, mono or strap or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2280.976s">Do</a>  they, do you guys require a note from their doctor when they're returning or?</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2285.125s">So</a>  if they're returning after symptoms, the required quarantine is only that of what it takes to, it's not a known 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2293.589s">It's</a>  the resolution of symptoms and seeing a doctor and being symptom free for 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2298.691s">And</a>  if they had an alternate diagnosis, so like strep or mono, we would require a doctor's note with instructions on when they can return and what is required for them to return.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2308.316s">Okay,</a>  but they don't automatically require a doctor's note is what I'm hearing.</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2311.794s">I'm</a>  sorry, I can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2312.715s">They</a>  don't automatically require a doctor's note is what I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2315.496s">If</a>  they show a negative test, they don't also need a doctor's note. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2317.978s">Some</a>  schools actually also require a primary care doctor's note. <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=2321.32s">And</a>  so I'm asking.</p>
