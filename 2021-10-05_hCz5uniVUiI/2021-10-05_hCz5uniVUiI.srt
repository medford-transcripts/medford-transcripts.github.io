[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

45
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:42,203
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nice for me to be back in the chambers with you tonight.

46
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:46,933
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm happy to share a few updates.

47
00:03:48,494 --> 00:04:03,299
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna share that some of our Mustang science teachers took the opportunity to attend a special training at the end of the summer provided by the Life Science Change Agent Teachers Program, LSCAT.

48
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:11,222
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a free week-long professional development series by Acera EI in partnership with the Medford Public Schools.

49
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:23,822
[SPEAKER_14]: This specialized training included lab activities and gene editing with CRISPR technology, microbiomics and climate change.

50
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:32,610
[SPEAKER_14]: All three units featured relevant cutting edge technology and research aligned to next generation science standards.

51
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:37,194
[SPEAKER_14]: It is my feeling that this is a great opportunity for teachers

52
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:49,346
[SPEAKER_14]: to take issues of modern science, like gene editing and climate change, and bring it into the classroom, making a positive impact on what students will be doing in the future.

53
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:58,229
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm proud that Acera EI is partnering with Medford Public Schools to bring hands-on science education to a new level.

54
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:01,890
[SPEAKER_14]: As I stated in our last meeting,

55
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:10,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford is very lucky to have such a supportive business community that assists our district.

56
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:23,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Last week, Mayor Lungo-Koehn and myself were able to visit Members Plus Credit Union and pick up 100 filled backpacks for those students who might be in need.

57
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:28,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, we would like to thank Target and Everett

58
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:49,776
[SPEAKER_14]: who donated hand sanitizer for all our schools, Goldilocks bagels for donating their locks for love, which will benefit each elementary school, and 4 Good Vibes store in South Medford, who ran an online fall craft fair, which benefited the Medford public schools.

59
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:57,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I must thank all of the merchants and other organizations who plan to play

60
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:09,463
[SPEAKER_14]: have donated prizes and or sponsored a hole for the annual Medford family network golf tournament hosted by Yoki restaurant.

61
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:16,566
[SPEAKER_14]: The tournament, one of MFN's largest fundraisers will be held next Monday, October 11th.

62
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:21,959
[SPEAKER_14]: at the Sagamore Golf Club facility in Linfield.

63
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:29,063
[SPEAKER_14]: So if anyone is interested in playing or donating a prize, please contact the Medford Family Network.

64
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,265
[SPEAKER_14]: They'd love to have you join them.

65
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:36,148
[SPEAKER_14]: I must say that our Mustang community is truly very blessed.

66
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:39,244
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a few upcoming events.

67
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:50,872
[SPEAKER_14]: This coming Wednesday, October 6th, is the International Walk, Bike to School Day and kicks off Walk, Bike to School Wednesdays this month.

68
00:06:52,593 --> 00:07:02,660
[SPEAKER_14]: These events encourage physical activity as well as promote pedestrian and bicycle safety in both our neighborhoods and all of our schools.

69
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:19,660
[SPEAKER_14]: This coming Saturday, the Medford Police Department, working together with Shiloh Baptist Church, will be hosting a free family day this Saturday, October 9th, outside in the City Hall parking lot from 10 a.m.

70
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,841
[SPEAKER_14]: to 2 p.m.

71
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:28,985
[SPEAKER_14]: This event will feature a DJ, food, a bike rodeo, car seat checks, and a unity walk.

72
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:33,607
[SPEAKER_14]: The goal of this event is to bring our community and police together

73
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Our vocational side of the house assisted the police department by producing flyers and a banner.

74
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:45,485
[SPEAKER_14]: We were glad to partner with the police on this important initiative.

75
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:51,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, October is Italian American Heritage Month.

76
00:07:53,450 --> 00:08:00,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Over 5.5 million Italians have immigrated to the United States since the 1800s.

77
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:02,835
[SPEAKER_14]: As you probably know,

78
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:15,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Our country, continent, as well as some of our neighboring continents to the south are named after an Italian explorer and geographer by the name of Amerigo Vespucci.

79
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:23,752
[SPEAKER_14]: We celebrate those of Italian heritage who have richly contributed to America and to the world.

80
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:37,392
[SPEAKER_14]: In closing, as the weather is changing and the leaves begin to fall, I hope that our Mustang families enjoy making memories, apple picking or pumpkin decorating.

81
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:42,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Take advantage of the outdoor activities while the weather cooperates.

82
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:43,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good evening.

83
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

84
00:08:51,598 --> 00:09:17,735
[SPEAKER_05]: We next up have the public health update, Director of Health Services and Assistant Superintendent of Finance Operations will report on the Medford Public Schools student and staff COVID testing program, state and district mask mandates, Medford Public Schools personnel vaccination status, contact tracing and quarantine communication protocols, and revisions to COVID-19 prevention protocols for all kindergarten classrooms.

85
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:21,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

86
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll start with the health services update about our weekly testing.

87
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:33,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Medford Public Schools continued its pooled testing surveillance last week, conducting a total of 315 pools.

88
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:38,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Of those 315 pools, there were four positive pools identified for a percent positivity rate of 1.26%.

89
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:46,300
[SPEAKER_15]: The percent positivity rate for the entire state of Massachusetts for the same week was 1.96%, so we were just below that.

90
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:53,540
[SPEAKER_15]: School nurses also saw 55 students with symptoms coming into the health offices.

91
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:00,608
[SPEAKER_15]: 40 of those students were able to be tested in the health office and school nurses found no additional positive students through their testing.

92
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:09,497
[SPEAKER_15]: The other 15 symptomatic students were unable to be tested in the nurse's office but were referred to outside testing and all were found to be negative through PCR testing.

93
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,265
[SPEAKER_15]: As a general reminder, please stay home if you're sick.

94
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:17,247
[SPEAKER_15]: We're still seeing students coming into the office with symptoms.

95
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,910
[SPEAKER_15]: As much as we want kids to be in school, we want to make sure that they're well enough to be in school.

96
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:22,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

97
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:27,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor, members of the school committee.

98
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:33,986
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some questions at our last public health date with respect to our testing program participation.

99
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:49,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your packets this week, we did provide additional information and a breakdown, both with respect to our school by school consent form completion rate, as well as what we've referred to as our actual participation rate.

100
00:10:50,777 --> 00:11:01,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actual participation rate is the percentage of students for whom consent forms have been received that are participating for each time that the testing program is run.

101
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:11,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally speaking, we were encouraged by those numbers, both with respect to consent forms that have been received and with regard to the actual participation rate.

102
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:22,748
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, there are a couple of school communities that we need to double down on the communication for in order to get our consent form consent form rates up over 90% across the board.

103
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:25,159
[SPEAKER_01]: as we had by the end of last year.

104
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:32,982
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll remember that that did take some time last year as we continue to sort of beat the testing drum over the course of the school year.

105
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:37,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I will point out one anecdote that's probably clear from the numbers that you've received.

106
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:48,208
[SPEAKER_01]: The school that we had the lowest consent form participation rate in terms of submission, we have the highest percent with respect to actual participation, which is somewhat ironic.

107
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:52,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, as you know, we'll never have 100% actual participation because

108
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:57,462
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be factor in students who are absent on a particular day, or perhaps are being quarantined.

109
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:14,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously those students are not able to participate in the program but generally speaking, we're, we're hovering in around 80%, based on the final numbers that came in after our testing program on Thursday, ended up being at about 78% of the students from we have consent forms are participating in the testing on a daily basis.

110
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:28,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of somewhat noteworthy that our high school numbers are as high as, as they are, as we talked about last year high school students having a little more independence little more agency, they have more flexibility, frankly, whether they participate or not.

111
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:37,732
[SPEAKER_01]: The mandatory participation for students involved in extracurricular programming is one of the factors we think and make sure that that number stays high.

112
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:43,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the lower grade levels, elementary, for instance, students are participating.

113
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:46,073
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole class is being walked down to the testing station.

114
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:50,015
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would expect those numbers to be high and for the most part that they are.

115
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:53,517
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions, happy to entertain them.

116
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:04,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I can move into some high level information related to vaccination rates, but won't be going into a high level of detail on those for reasons that I can explain.

117
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, I am also.

118
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:11,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Member McLaughlin, after that.

119
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:12,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

120
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:16,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I should probably read them at this point.

121
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:17,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that all right?

122
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:18,236
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

123
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,457
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is from

124
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Christina McCourty 24 North Street.

125
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:37,947
[SPEAKER_03]: She writes dear members of the school committee.

126
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:42,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the parent of two elementary school students and I'm writing with a few questions.

127
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:48,599
[SPEAKER_03]: One, at this point, is there any evidence that points to possible interschool spread of COVID-19?

128
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:58,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Watching the COVID tracker there was an increase in positive cases in a couple of buildings, and many of us are wondering if there were multiple cases in the same classroom.

129
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:06,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to take this one by one or if we could.

130
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:07,723
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

131
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:10,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mary.

132
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:13,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. To the member of the community for the question.

133
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:33,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So, last year, one of the, I think, significant points of pride that we had as an organization was that there was minimal in school transmission and for the most part, our health services department at the time concluded that there was really only one instance across the entire district, in which we said that there was a likelihood of in school transmission and

134
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:41,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I say likelihood because of course, with all these things that our statements have to be qualified because there's no definitive proof one way or another when it comes to this type of tracing.

135
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,690
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had more instances this year of suspected in school transmission.

136
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:58,993
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been concentrated and besides can go into greater detail about this probably not much greater detail for obvious reasons at the elementary school level where we have a higher population of unvaccinated individuals.

137
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:08,376
[SPEAKER_01]: The real reason I think that as a layperson that the inference you can draw is that with the occupancy restrictions being lifted, we have many more people in the building.

138
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:27,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while we have protocols in place around physical distancing, and we make a good faith effort to maintain that physical distancing and extended physical distancing during all meal periods, the reality is that we have more people, they are based on age,

139
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,955
[SPEAKER_01]: unvaccinated and they are in close proximity to one another.

140
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:36,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is definitely true that we have more evidence of in-school transmission this year than we did last year.

141
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:52,973
[SPEAKER_01]: As the committee knows, this week, this past week, as a result of a pattern that had developed at the kindergarten level, we did institute heightened protocols with respect to distancing, with respect to testing.

142
00:15:54,088 --> 00:16:00,812
[SPEAKER_01]: and a variety of other measures that were spelled out in the memo to you to essentially clamp down on our kindergarten students.

143
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:07,996
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not surprising that that's where we're seeing a concentration of positives and in-school transmission.

144
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:13,079
[SPEAKER_01]: These are students who are in a formal education environment form for the first time.

145
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously they are all unvaccinated.

146
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:18,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And while there were protocols in place at the beginning of the school year,

147
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:23,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, maybe to some degree, some of this was inevitable.

148
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:30,146
[SPEAKER_01]: We did feel that we needed to ratchet up the protocols that are in place at the elementary school level, specifically with kindergarten students.

149
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:34,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those students will be tested on a daily basis for the foreseeable future.

150
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:36,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll continue to monitor that closely.

151
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:44,557
[SPEAKER_03]: This parent goes on to say, is there any update on when buildings can transition back to testing twice per week?

152
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:55,303
[SPEAKER_03]: She mentions that she knows the kindergarten students are being tested daily and says if that's happening, she would think we could handle testing all students twice per week.

153
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:56,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you might.

154
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:02,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand where someone might make that assumption, but I would say it would be an assumption and a flawed one.

155
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:11,455
[SPEAKER_01]: We are stretching our staff and resources considerably by heightening the kindergarten testing on a daily basis.

156
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:16,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, we barely have the resources to do that.

157
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:27,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, doing school wide twice weekly testing is is for the same reason that we identified previous meeting of the school committee, not something that's feasible at this time.

158
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:28,513
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said,

159
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:40,344
[SPEAKER_01]: While there is an uptick with respect to in-school transmission this year, an important qualifying note is that there was only one instance in the entire school year last year.

160
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:47,770
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is not the case that we're seeing a dramatic rise either in positivity or in in-school transmission.

161
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:56,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the significant instructional disruption aside, all of us would prefer to test more rather than less.

162
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:00,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, if you look at the data that we're producing.

163
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:12,176
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't, at least by the standards that were established last year when we tested multiple times a week throughout the course of the year, there isn't frankly an urgent need to increase the amount of testing we have district wide.

164
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:17,002
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, like all things being equal, we would

165
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:22,429
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer to swab everyone's nose on the way in the door and just make that a matter of routine.

166
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:33,453
[SPEAKER_01]: But based on the resources that we have, we felt that concentrating them with the kindergarten students right now was most consistent with the data that we were seeing coming out of the testing program.

167
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:40,508
[SPEAKER_03]: The third part of the email is, some first grade students have begun unmasking in class for phonics lessons.

168
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:46,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Though this was briefly mentioned in an email communication, no details have been given on what this looks like.

169
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:52,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a right to know what risks our students are taking and which health professionals weighed in on this decision.

170
00:18:53,077 --> 00:19:00,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Going forward, can someone from the district please give a detailed description of unmasked situations that have been deemed to be necessary for instruction?

171
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:03,048
[SPEAKER_03]: before they happen for the first time.

172
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:16,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Any unmasking brings risks, and I think families have the right to know of any increased risks they are facing at school so we can reflect on it, ask questions, and determine whether we decide if the risk is acceptable to us.

173
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:25,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Many students are also anxious about being unmasked indoors, and knowing in advance would give us caretakers the ability to prepare them and discuss it in a safe place.

174
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:31,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with respect to the specific phonics lesson at third grade I'm going to defer for the time being we'll, we'll follow up with the committee.

175
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:40,091
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds as though there was a communication that went out related to that and as we discussed at the beginning of the year from an instructional perspective there are certain times in which.

176
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,484
[SPEAKER_01]: different protocols will have to be followed, generally speaking that involves either shields or additional distancing.

177
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,647
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to mitigate any risk that is absorbed.

178
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:55,811
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to be clear, just to speak on a more general basis.

179
00:19:56,392 --> 00:20:02,057
[SPEAKER_01]: We are balancing the educational interests of students with the public health risks of students in the community.

180
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:04,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Every hour of every day.

181
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:24,744
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no decision related to the operation of the Metro schools or frankly any other school district in which there is not some degree of balancing that's taking place, similar to in the professional world, people are going into work in our resuming in person activities and so I think it's important that we communicate and be as clear as possible.

182
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:27,405
[SPEAKER_01]: and as transparent as possible.

183
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:36,048
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the ways we do that I think is acknowledging the fact that there's there about this balancing taking place and there's going to be the remainder of the school year.

184
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:41,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll turn to the next person.

185
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:45,132
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is Ingrid Moncada 131 virgin have.

186
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:59,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few questions regarding COVID protocols at MPS, and she writes in parentheses, a comprehensive document with MPS current policies would be ideal, so we'd have to keep asking questions.

187
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:07,010
[SPEAKER_03]: One, what's the data that supports the decision of testing kindergarten in such a different way than the rest of the students?

188
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:09,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Why now?

189
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there evidence of in-school transmissions?

190
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:28,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer to that is yes, as I said previously, and the pattern and the data was that we had our fifth kindergarten class that was required to transition into temporary virtual learning because of positivity in the class and close contacts.

191
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:34,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, just speaking in a very practical sense, it is challenging to determine

192
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:39,686
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst a group of five-year-olds who have never been in school exactly who the close contacts are.

193
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:49,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And while sometimes we have concrete evidence and we can say that's exactly what happened, this is exactly the protocol we have to follow, sometimes we have to err on the side of caution, which is what we did.

194
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:55,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the fifth time we did it, we determined that we were going to have to revamp the protocols that were put in place to keep students safe.

195
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:58,100
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to the document, we have that document.

196
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it does need to be recirculated, and that's something we'll work on during this week's communication.

197
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:06,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this one touches on what you've just talked about.

198
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:09,409
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the criteria for quarantining a whole class?

199
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:12,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because the whole class is considered close contact?

200
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,830
[SPEAKER_03]: How can that happen?

201
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,750
[SPEAKER_03]: How often does that happen?

202
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it only in kindergarten classes?

203
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:21,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not by rule, it's only in kindergarten classes, it would happen where it happens.

204
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:25,173
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year, it's only happened in kindergarten.

205
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:25,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that

206
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:42,725
[SPEAKER_01]: The conclusion that we drew was that that's not a coincidence that if it had happened only in fifth grade, you probably would have drawn a different conclusion and probably needed to kindergarten, you have students that are in a brand new environment.

207
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:50,088
[SPEAKER_01]: and teachers who are working tirelessly to try to provide them with as normal an experience as possible.

208
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,470
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in any way a reflection on the staff.

209
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:58,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a reflection on what it's like to manage 18 to 21 five-year-olds.

210
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,595
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing against the five-year-olds.

211
00:23:02,655 --> 00:23:05,536
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, we're watching it.

212
00:23:05,576 --> 00:23:11,580
[SPEAKER_01]: We are operating within the circumstances that

213
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:13,646
[SPEAKER_01]: being dictated to us.

214
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:19,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Part three, what are the guidelines for students returning to school after being sick at home.

215
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:25,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard reports of people having to provide proof of coven negative and pay for a private PCR test.

216
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:32,970
[SPEAKER_03]: before being accepted back in school, and others that are not told anything, and just bring the kids back as soon as they feel better.

217
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to defer to Miss signs with regard to the specific protocols and pointing, I will just.

218
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:43,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to say, note this for the committee that, well, I think it's important that we answer as many questions as we can.

219
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:53,416
[SPEAKER_01]: There are times when someone could draw an inference that something is happening with regularity, that it's not.

220
00:23:53,996 --> 00:24:13,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the only thing you know about the Medford Public Schools and the work that we're doing to keep students and staff safe from COVID-19 is that a report that there was some inconsistency with regard to communication, I think that would not truly reflect the consistency and the thoroughness with which we've executed these protocols.

221
00:24:14,348 --> 00:24:20,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to put that disqualifier out there because I do think that there could be disproportionate conclusions drawn.

222
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:30,083
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is the only piece of information that the public has but I think the science can speak to the specifics with regard to how the quarantine works and their communication or close contacts.

223
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:35,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, so if we have student or staff that is symptomatic, obviously we would like to know about it.

224
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,162
[SPEAKER_15]: That is how we are able to tell you what is required to come back to school.

225
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:48,530
[SPEAKER_15]: We are finding that some parents and students, they make the decision to get their own PCR test without speaking to a nurse and then tell us after the fact.

226
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:49,770
[SPEAKER_15]: That's also great.

227
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,711
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure we're getting that PCR test if we're having symptoms related to COVID.

228
00:24:53,971 --> 00:25:01,613
[SPEAKER_15]: But we would like to know beforehand, because we also want to make sure that students are symptom free for 24 hours before returning to school without the use of medicine.

229
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:04,394
[SPEAKER_15]: So you know, no Tylenol, Ibuprofen, that would bring a fever down.

230
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,135
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure that your body is naturally returning to its

231
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:08,584
[SPEAKER_15]: baseline state of health.

232
00:25:09,264 --> 00:25:17,829
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we also want to make sure that you spoke to your primary care physician and made sure that there wasn't anything else going on you know they're still strep throat, they're still mono they're still the flu.

233
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:22,712
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure that you were seen by a health care provider before returning to school because there are other things.

234
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:24,553
[SPEAKER_15]: that it could be and not just COVID.

235
00:25:25,153 --> 00:25:36,338
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of a COVID PCR test, the school nurses have a laundry list of available testing sites that offer free PCR tests, so please use your building-based nurses as a resource.

236
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:37,219
[SPEAKER_15]: We're here to help you.

237
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:52,546
[SPEAKER_15]: We have those lists printed out and ready to hand out or email to families as needed, but the requirement really is if you're having any of those symptoms, you need to be symptom-free for 24 hours before returning to school, have a negative PCR test, and have reached out to your primary health care provider.

238
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:54,396
[SPEAKER_15]: make sure that you're good to come back.

239
00:25:56,218 --> 00:26:06,387
[SPEAKER_03]: The parent goes on to say, has the district or city considered providing free COVID testing for NPS families at schools after hours City Hall or other Medford location.

240
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:11,112
[SPEAKER_03]: If families are indeed required to provide proof of negative test before returning to school.

241
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,453
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be essential.

242
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:28,136
[SPEAKER_01]: We did consider last year having a satellite location for situations like this at the time that was primarily focused on staff, because of the staffing challenges that we were facing given the number of staff that were out on either short or long term basis.

243
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:42,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that it is something we can that we could consider but it's it's not an easy lift and as I said, we're relatively stretched with respect to resources, and I say that I'm referring more to human capital than financial

244
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:44,806
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly, in this particular instance.

245
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:50,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's something we could consider, but it's something that we'd have to look at pretty closely.

246
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:56,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't say with certainty that it's something we'd be able to execute in a way that will truly be effective.

247
00:26:57,131 --> 00:27:00,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick example, we might be able to do something like that once a week.

248
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:12,680
[SPEAKER_01]: but so much of the protocols are tied to specific timelines that we would end up in a situation in which we're making it very easy for families who have a student who tested positive on a Tuesday.

249
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:17,424
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you tested positive on a Wednesday through Friday, we wouldn't be able to help.

250
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:27,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the type of inconsistency or inequity that we're trying to take out of the system as opposed to perpetuate it.

251
00:27:27,551 --> 00:27:29,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a satellite location for families

252
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:37,759
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I think we might want to speak with the Board of Health about, since I think in many respects, it's more of a, it would be a community service as opposed to a school-based one.

253
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:41,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's worthy of consideration, but I think one that we'd have to look at.

254
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:47,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say again, if you look at our numbers, we're in a relatively good spot.

255
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:51,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, well, you know, we have to take all of these seriously.

256
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:52,167
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be vigilant.

257
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:53,347
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to maintain the protocols.

258
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:54,228
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do all of that.

259
00:27:55,768 --> 00:28:00,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we're nowhere close to where we were

260
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:02,483
[SPEAKER_01]: a year ago, certainly.

261
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:08,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some respects, the numbers are trending in a positive direction.

262
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:15,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what makes sense for us right now in terms of the use of resources may not make sense six weeks from now.

263
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:19,940
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things we'd have to take into account as we look at it.

264
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:22,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

265
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:24,344
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the letters that I received.

266
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:27,453
[SPEAKER_03]: on the school committee mailbox.

267
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:31,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we were gonna touch base on vaccination status, but if there are any other testing related.

268
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:32,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz?

269
00:28:40,503 --> 00:28:41,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Kreatz, oh, there you go.

270
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:44,406
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on.

271
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:45,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

272
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:49,390
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to find the consent form on the website.

273
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the superintendent includes it in her weekly letter.

274
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:54,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any way to put

275
00:28:54,872 --> 00:28:59,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a special button on the website with the link to all the corporate information.

276
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:13,546
[SPEAKER_00]: The consent form the Testing program frequently asked questions testing program schedule things like that short answer is yes, and it is located, but I think.

277
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,370
[SPEAKER_01]: we can make it more easily accessible.

278
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:24,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think your suggestion about concentrating some of the materials in a place that's slightly easier to find, I think we can make improvements there.

279
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:26,713
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can commit to that within the next 24 to 48 hours.

280
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:27,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

281
00:29:29,814 --> 00:29:30,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

282
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:31,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

283
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:41,337
[SPEAKER_11]: If a student has symptoms but cannot be tested since they don't have a consent form, are they isolated and sent home immediately?

284
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

285
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:50,075
[SPEAKER_15]: So first and foremost, our nurses would also try and reach the parent and get a verbal consent because they will have to be dismissed ASAP.

286
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:53,898
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the parent could physically sign the consent when they come for the dismissal.

287
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So we always try and get that consent.

288
00:29:56,199 --> 00:30:08,868
[SPEAKER_15]: If a parent is not willing to give consent for school, they are dismissed immediately after being isolated and, you know, assessed by a nurse to make sure they're safe to go home and not to another provider, like say being transported to the ER or what have you.

289
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:17,453
[SPEAKER_15]: They would be immediately dismissed after isolated and being with a nurse and referred to outside testing if they do not consent to in school testing.

290
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:18,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.

291
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:21,215
[SPEAKER_11]: And you answered my next question, which is great.

292
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:30,280
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we handling a positive student that was positive in school who has siblings in another classroom or in a different school?

293
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,881
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we contact tracing that?

294
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:43,757
[SPEAKER_15]: So for a student that is positive and has siblings in another school or in another classroom, which happens quite frequently in this district, they are then considered close contacts to their positive sibling.

295
00:30:44,498 --> 00:30:53,122
[SPEAKER_15]: And they would follow the same quarantine guidelines as anyone else where we would request that you get tested day five after your last day of exposure.

296
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:55,524
[SPEAKER_15]: or sooner if you have symptoms.

297
00:30:56,024 --> 00:31:07,313
[SPEAKER_15]: And then depending on that test result, if the siblings are 18 and five, they might not have that much interaction, might have separate bedrooms and the sibling might actually not become positive.

298
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:09,695
[SPEAKER_15]: And after their quarantine, they're able to return to school.

299
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:22,185
[SPEAKER_15]: But it might also be the case that that student then becomes positive and they start a 10 day isolation, but they would be in that quarantine period at home in a separate area from their positive sibling until they were determined safe to come back to school.

300
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:23,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.

301
00:31:24,168 --> 00:31:35,057
[SPEAKER_11]: So if it was a five-year-old who tested positive and there's a seven-year-old, I mean, not all five-year-olds and seven-year-olds are rough and tumble all day long, but a lot of them probably are.

302
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:47,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And so would we immediately, assuming we have consents, of course, would we immediately be testing that seven-year-old before the day's out so we could do close contacts on that classroom?

303
00:31:48,457 --> 00:32:00,540
[SPEAKER_15]: It really is a case by case basis, depending on the age and the interaction of the students and the siblings and what their contacts in school might also be and if you know they were seen in the nursing office two days prior for a little runny nose that.

304
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:09,332
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, subsided after half an hour, we really look at each individual case very closely and make a nursing decision on that.

305
00:32:09,953 --> 00:32:11,454
[SPEAKER_15]: And we usually err on the side of caution.

306
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:21,840
[SPEAKER_15]: So there have been instances where a sibling tested positive or a parent that's also a staff member test positive, and we're testing those kids before we even send them out of the building, just to make sure we're doing our due diligence.

307
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,901
[SPEAKER_15]: That has happened on multiple occasions already this school year.

308
00:32:25,101 --> 00:32:25,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

309
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:26,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

310
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:27,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my last question is, um,

311
00:32:29,856 --> 00:32:33,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was really surprised we could ramp up the daily kindergarten testing.

312
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:42,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I was happy with the memo, but my first thought was we still don't have cloning technology to duplicate the nurses.

313
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:45,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nurses were surprised we could do that too.

314
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:47,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

315
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:51,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, just trying to make light of what I'm sure is not a polite situation.

316
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:58,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Have we considered, you know, I know that I was reading something in, I don't know if it was the Globe or the New York Times about

317
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:08,376
[SPEAKER_11]: The very active traveling nurse programs that are out there, nurses can, frankly, traveling nurses right now can pretty much write their own checks.

318
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:15,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Have we considered, it sounds like we're at the edge of staffing.

319
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:26,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, when I looked at the testing numbers, one of the things about the elementary school, so in the elementary grades, I sort of think of the students as captives,

320
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:30,499
[SPEAKER_11]: the whole classroom goes to get tested, right?

321
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:38,404
[SPEAKER_11]: So if 90% of those students have a consent, then 90% of those students should get tested.

322
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:52,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at the numbers that we got, unless we have a 25% absenteeism in elementary, which I think is not realistic, it looks to me like whole classes just didn't go get tested.

323
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of caveats there.

324
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:58,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize, I should have said this at the outset.

325
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:02,076
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual participation numbers are a snapshot.

326
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:14,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So the numbers that were represented to you with respect to actual participation were for last week, September 27th till October 1st.

327
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So three days of testing.

328
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So in an elementary school, if you take the students that happen to be absent for that day,

329
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:28,087
[SPEAKER_01]: and a class perhaps the students that are quarantined because they're close contacts.

330
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:37,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine a few outliers along the lines of the class went down and the student was out of class getting services.

331
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:39,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we had anyone like in the restroom or anything along those lines.

332
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:45,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually we'd get them before we head down to the testing site, but like there could be some outliers like that.

333
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:48,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's generally what should represent that number.

334
00:34:48,717 --> 00:34:50,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't disagree that if it's at 25% of elementary school,

335
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:56,904
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be another variable and it's something that we can dig into the data on a little bit more.

336
00:34:57,384 --> 00:35:13,638
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should know that this represents a single week of actual participation and we intend at the end of October, assuming that, you know, and I think we will be that our program, our testing program is still operating at the same capacity and with the same frequency and so on and so forth.

337
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:25,915
[SPEAKER_01]: will take another snapshot and that this is essentially baseline data to determine whether or not additional communication efforts and drilling down on exactly the point that you raised can can remedy those numbers to some degree.

338
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

339
00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:35,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, you know, two of the elementary schools I mean I know that each elementary school is getting tested on one day so it's a snapshot for a week but really like

340
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:39,133
[SPEAKER_11]: the MISA took on the day that they do testing.

341
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:50,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And to use that just as an example, 28% of the kids who could have been tested on that day, 103 of them didn't get tested.

342
00:35:51,956 --> 00:36:00,378
[SPEAKER_11]: And to me, it seems unreasonable to imagine that that larger portion of students

343
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:05,208
[SPEAKER_11]: we're absent, I just think that's outside the realm of possibility.

344
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Dessie would be at our door if we had 28% absenteeism.

345
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:15,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just thinking, 103 students to me is not a few absent kids.

346
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:19,012
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it's several classrooms just didn't go get tested.

347
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that- I don't think that that's true, but we will look into it more.

348
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:25,414
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll drill down on it.

349
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:30,616
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if there was a class that just didn't test, absent a class that's quarantined,

350
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:37,714
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that that would apply to Mr. But in that particular week, but I will, I'll look at that closely.

351
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:38,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

352
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:41,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I mean, I not this isn't about blame.

353
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:47,005
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just about like, you know, are the nurses running out of time and the classes they're in line and now it's now it's like

354
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:03,879
[SPEAKER_01]: more closely and report back.

355
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:04,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

356
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

357
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:09,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor.

358
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:09,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

359
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:10,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

360
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:12,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

361
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have a couple of questions.

362
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:23,255
[SPEAKER_09]: For the comprehensive documentation of the COVID protocols, that is on the website?

363
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

364
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:29,140
[SPEAKER_09]: The comprehensive protocol for the COVID protocol?

365
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:29,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

366
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:30,381
[SPEAKER_09]: On the website?

367
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:33,728
[SPEAKER_01]: It is on the website, but we'll make it more accessible.

368
00:37:34,009 --> 00:37:34,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

369
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I know it's on the website.

370
00:37:37,113 --> 00:37:38,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know where it is myself.

371
00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:42,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will use that as a criteria to determine it needs to be more accessible.

372
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:43,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

373
00:37:44,117 --> 00:38:00,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And when students are out for the 10 days for quarantine, when they come back, do they, I know that they need a negative COVID test, but you also talked about whether or not they had something else, mono or strap or anything like that.

374
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:04,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they, do you guys require a note from their doctor when they're returning or?

375
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:13,469
[SPEAKER_15]: So if they're returning after symptoms, the required quarantine is only that of what it takes to, it's not a known 10 days.

376
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:18,011
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the resolution of symptoms and seeing a doctor and being symptom free for 24 hours.

377
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:27,735
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they had an alternate diagnosis, so like strep or mono, we would require a doctor's note with instructions on when they can return and what is required for them to return.

378
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:31,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but they don't automatically require a doctor's note is what I'm hearing.

379
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:32,695
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

380
00:38:32,715 --> 00:38:35,376
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't automatically require a doctor's note is what I'm hearing.

381
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:37,918
[SPEAKER_09]: If they show a negative test, they don't also need a doctor's note.

382
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:41,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Some schools actually also require a primary care doctor's note.

383
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,980
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm asking.

384
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,163
[SPEAKER_15]: They need to show proof that they reached out to their primary care physician and sought care.

385
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:48,484
[SPEAKER_09]: They do need a doctor's note then.

386
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:48,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

387
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:50,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

388
00:38:52,566 --> 00:38:56,608
[SPEAKER_09]: And regarding the data, have we dug deeper in the participation rates?

389
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:58,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you said you were gonna look into some of the disaggregation

390
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:16,325
[SPEAKER_09]: of what Member Ruseau was pointing out regarding absenteeism, but just in terms of the participation rate, I know that we have one or two buildings that have lower participation rate, and just wondering if there's any reason behind that, any narrative that you guys might be able to look into, or?

391
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:28,354
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is a snapshot from last week, and we have not, between last week and tonight, dug more deeply than what we've reported on tonight.

392
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:33,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it just would be good to know, especially if we see this disparity in the numbers ongoing, like, you know.

393
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:37,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wouldn't say it's ongoing, respectfully, because it's a snapshot from one week.

394
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:43,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand, but a snapshot over time will start to tell relevant data if it's the same.

395
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:51,243
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really what I'm wondering is how, if we continue to see low participation rate or lower at a particular school, it would be helpful for us to know why.

396
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:52,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a matter of translation?

397
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a matter of, you know, just anything?

398
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:55,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but I think it's worth asking.

399
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:01,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 100% worth asking just I just want to be clear that the data in front of you is just a snapshot.

400
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:02,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand.

401
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:18,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a baseline data that we intend to scrutinize thoroughly and identify whatever the reason is, because it's not going to be acceptable for there to be a discrepancy between the percentage of consent forms submitted

402
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:24,308
[SPEAKER_01]: and actual participation, because the class is being walked down to the testing site.

403
00:40:24,848 --> 00:40:27,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be, as far as I'm concerned, there won't be a discrepancy.

404
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's incumbent upon each school community to ensure that that's the case.

405
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:36,894
[SPEAKER_09]: So are we going to get baseline data over some time?

406
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:38,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, say again.

407
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:45,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Will there be baseline data that you'll be providing to us over an extended amount of time instead of just a snapshot in time?

408
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:50,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to be taking multiple snapshots to essentially provide baseline data or?

409
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:54,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the snapshot is the baseline data.

410
00:40:54,596 --> 00:40:56,617
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we have now from last week.

411
00:40:56,777 --> 00:40:57,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

412
00:40:57,237 --> 00:41:03,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We, at the end of October, intend to take another snapshot to determine if there are any discrepancies, how we've narrowed them.

413
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:04,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

414
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:05,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So then we'll do a comparison of the two.

415
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:06,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

416
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:06,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

417
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:21,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for students who are receiving special education supports and services and have to be quarantined as a close contact, what are we offering to them in terms of services and supports?

418
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:23,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they getting in-home services?

419
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:25,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they getting compensatory services?

420
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:27,884
[SPEAKER_09]: What's happening with those services?

421
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:44,658
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be the same as if they're missing school or any services, then we will offer the same compensatory services that we would if the student were absent or if for some reason the district was unable to provide the services during a specific duration of time.

422
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:47,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So all obligations will be met.

423
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:56,083
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of home tutoring or work being sent home, I think we referenced that previously that

424
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:03,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, the conditions are the same as they would have been in a pre-COVID context.

425
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:14,044
[SPEAKER_01]: If a student were out due to strep throat or to the flu or to a family emergency, the school is responsible for making sure that that student, that family have access to what information they need.

426
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:24,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also add that our teachers and staff have been thus far extraordinarily accommodating

427
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:33,662
[SPEAKER_01]: when we've had situations when we have had to either transition across to temporarily virtual learning or have had students that are quarantined.

428
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:50,307
[SPEAKER_01]: including situations in which there were families, for whatever reason, unable to make some of the in-person curriculum and welcome back nights, the teachers through their representatives readily agreed to ensure additional communication was sent home and make sure that any materials are there.

429
00:42:50,347 --> 00:42:55,269
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just sort of one example of how we've kept families in the loop.

430
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:03,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And that same effort, I think that's reflective of the effort that's gone in to situations in which students have been quarantined.

431
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

432
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:07,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually asking about special education services though.

433
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,171
[SPEAKER_09]: So like speech, OT, PT.

434
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:18,996
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, if it's on a student's IEP, that they're supposed to receive speech three times a week, but they're out for 10 days because they're being quarantined as a close contact.

435
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:25,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Will the school be offering compensatory services so that those students then get the three speech sessions that they missed?

436
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Or will there be in-home services for the three speech sessions, for example, that they did not receive?

437
00:43:32,614 --> 00:43:38,897
[SPEAKER_01]: miss bone can speak to the specifics but as i said at the beginning all the services will be provided yeah so there will be compensatory thank you

438
00:43:43,408 --> 00:43:45,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be compensatory services.

439
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:52,497
[SPEAKER_04]: If a student is home with COVID, we're not going to be sending staff in there, but we are all looking at providing them work.

440
00:43:53,097 --> 00:44:02,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also the teachers will be checking in with students during office hours as well, but we will be keeping track of any compensatory services that are owed.

441
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:06,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so for PT, OT and speech, Ms.

442
00:44:06,718 --> 00:44:12,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen, they're not coming into the home if they're testing negative but still have to quarantine?

443
00:44:12,823 --> 00:44:13,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

444
00:44:13,504 --> 00:44:14,265
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not coming into the home?

445
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:15,005
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going into the home.

446
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,088
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not offering any remote or Zoom for those?

447
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:21,651
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends, but it depends on the schedule.

448
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:23,612
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have them stream in.

449
00:44:23,753 --> 00:44:27,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends if it's a one-to-one, they may be reaching out to the family to do that.

450
00:44:28,056 --> 00:44:31,019
[SPEAKER_04]: But if not, then they will receive compensatory services.

451
00:44:31,494 --> 00:44:35,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so there are some instances where families are receiving remote services.

452
00:44:35,796 --> 00:44:37,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not aware of any at this point.

453
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:38,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

454
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:43,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but we, we look at it, you know, case by case situation.

455
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:43,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

456
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,260
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's an opportunity for that.

457
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:58,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Should the students require it due to regression or any of the other things that were, you know, compensatory services would come into place and we are looking at how to provide that maybe after school extended school day, that sort of thing.

458
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:58,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

459
00:44:58,426 --> 00:44:59,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

460
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:01,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, okay.

461
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:05,416
[SPEAKER_09]: And what would that look like after school or extended school day if they're in quarantine?

462
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm, I'm talking about after quarantine.

463
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:13,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they're back in school for the compensatory services, when they're back in the school setting.

464
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:14,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

465
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:15,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

466
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:16,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

467
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:16,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

468
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:32,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually maybe it's more of a statement, I would like to make sure that the principles are aware that we are expecting them to.

469
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:47,645
[SPEAKER_08]: get their numbers up from a participation perspective and asking, I'd like to ask that all the principals figure out what they need to do to reach their building communities and make that happen so that we are not seeing participation numbers this low.

470
00:45:47,665 --> 00:45:53,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like you can almost understand the kindergarten families coming in, not being used to this.

471
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,991
[SPEAKER_08]: feeling like they're a little bit lost.

472
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And we talked about that last time.

473
00:45:57,872 --> 00:46:05,455
[SPEAKER_08]: So I assume some additional outreach is happening there, but every other student in Medford Public Schools has been through this rodeo for an entire year.

474
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:15,839
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would, for the most part, with the exception of our remote students, but these percentages, they're not great.

475
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanna make sure that the next time we see this report,

476
00:46:20,062 --> 00:46:26,143
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel much much better like we did last year about the number of students participating because that is the only way we can.

477
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:38,131
[SPEAKER_08]: rely on our testing program to keep all of our students safe, to keep our staff safe, and to sort of make our way through this year without additional in-school spread.

478
00:46:38,271 --> 00:46:42,715
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really think we need to focus on this.

479
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:47,779
[SPEAKER_08]: There are buildings whose numbers are exactly where I would sort of expect them to be.

480
00:46:47,879 --> 00:46:53,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they have tips and tricks, I would encourage others to reach out to those principals and find out what they're doing that's making

481
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:06,453
[SPEAKER_08]: making them so successful, but I really do want to see these numbers back to where they were by the by the end of October, at a minimum, I mean it's been you know it's already been over a month that we've been in school, so I think we can.

482
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:20,827
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to focus on this as a community because it's the only way through this that I can see until such time as our vaccination rates go up dramatically and we're not seeing that happen yet either.

483
00:47:20,948 --> 00:47:27,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really do need the principals to rise to the challenge here and make it happen.

484
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:28,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ms.

485
00:47:28,173 --> 00:47:28,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Graham.

486
00:47:28,353 --> 00:47:31,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there's an awareness of the priority.

487
00:47:31,075 --> 00:47:34,558
[SPEAKER_01]: The only two points that I would add are one,

488
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:39,050
[SPEAKER_01]: While our participation rate was very high last year, it did take some time to get there.

489
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's worth noting.

490
00:47:42,132 --> 00:48:03,245
[SPEAKER_01]: The other piece that I would say is that without characterizing any individual decision, which is a decision of each family as to whether to participate or not, there's probably more of a discernible constituency of individuals who are eager to not participate

491
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:07,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I fully adhere to COVID protocols.

492
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:08,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something that's true in society.

493
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's true in each community.

494
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:16,456
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a reason to not continue to be persistent and to push because I think you're right.

495
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:23,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is both critically important and a responsibility, as you say, that as a community we have to each other to make sure that participation is where we need it to be.

496
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:35,227
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is a challenge that I think was less present when we were operating last year in what was considered to be more the throes of the pandemic.

497
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, may I ask another question?

498
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:41,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

499
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:42,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

500
00:48:42,872 --> 00:48:54,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I am wondering about also the consent forms and whether they're being sent home hard copy and backpacks, because I think there are families that don't have printers and or whether the consent forms are also translated for families that need them.

501
00:48:54,761 --> 00:49:05,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes to translations and yes to backpacks, although I think that's something, particularly with the backpacks, I think that, I think it's something we can consider again.

502
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,394
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of an implementation issue there, but not one that I think is insurmountable.

503
00:49:11,576 --> 00:49:14,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they haven't gone home in backpacks, they will.

504
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:15,399
[SPEAKER_01]: They have gone home in backpacks.

505
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,161
[SPEAKER_01]: They have absolutely gone home in backpacks.

506
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we can look to

507
00:49:23,102 --> 00:49:34,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can look to do that again I would be hesitant to send them out to all 4000 students again because as you can see the numbers, the majority have already sent it back and submitted another group.

508
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:41,674
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't have the exact number on have communicated an affirmative desire to not participate in the testing.

509
00:49:42,234 --> 00:49:48,455
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is, that's why I say that there is a, that's more of a discernible constituency than that was the case last year.

510
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:56,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we're not gonna get to 100% absent people changing their mind and expressing a different view of that, which they have a right to do.

511
00:49:56,757 --> 00:50:00,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they will, I hope they'll reconsider, but that's their right.

512
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:04,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we can, wanting to,

513
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:16,312
[SPEAKER_01]: target the backpack approach to the to the constituency for whom we don't have consent, I think is something we should consider, but it's not the case that they have not already been sent.

514
00:50:18,895 --> 00:50:19,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

515
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:26,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, Medford Public Schools 2021-2022 Student Enrollment Report.

516
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:41,092
[SPEAKER_05]: District administrators will report on the status of the Medford Public Schools student enrollment by school and grade level, as well as current projects with respect to parochial school enrollment, charter school enrollment, and out-of-district placements.

517
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:43,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

518
00:50:43,813 --> 00:50:46,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a annual presentation.

519
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:48,154
[SPEAKER_01]: As I understand, it's annual.

520
00:50:48,174 --> 00:50:50,895
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly annual in most communities where we

521
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:58,827
[SPEAKER_01]: take our October 1st data with respect to enrollment and share that with the community, the committee and the community.

522
00:50:59,988 --> 00:51:15,081
[SPEAKER_01]: The nature of the October 1st snapshot, which is determined by the state and is essentially a reporting requirement that all districts have to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is again, I know we're using this term a lot tonight, but it is a snapshot.

523
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:15,722
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a

524
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:30,020
[SPEAKER_01]: snapshot that fluctuates a great deal, or the numbers at least fluctuate subsequent to the snapshot, such that the numbers that you received on Friday, just after we made this submission to Desi aren't even exactly accurate.

525
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:45,232
[SPEAKER_01]: As we speak tonight and they won't be accurate, the ones that if we report them now they won't be accurate tomorrow, and they will continue to fluctuate as, as that happens throughout the course of the month of October but for purposes of state funding and a variety of other

526
00:51:46,753 --> 00:51:49,694
[SPEAKER_01]: state matters, the October 1 numbers are the ones that will report.

527
00:51:50,294 --> 00:51:55,255
[SPEAKER_01]: You have other data and there's other data that we're able to share tonight that don't necessarily aren't necessarily tied to October 1.

528
00:51:55,575 --> 00:52:03,177
[SPEAKER_01]: They include the charter school numbers which will will also fluctuate, and the private and parochial school numbers that we can report on.

529
00:52:04,138 --> 00:52:08,939
[SPEAKER_01]: As of this past January, which would be of

530
00:52:11,105 --> 00:52:31,772
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of relative value in a normal year, but this year, with so many families making decisions based on COVID protocols and some of the other changes that we've seen in our community and across the country and around the world over the last 12 to 18 months, there's sort of a limitation as to what conclusions we can draw.

531
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:35,513
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of high-level headlines and things that are important to note,

532
00:52:36,273 --> 00:52:38,575
[SPEAKER_01]: performance phone walks through our out of district numbers.

533
00:52:39,216 --> 00:52:50,807
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that we've seen a notice noticeable expected, and a number that we're happy to see on the upswing and our kindergarten numbers.

534
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:57,814
[SPEAKER_01]: The committee knows that just prior to the opening of the school or perhaps maybe a few weeks before the opening of school we did

535
00:52:58,388 --> 00:53:06,454
[SPEAKER_01]: open three additional kindergarten strands across three of our four elementary schools to keep those numbers in line with what we were hoping for.

536
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:06,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

537
00:53:07,155 --> 00:53:10,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Galussi reported on that during the first meeting.

538
00:53:11,558 --> 00:53:15,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Other fluctuations are largely attributable to internal programming decisions.

539
00:53:16,482 --> 00:53:24,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Teixeira, either in your last meeting or the week before, maybe it was the last meeting, reported on some of the changes in the EL program.

540
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:35,650
[SPEAKER_01]: which had an impact on the overall enrollment at the Roberts elementary school changes in recent years related to the meat program has had an effect on numbers at the high school.

541
00:53:37,212 --> 00:53:45,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally speaking, everything else remains fairly consistent and stable and miss bones going to walk you through

542
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:58,761
[SPEAKER_01]: the out-of-district numbers, and we'll be happy to answer any questions you have to the best of our ability, understanding, again, that a lot of these numbers are fluid and there may be a few instances in which we'll just be letting you know that we'll be reporting back to you in greater detail at a later date.

543
00:53:58,881 --> 00:53:59,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

544
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:07,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening Mayor members of the school committee so the current number of out of district enrollment is 35 students.

545
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:16,926
[SPEAKER_04]: These are students that have been placed in out of district programming, based on a higher level of need or specialized programming.

546
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:24,698
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a team decision that's made by team members special education coordinators.

547
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times the district will enter in a cost share agreement with either Department of Children and Family or Department of Mental Health, or Medford, the city of Medford will be responsible for that full tuition.

548
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:54,744
[SPEAKER_04]: That for public school staff continue to be involved in the students programming our evaluation team leaders attend annual review meetings, they monitor the out of district placement to ensure that the student is getting their needs met and the educational opportunities.

549
00:54:55,965 --> 00:55:05,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have a discussion at every annual review meeting about the least restrictive setting and how we can bring our students back into the public school setting when they're ready to.

550
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,391
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an ongoing discussion that takes place.

551
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:24,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Our numbers fluctuate year to year based on the amount of students that require out-of-district programming, but we also have students that may be in an out-of-district program till they age out at the age of 22.

552
00:55:26,183 --> 00:55:29,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have provided you with a list of our current out of district programming.

553
00:55:30,386 --> 00:55:33,268
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.

554
00:55:37,131 --> 00:55:37,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

555
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:39,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

556
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:40,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

557
00:55:40,793 --> 00:55:41,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for this report, Ms.

558
00:55:41,834 --> 00:55:42,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen.

559
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:48,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I am wondering if there is any cost analysis attached to these 35.

560
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:51,440
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is.

561
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the budgeted amount was 1.150.

562
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:59,047
[SPEAKER_04]: One point about $1.2 million for the 35 out of district placements.

563
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:00,708
[SPEAKER_04]: $1.5 million for the out of district placements.

564
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And for, I'm sorry, 1.2, 1.2, sorry.

565
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:03,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

566
00:56:19,595 --> 00:56:22,599
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the least restrictive environment.

567
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:33,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the students remain Medford public school students, and I am wondering, in addition to considering how to provide the least restrictive environment for them by.

568
00:56:35,214 --> 00:56:39,557
[SPEAKER_09]: providing opportunities within returning to Medford public schools.

569
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:44,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that they're also allowed or should be involved in the life of the school.

570
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:50,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So each of the out-of-district students is actually assigned to one of the public schools in Medford.

571
00:56:50,384 --> 00:56:53,226
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they have a principal and administration there.

572
00:56:53,306 --> 00:57:02,932
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they're able to access the life of the school between field trips, dances, after school activities, anything like that.

573
00:57:03,452 --> 00:57:05,273
[SPEAKER_09]: So who would coordinate that?

574
00:57:05,453 --> 00:57:26,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we do at the beginning, we started this two years ago, I believe, or last year, actually, two years ago, we have the evaluation team leaders who are the case managers for the other district students, reach out to the parents to talk about, do you want to receive district communication, you're assigned to this med for public school, what sort of communications do you want?

575
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:27,900
[SPEAKER_04]: How often?

576
00:57:30,215 --> 00:57:51,611
[SPEAKER_04]: They get the list we provide it to the principles the principles, add these families to the communication list and they receive any school communication, open houses, all the activities and after school clubs that are being offered, whatever is happening in the life of school, they are welcome to attend.

577
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:58,554
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also, this year, we had families ask for the superintendent's weekly communication.

578
00:57:58,914 --> 00:58:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've added that on as well.

579
00:58:01,235 --> 00:58:01,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

580
00:58:01,536 --> 00:58:03,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think you and I have spoken about this before.

581
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:07,358
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that happens for families that go out of district is they lose community.

582
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:12,041
[SPEAKER_09]: They lose their involvement in Medford community schools, Medford public schools.

583
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:16,343
[SPEAKER_09]: So how are we offering them least restrictive environment outside of those schools?

584
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:20,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would be really interesting to see data around what families are actually participating in.

585
00:58:21,005 --> 00:58:44,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Has there been any, as far as you know, has there been any data or survey of the out of district families in terms of I know the hair report for the state level talks about Massachusetts special education in Massachusetts, and a lot about a district students, families were pulled by Dr hair and Harvard Graduate School of Education, and a lot of those families actually did not

586
00:58:45,282 --> 00:58:47,724
[SPEAKER_09]: want to leave the district, they felt like they had to.

587
00:58:48,285 --> 00:59:03,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm wondering if we've done any sort of data or survey of the families, you know, for those who either, you know, perhaps did not want to felt they had to would like to come back would like to be more involved, anything, any activities that are specific to these families, anything that we can offer them?

588
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:07,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe we've done any type of survey of that sort at this time.

589
00:59:08,122 --> 00:59:09,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe that's something we can

590
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:15,834
[SPEAKER_04]: We could discuss think about for the subcommittee, you know, we would want to work in conjunction with CPAC as well.

591
00:59:16,895 --> 00:59:17,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

592
00:59:18,157 --> 00:59:18,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the.

593
00:59:19,738 --> 00:59:25,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and what the added district involvement is in for the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council would be great.

594
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:39,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and then just in terms of like school events, such as curriculum night, that sort of thing, also obviously welcome to attend, even though they're not necessarily assigned to a classroom or a specific.

595
00:59:39,904 --> 00:59:41,284
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more than welcome to attend.

596
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:51,046
[SPEAKER_04]: We would love them to come in and visit me with the principal so they know who they're getting the communication from and just be familiar with the public school that they're assigned to.

597
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:51,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

598
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:52,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

599
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:52,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen.

600
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:54,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

601
00:59:54,921 --> 01:00:12,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three we have professional development update Dr. William robust will be presenting to the Medford school committee on the professional development programming focusing on the Massachusetts educated performance evaluation systems that all Metro public school administrators are participating in during the 2021 2022 school year.

602
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:20,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the School Committee.

603
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:37,108
[SPEAKER_10]: This year, in connection with our strategic plan, one of the things that we committed to was to provide world-class training and support for our school and district leaders as they go and they support our teachers.

604
01:00:37,548 --> 01:00:42,172
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's my privilege this evening to introduce to you Dr. Bill Rebus.

605
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:43,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Rebus,

606
01:00:44,365 --> 01:00:50,569
[SPEAKER_10]: has been a consultant and trainer in supervision and evaluation for well over 20 years.

607
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:54,091
[SPEAKER_10]: He served as the assistant superintendent for human resources.

608
01:00:54,611 --> 01:00:56,012
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just advance the slide for a second.

609
01:00:56,232 --> 01:01:01,135
[SPEAKER_10]: The assistant superintendent for human resources for the Brookline Public Schools for seven years.

610
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:13,703
[SPEAKER_10]: He has served as a principal, an assistant principal, a teacher, as well as a member of the union leadership as well for both teachers and administrative bargaining associations.

611
01:01:14,082 --> 01:01:25,506
[SPEAKER_10]: On a personal and professional level, I first met and was trained by Dr. Rebus in 2008 and 2009, and then had follow-up trainings with him, I believe it was 2011 or 2012.

612
01:01:27,067 --> 01:01:39,251
[SPEAKER_10]: And the trainings were enlightening and helped to really change and alter practice to really support teachers in their endeavors to really improve student outcomes.

613
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:42,692
[SPEAKER_10]: So without any further ado, I'll turn the floor over to Dr. Rebus.

614
01:01:44,603 --> 01:01:45,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

615
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:50,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate your inviting me this evening to come and speak with you.

616
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:53,972
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a pleasure and an honor to be able to do that.

617
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:59,397
[SPEAKER_12]: As you see on the slide, we fully integrate

618
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:07,707
[SPEAKER_12]: the work we are doing with the administrative staff with the initiatives that are already taking place in the Medford public schools.

619
01:02:08,368 --> 01:02:14,114
[SPEAKER_12]: We previously when I say we because we've had three consultants working here.

620
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:21,963
[SPEAKER_12]: I am primarily the consultant working on performance evaluation and you actually

621
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:35,194
[SPEAKER_12]: hear me talk more about performance evaluation and professional development because from philosophically we believe that the role of performance evaluation is to develop staff

622
01:02:38,618 --> 01:02:44,263
[SPEAKER_12]: and ultimately to lead to higher levels of student achievement and growth.

623
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:50,128
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can see that I underlined some of the key areas on your mission statement.

624
01:02:50,689 --> 01:02:56,274
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been through the district's strategic plan.

625
01:02:56,794 --> 01:03:00,557
[SPEAKER_12]: We've read through the performance evaluation system that was

626
01:03:01,498 --> 01:03:11,261
[SPEAKER_12]: collectively bargained with the Teachers Association and has also been approved by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

627
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:27,107
[SPEAKER_12]: We've read through your teacher's contract and your various pieces of curriculum because we believe that a system of performance evaluation and professional development needs to be totally integrated and tied into

628
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:31,316
[SPEAKER_12]: what the initiatives are within an individual district.

629
01:03:32,836 --> 01:03:52,419
[SPEAKER_12]: So Peter, if you would just bounce, you'll see one of the things that today I'm speaking on, we provided a couple of programs for the district, which we in turn turned over to the district as in-district trainer programs.

630
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:55,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I look at it as the president of the company, I look at the,

631
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:06,504
[SPEAKER_12]: goal of our engagement in a school district is to work ourselves out of a job, which means to build sustainability and capacity within.

632
01:04:06,904 --> 01:04:25,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first two programs up there, which I'm not talking about today, but we have now created full capacity and sustainability for the district to be able to train their own people, which also includes a letter from us providing the district with permission to use all our intellectual property

633
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,960
[SPEAKER_12]: related to that, provided it's just within the district.

634
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:36,384
[SPEAKER_12]: It's to enhance the benefit of your staff and the children here in the Medford Public Schools.

635
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:40,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I'm gonna talk more about educator evaluation.

636
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:48,909
[SPEAKER_12]: And three words you're gonna hear over and over from me are consistency, consistently, effectively, and respectfully.

637
01:04:50,536 --> 01:04:55,760
[SPEAKER_12]: provide feedback to the educators in the Medford public schools.

638
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:57,902
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd go to the next slide, Peter, please.

639
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:06,108
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are five major outcomes of the program.

640
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:15,595
[SPEAKER_12]: The first being the improvement of student performance and student personal development.

641
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:17,657
[SPEAKER_12]: The,

642
01:05:19,647 --> 01:05:34,757
[SPEAKER_12]: A performance evaluation program, I'll use that terminology because that's what the state uses, but a performance evaluation development program really has no value if it doesn't impact the students in a very significant way.

643
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:38,359
[SPEAKER_12]: And let me give you an example.

644
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:48,626
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been longitudinal research on the impact of professional development training, workshops, courses, and such that teachers and others take.

645
01:05:49,619 --> 01:06:12,865
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there is not an alignment between that training and the coaching that happens with coaches, but particularly the coaching, the evaluation, the support and feedback from the school leaders and the district leaders, the implementation two years down the road is only about 20%.

646
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,421
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wanna be very clear about why that is.

647
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:22,023
[SPEAKER_12]: That isn't, when people look at that statistic, sometimes they draw the wrong conclusion.

648
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:31,306
[SPEAKER_12]: The conclusion they draw is that the people don't go to, they go to workshops and then they say, well, I'm just gonna do what I always did.

649
01:06:31,646 --> 01:06:32,487
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not true.

650
01:06:33,347 --> 01:06:41,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Teachers are very, very dedicated to doing new and more effective strategies in the classroom.

651
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,991
[SPEAKER_12]: But like anything else, when you go to a, when you first,

652
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:49,137
[SPEAKER_12]: attend a workshop, you're learning to do something new and different.

653
01:06:49,557 --> 01:06:57,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you get back to your classroom, you sometimes get a little nervous about practicing on your students.

654
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:06,207
[SPEAKER_12]: And the idea is, well, maybe I'll wait until there's a time when things are, something in the curriculum isn't so important and then I'll practice.

655
01:07:06,267 --> 01:07:10,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the last time I looked at the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks,

656
01:07:12,484 --> 01:07:16,167
[SPEAKER_12]: From the Department of Education's point of view, everything in there is important.

657
01:07:16,247 --> 01:07:19,109
[SPEAKER_12]: So what happens is then people wait, and they wait.

658
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:25,634
[SPEAKER_12]: And so eventually, the impact of the professional development dissipates.

659
01:07:26,134 --> 01:07:30,417
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we see a lower level of implementation, not because of

660
01:07:34,543 --> 01:07:41,725
[SPEAKER_12]: people being difficult, but people having the best of intentions, and that's just human nature for that to happen.

661
01:07:42,205 --> 01:07:50,987
[SPEAKER_12]: So our professional, when we're doing training with the administrators, we do what we call a workshop within a workshop.

662
01:07:51,307 --> 01:08:02,350
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I'm training administrators, I train them, yes, in how to consistently and effectively use the procedures and the standards for

663
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:16,205
[SPEAKER_12]: measuring teacher success and also Councilor success, psychologist success, all positions that are either classroom positions or clinical positions.

664
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:28,033
[SPEAKER_12]: But my training also is done in a way that we would want a teacher to run a highly effective classroom using what are known as high leverage research-based

665
01:08:29,015 --> 01:08:46,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Teaching strategies, so that the administrators actually experience the strategies within the work that they're doing and to give you a crossover we we did an in district trainer program, as you saw in the earlier slide about social emotional learning in the classroom.

666
01:08:47,580 --> 01:09:04,880
[SPEAKER_12]: And we used as part of my two and a half days with your administrators now when I was working with them, I used 30 strategies with them to teach the content of effective supervision evaluation and development that are.

667
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,572
[SPEAKER_12]: contained within the training that the teachers had.

668
01:09:07,612 --> 01:09:17,280
[SPEAKER_12]: So now the administrators have fully experienced that and can go back and be supportive and help teachers develop those strategies.

669
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:22,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Number two is the consistency piece.

670
01:09:23,124 --> 01:09:29,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Before I came in, I mentioned that I read through curriculum and I read through documents.

671
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:34,674
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing I did is I had a wonderful meeting with the Teachers Association.

672
01:09:35,734 --> 01:09:40,774
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were very forthcoming in terms of giving me their thoughts and ideas about what worked.

673
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:48,264
[SPEAKER_12]: in terms of performance evaluation in the Medford Public Schools and what did not work in the Medford Public Schools.

674
01:09:48,284 --> 01:10:06,559
[SPEAKER_12]: And I shared with them before I even stepped in the room with any administrators, how I would proceed, be proceeding with the administrative staff and have offered to them that at any time I would be open to conversations with them and sharing more information, even to the point of,

675
01:10:07,983 --> 01:10:13,868
[SPEAKER_12]: running a mock workshop similar to what we do with the administrator so they can actually experience it.

676
01:10:13,928 --> 01:10:20,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Because one of the key pieces with the consistency is also to have transparency.

677
01:10:21,353 --> 01:10:32,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Transparency so that teachers understand what the evaluators are doing and what they're trying to achieve when they're working with them through the system.

678
01:10:35,567 --> 01:10:44,269
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the ways we build this consistency initially is we actually watch videos of classroom teaching.

679
01:10:45,009 --> 01:10:56,191
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has provided probably about three dozen different videos of all different grade levels.

680
01:10:56,851 --> 01:11:01,852
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will watch the videos together and then they will,

681
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:10,150
[SPEAKER_12]: The administrators will work in groups of five, and they will analyze that video, and then they'll talk to one another.

682
01:11:10,728 --> 01:11:16,714
[SPEAKER_12]: And they'll look at the performances they saw or didn't see happening in there.

683
01:11:17,354 --> 01:11:25,462
[SPEAKER_12]: And that creates a common understanding and a consistent set of expectations for what you're looking for in a classroom.

684
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:36,051
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I've said many times to your administrators, I've said to administrators everywhere, is a person's performance evaluation shouldn't depend on who's evaluating them.

685
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:59,758
[SPEAKER_12]: It should depend on a fixed set of performance criteria that we value in the Medford public schools as indicating a high level of performance, whether it's in classroom teaching or providing speech and language therapy, providing occupational therapy, school nursing, whatever the area is.

686
01:12:01,961 --> 01:12:05,203
[SPEAKER_12]: The next, we're still with this slide.

687
01:12:05,223 --> 01:12:07,605
[SPEAKER_12]: I got one more on this slide, Dr. Cushing.

688
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:15,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Number three is the idea of clearly and respectfully communicating expectations.

689
01:12:16,012 --> 01:12:20,495
[SPEAKER_12]: You have documents that communicate expectations.

690
01:12:20,515 --> 01:12:23,737
[SPEAKER_12]: They're in the contract with the Medford Teachers Association.

691
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:33,704
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a performance rubric, but those rubrics are really representative of far more research on effective practice.

692
01:12:34,744 --> 01:12:40,228
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it becomes important for the teachers to understand

693
01:12:41,585 --> 01:13:08,482
[SPEAKER_12]: what it is that the administrators are looking for and looking at when they are in a classroom doing an observation or looking at samples of student work or looking at student assessment data or looking at any one of a long list of criteria and data that is used to determine a level of success.

694
01:13:09,983 --> 01:13:10,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Next slide, please, Peter.

695
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:22,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Number four is increase the usefulness of the feedback.

696
01:13:24,059 --> 01:13:34,047
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that national surveys have found is that many teachers do not find the feedback that they get as useful.

697
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:37,390
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are a few reasons for that.

698
01:13:37,811 --> 01:13:45,737
[SPEAKER_12]: One is that oftentimes the performance management is done separate from the feedback

699
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,561
[SPEAKER_12]: from the professional development that's done for teachers.

700
01:13:49,242 --> 01:14:12,936
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there isn't that connection and overlap when administrators are going into rooms or when they're watching nurses in their clinics or whatever it is that they're assessing what the position is, they should be looking for the same types of things that are provided for those people in their professional development.

701
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:23,231
[SPEAKER_12]: That is one of the things that people who are being evaluated look for.

702
01:14:23,852 --> 01:14:35,600
[SPEAKER_12]: They wanna know that what the feedback that they're getting is directly related to what they know their jobs are each and every day and how they can be better at their jobs each and every day.

703
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:44,879
[SPEAKER_12]: The other usefulness an example is that we've now have 100 years we've now been through 100 years of.

704
01:14:47,235 --> 01:14:56,538
[SPEAKER_12]: what was always called teacher evaluation, we now call it educator evaluation because a hundred years ago, we didn't have school nurses or psychologists or Councilors or anything like that.

705
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've learned, there's been a large body of research.

706
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:09,063
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the most current pieces of research that's reflected in our training is when you give a teacher

707
01:15:09,907 --> 01:15:11,507
[SPEAKER_12]: a recommendation to improve.

708
01:15:11,547 --> 01:15:13,008
[SPEAKER_12]: There should be three pieces to that.

709
01:15:13,568 --> 01:15:17,448
[SPEAKER_12]: One is the, what are you, what needs to improve or could improve?

710
01:15:17,968 --> 01:15:19,529
[SPEAKER_12]: The other is how to improve.

711
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:23,429
[SPEAKER_12]: And the third piece is an offer of support.

712
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:24,850
[SPEAKER_12]: So let me give you an example.

713
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:36,392
[SPEAKER_12]: A teacher who may, we know from research, brain research that

714
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:50,856
[SPEAKER_12]: We should never, a teacher should never, except in exceptional circumstances, be lecturing more than 20 minutes at a time without having students interact with the information.

715
01:15:51,236 --> 01:16:02,142
[SPEAKER_12]: They do what's called a turn and talk, or they work in a group, or they apply what's learned because that will cause the brain to integrate and hold on to the learning.

716
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:06,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if a teacher is struggling with that,

717
01:16:09,135 --> 01:16:14,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Suggesting to the teacher that they provide more effective group work in the classroom, that's a what?

718
01:16:16,218 --> 01:16:37,706
[SPEAKER_12]: But telling them how there are 11 components to effective group work, because if you don't, putting kids together, putting students together, whether they're 18 or they're four, isn't going to lead to an effective product and effective learning unless these 11 components are there.

719
01:16:39,176 --> 01:17:02,153
[SPEAKER_12]: not only recommending the use of more, but providing the 11 components and ending with a statement such as, if you need any assistance with this, I'm happy to assist with your implementation of that, or pointing to a person who may be more expert on it.

720
01:17:02,754 --> 01:17:07,257
[SPEAKER_12]: You should speak with and fill in the blank there.

721
01:17:08,549 --> 01:17:13,012
[SPEAKER_12]: We found that when that happens, there are a few things that take place.

722
01:17:13,993 --> 01:17:18,316
[SPEAKER_12]: One is you get much higher implementation of the recommended change.

723
01:17:19,937 --> 01:17:36,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Two is teachers feel that the performance assessment and development program is something that you as the administrator are doing with them, not something you're doing to them.

724
01:17:37,537 --> 01:17:50,800
[SPEAKER_12]: that you're a partner in that and you're working together to develop the craft of teaching or nursing or counseling, whatever it may be.

725
01:17:53,241 --> 01:18:06,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And it also, it's interesting that we've also found that even teachers who don't feel they need the offer of support, they get the recommendation,

726
01:18:07,662 --> 01:18:20,913
[SPEAKER_12]: the what and the how, and they know how to implement, they report that it feels good to know that my administrator is kind of behind me, is there, is my partner in this.

727
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:31,281
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that is an important part of developing that collaborative culture in a school building or in a district.

728
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:36,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And finally, the fifth piece is

729
01:18:37,835 --> 01:18:38,475
[SPEAKER_12]: The support.

730
01:18:41,197 --> 01:18:49,602
[SPEAKER_12]: We mentioned that, I mentioned that, I'm sorry, that if we should have transparency in terms of what the expectations are.

731
01:18:50,142 --> 01:19:04,151
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we expect teachers, if we're looking for certain things, when we go in to a educator's work area with students, we should,

732
01:19:04,902 --> 01:19:23,833
[SPEAKER_12]: be clear about what it is we're looking for, and we should be ready to provide what training is needed or what coaching is needed to in fact implement what they are doing in the most effective way possible.

733
01:19:24,915 --> 01:19:25,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Next slide, Peter.

734
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:32,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this point, I know I probably, I was told by Dr. Cushing to spend about 10 minutes.

735
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,041
[SPEAKER_12]: It's tough for me to only talk 10 minutes.

736
01:19:34,622 --> 01:19:36,103
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize for going over.

737
01:19:37,864 --> 01:19:44,048
[SPEAKER_12]: But in closing, I would like to just go back to three words that I think are very, very important.

738
01:19:44,788 --> 01:19:45,389
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is

739
01:19:49,263 --> 01:20:16,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Consistency, creating consistency within schools, across schools, creating higher levels of effectiveness that lead to higher levels of performance and more success by students, and finally doing it respectfully so that people feel that the process is again, one that

740
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,843
[SPEAKER_12]: that their administrator is doing with them, not that the administrator is doing to them.

741
01:20:23,504 --> 01:20:31,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll stop right there, and if there's time, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

742
01:20:31,049 --> 01:20:31,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Van der Kloot.

743
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:38,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. LaBuche for your presentation.

744
01:20:38,394 --> 01:20:38,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very interesting.

745
01:20:38,874 --> 01:20:42,817
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple questions just sort of in understanding the scope of your work in our district.

746
01:20:43,877 --> 01:20:53,684
[SPEAKER_03]: you've outlined three different areas, which I assume are for all K to 12 teachers?

747
01:20:53,885 --> 01:20:57,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, all K to 12 staff actually, yes.

748
01:20:57,647 --> 01:20:58,768
[SPEAKER_03]: All K to 12 staff.

749
01:20:58,828 --> 01:21:04,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, we don't have that much time for professional development.

750
01:21:04,572 --> 01:21:07,435
[SPEAKER_03]: When are you coming in and how many people are coming in?

751
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:09,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you could just give us an understanding.

752
01:21:09,396 --> 01:21:11,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I think the wonderful thing that,

753
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:20,822
[SPEAKER_12]: that you're doing is using the in-district trainer model, because it provides you with a lot of flexibility.

754
01:21:20,882 --> 01:21:32,226
[SPEAKER_12]: So you now have trainers who are prepared to do the same level and quality of training that our trainers will do in the areas of implicit bias and social emotional alert.

755
01:21:32,246 --> 01:21:35,667
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that there is

756
01:21:39,153 --> 01:21:48,815
[SPEAKER_12]: there is now planning for how to use those trainers as both trainers and coaches within the district.

757
01:21:48,995 --> 01:21:53,056
[SPEAKER_12]: And having your own people provides a lot of flexibility.

758
01:21:53,096 --> 01:21:54,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me give you one example.

759
01:21:54,156 --> 01:22:00,418
[SPEAKER_12]: In one building, a principal starts each of his faculty meetings,

760
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:06,302
[SPEAKER_12]: with a piece of a lesson from the social emotional learning program.

761
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:11,685
[SPEAKER_12]: He was a trainer in the, an in-district trainer in the social emotional learning program.

762
01:22:11,705 --> 01:22:18,048
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's able to integrate, take 10 or 15 minutes and integrate that over the course of the year.

763
01:22:19,308 --> 01:22:22,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have that kind of flexibility when you have in-house.

764
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:29,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And not only do you have that flexibility, it's significantly less expensive.

765
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:44,755
[SPEAKER_12]: know, if I have to send bring trainers over every time you have an early release day, there's the travel time, the preparation time, and all of all of that, then if the you wanted to bring them back to coach, there's all the costs in terms of of them being

766
01:22:45,205 --> 01:23:00,304
[SPEAKER_12]: physically in the building but you have you have an ideal situation now with high levels of flexibility and I'll have to defer to the the district administrators, more specifically on what the

767
01:23:00,985 --> 01:23:06,870
[SPEAKER_12]: plans are for those in-district trainers to specifically disseminate all the learning across.

768
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:09,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if I could go back, though.

769
01:23:09,112 --> 01:23:09,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

770
01:23:09,933 --> 01:23:15,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you're training the in-district, what is the scope of that work?

771
01:23:15,897 --> 01:23:17,519
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people are you training?

772
01:23:17,619 --> 01:23:18,980
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people are you meeting with?

773
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,040
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

774
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:19,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

775
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:23,444
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the implicit bias in the social-emotional learning programs, we train 20 trainers.

776
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:29,103
[SPEAKER_12]: in the district, which should be more than sufficient for a district this size.

777
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:38,369
[SPEAKER_12]: The training I am personally doing, I am doing the training with the administrative staff that has consisted of two full days in the summer.

778
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:44,533
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are doing a three hour training each month.

779
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:47,354
[SPEAKER_12]: that will continue throughout the year.

780
01:23:48,155 --> 01:23:54,699
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we will do another piece next August, with some training in the fall.

781
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:01,164
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that would be the extent of the training that I'm being that I'm involved in.

782
01:24:01,224 --> 01:24:10,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and with that we have structures for ways to sustain and maintain the both both the

783
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:24,991
[SPEAKER_12]: level of performance of the administrators using what it is that they learned, as well as absorbing new staff members if there is turnover.

784
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:26,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

785
01:24:26,911 --> 01:24:28,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one more question.

786
01:24:30,413 --> 01:24:34,774
[SPEAKER_03]: You say taught in our book, social emotional learning in the classroom.

787
01:24:35,294 --> 01:24:40,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those resources that are used, is that something that the school committee can take a look at?

788
01:24:40,793 --> 01:24:41,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes.

789
01:24:43,075 --> 01:24:52,802
[SPEAKER_12]: The program is in our book, Social Emotional Learning in the Classroom, which is the core text that was used with your trainer.

790
01:24:52,883 --> 01:25:02,590
[SPEAKER_12]: So the district office has copies of that text, as well as having copies of the text that we use with the administrative staff.

791
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:05,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can go find it in your office, Dr. Cushing.

792
01:25:05,332 --> 01:25:05,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

793
01:25:06,193 --> 01:25:09,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I have multiple copies for you to peruse if you want to borrow.

794
01:25:10,036 --> 01:25:10,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just be curious.

795
01:25:11,577 --> 01:25:15,459
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the books, actually, we have put in teacher libraries across the district.

796
01:25:15,539 --> 01:25:23,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Every school, with the exception of the high school, received four copies of a teacher resource book.

797
01:25:23,224 --> 01:25:28,246
[SPEAKER_10]: And the high school received eight copies of that book, given the size of the high school.

798
01:25:28,266 --> 01:25:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it available online?

799
01:25:30,968 --> 01:25:37,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Our social-emotional learning book is available online through Apple Books.

800
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:41,002
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have been negotiating.

801
01:25:41,022 --> 01:25:45,404
[SPEAKER_12]: The other two books are 600 pages long.

802
01:25:46,265 --> 01:25:49,387
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know people say, what?

803
01:25:50,748 --> 01:25:55,290
[SPEAKER_12]: The actual body of research on effective teaching is 7,000 pages long.

804
01:25:58,519 --> 01:26:02,402
[SPEAKER_12]: when you look at books and all the research that's been done.

805
01:26:03,023 --> 01:26:15,213
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know condense is a funny word to use when you're talking about a 600 page book, but we condensed the entire body of research on effective teaching into a 600 page book.

806
01:26:17,892 --> 01:26:21,313
[SPEAKER_12]: And what that does is it creates cost savings for our administrators.

807
01:26:21,413 --> 01:26:29,596
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the biggest national organizations that does professional development, sells books, is the Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development.

808
01:26:30,516 --> 01:26:38,059
[SPEAKER_12]: A district would have to buy nine of their books to get the content that's contained in this one book.

809
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,520
[SPEAKER_12]: So by having the book be...

810
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:48,725
[SPEAKER_12]: chapter by chapter covering what is typically covered in a single book.

811
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:53,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Each chapter is equivalent to what's in a book.

812
01:26:54,314 --> 01:26:55,615
[SPEAKER_12]: it is more cost effective.

813
01:26:55,655 --> 01:27:07,787
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem we run into with putting that book online is, if you had a book that size in a bookstore, in a college bookstore, the cost would probably be about $110, $115.

814
01:27:07,907 --> 01:27:17,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody who's had, my youngest just graduated from college, so I'm intimately aware of the cost of books.

815
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:28,034
[SPEAKER_12]: We sell the book, actually, we sell it at a discount for, I believe, $69 or $68 to the Medford Public Schools.

816
01:27:28,054 --> 01:27:29,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Our full price is only about $72, $73.

817
01:27:29,354 --> 01:27:31,976
[SPEAKER_12]: And to put it online and have it be cost-effective,

818
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:53,987
[SPEAKER_12]: would cost us thousands of dollars that would be because online books have a lower price point.

819
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:58,110
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the... Okay, you've answered my... Okay.

820
01:27:58,411 --> 01:27:59,311
[SPEAKER_03]: What I need to know.

821
01:27:59,472 --> 01:28:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

822
01:28:01,473 --> 01:28:01,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

823
01:28:03,615 --> 01:28:05,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the presentation.

824
01:28:05,516 --> 01:28:11,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if my question is necessarily for you or if it's for the administration, but I wanted to understand what...

825
01:28:12,933 --> 01:28:28,941
[SPEAKER_08]: measures and 360 evaluation is going to happen as this process rolls out so that we are sure that the administrators we're tasking to do this work are doing it with fidelity and they are doing it with the integrity that's intended.

826
01:28:29,021 --> 01:28:35,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So how do we plan to evaluate our evaluators essentially through this process?

827
01:28:35,604 --> 01:28:41,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll talk a little bit about that and then I'll let the administrators add to it if they wish.

828
01:28:42,628 --> 01:28:56,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, I do the quality control and we've gone from, we've done videos and I've already reviewed two sets of feedback that have been given based on the videos.

829
01:28:57,191 --> 01:29:07,753
[SPEAKER_12]: The administrators now have a, before I come back in October, they all have to complete an observation and write up the feedback.

830
01:29:08,403 --> 01:29:12,967
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they have to bring that with the teacher redacted so nobody knows who it is.

831
01:29:13,967 --> 01:29:24,015
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a set of criteria we have in our book based on the research of what effective feedback is.

832
01:29:24,896 --> 01:29:31,842
[SPEAKER_12]: And they are going to use that to self-assess and then assess one and others.

833
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,663
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they're going to bring them to me and I'm going to give them all written feedback on it.

834
01:29:37,063 --> 01:29:49,588
[SPEAKER_12]: So, after I'm after I'm no longer training that criteria will remain and that process can continue, which the process typically is to randomly select.

835
01:29:50,228 --> 01:30:06,479
[SPEAKER_12]: feedback documents and you use vector systems from vector systems and provide administrators feedback based on the criteria that we that I am using now to evaluate their their feedback.

836
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:08,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

837
01:30:10,281 --> 01:30:10,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

838
01:30:13,003 --> 01:30:13,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

839
01:30:16,365 --> 01:30:19,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We have presentations of the public not to begin before seven.

840
01:30:19,649 --> 01:30:28,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentations of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

841
01:30:29,514 --> 01:30:32,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident may only present once at any meeting.

842
01:30:32,195 --> 01:30:38,839
[SPEAKER_05]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

843
01:30:39,519 --> 01:30:47,323
[SPEAKER_05]: If one or more committee members wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, member may request the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

844
01:30:48,148 --> 01:30:55,495
[SPEAKER_05]: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BEDH public comment and presentations of the public.

845
01:30:56,296 --> 01:30:57,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight we have none.

846
01:30:58,118 --> 01:30:58,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Public comment.

847
01:30:59,419 --> 01:31:02,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Pursuant to policy and procedure,

848
01:31:03,696 --> 01:31:09,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once in any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

849
01:31:09,658 --> 01:31:13,260
[SPEAKER_05]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

850
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:19,842
[SPEAKER_05]: The speaker must begin their comments by providing their name and full Medford street address where they reside.

851
01:31:20,622 --> 01:31:24,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Residents may also submit their comments by writing to the superintendent schools prior to the meeting.

852
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:32,407
[SPEAKER_05]: or by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us prior to or during the item on the agenda.

853
01:31:32,907 --> 01:31:42,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Written comments must be kept to a length that allows for them to be read into the school record, school committee record in less than three minutes or the comments will be summarized by the secretary of the school committee.

854
01:31:43,829 --> 01:31:48,550
[SPEAKER_05]: A welcoming inclusive community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

855
01:31:49,090 --> 01:31:52,631
[SPEAKER_05]: We ask for you to help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

856
01:31:53,431 --> 01:31:54,351
[SPEAKER_05]: When writing or emailing,

857
01:31:54,753 --> 01:31:56,494
[SPEAKER_05]: please provide this information.

858
01:31:56,794 --> 01:32:04,079
[SPEAKER_05]: The number and name of the item on the agenda, your first and last name, your full Medford Street address, where you reside, your question or comment.

859
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:04,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor?

860
01:32:05,981 --> 01:32:07,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau, then Member Van der Kloot.

861
01:32:07,802 --> 01:32:08,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

862
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:18,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week when we met, not last week, whenever we last met, it became clear to me that this is our new format and things

863
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:34,533
[SPEAKER_11]: New don't always work quite the way we intended, but public comment this this thing that you just read this is not an item on the agenda for public comment, this is a statement that the mayor reads to remind the public and us.

864
01:32:35,774 --> 01:32:44,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Of our policy, this is not an item where we anybody can speak, this is simply a reminder of how what our policy is because I remember in the last meeting.

865
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:50,373
[SPEAKER_11]: We then took public comment that was not about items on the agenda.

866
01:32:50,914 --> 01:32:58,318
[SPEAKER_11]: And that surprised me, but I just, you know, you did read that sentence that we only take public comment for items on the agenda.

867
01:32:58,358 --> 01:33:01,840
[SPEAKER_11]: That's been the policy of the school committee since I've been on the school committee.

868
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:05,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And we didn't change that with this new update.

869
01:33:05,642 --> 01:33:09,784
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to reiterate that this is not an open mic.

870
01:33:11,305 --> 01:33:12,005
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

871
01:33:13,498 --> 01:33:15,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Member Van der Kloot.

872
01:33:15,979 --> 01:33:18,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I find it a little confusing, actually.

873
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:22,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of it is the wording is presentations of the public.

874
01:33:22,942 --> 01:33:27,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And does the presentation mean a statement or, for instance, a letter?

875
01:33:29,466 --> 01:33:29,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor?

876
01:33:31,206 --> 01:33:32,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

877
01:33:32,427 --> 01:33:32,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

878
01:33:32,647 --> 01:33:38,650
[SPEAKER_11]: The full policy actually explains that, no, a presentation of the public, there's a procedure for how to get yourself on this list.

879
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:40,691
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is a presentation.

880
01:33:40,711 --> 01:33:43,152
[SPEAKER_11]: It usually could be a

881
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:47,212
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be a PowerPoint, it could be just a, you come up and speak.

882
01:33:47,792 --> 01:34:01,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember we had one in the spring around reading, and that is people submit the presentation to the superintendent according to the details and the policy, which I don't have it in front of me.

883
01:34:02,217 --> 01:34:03,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's what the presentation is.

884
01:34:03,978 --> 01:34:06,039
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing showing up there.

885
01:34:06,359 --> 01:34:09,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I have another letter that has been submitted to us.

886
01:34:09,646 --> 01:34:12,770
[SPEAKER_05]: That's considered public participation, not a presentation.

887
01:34:13,191 --> 01:34:15,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I remember was so is done.

888
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:20,061
[SPEAKER_05]: We can have a member band includes read the email, so it's not.

889
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:24,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to do with anything particular on our agenda so it wasn't a pub.

890
01:34:25,088 --> 01:34:26,370
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we did earlier.

891
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,211
[SPEAKER_03]: have a public comment.

892
01:34:28,491 --> 01:34:29,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Mayor Sorry, remember Ruseau?

893
01:34:29,932 --> 01:34:32,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Um but we don't take public comment.

894
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:34,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anything you want to have a conversation?

895
01:34:34,494 --> 01:34:39,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So but we've always had an opportunity for people if this person was here.

896
01:34:40,497 --> 01:34:43,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier in the meeting where it used to be, they would

897
01:34:53,747 --> 01:35:04,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my fear is that you're cutting out the ability of a person to ask a question, which I understand isn't necessary.

898
01:35:04,431 --> 01:35:10,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I read this letter, I'm not expecting that there's going to be a dialogue, but the person wrote it.

899
01:35:10,714 --> 01:35:17,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that we did this whole thing about having letters submitted so that people who aren't here, we could read it.

900
01:35:17,777 --> 01:35:20,458
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may.

901
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:35,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I was under just from the chair, I was under the impression that anybody can bring anything up during public participation and just, if it's not on the agenda can't be discussed, a member would have to bring it before the school committee under resolution for the next regular meeting.

902
01:35:36,554 --> 01:35:38,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, so, thank you.

903
01:35:38,475 --> 01:35:44,997
[SPEAKER_11]: That's definitely not how the subcommittee when we talked about this or and when we pass this policy in the spring.

904
01:35:45,537 --> 01:35:48,138
[SPEAKER_11]: That is definitely not what we talked about at all.

905
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So in one hand, you're saying that the goal is to be inclusive and welcoming.

906
01:35:55,864 --> 01:36:00,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the other hand, we're saying, but here's someone who's written a letter, but I can't read it.

907
01:36:02,869 --> 01:36:04,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really understand that.

908
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:16,457
[SPEAKER_11]: But part of why we made this decision to be more explicit about what actually was always past practice was that this committee and frankly, every body

909
01:36:17,382 --> 01:36:22,466
[SPEAKER_11]: like us is unable to have somebody come up and ask a question and we don't answer.

910
01:36:22,486 --> 01:36:25,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Open meeting law dictates we don't answer questions.

911
01:36:27,809 --> 01:36:28,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

912
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:31,572
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, we can go back and watch our meetings.

913
01:36:32,092 --> 01:36:36,195
[SPEAKER_11]: All of us fail miserably and violate open meeting law.

914
01:36:36,715 --> 01:36:45,882
[SPEAKER_11]: So that- So the full policy says if somebody has a question that they want to be answered, that there's seven of us.

915
01:36:46,778 --> 01:36:53,580
[SPEAKER_11]: send us an email, any one of us can put it on the agenda for the next meeting, and then it's a regular agenda item for a conversation.

916
01:36:53,921 --> 01:36:56,221
[SPEAKER_03]: But this was submitted to the school committee account.

917
01:36:56,842 --> 01:37:01,503
[SPEAKER_03]: My job has been to read the letters that were submitted to the school committee account.

918
01:37:02,004 --> 01:37:08,566
[SPEAKER_03]: This person chose that way rather than writing us individually, which I actually think that there's a benefit from.

919
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:18,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that there would be no discussion about this, but to not read it, and again, I happen to know what the letter contains.

920
01:37:18,065 --> 01:37:18,845
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be anything.

921
01:37:18,905 --> 01:37:34,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just making a general observation that it seems to me that we've become, with this policy, the well-intended to correct another problem is in fact causing another concern that I am articulating right now.

922
01:37:35,823 --> 01:37:41,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So this person, Monica Rushford, who submitted this letter, is not going to have her letter read tonight.

923
01:37:41,908 --> 01:37:42,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to read the letter?

924
01:37:43,009 --> 01:37:46,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I make a motion to read the letter.

925
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:46,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

926
01:37:46,771 --> 01:37:47,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

927
01:37:47,452 --> 01:37:48,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Memocrats.

928
01:37:48,773 --> 01:37:49,594
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

929
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:50,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

930
01:37:51,255 --> 01:37:51,955
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

931
01:37:54,217 --> 01:37:55,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

932
01:37:56,227 --> 01:37:57,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, school committee members.

933
01:37:57,608 --> 01:38:00,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Medford resident and a parent of Missy Tuck Elementary students.

934
01:38:00,829 --> 01:38:05,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious whether there will be any kind of acknowledgement or dedication of the new name.

935
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:07,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see the banner on the front of the building.

936
01:38:07,513 --> 01:38:12,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to know if other signage or explanation of the significance of the name is under consideration.

937
01:38:12,636 --> 01:38:15,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard, for example, about a mural on the playground.

938
01:38:15,817 --> 01:38:19,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be the school committee's decision or the school's?

939
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:20,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all the work you do.

940
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, Monica Rushford.

941
01:38:26,055 --> 01:38:27,536
[SPEAKER_09]: make a motion to- Point of order.

942
01:38:28,656 --> 01:38:33,678
[SPEAKER_11]: A motion to- Point of order, we are not discussing or making a motion on anything related to that.

943
01:38:34,578 --> 01:38:37,239
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a violation of open meeting- It's just written to the record, yes.

944
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:42,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Any one of us can make a motion to do that at the next meeting.

945
01:38:44,382 --> 01:38:46,963
[SPEAKER_09]: What my motion was, I wanted to- You can't make that motion tonight.

946
01:38:47,503 --> 01:38:48,923
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to send an email.

947
01:38:49,403 --> 01:38:53,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we have to follow our existing policy on motions to add things to the agenda.

948
01:38:55,335 --> 01:38:58,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so in a man member member McLaughlin.

949
01:38:58,936 --> 01:39:08,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I understand the process correctly, then it's two weeks for somebody to be able to get something on the agenda if that's the case, if they bring it if they in this instance, it will be two weeks because we would have to.

950
01:39:08,598 --> 01:39:11,498
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not related to this particular question.

951
01:39:11,518 --> 01:39:14,159
[SPEAKER_09]: This is related to our policy, which is on the agenda.

952
01:39:14,959 --> 01:39:18,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I understand this correctly, if somebody

953
01:39:19,014 --> 01:39:31,658
[SPEAKER_09]: in our community were to come up here, which I understand, Member Ruseau, your position on the policy that if it's not on the agenda, coming up to speak publicly is out of order.

954
01:39:31,738 --> 01:39:44,942
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I'm saying is, should somebody do that, and we want to make a motion to put it on the agenda, we then have to put it on the next agenda in two weeks to make the motion, which would be another two weeks out before it would actually be on the agenda.

955
01:39:45,122 --> 01:39:45,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that accurate?

956
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:55,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is accurate, but then we still have tomorrow or the next day to be able to answer it in writing from the administration to the resident.

957
01:39:56,506 --> 01:40:05,433
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you wanna have a full length discussion, what member Ruseau was saying, open meeting law requires you to give notice, 48 hours notice when the agenda is posted.

958
01:40:06,093 --> 01:40:08,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So we should put it on the agenda if we want it answered publicly.

959
01:40:09,215 --> 01:40:09,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

960
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:16,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

961
01:40:16,221 --> 01:40:16,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor.

962
01:40:16,701 --> 01:40:17,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

963
01:40:18,643 --> 01:40:36,258
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing we may want to consider is to make a motion to ask the rules subcommittee to explicitly review that policy and create some guidance around the school committee email account specifically, because I think, you know, in this case like

964
01:40:36,838 --> 01:40:52,358
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in my opinion that was a harmless question and I would like us to be able to answer it but that is in the eye of the beholder someone else may not find that harmless question at all, and may disagree but I think ultimately we've opened up this channel for people to communicate with us.

965
01:40:53,097 --> 01:41:00,780
[SPEAKER_08]: through this email box, which frankly may or may not be the best way to get the answers to the questions that people send there.

966
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there may be more effective ways.

967
01:41:03,241 --> 01:41:13,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do think having some standards around what we do with stuff that comes to that box is important.

968
01:41:13,626 --> 01:41:17,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And perhaps there are some rules and some guidelines that we can put in place to do that.

969
01:41:17,788 --> 01:41:21,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to make a motion that the role of

970
01:41:23,087 --> 01:41:39,040
[SPEAKER_08]: the school committee email box, which was like never a thing before COVID but is now be considered by the rules policy and equity subcommittee, and our public participation policies be amended accordingly, based on that review and any recommendation.

971
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:39,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

972
01:41:40,101 --> 01:41:43,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

973
01:41:43,544 --> 01:41:44,285
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

974
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:44,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

975
01:41:45,226 --> 01:41:45,986
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed.

976
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:47,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

977
01:41:54,508 --> 01:42:00,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to press the button with to turn in a microphone on or Mr. McLaughlin if we could get the.

978
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:00,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

979
01:42:01,335 --> 01:42:01,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

980
01:42:02,296 --> 01:42:04,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharon hey 69 Ripley road.

981
01:42:04,058 --> 01:42:16,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question about the protocols earlier that discussed about for students who are symptomatic, and are either kept home by their parents or sent home.

982
01:42:17,071 --> 01:42:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a case.

983
01:42:18,322 --> 01:42:24,984
[SPEAKER_02]: week before last where I kept my second grader home because he had the sniffles and runny nose and cough, typical cold symptoms.

984
01:42:25,444 --> 01:42:29,465
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't clear to me what I needed to do at that point.

985
01:42:29,545 --> 01:42:38,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I did end up calling the school nurse and we did go and get a COVID test, went to the pediatrician and talked to the pediatrician, had the COVID test and it was negative.

986
01:42:38,567 --> 01:42:46,689
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I'm understanding correctly, what was said tonight was that you need to talk to the pediatrician, have the COVID test,

987
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:51,314
[SPEAKER_02]: and be symptom free for at least 24 hours.

988
01:42:52,555 --> 01:43:07,619
[SPEAKER_02]: which that was not communicated to me, but I also, I think in terms of talking about that, or if you guys talk about, I mean, K through two or even three, you're going to have kids with runny nose and cough that lasts for lots more than 24 hours.

989
01:43:07,699 --> 01:43:13,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's going to be a lot of disruption for kids if that's going to be the standard.

990
01:43:14,641 --> 01:43:20,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand it, but I think it's also something that should maybe be discussed more because that's going to be, could be difficult.

991
01:43:22,342 --> 01:43:35,039
[SPEAKER_02]: But also the protocol like I said for letting parents know I I sent I ended up emailing the results into my school nurse but that wasn't necessarily communicated to me that I needed to do I just figured they probably would want to know so.

992
01:43:42,724 --> 01:44:00,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so in terms of being symptom free we also take into consideration that they saw their pediatrician and may have been diagnosed with something else where we're not expecting them to be symptom free, but they might be recovered enough to be able to return which is why we're really asking people to reach out to their health care providers.

993
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:05,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they'll make the end diagnosis and determine the proper care in order to come back.

994
01:44:06,152 --> 01:44:07,752
[SPEAKER_15]: As nurses, we can't make diagnoses.

995
01:44:07,812 --> 01:44:14,154
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to make an informed judgment based off our assessment and ask that people go and see their provider.

996
01:44:14,174 --> 01:44:19,796
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank you for doing the right thing and keeping your child home and getting them tested and seeing your doctor.

997
01:44:19,816 --> 01:44:21,457
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly what we want parents to do.

998
01:44:21,977 --> 01:44:25,998
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think I agree, we could make it more evident to parents what we are requesting this year.

999
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:35,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we had a lot of communication with that last year, but as we've noted, we have parents that are doing this for the first time because they're either new to this district or they were remote last year.

1000
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can absolutely do some increased messaging on that from the nurse's office.

1001
01:44:39,841 --> 01:44:40,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1002
01:44:40,862 --> 01:44:41,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1003
01:44:41,162 --> 01:44:41,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1004
01:44:42,642 --> 01:44:50,024
[SPEAKER_05]: We have new business first resolution by member Rousseau, whereas the McGlynn playground continues to be in substandard conditions.

1005
01:44:50,646 --> 01:44:57,292
[SPEAKER_05]: The project for replacement is taking longer than initially anticipated and the mosquito-borne illness West Nile virus has been detected in Medford.

1006
01:44:57,872 --> 01:45:14,126
[SPEAKER_05]: An update on this project will be provided and a request will be made by the mayor to the Department of Public Works to clear the standing water at the playground whenever standing water is present to limit the opportunity for mosquito breeding, which could threaten our students and staff that use this playground.

1007
01:45:14,487 --> 01:45:14,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

1008
01:45:15,517 --> 01:45:16,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

1009
01:45:16,698 --> 01:45:20,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And I apologize if this isn't the normal way of asking you to do something.

1010
01:45:20,841 --> 01:45:32,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I just feel it's, you know, we're on the school committee getting it and it's, you know, because you're our chairperson, it feels like sort of an unusual opportunity that other districts don't have because the chair isn't usually the mayor.

1011
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:44,877
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, when I wrote this, which I believe was a week or two ago, there was standing water and, you know, I was getting flooded with stuff about West Nile and

1012
01:45:45,599 --> 01:45:48,081
[SPEAKER_11]: and it wasn't actually cold out already.

1013
01:45:49,021 --> 01:46:12,578
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is another resolution on here around the McGlynn, so I'm not gonna get into the specifics of the playground, but when I've heard that there's significant standing water that, not the morning after it rains, but like for days, that just seems like a really, like a bad thing that we,

1014
01:46:13,607 --> 01:46:14,648
[SPEAKER_11]: could really regret.

1015
01:46:15,588 --> 01:46:19,470
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know the effort involved with dealing with standing water.

1016
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:23,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not suggesting somebody gets out there with a broom.

1017
01:46:23,373 --> 01:46:24,694
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a huge playground.

1018
01:46:25,194 --> 01:46:33,839
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there is anything DPW can do to clear it so that it's not sitting there, that would be great.

1019
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:49,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can always just email my mayor or be long ago, Mayor Medford box and would get Department of Public Works right out there they have equipment to be able to handle this and they

1020
01:46:50,637 --> 01:46:59,344
[SPEAKER_05]: worked very hard during the last couple months when flooding was, we saw flooding places we've never seen it before.

1021
01:46:59,504 --> 01:47:14,616
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a really bad few storms, but we have our city engineer who's also assessing everywhere that doesn't have an assessment for flooding and coming up with some sort of plan to try to alleviate this so it doesn't happen again.

1022
01:47:15,017 --> 01:47:17,659
[SPEAKER_05]: But with climate change, we're where we are.

1023
01:47:22,963 --> 01:47:24,864
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a resident that would like to speak.

1024
01:47:25,024 --> 01:47:26,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I'm supposed to speak.

1025
01:47:27,545 --> 01:47:29,286
[SPEAKER_05]: You just name and address for the record, please.

1026
01:47:30,627 --> 01:47:31,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I good.

1027
01:47:31,327 --> 01:47:32,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, okay.

1028
01:47:32,828 --> 01:47:34,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Christine Fiorello I live at 747 Felsway in Medford.

1029
01:47:39,490 --> 01:47:49,516
[SPEAKER_13]: emailed school committee members as well as the mayor with my concerns about the McGlynn playground water stuff.

1030
01:47:50,537 --> 01:47:55,780
[SPEAKER_13]: It's rather confusing from this end to know where to go for certain information.

1031
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:05,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I did email folks in July and I thank everybody for responding and taking my concerns seriously.

1032
01:48:05,627 --> 01:48:07,848
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an old, old problem.

1033
01:48:07,908 --> 01:48:09,149
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not a new pro,

1034
01:48:09,703 --> 01:48:11,804
[SPEAKER_13]: problem at the McLean playground.

1035
01:48:13,405 --> 01:48:19,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I've just kind of been on it because now, because my grandson started attending first grade there this year.

1036
01:48:19,348 --> 01:48:25,512
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I took him to the playground in July, so he could get used to like, yeah, this is your new school, because he went to St.

1037
01:48:25,552 --> 01:48:34,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Ray's last year, you know, and I was like, man, there's like holes in the ground here, a kid's gonna break their ankle or, and then the water is just, it's a swamp.

1038
01:48:35,097 --> 01:48:36,598
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not just this year.

1039
01:48:38,138 --> 01:48:41,400
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a long standing problem.

1040
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:52,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when you get the phone things that say oh, get rid of your standing water because West Nile, and the entire playground is surrounded by standing water with green stuff on it and everything else.

1041
01:48:53,647 --> 01:48:58,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So I went down to the DPW, because I was told that there was a line.

1042
01:48:59,110 --> 01:49:01,852
[SPEAKER_13]: The fence out belongs to the city.

1043
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:06,107
[SPEAKER_13]: That's their responsibility, so to speak, and from the fence in.

1044
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:08,973
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the school department.

1045
01:49:09,554 --> 01:49:13,322
[SPEAKER_13]: So you've got two different groups that are trying to work but it appears to me.

1046
01:49:15,535 --> 01:49:17,296
[SPEAKER_13]: You all have more information than I have.

1047
01:49:17,316 --> 01:49:18,817
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really acknowledge that.

1048
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:25,521
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also understand that COVID is a much bigger problem than this, but it still needs to be resolved.

1049
01:49:25,681 --> 01:49:33,485
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I go down to DPW and I talked to the commissioner there and he's like, well, I don't know anything about it.

1050
01:49:33,685 --> 01:49:37,767
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, well, you know, there must've been drains when the place was first built.

1051
01:49:39,088 --> 01:49:40,169
[SPEAKER_13]: He knows nothing about it.

1052
01:49:41,289 --> 01:49:42,130
[SPEAKER_13]: He'll look into it.

1053
01:49:43,214 --> 01:49:48,157
[SPEAKER_13]: I asked about the gate because the gate, the poles are bent.

1054
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:54,501
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know if that's because it's sinking or if a plow hit it, but the gates cannot be closed.

1055
01:49:54,681 --> 01:50:00,144
[SPEAKER_13]: They can be closed, but as soon as somebody opens them, they're now at an angle digging into the ground.

1056
01:50:00,605 --> 01:50:01,345
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not safe.

1057
01:50:01,385 --> 01:50:03,947
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just a matter of the ground, but somebody is gonna fall over that.

1058
01:50:04,087 --> 01:50:10,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And personally, I don't know why we have a gate there because all you have to do is walk around the corner and get into the playground.

1059
01:50:10,310 --> 01:50:12,392
[SPEAKER_13]: You really don't need a gate there.

1060
01:50:13,753 --> 01:50:23,727
[SPEAKER_13]: spoke to fell at dbw he said he could look into fixing the gate or just put fencing across there, because you really ultimately don't need a gate.

1061
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:28,033
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, an engineer has to come out to look at the water.

1062
01:50:29,817 --> 01:50:31,378
[SPEAKER_13]: because it's a serious drainage problem.

1063
01:50:31,519 --> 01:50:35,362
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just every time it rains, it's there all the time.

1064
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:44,871
[SPEAKER_13]: So DPW would literally have to set up a tent and be there 24 hours to be able to get rid of the water because it's just always there.

1065
01:50:44,891 --> 01:50:54,761
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand from hearing different people here, and most recently the woman who's in charge of the PTO, Beth McGlynn, that

1066
01:50:55,966 --> 01:51:01,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Conversations about this have been going on for a long time as far as replacing the playground.

1067
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:05,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Personally, I think the play structures are the least of the problems.

1068
01:51:05,413 --> 01:51:15,900
[SPEAKER_13]: They've held up well for 20 years in comparison to some of the city parks that were 20 years old and much worse shape, but the holes in the ground are not okay.

1069
01:51:16,481 --> 01:51:23,386
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would think that people would be concerned for liability because if somebody goes into one of those holes, they're going to break an ankle or a foot.

1070
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:35,113
[SPEAKER_13]: replace the ground covering because of the cost presently, it seems to me that somebody with a background in building should know how to fill those holes.

1071
01:51:35,413 --> 01:51:46,457
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, to me, you could put just gravel and pack that gravel solid in those holes so when a kid runs across it, they're not going to put their foot in it.

1072
01:51:48,728 --> 01:51:58,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean that's a like a lawsuit waiting to happen and I'm actually kind of surprised that nobody's been hurt up till now because there are at least three significant holes in that ground covering.

1073
01:51:59,339 --> 01:52:05,486
[SPEAKER_13]: So the ground covering seems to me, if it's two years down the line before we're going to get any money to do anything something has to be done.

1074
01:52:06,427 --> 01:52:07,067
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime.

1075
01:52:08,738 --> 01:52:11,040
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, the gate, the holes, and then the water.

1076
01:52:11,721 --> 01:52:20,870
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be years, I'm guessing, before anything is done to redo the playground.

1077
01:52:22,191 --> 01:52:26,175
[SPEAKER_13]: But that doesn't mean that we can just have that water sitting there.

1078
01:52:26,855 --> 01:52:32,861
[SPEAKER_13]: And if that's outside the playground, can't something be done in the meantime

1079
01:52:33,449 --> 01:52:41,938
[SPEAKER_13]: to get that water to start pooling in that area and obviously it would take a civil engineer to take a look at that and give us you know some ideas.

1080
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:53,810
[SPEAKER_13]: So I realized that all different people are working on it, but when you're me at home trying to figure out who I reach out to and who has all the information

1081
01:52:55,167 --> 01:52:57,208
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't seem to be one place.

1082
01:52:57,508 --> 01:53:01,409
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I said, DPW, I thought would be really involved.

1083
01:53:01,469 --> 01:53:03,810
[SPEAKER_13]: But then when I go down there, they're like, yeah, well, I don't know.

1084
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:04,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they were very nice.

1085
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:05,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't get me wrong.

1086
01:53:05,471 --> 01:53:07,411
[SPEAKER_13]: And they answer my phone calls.

1087
01:53:07,731 --> 01:53:09,552
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, gee, when the engineer goes out, can I go?

1088
01:53:09,572 --> 01:53:12,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm kind of curious as to what goes on here.

1089
01:53:14,594 --> 01:53:15,234
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't want to.

1090
01:53:15,254 --> 01:53:16,314
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not throwing stones.

1091
01:53:16,374 --> 01:53:22,717
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just trying to figure out the best way to continue to get information about what's going on.

1092
01:53:24,795 --> 01:53:38,964
[SPEAKER_13]: And somebody to look at seriously, those basic safety issues have to be taken care of short-term, not long-term, when the entire playground is either redone and shrunk, because that's a huge playground.

1093
01:53:39,825 --> 01:53:47,670
[SPEAKER_13]: And it also gets a lot more wear and tear because of the location, where it's at, what the field's there and everything.

1094
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:52,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Considering, I think, the actual play structures have held up pretty well.

1095
01:53:54,037 --> 01:54:02,266
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't like the thought of my grandson being out there when half of the ground is covered with mold or mildew and then this green stuff, you know, all over the edge.

1096
01:54:03,267 --> 01:54:08,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I want to say first thank you for, I'm sorry I'm having a hard time hearing you.

1097
01:54:11,028 --> 01:54:12,810
[SPEAKER_14]: We're sharing a microphone Can you hear me better now.

1098
01:54:13,671 --> 01:54:18,276
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say thank you for, you know, bringing your concerns forward.

1099
01:54:18,996 --> 01:54:25,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was going to say our next resolution offered by member Graham is going to address it.

1100
01:54:26,064 --> 01:54:28,466
[SPEAKER_14]: The McGlynn playground is a.

1101
01:54:29,467 --> 01:54:33,029
[SPEAKER_14]: is a very large project that is on everyone's radar.

1102
01:54:33,689 --> 01:54:35,450
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're trying to get the ball rolling.

1103
01:54:35,791 --> 01:54:39,693
[SPEAKER_14]: And member Graham will be able to speak more specifically to that.

1104
01:54:41,073 --> 01:54:54,000
[SPEAKER_14]: But the hope is that we will be able to get movement on the playground sooner rather than later, it will take time, but we are going to try to get that surface fixed and fixed properly, so that we're not dealing with all of the

1105
01:54:55,201 --> 01:55:11,149
[SPEAKER_13]: the water challenges etc that you were talking about and I understand it's a long-term project but we can't wait two years for holes to be fixed that a child or an adult is going to get hurt in or for that water to be somehow resolved.

1106
01:55:11,749 --> 01:55:18,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk to the city engineer who probably this is not on his radar to see if he can look into the drainage issues and then I'm going to read

1107
01:55:18,916 --> 01:55:25,920
[SPEAKER_05]: if you don't mind member Graham's next resolution, we can kind of combine them a bit because this will help us a lot.

1108
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:48,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the design study to replace the McGlynn playground was delayed by COVID-19 pandemic and whereas unstructured outdoor play promotes the development of important social emotional skills, be it resolved that the school committee authorizes up to 2000 to conduct a playground safety inspection by a certified playground safety inspector at the McGlynn elementary school playground as quickly as possible

1109
01:55:49,193 --> 01:55:56,385
[SPEAKER_05]: be it further resolved that the results of the inspection are presented to the committee, so that identified safety concerns can be remedied expeditiously.

1110
01:55:56,746 --> 01:55:57,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1111
01:55:58,252 --> 01:55:58,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1112
01:55:58,832 --> 01:56:07,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So, as you noted, the RFP process that we've been talking about is getting underway.

1113
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:13,962
[SPEAKER_08]: It was delayed, and we are looking at ways to expedite that now.

1114
01:56:14,963 --> 01:56:20,147
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the playground needs to be able to be used tomorrow and the next day and the next day.

1115
01:56:21,107 --> 01:56:42,122
[SPEAKER_08]: My hope is that the committee will join me in asking for us to do an audit, a safety inspection of the playground right now so that we can identify anything that is critical and find a way to remediate it right now while we keep our eye on the RFP that needs to go out so that we can select a design vendor

1116
01:56:42,662 --> 01:56:51,584
[SPEAKER_08]: who can engage the community about what that space really could or should be in a way that is, I think, more economical than the current design allows for.

1117
01:56:52,724 --> 01:57:08,827
[SPEAKER_08]: That surface, I think for the public, when we went after grants for resurfacing all of the playgrounds at the elementary schools, that surface was like five times the cost of each other elementary school individually.

1118
01:57:09,487 --> 01:57:11,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's because it is such a large area.

1119
01:57:13,534 --> 01:57:21,327
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have the good fortune of some local experts in playground design, who have been participating in the discussion.

1120
01:57:22,085 --> 01:57:31,287
[SPEAKER_08]: and really encouraging us to think about sort of the bigger picture, right, around accessibility and interest among students.

1121
01:57:31,347 --> 01:57:34,868
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you make a playground like that interesting for both elementary school and middle school students?

1122
01:57:35,248 --> 01:57:39,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's sort of why this design study was inserted into the process.

1123
01:57:39,569 --> 01:57:49,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So unfortunately it was inserted into the process and then COVID took us in a, you know, obviously a very different direction, but I think the design study will,

1124
01:57:50,112 --> 01:57:54,974
[SPEAKER_08]: pay off in spades for the community and really produce something wonderful.

1125
01:57:56,494 --> 01:58:05,538
[SPEAKER_08]: As we go forward, but that doesn't mean that in the meantime, we can be okay with standing water and holes that somebody is going to sort of twist an ankle on or worse.

1126
01:58:06,598 --> 01:58:11,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So the safety inspection, I think, will allow us to do both things at the same time.

1127
01:58:11,662 --> 01:58:22,290
[SPEAKER_08]: One is make sure that playground is as safe as it can be while we acknowledge that it is at the end of its life and sort of move forward expeditiously on this RFP so that we can get that process moving.

1128
01:58:23,311 --> 01:58:32,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also wondering if there is an environmentalist in the city that knows something about the grounds there because it almost appears like it's wetland at this point.

1129
01:58:32,878 --> 01:58:33,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you go

1130
01:58:34,604 --> 01:58:47,993
[SPEAKER_13]: 50 feet beyond that that fence it's like a swamp, so I don't know if the rivers proximity is also contributing and they may be something beyond just an engineer, maybe you know somebody who's familiar with.

1131
01:58:49,194 --> 01:58:53,917
[SPEAKER_13]: With areas around rivers that that may be able to offer some suggestions.

1132
01:58:54,372 --> 01:59:09,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and that will be part of the design study that happens is really grappling with that space, which does sit right next to the river, which is in a floodplain, as we talk about climate change going forward and other things.

1133
01:59:09,726 --> 01:59:13,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So whoever is ultimately selected for the design study will have

1134
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:29,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Really a comprehensive order to look at the realities of the site, look at best practice and playground design which frankly, none of our other elementary schools are a best practice of playground design in 2021 they were when they were built many years ago.

1135
01:59:30,708 --> 01:59:41,637
[SPEAKER_08]: but we have an opportunity here to do something different and really bring that space, especially being sort of in the middle of the city where it is to a different place.

1136
01:59:42,157 --> 01:59:49,964
[SPEAKER_08]: But they also will have to grapple with climate change and what is going on in the ground and the drainage and all the other things that are the realities of that site.

1137
01:59:50,084 --> 01:59:56,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and we've also asked, we also will be asking that in that organization to

1138
01:59:57,211 --> 02:00:03,934
[SPEAKER_08]: significantly engage the community so that the school community itself can be part of the process.

1139
02:00:03,974 --> 02:00:06,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So lots to come.

1140
02:00:06,155 --> 02:00:09,157
[SPEAKER_13]: How would we know when the safety study is done?

1141
02:00:09,577 --> 02:00:14,199
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to be reported to the school committee at a later meeting.

1142
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:17,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, that's part of the resolution, that it be presented to us.

1143
02:00:18,406 --> 02:00:35,032
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think once it's presented, we can also make sure that the PTO gets a copy of the report so that it can be distributed amongst the families at the McGlynn as well, which I think would be really reasonable for us to be able to accomplish.

1144
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:40,034
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would think that's a really easy thing for us to do to make sure that you all have the information.

1145
02:00:41,315 --> 02:00:47,057
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if there are other updates about the RFP timeline, Superintendent, or

1146
02:00:47,718 --> 02:00:53,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And if not, we can maybe talk about that at our next meeting so that we can keep track of that as well.

1147
02:00:54,403 --> 02:00:55,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

1148
02:00:56,584 --> 02:00:56,965
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion.

1149
02:00:56,985 --> 02:00:57,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of order, ma'am.

1150
02:00:59,386 --> 02:01:00,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

1151
02:01:00,847 --> 02:01:02,969
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two motions on the floor right now.

1152
02:01:03,129 --> 02:01:07,132
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to clarify where we're at, I believe.

1153
02:01:08,155 --> 02:01:13,598
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would make a friendly recommendation that perhaps these motions could be merged.

1154
02:01:14,238 --> 02:01:19,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to merge the resolutions, seconded by Member Ruseau.

1155
02:01:19,821 --> 02:01:20,661
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1156
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:21,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1157
02:01:21,542 --> 02:01:22,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Those approved.

1158
02:01:23,223 --> 02:01:24,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions are merged.

1159
02:01:24,443 --> 02:01:28,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a motion on the floor for approval by Member- Motion to approve.

1160
02:01:28,405 --> 02:01:34,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1174
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:48,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1176
02:01:50,784 --> 02:01:52,086
[SPEAKER_05]: The papers pass.

1177
02:01:52,842 --> 02:02:08,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Member McLaughlin, thank you and I just wanted to make a last point that was made to me also specifically about this playground that the playground is used, not just by the McGlynn school, but it is in fact a city playground that is often used by community members.

1178
02:02:09,272 --> 02:02:23,998
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, that convergence between city and school really need to be recognized as we're seeing in the motion and across a lot of our business in the city that we're considering both of those items with respect to the playground.

1179
02:02:24,198 --> 02:02:25,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

1180
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:32,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three offered by member Rousseau in light of rapidly increasing COVID-19 positive cases in Medford.

1181
02:02:33,742 --> 02:02:41,049
[SPEAKER_05]: low vaccination rate of our eligible students, the nearly 2000 students that are not yet eligible for vaccination, the importance of contact tracing.

1182
02:02:41,649 --> 02:02:47,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And here it's to put protocols designed to limit exposure of our students and staff when positive cases arise.

1183
02:02:47,855 --> 02:02:52,819
[SPEAKER_05]: The protocols for contact tracing and communication for close contacts will be presented.

1184
02:02:55,041 --> 02:02:56,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to present or

1185
02:02:57,210 --> 02:02:58,070
[SPEAKER_11]: could I speak first?

1186
02:02:58,311 --> 02:02:58,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau.

1187
02:02:59,211 --> 02:03:00,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mayor.

1188
02:03:01,652 --> 02:03:14,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Earlier in the evening, under the public health update, there was actually one element of the public health update that I think was going to be presented, but then we moved along too quickly.

1189
02:03:14,819 --> 02:03:17,541
[SPEAKER_11]: It was around the NPS personnel vaccination status.

1190
02:03:18,381 --> 02:03:25,165
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seems relevant and perhaps an okay time to include that.

1191
02:03:25,285 --> 02:03:25,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I

1192
02:03:26,197 --> 02:03:30,618
[SPEAKER_11]: believe Mr. Murphy was literally about to speak about it, but then we moved along.

1193
02:03:30,798 --> 02:03:40,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know at our last meeting, we did discuss that this was gonna be presented tonight and it has not been presented and it's not on our website yet.

1194
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:44,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just feels like the public has kind of been waiting.

1195
02:03:45,282 --> 02:03:54,405
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, if that could be part of the presentation, if there will be one.

1196
02:03:57,778 --> 02:03:58,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1197
02:03:59,178 --> 02:03:59,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

1198
02:04:01,779 --> 02:04:02,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1199
02:04:02,099 --> 02:04:06,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering a little clarification on the motion if we can.

1200
02:04:07,781 --> 02:04:12,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It's saying the protocols for contact tracing and communication for close contacts will be presented.

1201
02:04:12,982 --> 02:04:24,085
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm unclear if member Ruseau is asking that additionally the vaccination rate will be included or whether that's being asked for

1202
02:04:25,098 --> 02:04:27,119
[SPEAKER_09]: to be part of the presentation tonight, number one.

1203
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:31,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, the protocols for contact tracing and communication for close contacts.

1204
02:04:31,863 --> 02:04:39,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like we've had the conversation a couple of times tonight, but I feel like it hasn't really been presented to the community in terms of what that looks like.

1205
02:04:39,328 --> 02:04:45,673
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what I'm understanding this motion to be, but would love a little clarification from my colleague, if I might.

1206
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:46,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1207
02:04:48,142 --> 02:05:04,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I wrote this, you know, I know we have the you know the covert exposure guidance, and we've had many conversations that I feel like are really providing clarity, but, you know, in the medical world protocols are literally written down in black and white.

1208
02:05:06,057 --> 02:05:10,038
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not education, they're not training.

1209
02:05:11,578 --> 02:05:13,158
[SPEAKER_11]: You read this, you do this.

1210
02:05:14,339 --> 02:05:31,402
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just feel like while I'm hearing that we have some really great stuff going on, consistency, which has been referenced over and over again, is critical, but consistency requires that there is no question about what it is people are supposed to be doing.

1211
02:05:31,907 --> 02:05:53,739
[SPEAKER_11]: So I envisioned that protocols, meaning written documentation, and it doesn't have to be a PowerPoint, it can just be Google Docs or something, of how we do contact tracing, how do we communicate with families around close contacts, so that every nurse in every situation in every school is following the same exact protocols.

1212
02:05:53,799 --> 02:05:56,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they're not protocols, then that's OK.

1213
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:57,661
[SPEAKER_11]: We just call them what they are.

1214
02:05:58,421 --> 02:06:00,302
[SPEAKER_11]: But I hear the word protocols over and over again.

1215
02:06:00,743 --> 02:06:01,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Protocols are?

1216
02:06:02,487 --> 02:06:08,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody, a new nurse could show up tomorrow in our school system, be handed the protocols and would know what to do.

1217
02:06:09,352 --> 02:06:10,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to know that we have those.

1218
02:06:10,973 --> 02:06:14,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1219
02:06:15,176 --> 02:06:15,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

1220
02:06:16,037 --> 02:06:17,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, then Mr. Murphy.

1221
02:06:17,538 --> 02:06:25,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just if I can, is that not, I mean, I know that this, I believe that this is what that, this document was attempting to do, is that right?

1222
02:06:26,025 --> 02:06:35,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Murphy, I think there's a step or two missing regarding the physician's letter, which certainly I would recommend, but I'm wondering if that's what the intent of this was.

1223
02:06:36,029 --> 02:06:42,372
[SPEAKER_01]: If the document in your hand is the one that I think it is, that is correct, but that is part of what the communication protocols are.

1224
02:06:42,452 --> 02:06:43,573
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little far away.

1225
02:06:45,834 --> 02:07:06,020
[SPEAKER_01]: We took Mr. Rousseau's motion to essentially be a request for the administration to elaborate upon the internal communication protocols that are used to ensure that once close contacts are identified, that all due diligence is applied to ensure that the information has been shared with the affected parties.

1226
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:12,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did touch, I thought we touched upon that briefly, but it's certainly something that in the next public health update,

1227
02:07:12,482 --> 02:07:18,406
[SPEAKER_01]: we could expand upon to make sure that there are more details and specificity that are provided.

1228
02:07:18,726 --> 02:07:23,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just say briefly so that we don't leave anyone in suspense over the course of the next two weeks, that Ms.

1229
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:41,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines' department, her staff does in fact make sure that they have actually contacted an individual and spoken with them and there are follow-up phone calls that are made prior to the next school day to ensure that everyone has the information that they need when close contacts are identified.

1230
02:07:42,212 --> 02:07:58,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just say sort of a little more than anecdotally that there has been no, I don't know of any specific instance, and I can say with certainty that there's been no systemic problem with respect to individuals coming into school after they've been identified as a close contact.

1231
02:07:59,380 --> 02:07:59,620
[SPEAKER_01]: As Ms.

1232
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:09,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Hinds has said, we have had a challenge with individuals coming into school when they're symptomatic and seeking a test, despite the protocols being that if you're symptomatic that you're to stay home.

1233
02:08:09,418 --> 02:08:13,942
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been a challenge and one that we continue to communicate about at every opportunity that we have.

1234
02:08:14,702 --> 02:08:25,951
[SPEAKER_01]: But with regard to close contacts coming in, we really haven't seen that in part, I think not in large part, because of the efforts of the health services staff, making sure that everyone who has that information, who needs that information gets it.

1235
02:08:26,892 --> 02:08:37,901
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that sort of, I guess I just did elaborate in response to your motion, but if you'd like that to be published somewhere in order to expand upon the document that Ms.

1236
02:08:37,941 --> 02:08:38,722
[SPEAKER_01]: McLaughlin refers to,

1237
02:08:39,267 --> 02:08:41,929
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that there's absolute clarity in that, we'd be happy to do that.

1238
02:08:43,650 --> 02:08:49,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you need an additional report beyond what I just said, but if you'd like one, we're happy to send it along.

1239
02:08:50,774 --> 02:08:52,535
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that satisfies the motion.

1240
02:08:52,555 --> 02:08:53,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

1241
02:08:53,395 --> 02:08:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

1242
02:08:54,576 --> 02:08:58,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be perfectly satisfied if it was just something that shows up on the website and you let us know.

1243
02:09:00,159 --> 02:09:00,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to Ms.

1244
02:09:00,679 --> 02:09:05,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Kreatz's point earlier, I think we'll try to expand upon the concentration of documents.

1245
02:09:05,142 --> 02:09:07,263
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the website, which is undergoing

1246
02:09:08,119 --> 02:09:11,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Various revisions to try and make it more efficient and more user friendly.

1247
02:09:11,724 --> 02:09:16,971
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been an attempt to try to keep it cleaner to have all only up to date information.

1248
02:09:17,825 --> 02:09:26,768
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we could expand upon the COVID section to give you all the information, including I'll just throw in because I know that one of the community members may have sent an email with respect to this.

1249
02:09:27,268 --> 02:09:34,531
[SPEAKER_01]: The discrepancy on elementary actual participation is attributable to the kindergarten shift in protocols that happened midweek last week.

1250
02:09:35,071 --> 02:09:40,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So those numbers that we were looking at at Robertson-Missituk is because our snapshot did not fully take into account

1251
02:09:41,713 --> 02:09:46,714
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that we had switched to individual PCR testing of kindergarten students rather than pool testing.

1252
02:09:47,034 --> 02:09:50,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you were seeing that that percentages that we were referring to earlier.

1253
02:09:50,395 --> 02:09:53,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize for any confusion that that might have caused.

1254
02:09:54,296 --> 02:09:55,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, Member McLaughlin.

1255
02:09:56,437 --> 02:10:03,799
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could make a friendly suggestion regarding this graphic, if we could, if you may consider

1256
02:10:05,416 --> 02:10:16,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Because some of it is also just a little unclear to me as I'm reading it just in a narrative, for example, unvaccinated with or without symptoms should test immediately if experiencing symptoms, which I get that.

1257
02:10:17,323 --> 02:10:23,028
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, then test after five days and quarantine for seven days until student has a negative PCR test.

1258
02:10:23,408 --> 02:10:27,372
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit difficult for, you know, I'm not fully understanding that.

1259
02:10:27,412 --> 02:10:29,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So if not, then test after five days.

1260
02:10:29,854 --> 02:10:35,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that mean that student is still in school for the testing after, you know, until they test after five days?

1261
02:10:36,099 --> 02:10:38,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if they're found positive, they quarantine for seven days.

1262
02:10:39,142 --> 02:10:42,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a little bit unclear, and I just would have a lay person

1263
02:10:43,265 --> 02:10:55,692
[SPEAKER_09]: read this with you, perhaps, or a parent or somebody to make sure that, you know, it's really explicit because I think it might be a lot easier for folks that have been doing it for a long time to understand than perhaps lay people.

1264
02:10:56,993 --> 02:10:57,393
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.

1265
02:10:57,473 --> 02:11:05,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was actually generated by the Board of Health, but I certainly will take it and we'll make whatever adjustments are necessary to make sure that it's as clear as possible.

1266
02:11:05,478 --> 02:11:11,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I will work with COVID's communication director as well to make any updates.

1267
02:11:11,607 --> 02:11:15,628
[SPEAKER_15]: I do just want to add that we've worked with specific PTO members to make this as well.

1268
02:11:15,648 --> 02:11:22,811
[SPEAKER_15]: So there were lay people involved in the, in making this with the board of health and myself.

1269
02:11:22,911 --> 02:11:34,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard when you want to condense it to just a certain, you know, certain amount of texts that it's readable and understandable, but yes, it can get, it's just a hard topic to understand with so many variables.

1270
02:11:35,853 --> 02:11:46,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin if you're finished I'm going to go to yeah I just I just and to your point there it is hard to condense and so I think the budget, the bullets could be helpful but also just in terms of translation.

1271
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:55,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I do find some of this and you know I consider myself educated, but I find some of this a little bit confusing and I understand, you know, I'm glad that there was collaboration

1272
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,100
[SPEAKER_09]: cross effort.

1273
02:11:57,160 --> 02:12:11,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to simplify it or ask the staff to simplify it as much as possible and then perhaps also run it by the folks who speak the languages that we'll be translating it into to make sure that it's translatable as well.

1274
02:12:13,157 --> 02:12:14,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you member so thank you.

1275
02:12:15,098 --> 02:12:24,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean when I when I look at this this this can't be the protocol the nurses use because there's nothing to do, there's nothing in here that says anything about students who don't have consents to test for instance.

1276
02:12:25,264 --> 02:12:35,750
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm fine with a document that targeted, where the audiences, you know, the general public or parents that that should look very different than one that the nursing staff is using.

1277
02:12:36,470 --> 02:12:39,913
[SPEAKER_11]: But none of this takes into consideration what if the student doesn't?

1278
02:12:40,233 --> 02:12:49,940
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the tested positive for COVID-19, zero students without a consent will ever be tested positive for COVID-19 in our schools.

1279
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just want to be very clear.

1280
02:12:51,741 --> 02:12:53,902
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one document.

1281
02:12:54,703 --> 02:12:55,884
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have other protocols.

1282
02:12:55,904 --> 02:12:57,164
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have other documents.

1283
02:12:58,005 --> 02:13:02,788
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more information in the universe of documents that we're using to communicate to families.

1284
02:13:03,269 --> 02:13:04,750
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just one single document.

1285
02:13:05,402 --> 02:13:08,524
[SPEAKER_01]: produced by the Board of Health in collaboration with PTOs to try to help.

1286
02:13:08,604 --> 02:13:19,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I think though, I take the message of the committee to be that we have to continue to reaffirm our continuous commitment to improved communication to make sure that we can be as clear as possible.

1287
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:32,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot represent, I don't think anyone can represent that there will be no questions or any confusion in part because when you receive a phone call saying that you've either been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a close contact, oftentimes,

1288
02:13:33,550 --> 02:13:41,271
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how good our communication was beforehand, there's going to be a need for additional questions and information sharing.

1289
02:13:41,591 --> 02:13:53,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we have a very strong health services staff who, just to be clear, because again, if you're only watching this sliver of the conversation, you might be under the impression that the Medford Public Schools is really struggling with adherence to these protocols.

1290
02:13:53,353 --> 02:13:54,794
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that's accurate.

1291
02:13:54,934 --> 02:13:56,274
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually doing fairly well.

1292
02:13:56,554 --> 02:14:01,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a continued reminder that this year has actually gone fairly well.

1293
02:14:02,983 --> 02:14:17,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Very well member of and include needs to present to the school nurse, a physical copy of the PCR test.

1294
02:14:22,783 --> 02:14:24,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so they will.

1295
02:14:24,985 --> 02:14:30,909
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to make it abundantly clear that this is absolutely not the only thing that we provide parents when we're doing contact tracing.

1296
02:14:31,389 --> 02:14:36,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Contact tracing will always include a phone call, whether it's with us or with also a translator.

1297
02:14:36,073 --> 02:14:41,156
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been using a lot of translation services in order to reach those families that might not be able to speak English.

1298
02:14:42,898 --> 02:14:55,747
[SPEAKER_15]: So we always have a phone call, whether it's calling all 10 numbers listed on whatever emergency forms we have, there are nights where I'm calling parents at 10pm and then again at 6am just to make sure I can get in contact with them before the next school day.

1299
02:14:56,467 --> 02:15:05,354
[SPEAKER_15]: We follow up that phone call with an email and we have a template for that email so that it is consistent messaging across all the schools with our close contact protocol.

1300
02:15:06,114 --> 02:15:07,614
[SPEAKER_15]: included in that email.

1301
02:15:08,015 --> 02:15:28,340
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have the Massachusetts Department of Public Health quarantine guidelines attached to that email as well, which is also translated on their website included in that is if they are personally in school and being dismissed having been determined to close contact while in school, the school nurse will have a face to face conversation with who's picking them up.

1302
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,940
[SPEAKER_15]: and give them printed copies of it as well.

1303
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:36,461
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is one of many resources we use when we're trying to contact parents.

1304
02:15:38,922 --> 02:15:41,102
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can absolutely provide you with all those.

1305
02:15:41,182 --> 02:15:46,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I have them in a Google Drive ready to go for whenever nurses need them, which is unfortunately more frequently than not.

1306
02:15:47,783 --> 02:15:52,704
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're available and parents have been seeing them, but we can make them available to you as well.

1307
02:15:53,745 --> 02:15:53,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor?

1308
02:15:55,285 --> 02:15:55,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

1309
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:57,561
[SPEAKER_11]: I just would like to say thank you.

1310
02:15:58,862 --> 02:16:19,657
[SPEAKER_11]: As Mr. Murphy and I have talked about this sort of ad nauseum over the last year, or since he started, which was just barely over a year, that our school system's capacity for system thinking and doing things at a systemic approach is

1311
02:16:21,347 --> 02:16:22,308
[SPEAKER_11]: not where it needs to be.

1312
02:16:22,948 --> 02:16:34,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And so for me, I didn't come at this with the assumption that we had good systems in place, because frankly, we don't have good systems in place in many parts of our school system, and we're working on it.

1313
02:16:35,554 --> 02:16:38,475
[SPEAKER_11]: But this sounds actually really quite excellent.

1314
02:16:38,555 --> 02:16:40,196
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually an example.

1315
02:16:40,756 --> 02:16:41,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1316
02:16:41,477 --> 02:16:43,758
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that we only have one of two classes a week.

1317
02:16:44,362 --> 02:16:49,884
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we have had no examples of close contacts forcing their way into a building is because Ms.

1318
02:16:49,904 --> 02:16:51,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines and her staff, and before that, Ms.

1319
02:16:52,124 --> 02:16:55,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Ray and her staff, of which Ms.

1320
02:16:55,045 --> 02:17:09,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines was an important member, have developed a system and a protocol that has taxed our school nurses, to be sure, that is not the easiest to execute or implement, and that if we were, and I appreciate Ms.

1321
02:17:09,750 --> 02:17:12,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines suggesting that we can show you some of the other templates, and that may be helpful,

1322
02:17:13,194 --> 02:17:16,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to also put out a disclaimer that there are.

1323
02:17:18,145 --> 02:17:25,908
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many different layers to the systems that we have that has kept students in school, and that has kept students and staff generally safe.

1324
02:17:26,648 --> 02:17:44,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't, frankly, in any type of using the amount of time that we have, efficiently show you every single step along the way, including all of the responses that we have to execute on an hourly basis when there are variations, because the same fact pattern never repeats itself twice.

1325
02:17:45,656 --> 02:17:50,939
[SPEAKER_01]: But the systems in this regard have worked fairly well, which is why I continue.

1326
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:58,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And that includes the systems we've put in place to try to generate vaccination rates, which is information I'd be happy to share if the committee would like to briefly hear that.

1327
02:17:59,506 --> 02:18:00,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

1328
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:04,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.

1329
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:09,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So, sorry, we have a high level of specificity.

1330
02:18:10,783 --> 02:18:23,669
[SPEAKER_01]: We have looked at it at this point at each building community, and each building community is hovering in the vicinity of 90% I'd rather not go into the very very specific detail the percentage but no building is lower than 86.4%.

1331
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:29,992
[SPEAKER_01]: and every other building is 90% or above in terms of staff vaccination rates.

1332
02:18:30,392 --> 02:18:33,693
[SPEAKER_01]: The other reason I'm not going into a higher level of specificity right now is Ms.

1333
02:18:33,733 --> 02:18:43,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Hines and her staff are still now going through and identifying individual staff members one by one for whom we have not heard from and ascertaining

1334
02:18:45,178 --> 02:18:52,043
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not the individual is going to comply with the proof of vaccination requirements that is in place for the vast majority of our employees.

1335
02:18:52,523 --> 02:18:57,826
[SPEAKER_01]: We still do have two bargaining units, as you know, that have not yet joined the agreement that all other bargaining units have.

1336
02:18:58,326 --> 02:18:59,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Those conversations are ongoing.

1337
02:18:59,927 --> 02:19:01,008
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been constructive.

1338
02:19:01,748 --> 02:19:10,854
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate their partnership, and we look forward to hopefully having everyone under agreement soon, and we'll consider all options as necessary if that turns out not to be the case.

1339
02:19:13,348 --> 02:19:18,550
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that, well, these numbers, as I said, hover around 90% between 90 and 95% generally.

1340
02:19:19,430 --> 02:19:25,633
[SPEAKER_01]: That also includes a number of part time hourly workers who it's sort of understandable that we just haven't heard from yet.

1341
02:19:26,773 --> 02:19:32,896
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the requirement is in place for all non unit personnel, whether they're part time hourly full time.

1342
02:19:33,486 --> 02:19:39,568
[SPEAKER_01]: salary or whatever, it's just going to take more time, frankly, for those conversations for us to grab all that data.

1343
02:19:39,588 --> 02:19:47,390
[SPEAKER_01]: But based on what we've seen so far, it's my expectation that numbers will just continue to go up over the course of the next week or two.

1344
02:19:47,810 --> 02:20:01,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll get into the subsequent conversations about what, as an organization, we have to do to eventually get to 100% vaccination, which, as we've stated before, is our goal, taking into account the exemptions that we've previously discussed.

1345
02:20:03,312 --> 02:20:09,476
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, the short message is that we've had encouraging news with respect to our vaccination amongst staff.

1346
02:20:11,617 --> 02:20:12,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1347
02:20:13,098 --> 02:20:14,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have one quick question.

1348
02:20:15,739 --> 02:20:16,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

1349
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:16,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1350
02:20:19,802 --> 02:20:30,268
[SPEAKER_11]: When a staff member has had COVID and can't get vaccinated yet, will you be counting them in the vaccinated numbers so that we're not... It would be one of the exemptions.

1351
02:20:30,838 --> 02:20:35,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but if we could just I don't know how many that is but you know.

1352
02:20:36,362 --> 02:20:42,447
[SPEAKER_11]: If we just go purely by have you gotten the shot and they can't get the shot that would be awful to say we're not at 100% when we.

1353
02:20:44,237 --> 02:20:55,724
[SPEAKER_01]: really eventually when we're ready to when all the conversations are done with all the bargaining units and we're able to share this information in greater detail, we'll disaggregate appropriately so that the types of exemptions that were granted.

1354
02:20:57,025 --> 02:21:02,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I think frankly, that would just be encompassed by the medical exemptions because that would be the basis for it.

1355
02:21:02,088 --> 02:21:05,450
[SPEAKER_01]: But frankly, it might turn out to be the majority.

1356
02:21:05,531 --> 02:21:11,714
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say also, just from what I've seen so far in the data, it's not going to move the needle significantly in terms of our overall rate.

1357
02:21:15,165 --> 02:21:18,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval as amended, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1358
02:21:18,548 --> 02:21:19,409
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1359
02:21:19,429 --> 02:21:19,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1360
02:21:20,210 --> 02:21:20,990
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1361
02:21:21,791 --> 02:21:22,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper passes.

1362
02:21:23,212 --> 02:21:25,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to be clear, you do want the report based on that?

1363
02:21:26,215 --> 02:21:28,798
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was as amended to just put it on the website.

1364
02:21:29,178 --> 02:21:29,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

1365
02:21:29,738 --> 02:21:30,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the website, it will go.

1366
02:21:31,140 --> 02:21:31,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1367
02:21:31,620 --> 02:21:31,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1368
02:21:35,043 --> 02:21:37,205
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two condolences.

1369
02:21:38,366 --> 02:21:38,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Three.

1370
02:21:40,525 --> 02:21:41,406
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one on the next page, too.

1371
02:21:41,426 --> 02:21:42,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, three.

1372
02:21:43,127 --> 02:21:58,918
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Leslie George Budd Hollenbeck, father of Jan Hollenbeck, a coordinator of related services, secondary transition, section 504, and assistive technology.

1373
02:22:00,299 --> 02:22:08,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Louise Marie Duffy Riley, a longtime school crossing guard for the

1374
02:22:10,025 --> 02:22:10,725
[SPEAKER_05]: MDC.

1375
02:22:13,307 --> 02:22:24,353
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Mary Canaley Mulgrew, sister-in-law of former Medford High School teacher and coach, Frank Jewett.

1376
02:22:25,294 --> 02:22:27,035
[SPEAKER_05]: We all may rise for a moment of silence.

1377
02:22:45,143 --> 02:22:45,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1378
02:22:46,183 --> 02:22:52,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next regular meeting will be Monday, October 18 here at 630.

1379

[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

1380
02:22:57,208 --> 02:22:58,148
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1381
02:22:58,168 --> 02:22:58,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1382
02:22:59,068 --> 02:22:59,909
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1383
02:23:00,069 --> 02:23:01,309
