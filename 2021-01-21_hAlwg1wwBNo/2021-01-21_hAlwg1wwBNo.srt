[SPEAKER_07]: So two present, one absent.

20
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:32,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I'm sorry, I'm trying, I was just looking through, of course, right before we started, I clicked on my email and I lost our introduction for our, that I need to read to the community.

[SPEAKER_07]: So if you guys could just bear with me one second, it is in the,

00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:08,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I had it open a few minutes ago and then I accidentally closed it.

28
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,722
[SPEAKER_07]: and building community and school-based friendships for students with disabilities.

29
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:40,903
[SPEAKER_07]: That's under our special education category.

30
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:57,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And pursuant to Governor Baker's March, 2020 order, suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law and the governor's order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford school committee subcommittee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

31
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:02,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Specific information, the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and our parties

34
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:25,270

35
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,591
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's really good news.

36
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Glad to hear it.

37
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:33,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are gonna start, as I said, with the behavioral health.

38
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a really important.

39
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Aspect of the subcommittee meeting.

40
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,873
[SPEAKER_07]: We had one scheduled for December and it happened to be on that day that we got that foot of snow.

41
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:54,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we ended up not having it and we are rescheduling today.

42
00:03:54,658 --> 00:04:02,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the last meeting minutes, I sort of took a little bit of note to some of the things that we talked about at the last meeting.

43
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:13,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the call, we have Stacey Shulman, who is the director of guidance and who leads the charge in the helping us

44
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:15,543
[SPEAKER_07]: create trauma-informed schools.

45
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:24,350
[SPEAKER_07]: And Stacey, if you wanna just speak for a moment and then I'm gonna pull up our meetings from our minutes from the last meeting to talk about some of the outstanding items we had discussed.

46
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to just do a little intro?

47
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:28,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, I'm Stacey Schulman.

48
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:33,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health for Medford Public Schools and a licensed mental health Councilor.

49
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been talking in our meetings this year a lot about trauma, especially related to the COVID pandemic.

50
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:46,228
[SPEAKER_06]: and what our students are facing, but also just creating trauma sensitive schools.

51
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:59,537
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the other topics that we've delved into a lot is speaking about stress and what a lot of our specifically secondary students have mentioned is stress related to homework.

52
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:10,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll talk a little bit about that later on today, but Medford has sent out surveys to high school faculty, high school students,

53
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:22,018
[SPEAKER_06]: and Mr. DeLeva, the high school principal is on with us and we'll talk a little bit about those survey results as well as what the steps we're going to take based on that data will be.

54
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:22,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

55
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:24,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, that's great.

56
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,181
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one of the follow-up items that we wanted to have.

57
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:31,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed that we also have school committee member, Paulette van de Kloot here.

58
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:33,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks Paulette for joining us.

59
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:37,785
[SPEAKER_07]: We have several faculty members as well and superintendent intern,

60
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent, intern, Tom Miliszewski.

61
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:41,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom, thanks for joining us.

62
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:45,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Cushing, everyone that's here, we appreciate you being here.

63
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:58,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was actually also in the minutes for the last meeting that we were talking about the high school survey, the homework stress, which we're definitely seeing a lot of right now.

64
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:01,200
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm eager to hear more about that.

65
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that you said that we were gonna share the results of the high school survey.

66
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So like to be able to do that.

67
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:18,786
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some other notes that I had from our last meeting that I wanted to follow up on was that were suggestions, you know, from our minutes where you had talked about a little bit about the NAN project.

68
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:23,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to know how that was going and whether that happened and or how families can

69
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,912
[SPEAKER_07]: participate if possible or, you know, are there any projects with Elliot that we can share that we might know about?

70
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:35,814
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also there was a suggestion about a webinar around some of these issues.

71
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:42,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to follow up on those two items, but maybe we can start with the, well, why don't you decide where you want to start, Stacey?

72
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:45,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll talk a little bit about the Dan project first.

73
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's, that's sort of the smaller, um,

74
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,153
[SPEAKER_06]: item or less involved.

75
00:06:50,213 --> 00:07:03,843
[SPEAKER_06]: The NAN project is a partnership that we have through Elliott Health and Human Services, which is a large community agency that focuses on behavioral health in our

76
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:06,838
[SPEAKER_06]: in our area.

77
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:22,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And the NAN project was created as a way to talk to students about mental health, but more specifically, they bring in what they call peer mentors.

78
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:33,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're young adults in their early 20s who have experienced moderate to severe mental illness and have come through it.

79
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:42,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they come and they speak to students in terms of an education portion of it, but as well to relay their experience.

80
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:57,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And the purpose is to not only educate students around mental health, but also to enlighten them in terms of that 95% of people who develop a mental health disorder recover with supports.

81
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:58,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the message is hopeful.

82
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:03,676
[SPEAKER_06]: and the messages with somebody who is very similar in age.

83
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:14,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had them come in and speak to our seniors, and then we're working on a calendar with them to speak to the other grades as well.

84
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:23,964
[SPEAKER_06]: They break out into smaller groups in order to have like a closer, closer knit conversation around it, and we received a lot of positive feedback.

85
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:29,246
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had Nan come in person in previous years, but this was done on Zoom during advisory.

86
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:38,438
[SPEAKER_06]: They have in the past provided parent nights or informations related to mental health awareness.

87
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:46,044
[SPEAKER_06]: They've also relayed a lot of information to staff in the past for like a faculty one-on-one mental health one-on-one session.

88
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:51,027
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a great resource and I'm grateful to them for always being willing to support Medford.

89
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:56,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a contact there that you can share Stacey with us that

90
00:08:57,148 --> 00:09:10,691
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, if we thought about, or if there are folks on the call that thought about wanting to do some sort of a parent night for mental health awareness, or if that's potentially an objective that somebody wants to walk away from within this particular meeting.

91
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:21,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly, I know that you talked about also professional development specific to the DESI mandate and around suicide prevention.

92
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, you oriented a little bit

93
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,565
[SPEAKER_07]: last time that the NAN project was created as a suicide awareness program initially, is that right?

94
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:38,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the director of the NAN project is Jay Kavanaugh and his sister Nancy, who they called NAN, died by suicide.

95
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:47,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they developed this project in her honor to serve as a community support.

96
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:59,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we want to find out about any community classes for mental health awareness, we could reach out to Elliot and then share that with the community.

97
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:07,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if the NAN projects provides specific community based.

98
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:14,046
[SPEAKER_06]: education, their focus a lot is pushing into school systems.

99
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,328
[SPEAKER_07]: But didn't you just mention a moment ago that Elliot does have family-based mental health awareness?

100
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:28,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Elliot has family-based care, and the NAN project has come to schools to do a parent night.

101
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could certainly talk to them about doing that.

102
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:32,131
[SPEAKER_06]: It would, of course, be on Zoom.

103
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:34,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, of course.

104
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:43,727
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that would be a really good idea, especially as we were talking about, you know, whether there was a webinar or something, but something around sort of community education, it sounds like a great program.

105
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:53,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And the students are really, you know, being served and learning from it, which I think is great within our schools, but it would be great if we could have something that was community based.

106
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:55,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any questions or comments on this?

107
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:59,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody feel free if you have questions or want to speak up?

108
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:11,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing and hearing none.

109
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Stacy.

110
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:14,414
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

111
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,695
[SPEAKER_06]: So do we feel comfortable moving on to the homework survey?

112
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:17,415
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

113
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to I think so.

114
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:31,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe after the homework survey, we can talk about, I guess a line was sort of the NAM projects, mental health awareness, sort of maybe the webinar or something along those lines that we had that had been brought up in the last.

115
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:33,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want to do homework first and then the webinar.

116
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's do, let's do the homework survey.

117
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to share my screen and go over our PowerPoint.

118
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:47,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after I do that, I'll allow Mr. Duleba to talk a little bit about what we've met as a curriculum director team with him to develop afterwards.

119
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So see, can everyone see that?

120
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:55,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

121
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:57,759
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so I'm going to go ahead and present.

122
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:12,479
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I mentioned before, we had been hearing a lot from parents, caregivers, and students about specifically stress from homework, as well as being on the screen a lot.

123
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:22,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had informal conversations with faculty and who had relayed different messages that they didn't feel like they were giving a lot of homework.

124
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:31,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanted to put out just like a global survey and we surveyed both faculty and students.

125
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:32,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll go over the staff feedback.

126
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:37,728
[SPEAKER_06]: There were 74 respondents, as you see here, a mix of students in other areas.

127
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:40,429
[SPEAKER_06]: We also made sure to note

128
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:45,559
[SPEAKER_06]: faculty who are teaching AP courses as well, because we know that course load there is very rigorous.

129
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:54,212
[SPEAKER_06]: It was spread across the board, less of a representation there from fine arts, but certainly the other areas.

130
00:12:55,936 --> 00:13:02,217
[SPEAKER_06]: So we asked on average per night of homework, how many hours are you assigning per subject?

131
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:11,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you can see here, there was a good amount of people saying small numbers.

132
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So 15, 30 minutes, I do not assign homework.

133
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Very rarely did we see someone who said three to four hours a night.

134
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,262
[SPEAKER_06]: That was maybe one respondent.

135
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:35,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we asked compared to last year when everyone was in school in the building, this year homework assigned is significantly less, less than last year, about the same, more than last year.

136
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:42,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see here, the bulk said either about the same or less or significantly less.

137
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is faculty responses.

138
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,031
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked how many students in your class have stated they're overwhelmed?

139
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,291
[SPEAKER_06]: 20% said none.

140
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:56,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost 40% said some, 13 said most.

141
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,929
[SPEAKER_06]: This is around six or 7% more than half.

142
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's split into the smaller categories after that.

143
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,690
[SPEAKER_06]: How many students are behind in their homework?

144
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:19,872
[SPEAKER_06]: 21.9% said none, 8.2 more than half, but the bulk 67% said some of their students are behind in homework assignments.

145
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:26,072
[SPEAKER_06]: On average, what are they, how long do they expect students to work on asynchronous work?

146
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me one second, Mr. Rousseau.

147
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:29,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

148
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:31,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

149
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry to cut back one slide.

150
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, sure.

151
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:37,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, you don't really need to.

152
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:44,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have, I realized that maybe this is an ongoing type of survey in the past.

153
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:52,353
[SPEAKER_17]: But do we have any context for whether, other than that one about, you know, compared to last year, which that's very useful.

154
00:14:53,334 --> 00:15:01,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have any sense as to whether these are, I mean, is 67% of students being behind on their homework, is that normal?

155
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,920
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'm not a teacher.

156
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:04,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

157
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:08,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have, we have never given the survey before.

158
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:15,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so we don't have a specific data point, um, to base it on from last year, but that's a great, that's a great.

159
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

160
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:26,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Just for clarification on that last slide, uh, it was 67.1% of faculty reporting that some of their students are behind.

161
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:27,071
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

162
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:27,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

163
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that 67% of students are behind on

164
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,690
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

165
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:33,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, that's correct.

166
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:36,673
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you look too, it's a total of 73 responses there.

167
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:43,036
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you in the faculty, that's a little bit less than what we have for an actual faculty number.

168
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,017
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to kind of keep that in perspective as well.

169
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:45,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

170
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:45,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

171
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:54,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, on average, what are you expecting for asynchronous work per class per day?

172
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:56,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was one of our concerns.

173
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Most, 50%, so half, 30 minutes or less.

174
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,522
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 minutes or less, 10 minutes or less.

175
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:05,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are 45 minutes or less.

176
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:07,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, very rarely one hour or less.

177
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that's during the class period.

178
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:24,122
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked for this because our hypothesis was that students are feeling like they're receiving a lot of homework, but perhaps it was spillover from asynchronous work during the day that they were completing after school hours.

179
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:30,589
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the more important work for students to complete asynchronous or homework assignments.

180
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,751
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see, the vast majority are saying asynchronous assignments.

181
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:40,433
[SPEAKER_06]: On average, how long do you expect students to work on asynchronous work per class?

182
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:41,993
[SPEAKER_06]: We already went over that, that was twice.

183
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:46,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So then we surveyed students and we got a great response.

184
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:49,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So 781 students responded.

185
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:53,057
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a great mix across the grade levels there.

186
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So the students on average, how many hours of homework are you completing on all your subjects?

187
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:06,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a little different than the question we asked previously to faculty.

188
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So be mindful of that, where we asked per subject, how much are you assigning, right?

189
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:12,130
[SPEAKER_06]: This is total, how much homework do you have?

190
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:18,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the smaller numbers here, we have less than one hour a night, which then increases up.

191
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So 18.4% said they had three to four hours a night.

192
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:28,807
[SPEAKER_06]: 26.5%, one to two hours.

193
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:32,892
[SPEAKER_06]: The bulk here of majority, two to three hours a night, 35.5.

194
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:40,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And then 9.5% of students said they had more than four hours a night of homework, which in my opinion is an incredible amount.

195
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:55,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So compared to last year when everyone is in the building, this year the homework load is, and we asked them significantly less, less than last year, about the same, more than half, more than last year, significantly more.

196
00:17:55,995 --> 00:18:03,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you can see, 42.3, the bulk of students are saying they feel like the homework assignment is more than last year.

197
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:09,289
[SPEAKER_06]: 16.9% said they felt it was significantly more.

198
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:10,390
[SPEAKER_06]: 26.1% about the same.

199
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,194
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a little less than 10% are saying that it was less than last year.

200
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And a very small sliver are saying significantly less.

201
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:20,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see here that there is a divide.

202
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:24,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Faculty are feeling like they're either giving the same or far less homework.

203
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:30,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And students are saying they feel like, the bulk of students are saying they either have the same or more.

204
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:36,945
[SPEAKER_06]: The subject that requires me to spend the most time of homework to complete assignments is the following.

205
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:39,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Science took the bulk of that.

206
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:50,112
[SPEAKER_06]: So 31.5% said science was taking up the most amount of time, followed by math, and then English, and then social studies.

207
00:18:54,114 --> 00:19:00,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Referencing the subject you identified in the last question, which is the most amount of time, how much time on average do you spend on homework a night?

208
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:10,588
[SPEAKER_06]: And so 59%, the majority there said one to two hours a night, and then followed by less than an hour.

209
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:15,210
[SPEAKER_06]: But 13.2 said the subject they spent most a night was two to three hours.

210
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that's a lot of time.

211
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a small amount said three hours of time.

212
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:29,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe that is the, I just wanna make sure here, it's not letting me go on anymore.

213
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:30,819
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that is the last slide.

214
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:36,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have any questions before I stop sharing my screen?

215
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Stacey, I just had one question.

216
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:51,502
[SPEAKER_08]: When the kids were asked about the homework, how much homework they had in comparison to last year, were they told to be mindful of not including the asynchronous work?

217
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:53,023
[SPEAKER_08]: They were not.

218
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:54,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

219
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:56,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were saying homework.

220
00:19:56,745 --> 00:20:00,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a great question because that is one of our

221
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:01,583
[SPEAKER_06]: hypotheses, right?

222
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:03,244
[SPEAKER_06]: That it's all sort of coming into one.

223
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:15,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly, so with faculty saying they feel like they're either assigning the same or less, and with students saying like they feel like they have more.

224
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a reason, right?

225
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:20,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody else have any more questions?

226
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,314
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll allow Mr. Duleba to talk a little bit about, oh, Mr. Russo.

227
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:29,617
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I was just curious, did we ask students to identify what cohort they're in?

228
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:31,036
[SPEAKER_14]: We did not.

229
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:31,816
[SPEAKER_14]: We did not.

230
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:45,820
[SPEAKER_14]: At the time, we were pretty much cohort A had been in the building at this time when we developed the survey, while people were still, if you remember, the high school had been remote for a longer period of time.

231
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,980
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's something to think about.

232
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Paul, I didn't mean to cut you off.

233
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:53,901
[SPEAKER_14]: My apologies.

234
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,902
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm sure you were about to go there.

235
00:20:55,962 --> 00:21:00,463
[SPEAKER_17]: But just that the distinction between asynchronous and homework

236
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:04,956
[SPEAKER_17]: my own house, I can say I don't recognize any distinction.

237
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:09,798
[SPEAKER_17]: And I completely understand teachers would very much recognize a distinction.

238
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:16,002
[SPEAKER_17]: But I doubt very much students at any grade level truly recognize any difference.

239
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:18,103
[SPEAKER_17]: So that

240
00:21:19,684 --> 00:21:40,758
[SPEAKER_17]: which cohort you're in won't truly answer that question, but I think that if we saw some very divergent information for cohort D, my kids are full remote students, I think we could tease that apart by simply saying, did cohort D come up with a very different number than the hybrid kids, when in fact,

241
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:47,329
[SPEAKER_17]: those groups of kids across cohorts should have, I mean, there should be no difference, frankly, in how much homework they had.

242
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,730
[SPEAKER_17]: So we could really kind of answer that question for sure.

243
00:21:51,071 --> 00:22:07,502
[SPEAKER_17]: But just something for the next survey, because I think that that's a really important thing to understand is that because, you know, DESE has changed the rules around how much FaceTime kids are supposed to get.

244
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:19,486
[SPEAKER_17]: and I'm sure we're going to be changing things to increase the amount of face time and whether or not that will increase asynchronous homework or asynchronous work that will then be translated.

245
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:29,349
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if we do this survey again and we find out that the amount of homework has dramatically increased or decreased, I think we need to understand what that means.

246
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:32,951
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just kind of rambling, I apologize.

247
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:35,251
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't think you're rambling.

248
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,472
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one thing that I took

249
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:47,092
[SPEAKER_14]: out of the surveys too was making sure we had definitions of what asynchronous is and what homework is, because I think that's somewhat where the lines get blurred.

250
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:55,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I think on a staff perspective, some people feel like, okay, just finish up your asynchronous work that you didn't complete in class.

251
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,200
[SPEAKER_14]: And that should be it.

252
00:22:57,601 --> 00:23:05,147
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's other staff members that feel there should be the outside assignment of reinforcement skills or even pre

253
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:08,588
[SPEAKER_14]: enforcement skills onto your next topic.

254
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:19,172
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think what we were realizing is, again, going back to where we were, we were all remote minus cohort A, you know, at the time.

255
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:27,055
[SPEAKER_14]: So with this survey, and it was something that like curriculum directors and we all sat down and we were reviewing things, we were listening.

256
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:32,357
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't that we didn't care, but I think there's a lot of different perspectives regarding

257
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:35,958
[SPEAKER_14]: what this type of work should be.

258
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,262
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think on a, and I'm sorry if I'm taking over and I apologize.

259
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think it leading into it.

260
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:52,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what ended up happening is there's also discussions about, you know, where you need to be in a certain curriculum too, because we're not aware.

261
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:56,999
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we all have our own feelings about what accountability is and all that, but we're still not aware of what needs to be

262
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:05,826
[SPEAKER_14]: there and where students are at at some point, or what have they lost at some point, and what can we do to regain instruction that had been lost.

263
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:10,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I think at the high school, we're just trying to find that balance.

264
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:13,872
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time, understanding that it can be overwhelming.

265
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:20,797
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we were in the building, and I think about it in the building, the conversations of teachers talking to teachers,

266
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:28,703
[SPEAKER_14]: and determining what's being done was a lot easier to manage regarding assignments.

267
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:29,804
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

268
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:33,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Charlotte's nodding to what I said, so I just wanted to say she's in agreement.

269
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:43,795
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we really, not that we lost sight, but a person's trying to assign, and they're not having a conversation, let's say, if I'm the science teacher,

270
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:53,236
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not having the conversation that the English teacher you know could go and talk to the English teacher and say, hey, you know how much is going on what's what's you know being part of what.

271
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:58,922
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were all kind of home and you know, the other thing that we have to also keep in mind is people.

272
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:02,284
[SPEAKER_14]: do work at different levels.

273
00:25:02,824 --> 00:25:08,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So meaning that when you assign the work, right, some students may be able to do it in 15 minutes.

274
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:15,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And some students may take longer times just because of what their need is to understand that assignment.

275
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:22,352
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have so many- Sorry, excuse me, Paul, but I just wanted to say, but that said, then your numbers sort of

276
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:24,353
[SPEAKER_07]: will reflect that too.

277
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:29,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they are a little bit with the teachers and the students in terms of the perspective gap, if you will.

278
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:35,301
[SPEAKER_07]: But among the students, I think that you would see the significant data set as well.

279
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:43,948
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess I'm just wondering around this, is there not still a common planning time where the teachers are able to communicate around the homework?

280
00:25:44,328 --> 00:25:48,211
[SPEAKER_14]: There is common planning time, but there's not common planning time for every

281
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,794
[SPEAKER_14]: single subject at certain times.

282
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:55,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to reinforce the Freshman Collaborative again.

283
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:57,817
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a work in progress.

284
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:00,259
[SPEAKER_14]: It was ready to go for next year, and then COVID hit.

285
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me what that is, Mr. DeLego.

286
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:17,150
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Freshman Collaborative, and this is something that we're trying to bring back, was we would take all ninth grade teachers of all subject areas and built in time for them to collaborate together like we're talking about in that common planning time.

287
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:19,192
[SPEAKER_14]: For our ninth graders.

288
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:24,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we would love to do that for every subject for every possible grade level.

289
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:28,221
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's a lot of things that there's a lot of diversity in the schedule.

290
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:31,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's say a lot of choices in the schedule that don't cause that.

291
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:36,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So, for example, you could have a student that's an AP mathematics student.

292
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,889
[SPEAKER_14]: and a CP science student.

293
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:45,931
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's not easy to kind of group those guys all together to have that collaboration.

294
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:52,773
[SPEAKER_14]: But we do know within our ninth grade, there's a very certain pattern that follows for every ninth grade student.

295
00:26:53,154 --> 00:27:02,757
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you remember in their course selections, I know it's been a while, Melody, but if you remember in their course selection sheets, the freshmen all had a tiny one because they had their set courses

296
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:09,801
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you just had to make sure that you knew that they were in their second courses because they kind of all start out in that same kind of pattern.

297
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:19,247
[SPEAKER_14]: But then as you increase in grade level, your choices get greater and greater and greater, and your wants get greater, so it's very hard to align.

298
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:23,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Now on the special education aspect, you know, we do do that co-planning.

299
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,092
[SPEAKER_14]: part as well when we have the co-taught model.

300
00:27:27,673 --> 00:27:36,078
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do have that kind of common planning time, but across every discipline doesn't always happen all the time just due to, again, the diversity of our schedule.

301
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's not a grade level common planning time is what you're saying.

302
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:49,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you know the schedule, the only common course that we have throughout every grade level is English.

303
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,534
[SPEAKER_14]: When you move up into certain levels, you get a mix of grades.

304
00:27:55,094 --> 00:28:01,619
[SPEAKER_14]: So for example, you may have like a 10th, 11th grade math class, and you may have a 12th, 11th grade math class.

305
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:10,346
[SPEAKER_14]: So even when we were trying to bring cohorts back, those are the things we were also, you know, making sure, you know, most of the 11th and 12th grade overlap.

306
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,734
[SPEAKER_14]: in a lot of classes, but you wouldn't see like a 10th grade in there.

307
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:22,788
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, it gets to be varying like AP European history starts in 10th grade, where most other AP classes start in 11th and 12th grade.

308
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:41,137
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, if you were an AP teacher and you were doing grade level, strictly grade level common planning time, you know, that could potentially mean that an AP level teacher would have to go to three, you know, nine, well, four, you know, or three, 10, 11, 12 common planning times if they had, you know, three grade levels.

309
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:41,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

310
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:42,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be, that's the issue.

311
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:45,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you're trying to group them by category as opposed to by,

312
00:28:46,401 --> 00:29:05,311
[SPEAKER_14]: grade level because it seems to me like it, you know, obviously seems like a quick answer would be grade level and then you're saying no, not because of all of these variances, but also our teachers don't just teach specific ninth grade specific 10th grade, it's mixed so if you're an English teacher, for example, you may have to ninth grade classes and you may have to 10th grade classes.

313
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:07,632
[SPEAKER_14]: So you kind of run into a lot of

314
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:21,703
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also want our teachers to be diversified like that, because that helps us move things around in certain ways for student needs, for example.

315
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:33,965
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're looking to change a class, for example, and you're looking to see what's aligned with it, having the teachers have a diverse schedule helps a lot in those needs.

316
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:43,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mr. DeLava, would you have a recommendation or is there, are there folks here that might have a recommendation around how do, how is this communicated?

317
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:53,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it's been, it seems like it's been an ongoing concern, you know, off and on over the years around, you know, again, when we're in person, it's a little bit different because there's that natural conversation.

318
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:58,436
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think planning for both those scenarios is a good idea for a while in person and remote.

319
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:03,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there some sort of systemic way that we could think of approaching

320
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:05,412
[SPEAKER_07]: what these levels are.

321
00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:12,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know we're starting with this survey, but I'm sort of, I'm always interested in this, in jumping to the solution, which I know is not an easy thing.

322
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:19,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not looking for low hanging fruit, but I guess I'm looking for some suggestions, like what would be some suggestions around this?

323
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,242
[SPEAKER_14]: So are we talking about the common planning time or the homework?

324
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:23,102
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure I answer.

325
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:27,165
[SPEAKER_07]: The homework specific, whether it would be planning time for a solution or other things.

326
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,267
[SPEAKER_14]: So in a lot of cases, what we had done, and again,

327
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:37,064
[SPEAKER_14]: This, first of all, I want to make sure the slide presentation that you say was compiled by Dr. Riccadeli as well.

328
00:30:38,144 --> 00:30:59,952
[SPEAKER_14]: So we worked all together on collecting the data and disseminating the data and reviewing the data and making sure that people understood by subject area, how do we balance the, you know, the social emotional part that we need, you know, and the anxiety part versus you have to balance like making sure you're covering content

329
00:31:00,874 --> 00:31:01,956
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, effectively.

330
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:08,351
[SPEAKER_14]: And the only way we could have done that is with that surveys from the staff and from the students to get that perspective.

331
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:16,832
[SPEAKER_14]: So that being said, we met and I sort of drew up a proposal for everybody to sort of review.

332
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:34,477
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of things that we had discussed mostly was A, identifying what homework was, and then defining what asynchronous work was so that there was no unclear idea of what each one meant.

333
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:56,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming up with sort of rules, but I think what we needed to do, and again, we're still in the final touches upstage, is sort of coming up with certain days for certain subjects and then rotating those days so that one subject didn't feel like they're always Monday, Tuesday, for example.

334
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:03,475
[SPEAKER_14]: So in one sense, what we were talking about was keeping a time limit to a maximum of 30 minutes per subject.

335
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:11,137
[SPEAKER_14]: But then on top of that, we were talking about, OK, so we do an A, B rotational week for vocational.

336
00:32:11,157 --> 00:32:12,518
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just using that as a guide.

337
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:23,001
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's say, for example, week A, we've decided that on Monday and Tuesday, those are going to be your STEM homework assignments with the 30-minute maximum there.

338
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:25,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Wednesday, we'll work on world language.

339
00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:32,865
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Thursday and Friday, we'll work on our humanities, which is our English and social studies, and include electives only.

340
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:36,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Then the next week you would flip that around.

341
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:41,493
[SPEAKER_14]: So you would say, okay, Monday and Thursday, now you're doing the humanities in your elective courses.

342
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:45,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Wednesday still stays as world language, but now Thursday and Friday is your STEM.

343
00:32:45,335 --> 00:32:48,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have a little bit of a weekend in between.

344
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:57,242
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think what we're trying to do is kind of isolate subject on certain days as also isolate time of 30 minutes.

345
00:32:57,382 --> 00:33:03,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, again, like I've said before, what we're trying to figure out in so many ways is,

346
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:08,196
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the ability level, and I didn't mean it, just everyone ranges on how they do work.

347
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:11,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, put me in a science class, I'm gonna get it like that.

348
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:29,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Personally, if anybody knows me, if you'd asked me if two roads diverge in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and I had to find the item meaning, I'm gonna be there for an hour, you know, just trying to understand that, because everybody's brains work differently.

349
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:31,974
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to find that commonality,

350
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:41,019
[SPEAKER_14]: The other piece of this too, and it's something to be mindful of, and it is regarding advanced placement.

351
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,683
[SPEAKER_14]: In advanced placement, we're caught by the college board, and meaning that we have to present our syllabuses to the college board.

352
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:49,885
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to be approved by the college board.

353
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:53,467
[SPEAKER_14]: So the assignments that need to be there have to follow a certain pattern.

354
00:33:55,668 --> 00:34:00,872
[SPEAKER_14]: How that gets portrayed, and again, I'm not even sure how the exam is going to come through.

355
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,950
[SPEAKER_14]: in the end, but the preparedness needs to be there no matter what that is.

356
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:11,615
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I'm not saying unfortunately, but we do have to be mindful like our tiers, right?

357
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:17,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Tier one, tier two, tier three, like what, you know, tier three, unfortunately we'll say will be AP.

358
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:26,587
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have a little bit more work ahead of them in order to make sure that they're ready for the level that they have selected to be challenged for.

359
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:47,376
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a lot, I'm sorry, I will definitely stop and ask any questions, but that's sort of where we've all kind of, and I don't want to say this is a Paul DeLeva decision, I will tell you, like, it was sitting down with curriculum directors, going through the data, identifying certain things, because they also realized, too, that their pacing guides need to change.

360
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:51,019
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, in certain things where you need to cover certain topics,

361
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:54,014
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, you have to make sure you make those adjustments.

362
00:34:54,454 --> 00:35:03,521
[SPEAKER_14]: So are we going to hit the, you know, Dessie didn't give it to us this year, but what are our essential standards that we need to make sure our students are hitting at the same time?

363
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:05,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

364
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:07,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to point out it's 538.

365
00:35:08,325 --> 00:35:12,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got about roughly 10 more minutes left for behavioral health.

366
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:14,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that, Mr. DeLava.

367
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:17,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it would be helpful to include this survey for

368
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:22,108
[SPEAKER_07]: to share with the rest of our school committee.

369
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:24,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Stacy, if that's okay.

370
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:26,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Mr. Gertman.

371
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:28,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I would just toss out one other idea.

372
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:35,091
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're going forward with another survey is to include a group for parent feedback as well.

373
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:44,214
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing to be mindful of is that all of us, this is a very highly subjective thing, not just based on ability, but on perception of

374
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:54,019
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're going to have some students who will report that, oh, yeah, it took me an hour when they finished in 15 minutes, for a variety of reasons.

375
00:35:54,959 --> 00:36:06,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And you may get something that helps you modify your data sets based on how long parents say it's taking their kids, and whether or not the kids took a 30-minute Facebook break in the middle of finishing the assignment.

376
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:09,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, I appreciate that, because you're right.

377
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:10,562
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a view.

378
00:36:13,146 --> 00:36:20,969
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, our roles always are to interact with our students, but now being at home, right, it's a whole different animal, right?

379
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,010
[SPEAKER_13]: So- Right, the parents are deeply involved.

380
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:34,756
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm speaking at the grade, you know, at the lower school level right now, you know, not at the high school level, but even at the high school level, I would expect that many parents are still deeply involved in the day-to-day of their kids' educations this year.

381
00:36:35,356 --> 00:36:39,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, one other note is, and I don't know what the standard is at this point,

382
00:36:40,503 --> 00:36:46,587
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know that back when I was in high school, people in AP classes regularly expected to spend an hour per class on homework.

383
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:57,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if that's sort of, I know that you guys are trying to limit it this year, especially with the amount of screen time, but that may influence kids who are in three AP classes, maybe the ones who are reporting.

384
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,257
[SPEAKER_13]: It took me many hours to finish homework.

385
00:36:59,677 --> 00:36:59,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

386
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:02,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

387
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

388
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:16,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I think for some students, too, or people I know, I think the mental gearing up to the time to do the homework is included in the calculation of the homework time.

389
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:17,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I know for me it is.

390
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:24,427
[SPEAKER_07]: When I'm thinking about stuff, I'm like, OK, the time that it took me to mentally get there, I sort of am counting as the time that was committed to that, too.

391
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:25,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's interesting.

392
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:33,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we have some other folks here that are interested in the educational piece and the webinar piece.

393
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to know if there's anyone else

394
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:43,323
[SPEAKER_07]: wants to sort of speak to that specific to the mental health needs and behavioral health needs of our students in our schools right now.

395
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:51,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Heather, you have nothing that you want to add right now?

396
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:52,087
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

397
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:55,428
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

398
00:37:57,474 --> 00:38:22,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And Stacey, just, you know, I know that you talked about the potential that we might have for, you know, recommending bringing in the training for families around the mental health piece, which I think would be really appreciated and much needed this year myself, but also I'm wondering what your thoughts are around this concept of webinar that was proposed in our last meeting.

399
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I mean, we can, you know, certainly put together more parent information.

400
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:35,449
[SPEAKER_06]: The school adjustment Councilors at the beginning of the year created their own webinars on anxiety and depression specifically.

401
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:38,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And those were posted for parents.

402
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:43,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we would have to narrow down a topic.

403
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:53,523
[SPEAKER_06]: We can certainly do like a broad, like NAN project can do a broad mental health 101, but I think people are looking for specifics at this time.

404
00:38:53,723 --> 00:39:03,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we have a limited time for parent education in a way, or just community education, students are welcome as well.

405
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:05,529
[SPEAKER_06]: What would that subject be?

406
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,190
[SPEAKER_09]: What would be most helpful at this time?

407
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:16,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Melanie, you're on mute.

408
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:18,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

409
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:19,210
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good to think about.

410
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to.

411
00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:33,422
[SPEAKER_07]: include that for our agenda for the next, next meeting too, so that we could in the interim be thinking about and asking students in the community what they feel might be most helpful for that sort of thing.

412
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:39,625
[SPEAKER_07]: And it might be interested to sort of think about a student run or a student assisted, you know, sort of webinar around that.

413
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:50,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to, I'd like to include that on our agenda for the next meeting, Stacey, and then in the interim, we'll do a little bit of legwork around that.

414
00:39:53,836 --> 00:40:01,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think that also on the agenda for the next time is, you know, thinking about this professional development piece that we had talked about in the past.

415
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:22,112
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, you know, we're still looking towards a May presentation that actually needs to be scheduled for school committee and thinking about what, you know, this subcommittee would like to put forward or ask our subcommittee members to put forward to the committee as the whole for policy recommendation.

416
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:48,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to include the professional development DESI mandate that you talked about last time in terms of that, whether that's one of the things we want to talk about next time, but also folks who are here and have been here for the behavioral health portion of this meeting, please give some thought between now and our next meeting around, you know, what you might like to see or propose for policy

417
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:59,086
[SPEAKER_07]: recommendations around mental health, behavioral health for our schools and our district in our May presentation to school committee based on the meetings that we've had this year.

418
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:06,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also speak to your students and ask them what they feel like is important and around this mental health issues.

419
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll do the same and we'll come back to the table for the behavioral health session.

420
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:17,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just see in our next meeting, which is, sorry.

421
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:30,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next meeting is February 11th.

422
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:44,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you guys mark your calendar for that and also let folks know that you know that are interested and concerned with issues regarding mental health, behavioral health, please have them come to our February 11th meeting.

423
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will put information out on social media around some of those questions that we asked as well.

424
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:49,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys.

425
00:41:51,027 --> 00:42:04,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna make that sort of awkward switch now over to special education and some of the topics that we talked about in our last meeting regarding special education.

426
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:09,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sort of wanna, again, bear with me a second while I pull up my notes.

427
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:17,146
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about, so our topic of our sort of,

428
00:42:19,607 --> 00:42:19,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah Silver, PB.:

429
00:42:19,927 --> 00:42:28,155
[SPEAKER_07]: : Question of practice right now is how we're how we can facilitate and develop meaningful friendships relationships for students.

430
00:42:28,175 --> 00:42:29,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah Silver, PB.:

431
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:39,025
[SPEAKER_07]: : Within our schools and within our community as folks that in the special education subcommittee and what recommendations we can make to the committee as a whole, regarding

432
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:44,592
[SPEAKER_07]: meaningful inclusion and relationships for students with and without disabilities in our schools.

433
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:53,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the things that we talked about in our last meeting with multiple parents and other family, other stakeholders that we had on the call are

434
00:42:54,305 --> 00:43:10,393
[SPEAKER_07]: have been ongoing conversations around a Best Buddies program and creating a siblings group or a siblings support group of individuals with disabilities, siblings with disabilities, and or support around being able to participate in community or recreational activities.

435
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:17,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, hold on one second.

436
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:22,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

437
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:29,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to mention Heather and Marissa, who have been really working hard.

438
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:40,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Two parents that are part of the autism support group that runs monthly have been working really hard last year, meeting with the Best Buddies program and doing some like work around

439
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:45,118
[SPEAKER_07]: The schools in particular and best buddies are not able to be on this call tonight.

440
00:43:45,798 --> 00:43:50,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to do an update on that for our next meeting around the best buddies program.

441
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:57,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And sort of just what, what we have found and what, you know, the interest is and whether or not we want to move that issue a question forward.

442
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:02,133
[SPEAKER_07]: But they also asked me to let folks know that there is a,

443
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:13,141
[SPEAKER_07]: meeting next Thursday of their group, their autism support group, specific to funding for families.

444
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:18,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, help getting access to personal care attendant, mass health, that sort of thing.

445
00:44:18,265 --> 00:44:19,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's next Thursday.

446
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:23,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have a link that I can share or a flyer that I can share with folks.

447
00:44:24,712 --> 00:44:29,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll share both on my social media and also in our new Google Drive.

448
00:44:29,577 --> 00:44:33,061
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just set up a new Google Drive folder for this subcommittee.

449
00:44:33,782 --> 00:44:36,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I shared it with some of you just prior to the meeting.

450
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:41,735
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's one folder on trauma, specific trauma resources.

451
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:46,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll also include my notes there from our meetings and there won't be our official minutes.

452
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:52,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Those will be included as well once they're approved by school committee, but there'll be sort of working notes and then also resources.

453
00:44:52,821 --> 00:44:59,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would encourage folks who have access to the drive to also upload information, resources, what have you, things that they might find familiar.

454
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:01,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that they might find useful.

455
00:45:02,226 --> 00:45:05,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to share one of the things that we talked about doing

456
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:26,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time that I just sort of started and was the idea that, you know, folks had around just creating a database of supports and volunteerism, volunteers around, you know, people who have this interest both in our schools and in our communities.

457
00:45:26,668 --> 00:45:28,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just going to share my screen for a second.

458
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:33,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I can just share this with you guys.

459
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:50,413
[SPEAKER_07]: for whoever's interested and we can start to populate it but essentially it is just this spreadsheet, where we're starting to really think about, you know, following as a list of volunteers interested parties willing to help establish common ground among students with and without disabilities in Medford public schools.

460
00:45:52,175 --> 00:46:00,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah Silver, PB): With the last edited and obviously this list will grow and change with people coming and going, but I think it's a nice touchstone it was recommended at this meeting.

461
00:46:00,617 --> 00:46:09,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah Silver, PB): And I think it's a nice touchstone for sort of a volunteer base to just know you know people in the community that are concerned with and passionate about this issue and that are also willing to

462
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:12,464
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, offer their volunteer time specifically.

463
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:16,026
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard a lot from recreation around the need for that.

464
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:24,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So in a minute, I'm going to ask that Kate Quinn introduce herself and maybe share a little bit about what she's on the call for today.

465
00:46:26,393 --> 00:46:28,635
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me just stop sharing my screen.

466
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,669
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to send a link to that Google Doc for folks.

467
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:38,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, or you can send me people that you know that are interested in this volunteer work.

468
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:46,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm also going to put a call, a call to action.

469
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:58,757
[SPEAKER_07]: for folks that might be interested in participating, I think we'll be surprised by the number of folks that would actually be interested in this sort of opportunity.

470
00:46:59,097 --> 00:47:12,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, what I really liked earlier today, I was talking with a staff member who was talking about authentic friendships and, you know, not, and she, the way she described it was horizontal friendships, which I really liked instead of vertical friendships.

471
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:19,761
[SPEAKER_07]: which they're not, you know, horizontal friendships are friendships on equal footing and they're friends because we're authentic friends.

472
00:47:19,781 --> 00:47:28,345
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not friends because we're doing somebody a favor or we think, you know, we're getting our volunteer hours or any of those sorts of things.

473
00:47:28,385 --> 00:47:31,506
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really are thinking about how are we building authentic friendships.

474
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:36,528
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kate, yeah, Paul, remember what you said?

475
00:47:37,348 --> 00:47:37,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

476
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:40,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you wanna move that to your school committee account?

477
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,031
[SPEAKER_17]: That's actually, the spreadsheet is on your personal

478
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,510
[SPEAKER_17]: female account.

479
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I frequently make the mistake of putting them in one place or the other.

480
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:50,072
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I could do that.

481
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:57,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't yet because we had said that we would still and I will do that if that's what we decide we want to do as a subcommittee.

482
00:47:57,814 --> 00:48:02,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was because in our last meeting in our meeting minute notes, we were still trying to figure out how that was going to be coordinated.

483
00:48:02,535 --> 00:48:06,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know the superintendent was saying, you know, they would have some conversation around that.

484
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:08,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that that's happened yet.

485
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:11,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't want to sort of overstep my bounds in terms of putting anything on the

486
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:16,914
[SPEAKER_07]: school committee folder at this point before we really know or have created a practice around that.

487
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:18,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So superintendent, can you speak to that?

488
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:35,850
[SPEAKER_12]: If members, we do not have people that have access.

489
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:39,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Maurice, you're breaking up.

490
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, you were all stuttery.

491
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:48,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get to, I didn't really get to hear you.

492
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:49,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you try again?

493
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:54,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm switching lines.

494
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:55,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me better now?

495
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's the 5G.

496
00:48:59,392 --> 00:49:01,133
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a free commercial for Verizon.

497
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:02,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I just switched over.

498
00:49:04,996 --> 00:49:05,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

499
00:49:06,237 --> 00:49:08,479
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I was saying was,

500
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:28,559
[SPEAKER_11]: For the school committee drive, that one is exclusively school committee members, if it's a drive that's going to be shared with people outside of, you know, the official, we probably would need to have it repeated in two places, so that

501
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:44,318
[SPEAKER_11]: the shared drive which is what school committee members that is exclusively only school committee members and then if we're going to do a shared a drive an open drive for

502
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,231
[SPEAKER_11]: for the public to be able to have access to that.

503
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:54,193
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be some of the same information.

504
00:49:54,313 --> 00:50:09,342
[SPEAKER_11]: So it could still be under your Melanie McLaughlin at Medford email, but it would be separate so that we would know that particular drive has, it's open to the public so that there would be other emails.

505
00:50:10,002 --> 00:50:11,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, you know, with,

506
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:17,987
[SPEAKER_11]: As it is, trying to keep district documents secure.

507
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:29,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Viruses do happen and bugs happen, that if it's going to be an open drive for anyone to have access to with any email, I think it should be separate.

508
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:31,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I agree.

509
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:50,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was, yeah, and I and I would say, I think what Mr. What member Rousseau is saying, you know, under my that K 12 Gmail account, I could have my own folder on my own drive, not as part of our shared drive, which we have, I know, as school members, but I guess the other it, you know, sometimes there can be

510
00:50:51,502 --> 00:51:11,922
[SPEAKER_07]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Accounts and Accounting Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Accounts and Accounting Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Accounts and Accounting Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Accounts and Accounting Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Accounts and Accounting Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Accounts and Accounting Services HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Accounts and Accounting Services

511
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:22,076
[SPEAKER_07]: um, you know, working folder, you know, behavioral health special education subcommittee that really just right now has resources and notes in it.

512
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:26,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and this spreadsheet for volunteerism for folks that want to, um, volunteer.

513
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:28,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, if, um

514
00:51:30,399 --> 00:51:37,663
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's decided that you guys want me to put that on a folder under my own drive using my K12 email, I'm happy to do that.

515
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:43,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I just am concerned that even with Google, sometimes they're like, that person's outside of Gmail.

516
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,109
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to send them a special invitation, which is fine.

517
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:47,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind doing that, but I do.

518
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:52,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to be aware and wary of both the technical issues and the security issues.

519
00:51:52,392 --> 00:51:52,993
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I...

520
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:53,633
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

521
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:53,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

522
00:51:53,913 --> 00:51:54,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

523
00:51:54,173 --> 00:51:58,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I defaulted to that right now, but I will defer to the subcommittee and whatever you guys.

524
00:51:58,975 --> 00:51:59,396
[SPEAKER_07]: We vote.

525
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:00,676
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we decide we want to do.

526
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:05,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can either.

527
00:52:06,278 --> 00:52:08,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a vote on that now or wait and see.

528
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:08,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

529
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

530
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,780
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you?

531
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,961
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm fine with wait and see.

532
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:16,483
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, you know, I just, whenever it's got personal account information, that means it's yours.

533
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:25,190
[SPEAKER_17]: email addresses and phone numbers for people in the public.

534
00:52:26,651 --> 00:52:37,898
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, if I was not on the school committee and everything about me was already known, I would be a little uncomfortable with not knowing what you were planning to do with that, or, you know, was it gonna end up in some other distribution list?

535
00:52:37,978 --> 00:52:49,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Or was it gonna get emails about, I mean, I'm just, I'm swamped with literally many hundreds of emails a day, and I've become hypersensitive about giving my email address to anybody for any reason.

536
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:52,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a little late for that, Member Ruseau.

537
00:52:53,726 --> 00:52:55,626
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, but I already spent hours a day on email.

538
00:52:55,846 --> 00:53:00,127
[SPEAKER_17]: And so if you want my email for something, I better know you personally.

539
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:01,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

540
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:02,888
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all.

541
00:53:03,008 --> 00:53:09,629
[SPEAKER_17]: And so also, as I've mentioned in another meeting, none of us on the school committee can assume we will be here a year from now.

542
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:12,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, actually, as there is an election, that's actually true.

543
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,091
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just worry about anything we're doing just

544
00:53:18,109 --> 00:53:24,894
[SPEAKER_17]: withering away on December 31st of this year when somebody else gets sworn into office, should we not?

545
00:53:24,914 --> 00:53:29,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I think that's a reasonable, and I think that's a totally reasonable concern.

546
00:53:29,898 --> 00:53:36,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And I certainly can make, you know, as my pledge to office that I always like to leave the campfire better than I found it.

547
00:53:37,143 --> 00:53:46,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would have every intention of being able to transfer information over to any successor of mine, because my vested interest is really about moving this issue forward.

548
00:53:46,811 --> 00:53:46,931
[SPEAKER_07]: So

549
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that that can be individual for everyone.

550
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand your concern for posterity and I hear you.

551
00:53:53,593 --> 00:54:00,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm more than happy to also create a duplicate folder, if you will, with the materials there for folks to research.

552
00:54:00,736 --> 00:54:09,159
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it does beg the question sort of having a disclaimer even at the open around this school committee portion of it or not.

553
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,241
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we're all just trying to feel this out right now, because we haven't done it before.

554
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:17,103
[SPEAKER_07]: So really in the interest of sharing information right now and preparing,

555
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,323
[SPEAKER_07]: volunteer resources and what have you.

556
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:21,305
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the main reason to do this.

557
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:27,691
[SPEAKER_07]: And also just trauma resources and the friendship toolkit and other resources that are there.

558
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,333
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's a good question.

559
00:54:29,373 --> 00:54:37,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll have to give that some thought and think about whether it's under the school committee drive under my folder or not and how I can do that.

560
00:54:37,602 --> 00:54:38,763
[SPEAKER_07]: But I appreciate you bringing it up.

561
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:57,705
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, if folks have volunteers that are interested in this issue around creating and sustaining community friendships and school-based friendships for students with and without disabilities, I'd really love for you to, or if you yourself are interested in any volunteerism around this, we'd love for you to share the information.

562
00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:05,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Kate, maybe you can talk a little bit about your role and why you're here and part of the impetus for creating this list.

563
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:06,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Paulette?

564
00:55:06,896 --> 00:55:09,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I just want to point out, Mr. Gertman had his hand raised.

565
00:55:10,738 --> 00:55:10,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

566
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:17,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I just wanted to ask, do Medford Public Schools at large have a publicly facing Google Drive for this kind of resource?

567
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:19,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe we do.

568
00:55:20,022 --> 00:55:21,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the issue, Mr. Gertman.

569
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:23,944
[SPEAKER_07]: But can you tell us more about what you know about that?

570
00:55:25,904 --> 00:55:32,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I know a little bit, but it doesn't take very much to create a Google email.

571
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:33,808
[SPEAKER_13]: So it seems to me that

572
00:55:34,452 --> 00:55:48,837
[SPEAKER_13]: it would be valuable for Medford Public Schools as a whole to create a Medford Public Schools resources account with downloadable documents for parents to be able to go and search and find whenever they need them.

573
00:55:49,317 --> 00:55:56,420
[SPEAKER_13]: There's already the website, which is great, but it would give you a centralized location for a lot of this information, for school forms, for things like that.

574
00:55:57,918 --> 00:56:08,882
[SPEAKER_13]: that could be updated by anybody with access to it sort of across the school committee or actual administrative arms of Medford Public Schools.

575
00:56:10,142 --> 00:56:13,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the superintendent's point, superintendent, did you want to respond on that?

576
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:21,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the issues and the concerns are around the security issues, and I don't know what those are, but.

577
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:26,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the simple answer to that is make it accessible to Medford Public School accounts.

578
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:29,808
[SPEAKER_13]: And then parents can log in with their student's account to get the information.

579
00:56:32,894 --> 00:56:33,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting idea.

580
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:34,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for sharing that.

581
00:56:41,453 --> 00:56:43,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I hate when I push the button by mistake.

582
00:56:43,896 --> 00:56:47,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Kate Quinn is here with us from Medford Recreation.

583
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:57,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe Kate, you could talk a little bit because that was also the impetus for starting this spreadsheet among other things, also among the sibling support group that we'll talk about in a minute and some other things.

584
00:56:57,911 --> 00:56:59,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But Kate, can you introduce yourself, please?

585
00:56:59,693 --> 00:57:00,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, everybody.

586
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:01,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Kate Quinn.

587
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I work for Medford Recreation Department.

588
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:09,452
[SPEAKER_10]: We currently are all-inclusive programming, but we also run adaptive programming as well.

589
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:12,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, we're running a bowling class.

590
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:20,081
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another session that will start in February, and we're looking for some volunteers.

591
00:57:20,161 --> 00:57:27,527
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have some ideas for future classes, which is fishing, bocce.

592
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:31,791
[SPEAKER_10]: We're hoping to do some adaptive swim lessons at the pool.

593
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:40,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're really looking for some support for volunteers for sure for our programming.

594
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:48,579
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now I have about three that are going to help me come next.

595
00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:54,950
[SPEAKER_10]: session, so I'm looking forward to that and hoping that we have a nice full roster of participants as well.

596
00:57:55,890 --> 00:58:13,965
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, most of all, if you guys could help us out with any type of volunteering or if you know any students that might be interested, you can also send me an email personally, kqinn, so k-q-u-i-n-n at medford-ma.gov.

597
00:58:17,482 --> 00:58:19,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so that's, that's about it.

598
00:58:19,243 --> 00:58:22,585
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for having me and inviting me and I look forward to the future meetings.

599
00:58:25,227 --> 00:58:26,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Kate.

600
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:33,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I also just put your email in the chat for anyone that wants to copy it or that has any ideas or requests for Kate around some

601
00:58:34,465 --> 00:58:37,127
[SPEAKER_07]: some inclusive recreational activities.

602
00:58:37,207 --> 00:58:47,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I know that one of the things that was brought up to me, I was talking to a parent the other day that was talking about, I'm really encouraged, Kate, for folks who don't know, the recreation program is now what, two or three years old?

603
00:58:48,635 --> 00:58:48,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know?

604
00:58:50,176 --> 00:58:50,916
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going on three years.

605
00:58:51,057 --> 00:58:51,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

606
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:55,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, it's, and this is the citywide recreational programming.

607
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,303
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, as you can imagine, both with the Americans with Disabilities Act, but also

608
00:59:01,101 --> 00:59:05,023
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because it's the right thing to do, you know, inclusive programming is really important.

609
00:59:06,144 --> 00:59:12,288
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the recreation department has made a very clear commitment to inclusive programming and also to adaptive programming.

610
00:59:12,308 --> 00:59:13,628
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really appreciate that.

611
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:17,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it's been, you know, um, really demonstrated in action.

612
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,592
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's really good to see.

613
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:27,216
[SPEAKER_07]: It was also mentioned recently to me by a parent that we're talking about, like the, one of the programs, I think that you guys were running was very age specific.

614
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:28,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And this parent was saying like,

615
00:59:29,072 --> 00:59:41,418
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, why could we not sort of open it up to all ages right now because the participation level is fairly low and that there's only, I think, you know, it was an adaptive program and I think there's only one or two even individuals in the program.

616
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:47,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the reasons that, for example, other parents I knew weren't involved was because they felt like there was an age cutoff there.

617
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:53,383
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was something, you know, just to consider for feedback that I know a family member had.

618
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:57,665
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also what kind of partnership opportunities are there

619
00:59:58,175 --> 00:59:59,296
[SPEAKER_07]: with the Medford CPAC.

620
00:59:59,336 --> 01:00:02,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we have a couple of the chairs on the call now.

621
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:03,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex Lorick.

622
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Kate if you haven't met Alex maybe Alex you could say hello.

623
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:08,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Tanya Sullivan's on the call as well.

624
01:00:08,884 --> 01:00:12,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Kate CPAC is Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

625
01:00:13,388 --> 01:00:21,055
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's an organization that advises the district and families on best practices pertaining to educations of students with on IEPs and 504s.

626
01:00:21,115 --> 01:00:21,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex.

627
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:26,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hi.

628
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, I want to say that I love the Math for Decreation program.

629
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:34,947
[SPEAKER_02]: My son is 12, and he has intellectual disabilities.

630
01:00:34,987 --> 01:00:35,687
[SPEAKER_02]: He's at McGlynn.

631
01:00:36,248 --> 01:00:39,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did several session of the parkour.

632
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And he absolutely loved it.

633
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,955
[SPEAKER_02]: We stopped because we don't want to go indoors.

634
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:51,420
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was just looking at the program today, and we plan on doing the adaptive bowling with him.

635
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So one concern that I have specific

636
01:00:54,762 --> 01:01:15,062
[SPEAKER_02]: like I was saying he has intellectual disabilities and Melanie was saying there is a very strict cutoff on the age of the child that you really don't qualify so you don't have any options and for instance for Victor he's 12 and some programs are 12-14 or 12-15 and I really don't feel quite comfortable.

637
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:15,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he

638
01:01:16,225 --> 01:01:21,370
[SPEAKER_02]: is doing a little bit better with a little bit of a younger group because of his abilities.

639
01:01:21,931 --> 01:01:26,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe there is a little bit more flexibility there for our children.

640
01:01:26,155 --> 01:01:32,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Like somebody who's 13, I think maybe some parents would be more comfortable with a younger group.

641
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,644
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are open for collaboration.

642
01:01:36,597 --> 01:01:39,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that program, so I would love to make it more available for our parents.

643
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you and Kate, excuse me one second.

644
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:47,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I just I want to we have another parent with a raised hand, so maybe we could just let the parents sort of talk for a moment and then Angelica.

645
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:51,990
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on mute Angelica.

646
01:01:57,034 --> 01:01:57,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?

647
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:02,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, no, I just think it's great that Alex mentioned that because

648
01:02:03,593 --> 01:02:05,774
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, my son is eight years old.

649
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:07,754
[SPEAKER_15]: He goes to the connection programs.

650
01:02:08,214 --> 01:02:13,956
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you think about that, he has peers in his classroom, which there's second, third, and fourth grade.

651
01:02:14,636 --> 01:02:17,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, so they mix it up together.

652
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:24,820
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it would be a good opportunity when you have the adaptive programs, the sports, to put all the kids together.

653
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:32,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think it's just hard enough to have the time and to have the volunteers, because most of them need the one-to-one.

654
01:02:32,642 --> 01:02:38,946
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it would be a good idea, even for these parents to bound and even the kids, it's hard enough.

655
01:02:39,026 --> 01:02:41,687
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it would be a good opportunity to put it all together.

656
01:02:41,727 --> 01:02:47,731
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think for every sport it's gonna work, but for most of them, that would be great.

657
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:51,345
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great feedback.

658
01:02:51,365 --> 01:02:56,868
[SPEAKER_10]: So the other thing is you can always feel free to email me for any classes.

659
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:08,955
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think your child could be in second grade but could play basketball with a fifth grader, you just send me an email and usually I can make an exception and let anybody into the class.

660
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:14,478
[SPEAKER_10]: But I definitely will talk to Kevin about changing the ages for the programming.

661
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:17,160
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if you suggest

662
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:32,293
[SPEAKER_10]: You know if I did like elementary to middle school age and then a high school group or you know what you guys think is best looks like I have a couple head shaking yes that maybe we do elementary to middle and then a high school.

663
01:03:33,193 --> 01:03:36,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Angelica did you oh actually Carla you want to talk and then Angelica.

664
01:03:37,517 --> 01:03:38,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, hey.

665
01:03:38,658 --> 01:03:38,978
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi Kate.

666
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:49,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so this would be, this is a great platform for what we're doing within the building right now and I think we're kind of doing the same thing but parallel and I think it would be great if we could collaborate.

667
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:56,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Just, I would love to get more information I actually don't know a lot about the recreation programs that are already being run.

668
01:03:57,655 --> 01:04:22,862
[SPEAKER_18]: but it's something you know a parent talked about a lot of students might need a one-to-one and where we're working on fostering relationships within the building this could be a great opportunity for the students in the CCSR that we already have in the classroom and we had wanted to do some after-school activities and have an inclusive you know recreational environment for them so I would love to talk more about that.

669
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, Angelica and then Ms.

670
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:27,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Heim.

671
01:04:28,122 --> 01:04:44,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and to add to that, sometimes I think we are just thinking about to have so many volunteers to have a one-to-one, but from my experience, Noah was part of the basketball, we didn't have a one-to-one, so I talked to Ms.

672
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:51,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Katie and she was able to allow him to go to a regular for typical kids, but he had his BT,

673
01:04:51,965 --> 01:05:13,790
[SPEAKER_15]: being helping with him so it's another thing that we I think we could be open mind or maybe the parent can be the one-to-one and be more open mind about that that will be very helpful because we always just thinking about adaptive but sometimes the time and the day it doesn't work for you but it doesn't mean you cannot be part of it I think we should be way more open mind about that.

674
01:05:14,638 --> 01:05:16,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just add, Angelica, thank you.

675
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, not just adaptive, but inclusive.

676
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's nice to have the flexibility of both.

677
01:05:20,401 --> 01:05:25,364
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those who are on the meeting who don't know, BT, behavior therapist.

678
01:05:25,444 --> 01:05:32,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And so in that instance, the student had their outside therapist participating both in supporting them in that situation.

679
01:05:32,788 --> 01:05:37,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the flexibility with having other people in that role is really helpful.

680
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:44,275
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think just all around the flexibility, both in the programming and in the support is essential.

681
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:53,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I also sort of want to just, again, reflect on Carla and the point around, you know, there are some instances where those relationships are not horizontal relationships, right?

682
01:05:53,780 --> 01:06:04,506
[SPEAKER_07]: They're more about, you know, sort of the supervision or the teacher-student role or whatever, but when we're talking about peers and peer support, we really want to make sure that, you know, we're fostering friendship.

683
01:06:05,947 --> 01:06:12,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that's a really important part of it because, again, getting back to our primary goal here of how we're fostering friendship and community engagement

684
01:06:12,756 --> 01:06:14,717
[SPEAKER_07]: and a feeling of participation in our schools.

685
01:06:14,757 --> 01:06:37,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why we're doing this as a subcommittee as well is to really foster acceptance and inclusion and equity, of course, but also to bring students to our schools and to want to be part of our schools and to come to our schools, bring them into out of district or in from parochial environments or other private school environments so that they can feel that they are part of an included and are feeling those friendships.

686
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:37,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ms.

687
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:38,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Heim.

688
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:43,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just so I hi, Kate, this is a great program.

689
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:45,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an OT and transition specialist.

690
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:51,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we talked right before the COVID shutdown last spring when you're looking for volunteers.

691
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:54,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, it's a great program.

692
01:06:54,775 --> 01:07:07,401
[SPEAKER_04]: We do need social opportunities, community based social opportunities for students in inclusive environments also to foster

693
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:12,186
[SPEAKER_04]: social connections beyond the walls of the high school.

694
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:29,916
[SPEAKER_04]: So to have that opportunity for an activity-based group outside of the high school that we can support from the high school is a really wonderful opportunity, particularly while we're waiting for our library to be finished too.

695
01:07:29,996 --> 01:07:34,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been kind of thinking that's a good meeting space too, but appreciate the effort.

696
01:07:36,551 --> 01:07:36,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

697
01:07:37,171 --> 01:07:38,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Kate, did you want to respond?

698
01:07:44,355 --> 01:07:44,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

699
01:07:44,655 --> 01:07:51,538
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, I'm, I'm definitely interested in, um, collaborating with the high school as well.

700
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:53,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And Carla, that's great.

701
01:07:56,101 --> 01:07:59,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Contact before I've met a few of you from working at the high school as well.

702
01:08:00,803 --> 01:08:02,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I came to the recreation department.

703
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:07,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I can get anybody's emails and we can connect.

704
01:08:09,498 --> 01:08:09,919
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

705
01:08:09,979 --> 01:08:30,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe if, you know, with Tonya and Alex as the co-chairs of the CPAP too, if you guys are able to connect maybe on a monthly, even before the adaptive and other classes come out so that the CPAP can also, you know, get that information out to the community and we can also, you know, they can also be thinking about community supports and I'll also be happy to help with,

706
01:08:31,252 --> 01:08:33,038
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at the volunteerism piece of it too.

707
01:08:33,138 --> 01:08:34,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Angelica, did you have your hand raised again?

708
01:08:35,387 --> 01:08:37,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I just have a question.

709
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:41,812
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you guys are spreading the word about the adaptive programs?

710
01:08:41,912 --> 01:08:51,099
[SPEAKER_15]: You just have to go online or you get an email because in my case, I don't have, I know I'm out of the planet, but I don't have social media.

711
01:08:51,559 --> 01:08:55,242
[SPEAKER_15]: So how do I get to know, don't you think we should have a plan?

712
01:08:55,763 --> 01:09:03,649
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, backpackers putting backpacks kids, or I don't know, the CPAC, how can we spread the word about that?

713
01:09:04,973 --> 01:09:12,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so right now we are on Facebook as well as our website, which is also listed on City Hall's website.

714
01:09:13,936 --> 01:09:16,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, that's pretty much most of our marketing right there.

715
01:09:17,557 --> 01:09:28,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely we've sent out flyers for anybody sometimes for classes through our MyRec, which is when you sign up and you have an account with our programs.

716
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:32,161
[SPEAKER_10]: We have like newsletters that we send out through there.

717
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,002
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're not

718
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:39,501
[SPEAKER_10]: registered for any programs and you don't have an account, then you won't get those emails.

719
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:49,624
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe it could be forwarded to the schools, maybe to the different departments, and then we can go from there.

720
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:51,905
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys could distribute to your students.

721
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:54,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just jump in for one second?

722
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:59,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that obviously CPAC, we would love to

723
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,602
[SPEAKER_08]: meet with you, Kate, and kind of go over the programs.

724
01:10:04,003 --> 01:10:15,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm wondering if it might be beneficial to have some sort of distribution through the school of the Medford Recreation Department adaptive programs that would go out to our community.

725
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:29,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we can certainly send to our listserv, we can certainly post on Facebook, but I'm wondering, since the school does hold, you know, information on all of the families that would benefit from the adaptive programs, if that might not be

726
01:10:29,644 --> 01:10:31,124
[SPEAKER_08]: a good kind of marry up.

727
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:33,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Miss Bowen.

728
01:10:33,825 --> 01:10:34,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, good evening.

729
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:47,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a great idea, Tanya, and we could partner and I could work with the special education evaluation team leaders and coordinators throughout the district to make sure that that information is distributed to our families.

730
01:10:48,528 --> 01:10:53,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think it, you know, we can we can post them in the schools, but we could also make sure that

731
01:10:54,349 --> 01:11:00,551
[SPEAKER_03]: when meetings are occurring, that this is information that is being shared with the parents on an ongoing basis.

732
01:11:00,851 --> 01:11:08,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we do have a lot of parents that aren't on social media or may need translation, things like that.

733
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:15,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just want to be aware of that and make sure that we're getting to as many parents and families that we can.

734
01:11:15,996 --> 01:11:20,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can definitely partner with you as well and help to get that information distributed.

735
01:11:20,558 --> 01:11:21,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

736
01:11:22,136 --> 01:11:22,756
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

737
01:11:22,796 --> 01:11:26,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to offer some snaps here right now, because I love it when meetings work like that.

738
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:27,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yes, yes, yes.

739
01:11:27,799 --> 01:11:28,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep the momentum going.

740
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:29,240
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

741
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:29,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

742
01:11:30,621 --> 01:11:31,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Joan.

743
01:11:31,742 --> 01:11:32,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, CPAC.

744
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:33,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Kate.

745
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:34,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I think these are all really great things.

746
01:11:34,944 --> 01:11:49,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, like I said, if we really gave some thought to this, even building this volunteer list, I think you'd be stunned by the people in the community that really want to be part of this, because it's such a meaningful way, really, to just coexist, frankly, and to create these friendships.

747
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:51,931
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of opportunity here.

748
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:52,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited about that.

749
01:11:53,632 --> 01:11:56,433
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have about 16 minutes left.

750
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,695
[SPEAKER_07]: This Zoom account is being used for another meeting right after this.

751
01:11:59,755 --> 01:12:01,255
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have to end right at 6.30.

752
01:12:01,955 --> 01:12:04,577
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanna be aware of that.

753
01:12:05,097 --> 01:12:07,338
[SPEAKER_07]: So getting back to the policy piece.

754
01:12:07,378 --> 01:12:17,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we're thinking about this big picture of how we're building these relationships and friendships and really modeling equity and inclusion across our community, both as school committee members and community members,

755
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:21,888
[SPEAKER_07]: how are we doing this within the walls and outside of the walls?

756
01:12:21,948 --> 01:12:35,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have been looking to what already exists in the community and the common ground program that is at the high school, in addition to the best buddy program that we're aware of and some of the things that we've been talking about.

757
01:12:35,154 --> 01:12:40,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've had the opportunity to talk to some community members around the common ground program.

758
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:43,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually was also able to sit in with them and I presented to them

759
01:12:44,411 --> 01:12:45,292
[SPEAKER_07]: two years ago, I think.

760
01:12:46,012 --> 01:12:47,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just such a good program.

761
01:12:47,753 --> 01:13:00,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think because it already existed at such a foundation, I wanted to sort of put out this idea that had been mentioned today around, you know, really continuing that theme and that model.

762
01:13:00,261 --> 01:13:04,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And so instead of really, you know, even naming Friendship Project or, you know, just something like

763
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:09,464
[SPEAKER_07]: that we have been talking about in the past, why not just keep this idea of common ground, right?

764
01:13:09,504 --> 01:13:16,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what we're really trying to find is what is the common ground between us as human beings and how do we build these relationships and build these friendships?

765
01:13:16,751 --> 01:13:26,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not just expand that program that Carla, Andre, and Michael Storker at the high school, a special education professional and a general education professional,

766
01:13:27,549 --> 01:13:32,815
[SPEAKER_07]: did together already a few years ago, and that is so enriching and rewarding to the students.

767
01:13:32,895 --> 01:13:35,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been so glad to be a part of, and it's been really wonderful.

768
01:13:35,618 --> 01:13:42,545
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that there are some families of students with disabilities on the call who are also part of the program, but I'd like, you know, again, we have about 14 minutes.

769
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:50,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love it if maybe Michael and Carla could give yourself two or three minutes each to speak, and then maybe we can talk about some of the things that we were thinking for next steps.

770
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:53,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to go first, Michael or Carla?

771
01:13:53,213 --> 01:13:53,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Carla?

772
01:13:53,673 --> 01:13:55,956
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so Carla, I'm going to give you three minutes.

773
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:57,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready, set, go.

774
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:58,198
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

775
01:13:58,218 --> 01:14:08,449
[SPEAKER_18]: So the overarching idea is to provide more opportunity for students to have meaningful inclusion, fostering meaningful relationships, and having horizontal friendships.

776
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:14,492
[SPEAKER_18]: And also to provide staff with kind of the background knowledge to foster that within our building.

777
01:14:14,812 --> 01:14:18,514
[SPEAKER_18]: So that being said, in terms of a policy what does that look like.

778
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:23,637
[SPEAKER_18]: So, whether that be a small amount of funding that goes towards this over.

779
01:14:24,237 --> 01:14:33,320
[SPEAKER_18]: This umbrella theme of common ground so common ground the class that me Mr. score for have running right now common ground the after school club common ground.

780
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:41,722
[SPEAKER_18]: In terms of recreation, which is great that Kate is here wrapped up like a nice little gift because I didn't you know realize that we kind of have that platform going.

781
01:14:42,342 --> 01:14:58,360
[SPEAKER_18]: And then common ground in terms of the curriculum and this is something that is really way off in the future but I am hopeful to see where you know I'm teaching really modified curriculum, but I can go into a history class with say Riley Jones and we are, you know, both

782
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:08,182
[SPEAKER_18]: talking about World War I, and there's one day a month where we all go into that classroom and we can collaborate with those AP students, honor students, you know, whatever level.

783
01:15:08,262 --> 01:15:13,043
[SPEAKER_18]: So having all students of all abilities together in those core subjects at some point.

784
01:15:13,483 --> 01:15:18,564
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, Melanie, the policy portion is kind of more your expertise.

785
01:15:18,944 --> 01:15:23,865
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the idea, and as you said, the idea kind of, it kind of forms a policy.

786
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,202
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea seeds the policy for sure.

787
01:15:26,242 --> 01:15:26,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was great.

788
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:27,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Three minutes.

789
01:15:27,543 --> 01:15:28,684
[SPEAKER_07]: You did really well, Carla.

790
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Mr. Skorka, three minutes.

791
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:34,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.

792
01:15:34,629 --> 01:15:42,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to give a little bit of information about the Common Ground program, just in case anybody doesn't know.

793
01:15:42,236 --> 01:15:45,739
[SPEAKER_01]: So Carla and I have been doing this for just about three years now.

794
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a class called Diversity and Community Enrichment.

795
01:15:49,223 --> 01:15:50,644
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of my students,

796
01:15:51,084 --> 01:15:59,270
[SPEAKER_01]: go even now during Zoom to Carla's class and they help facilitate activities and really build friendships and it has been such a wonderful program.

797
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:02,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Students sign up for the class just to be in the program.

798
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:12,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have six students now that are going every every we meet twice out of a six-day cycle so they're going to at least two times a week and it has been wonderful.

799
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:17,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Even last year you know the the friendships just formed so authentically and they were even

800
01:16:17,584 --> 01:16:18,925
[SPEAKER_01]: they were even eating lunch together.

801
01:16:19,005 --> 01:16:20,546
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not something that I asked them to do.

802
01:16:20,586 --> 01:16:21,587
[SPEAKER_01]: They just did it on their own.

803
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:22,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's wonderful.

804
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:29,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally would love to see something similar in all levels, not just at the high school, at the middle school and elementary schools as well.

805
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:33,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would really benefit everybody.

806
01:16:33,475 --> 01:16:37,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this program is getting bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger.

807
01:16:37,698 --> 01:16:42,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so humbled and grateful to be a part of the experience.

808
01:16:42,141 --> 01:16:46,304
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to continue this in as many ways as we can moving forward.

809
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:47,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Skorka.

810
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:54,288
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just have to say, you know, seeing those friendships and witnessing the kids interacting with each other, they are authentic friendships.

811
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:56,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's so remarkable about them is they're not adult led.

812
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:59,994
[SPEAKER_07]: They're organic and they're developed, you know, independently.

813
01:17:00,034 --> 01:17:02,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I really liked seeing.

814
01:17:02,777 --> 01:17:10,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I know that the people that, you know, I see in the disability community all the time that are either, you know, the professionals or

815
01:17:11,045 --> 01:17:19,508
[SPEAKER_07]: experts in the field or whatever, all have a story about what brought them to this, to this work, you know, and it, and it always stems from a friendship, or from somebody that they loved.

816
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:22,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that's a really big and important piece of that.

817
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:33,574
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I really liked Carla talking about today, too, just as we're thinking about, you know, taking off small pieces and not trying to do, you know, whole things, it's just even little bits of

818
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:40,717
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, how it might be piloted and, you know, not necessarily district-wide, but maybe in another, you know, in the middle school level, right?

819
01:17:40,777 --> 01:17:42,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're sort of looking at it at a middle school level.

820
01:17:42,619 --> 01:17:48,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Mr. Skorka, you have that experience with CCSR, and that was how you guys branched from the high school with CCSR.

821
01:17:48,844 --> 01:18:02,415
[SPEAKER_07]: For folks who are here and don't know CCSR, it's the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, which is an incredible club at the high school and now at all the schools teaching citizenship and social responsibility to so many students.

822
01:18:02,937 --> 01:18:05,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So that had expanded beyond the high school as well.

823
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:13,186
[SPEAKER_07]: But as a pilot, sort of, you know, it started at the high school and then sort of moved on at each level and was a really good model for that.

824
01:18:13,246 --> 01:18:18,290
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm excited to have you and Miss Andre here to even be talking about this.

825
01:18:18,731 --> 01:18:19,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you guys so much.

826
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:22,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm so proud and happy with the work that you're doing at the high school.

827
01:18:22,894 --> 01:18:25,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm grateful for the work that you're doing at the high school for our students.

828
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:35,896
[SPEAKER_07]: 621.

829
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:35,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to give folks an opportunity to, you know, brainstorm popcorn a little bit if you want, but I'd like to think, you know, I want to add for the next session.

830
01:18:35,916 --> 01:18:45,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to, again, identify individuals maybe at the middle school level or more that are interested in common ground in the community.

831
01:18:45,422 --> 01:18:47,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I also would love to see a common ground

832
01:18:48,123 --> 01:19:08,054
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, once a month event night out right common ground night out right we're going to assembly row we're going to the movies we're going to go, we're going to have a dance we're going to do whatever but we're going to, we're going to find some common ground and again, you know, post COVID common ground in the meantime, what's been really nice about COVID and one of the things that has been a huge advantage frankly for families with disabilities is that we can be

833
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:12,699
[SPEAKER_07]: in these settings now, we can all be in these rooms together because we don't have to worry about the noise.

834
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:22,743
[SPEAKER_07]: We can hit mute, or we can, you know, turn down our volume or, you know, so many adaptations that have been created through COVID and this opportunity and even seeing curriculum, right?

835
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:31,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I also want to give a shout out pretty soon, Craig Drowski and Carla Andre are going to be presenting at the CPAC.

836
01:19:32,086 --> 01:19:38,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what the date is, but maybe Alex and Tanya, you could share that on differentiated instruction on differentiating curriculum.

837
01:19:38,852 --> 01:19:50,566
[SPEAKER_07]: for exactly the, you know, these purposes around, you know, how do you include, you know, students with complex intellectual and developmental disabilities and needs into a general education setting in terms of differentiating curriculum.

838
01:19:51,026 --> 01:19:54,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's been really neat to see as a family member in the home.

839
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:55,211
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's been great.

840
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:59,236
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to, with the eight minutes left, I want to give us five minutes to

841
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:03,503
[SPEAKER_07]: offer community input and then a few minutes to just wrap it up.

842
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So community input.

843
01:20:05,545 --> 01:20:11,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Mel, I just wanted to say that that meeting that you're talking about the differentiated curriculum is going to be on April 14th.

844
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Tanya.

845
01:20:13,571 --> 01:20:13,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

846
01:20:19,335 --> 01:20:23,539
[SPEAKER_07]: So anybody, ideas, interest, enthusiasm, anything?

847
01:20:23,839 --> 01:20:25,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of enthusiasm.

848
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like so excited that this common ground is like

849
01:20:28,545 --> 01:20:29,506
[SPEAKER_08]: going crazy.

850
01:20:29,666 --> 01:20:33,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Carla and I have talked about this before, and my son absolutely loves it.

851
01:20:34,651 --> 01:20:40,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking as a mom of a child with a disability that participates in the Common Ground program, it is epic.

852
01:20:42,098 --> 01:20:47,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I wondered though, I know Carla had mentioned something about how funding would look for the Common Ground umbrella.

853
01:20:47,424 --> 01:20:51,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we're going to do it in baby steps, but what will that look like?

854
01:20:52,967 --> 01:20:53,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's a good point.

855
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:55,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a budget would have to be drawn up.

856
01:20:55,589 --> 01:21:00,314
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that's sort of the policy piece that comes in from the school committee aspect is what does that look like?

857
01:21:00,354 --> 01:21:01,875
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what would actually be needed?

858
01:21:01,975 --> 01:21:03,417
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, how does that run?

859
01:21:03,477 --> 01:21:10,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would, you know, look to do a little bit of legwork with Mr. Skorka around, you know, his experience with CCSR and sort of

860
01:21:10,888 --> 01:21:26,398
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, what that budget looked like and where funding, potential funding streams or sources could come from, whether it is, you know, again, initially, you know, grants, community donations, part of the special education budget, you know, but having a number will help us define that.

861
01:21:26,939 --> 01:21:37,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think maybe that's a goal that we can, again, come to the table with next month, what kind of a budget for a pilot program of this sort, you know, for the next year would there need to be.

862
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,667
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll work on those numbers.

863
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Tonya.

864
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:45,799
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very exciting, I just have to say.

865
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It is exciting.

866
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I have a big smile on my face.

867
01:21:51,401 --> 01:21:52,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it is exciting.

868
01:21:52,461 --> 01:21:58,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe Tonya, you can share a little bit of a personal story about your experience last year with Joe and Emily.

869
01:22:02,144 --> 01:22:07,345
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean for Emily that was in CCSR?

870
01:22:07,545 --> 01:22:09,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, wasn't that part of the CCSR common ground?

871
01:22:10,423 --> 01:22:13,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's a bunch of new people in it this year too.

872
01:22:13,286 --> 01:22:20,813
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, what I can say is that I know that every day that he has this on his schedule, he is up, he is ready.

873
01:22:22,115 --> 01:22:24,517
[SPEAKER_08]: He can't get through the other classes fast enough.

874
01:22:25,478 --> 01:22:33,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And listening to them, because I'm in the next room, he's on his computer out in the kitchen, I'm in the next room.

875
01:22:33,346 --> 01:22:34,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And just listening to him,

876
01:22:35,252 --> 01:22:40,014
[SPEAKER_08]: and all the kids and the CCSR students, they're just laughing, they're having fun.

877
01:22:40,074 --> 01:22:43,116
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's really unaltered.

878
01:22:43,656 --> 01:22:45,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just really fabulous.

879
01:22:45,777 --> 01:22:48,438
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kids being kids and, you know, being able to engage.

880
01:22:48,498 --> 01:23:03,665
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would encourage, you know, Carla and Mr. Sporker, maybe if folks are interested and wanna email them directly, you know, about, you know, opportunities to introduce themselves to the group or, you know, observe the, you know, common ground in action or whatever, I would assume that that would be okay

881
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:06,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Carla and Michael, yeah, Mr. Skorka.

882
01:23:07,574 --> 01:23:16,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And also I just have to say what I really love when I observe is watching how natural the two of you are with the cadence of the relationship, right?

883
01:23:16,835 --> 01:23:25,757
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys aren't in there, you know, being the adult in the room and you're really letting the kids be who they are, their authentic selves.

884
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:28,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's great to see and kudos to you for that.

885
01:23:28,597 --> 01:23:33,038
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think you are a real model of example for the district, thank you.

886
01:23:35,273 --> 01:23:35,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I second that.

887
01:23:36,854 --> 01:23:37,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Skorka.

888
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:44,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to just say for one thing for the group, I think you're talking about Emily McDade.

889
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,862
[SPEAKER_01]: She wrote a beautiful article about the common ground.

890
01:23:47,942 --> 01:23:50,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the transcript last year.

891
01:23:50,163 --> 01:23:52,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I can share it with the group.

892
01:23:52,605 --> 01:23:57,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still online, but I just wanted to put that out there just in case you wanted to get the student perspective as well.

893
01:23:58,189 --> 01:23:59,850
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a beautiful, beautiful article.

894
01:24:00,542 --> 01:24:01,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please do.

895
01:24:01,562 --> 01:24:04,124
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll put that on the resources in the resources folder as well.

896
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,625
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can mail it out to email it out to folks as well.

897
01:24:06,665 --> 01:24:08,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's 627.

898
01:24:08,245 --> 01:24:12,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that the superintendent and others are going on to another zoom meeting.

899
01:24:12,107 --> 01:24:14,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can give them a minute or two to transition.

900
01:24:14,228 --> 01:24:16,009
[SPEAKER_07]: But our next meeting is February 11.

901
01:24:16,669 --> 01:24:23,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So folks that are on this call, please do come next time we'll start the meeting with special education five to 545.

902
01:24:23,172 --> 01:24:24,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And behavioral health will be 545 to 630.

903
01:24:26,317 --> 01:24:34,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to give out a shout out to Susanna Campbell, who has been running the disability awareness program in district and it's second week was today.

904
01:24:34,585 --> 01:24:44,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was able to be there last week and I love it and I love to see the participation and it's really exciting to seeing 40 staff and Community members.

905
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:54,307
[SPEAKER_07]: also really dedicated to this issue of, you know, eliminating ableism and really working on equity and inclusion and diversity in our district.

906
01:24:54,347 --> 01:24:55,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you all.

907
01:24:55,869 --> 01:24:56,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

908
01:24:56,749 --> 01:24:57,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy dreams.

909
01:24:57,990 --> 01:24:58,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

910
01:24:59,212 --> 01:24:59,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, everyone.

911
01:24:59,852 --> 01:25:00,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye bye.
