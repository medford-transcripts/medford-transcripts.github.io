1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:32,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just one second to find the agenda.

3
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,859
[SPEAKER_03]: That was open apparently.

4
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:22,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

5
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:25,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

6
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:29,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to read the meeting notice so we can get started and then.

7
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:40,616
[SPEAKER_03]: We can dive in, so please be advised that on Tuesday, October 15th at 5 PM, there'll be a strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting.

16
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:28,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau?

17
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:29,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

18
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:31,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Reinfeld?

19
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:32,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

20
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:33,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

21
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:34,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

22
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So three present, zero absent.

23
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:57,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Our agenda today is really to kick off the strategic and capital planning process, particularly with a focus on the capital planning component, which is based on the policy that we passed unanimously last spring to lay out a series of steps for capital planning that

24
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:07,190
[SPEAKER_03]: line up and to the best of our ability, don't overlap budget season because that becomes too many things at the same time.

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:25,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So the goal here is for us to do this capital planning work in advance of the sort of operating budget conversation so that A, we can feed that both to the mayor and to the council in advance of budget season, but also so that we're not sort of stepping on

26
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:33,150
[SPEAKER_03]: The need for, you know, extra meetings and things like that, um, for all of our staff, uh, for that purpose.

27
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

28
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we have a meeting scheduled today and then we have a meeting scheduled in November.

29
00:03:37,894 --> 00:03:41,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we may or may not need both meetings.

30
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:45,521
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll sort of see how it goes today, but the goal for us is to.

31
00:03:46,894 --> 00:04:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: take last year's capital plan and go through it together and make some updates to it to the best of our knowledge, as well as add potential capital projects to it that don't exist on there now.

32
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk a little bit about some of the work Peter has been doing to collect that information.

33
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:15,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And then really the other thing for us to do will be ultimately to come up with

34
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:25,006
[SPEAKER_03]: an attempt at prioritization of some kind for the whole giant list, um, so that we can clearly identify that for the school committee.

35
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:41,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then ultimately, um, to the mayor and the council and also, um, identify if there are projects that are potentially eligible for community preservation at, um, act funding, um, whether there's projects that are

36
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:45,199
[SPEAKER_03]: eligible to be included in that school spending, yes or no.

37
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:58,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, sort of all other and to start to have an ongoing process, which has been a little bit haphazard over the last couple of years, or really maybe forever.

38
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:03,725
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly, that it's been a thing that has been a work in progress for us.

39
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:10,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So really trying to get a more stringent process in place that aligns with that policy is sort of where we're at.

40
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:11,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense so far?

41
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:30,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to pull up a copy of Our Last capital plan.

42
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:31,432
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.

43
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:24,013
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where I will note my extreme dislike of Google Drive.

44
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:29,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So give me just one more second and we'll find it.

45
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:30,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I found it, Jenny.

46
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:31,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put it in the chat for you.

47
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:33,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

48
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I found it at the same time.

49
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:37,258
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, found it.

50
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

51
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to share my screen.

52
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:56,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the first thing I thought we would do is just refresh everyone's memory about what, um, the capital plan looks like as it existed last year when we met.

53
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:03,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then we can talk a little bit about, um, where we are with some of these projects.

54
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:05,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you all see that?

55
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it big enough?

56
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you make it a little larger, maybe 200?

57
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:16,930
[SPEAKER_03]: better?

58
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's better now.

59
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

60
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this is the capital plan as of the end of June.

61
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:39,893
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about all of these projects in our capital planning meeting and then this ultimately is also the capital plan that was submitted to MSBA.

62
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:45,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it contained the projects, uh, that.

63
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,800
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew about or we're planning for last year.

64
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so let's just sort of go from top to bottom.

65
00:07:52,804 --> 00:08:00,269
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first three projects are led light replacement projects, um, for Brooks, Missittuck and Medford high.

66
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:06,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, those are, um, at the time we said they were planned for FYI 25.

67
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:30,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way this works, my understanding is that it's on-bill financing through National Grid, and that we can, that these projects are in progress, and there's a, like, five-year payment cycle to do all of this work, because it contributes to energy savings.

68
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the first three here.

69
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:34,977
[SPEAKER_03]: That's these first three rows right here.

70
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:40,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, some other projects that, um.

71
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of shifting gears, we, we made sure we're on the plan.

72
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:55,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we have this, um, solar roof and battery project at the Andrews, which is actually a city sponsored project.

73
00:08:56,732 --> 00:09:02,054
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has been in the works for quite some time, um, because it's.

74
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:05,036
[SPEAKER_03]: being completed by the City of Medford.

75
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:14,045
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a whole lot of information about it and we might need to, perhaps at the next meeting, invite Alicia Hunt or others to join us.

76
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were multiple parts of this project at the time.

77
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:22,033
[SPEAKER_03]: There was putting solar on the roof.

78
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:38,558
[SPEAKER_03]: putting solar batteries in place, and all of that was to help the Andrews Middle School become like an emergency shelter sort of resilience hub for the city, which lacks that now.

79
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a tremendous amount of information about that, but that's what that one was.

80
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:52,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Our HVAC replacement project is listed here as well for both McGlynn and Andrews.

81
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:58,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we also then are sort of looking forward to say.

82
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:06,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we will need to do roof rebuilds for McGlynn Elementary, Brooks, Missittuc and Roberts.

83
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:13,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of those schools are sort of at the stage where we need to begin watching, um, roof replacement needs.

84
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,922
[SPEAKER_03]: The Andrews has already been replaced as part of, um, that product, the solar roof and battery projects.

85
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:25,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So that updates to the roof had to be done before the solar, um, could even be viable.

86
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:25,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

87
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:45,845
[SPEAKER_03]: As we talk about HVAC, we know that we will also have HVAC maintenance and replacement work to do at some point in the future around for Brooks, Missittuck, and Roberts because all of those systems are as old as the Andrews and McGlynn.

88
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, you know, we will, uh, be looking at that and I'll talk, I'll mention recommissioning in just a second.

89
00:10:54,252 --> 00:11:04,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we have, um, some district wide security upgrades on the next, um, on the next row here, uh, right here.

90
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then we do have, um,

91
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:12,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Playground renovations potentially at our other three middle schools.

92
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:19,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think everyone knows how amazing the work at the McGlynn was the good thing.

93
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:28,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the good thing about that project is that it has really solved a whole host of issues at the McGlynn but

94
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:44,669
[SPEAKER_03]: The McGlynn space is so unique, there's very little that you could sort of envision lifting up and putting in place in some of our other school buildings because the other school buildings just simply don't have playgrounds sized like that.

95
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is some things to think about from a playground innovation perspective.

96
00:11:52,137 --> 00:12:01,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have on this list a front stairwell replacement project, ADA accessibility improvements and gutters for the Curtis Tufts building.

97
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:07,423
[SPEAKER_03]: We have fire pump control work for McGlynn complex.

98
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,285
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Brooks hot water heater.

99
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:17,108
[SPEAKER_03]: This actually update here has been approved.

100
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:27,369
[SPEAKER_03]: in September, I guess it was October, October 2024.

101
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:31,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So that work is in progress now.

102
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:32,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good news.

103
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: We have also on this list, we have parking lot paving at the McGlynn and Andrews Complex.

104
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,281
[SPEAKER_03]: We have drainage at the field at the Brooks.

105
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:45,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

106
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:48,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Member Grant.

107
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:51,226
[SPEAKER_05]: The FY25 for the Brooks water heater, didn't that come in at $267,000?

108
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It did, yes.

109
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:00,393
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a wrong spot.

110
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:04,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong spot, sorry.

111
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:11,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so everyone's, pardon me, that's including a 10% contingency just so that everyone knows.

112
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:12,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

113
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:35,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have a project to replace the field flashing behind the brick at the McGlynn Elementary that causes rain in the kindergarten classrooms when it is driving sideways rain apparently is the like factor there that sort of causes that problem.

114
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:50,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then we also have, uh, we also put on the list, um, the front Plaza, uh, settling at the McGlynn and the Andrews, um, and some, uh, potential remediation for ADA compliance.

115
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:56,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that was everything on our list, um, as of June of last year.

116
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:59,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions about that so far?

117
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:22,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the next piece of this is to start to identify, are there other projects that need to be placed on this list that aren't here yet?

118
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:28,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Cushing and I met a month or so ago and we talked about

119
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:54,900
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, efforts, um, which are consistent with the policy that we pass to make sure that our building leaders and all the buildings, um, participated in this process, um, by, uh, submitting any of their capital needs to us, um, via our new operations hero, um, ticketing system for maintenance and, um, custodial services.

120
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:59,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, Dr. Cushing put out a memo and a call to the team to.

121
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:05,092
[SPEAKER_03]: collect input so that we could add to this list.

122
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:13,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will ask him to tell us how that went and what he has to share.

123
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:16,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Member Graham.

124
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:23,620
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principals and other members of the team responded well.

125
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:39,267
[SPEAKER_00]: They also imported to Operations Hero, which is our new, started last year, district ticketing system for emergency, not for emergency, I apologize, for buildings and grounds requests.

126
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:50,287
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary things that principals are still reporting are really requesting upgrades of security systems.

127
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:57,040
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrades of exterior door locking systems to move from keyed to keyless.

128
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:08,502
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the McGlynn and the Andrews complex, it's already on the list, but is the settling of the

129
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:23,447
[SPEAKER_00]: plazas which actually is now making the buildings not ADA compliant but that's a it's a concrete settling issue that we have a request out to a

130
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:36,203
[SPEAKER_00]: company to give us quote on what that construction management and design would be to either repair, alter, or to do.

131
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:41,651
[SPEAKER_00]: The high school has requested a new motor for the

132
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:46,273
[SPEAKER_00]: freight elevator that was damaged in the flood that we had last year.

133
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And the freight elevator is a much larger elevator.

134
00:16:51,194 --> 00:17:00,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be approximately $20,000 to $25,000 to go on to the freight elevator.

135
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:05,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also just looking through my notes here.

136
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:08,237
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the motor, is that correct?

137
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:09,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, correct.

138
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:19,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said it was how much Peter between 20 and $25,000 is our initial estimate.

139
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

140
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:29,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they've also we also have to do this wouldn't really fall under.

141
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:42,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on how much would be, but we do have to put door sweeps on many exterior doors as the buildings have settled overtime to make sure that we're preventing.

142
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:48,364
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of our integrated pest management, so our.

143
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:59,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Our IPM company has really suggested that door sweeps go on many of the exterior doors as well as mitigation of our

144
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:11,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, dumpster areas, um, due to road and challenges that we're facing, uh, not inside buildings, but at those, um, levels.

145
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:20,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, uh, also have requested for all schools, new bike racks.

146
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:24,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we do have a grant for some of that work, uh, upwards of $20,000 at the McGlynn.

147
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:39,608
[SPEAKER_00]: the Andrews and the high school to replace with modern bicycle racks as well as bicycle repair stations at those three schools.

148
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:49,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a request out to a company known as Darrow to provide us quotes for the equipment and the installation as well.

149
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:57,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Peter, is the request at all schools?

150
00:18:58,743 --> 00:18:58,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

151
00:18:59,523 --> 00:18:59,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

152
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:01,204
[SPEAKER_00]: The request is at all schools.

153
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:04,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And the grant is specific to the McLean MHS, right?

154
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:04,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

155
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:04,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

156
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:05,085
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

157
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:05,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And

158
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:29,419
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bulk of what has been requested, also I don't know if it's under there specifically district wide security upgrades.

159
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:36,087
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things in particular with those is making sure that there are cameras beyond the first floor of each school.

160
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:38,429
[SPEAKER_00]: That request came in repeatedly.

161
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:53,920
[SPEAKER_00]: if not in specifically entered in operations hero, but also requested, um, you know, of making sure that principles in the system principles have the ability to monitor, um, the entire building.

162
00:19:56,702 --> 00:20:01,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we have $1.9 million as a cost estimate.

163
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:07,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that does that include locks soup to nuts?

164
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,911
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes everything.

165
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:09,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

166
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

167
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And the grant funding did not come through.

168
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:14,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

169
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:15,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, no.

170
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:31,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grant funding would have provided, just so everyone is clear, would have provided door locks at up to eight doors at the high school, five doors, between three and five doors at the outside schools.

171
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:45,853
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras covering the full entity of the middle schools, the high school, and then telephones in every high school classroom.

172
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:51,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

173
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Member Ruseau.

174
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:55,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

175
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, do we know if that included handling

176
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:01,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these would be networked.

177
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:07,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we know if that included figuring out how we're going to network at the high school?

178
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:09,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it did.

179
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:12,487
[SPEAKER_00]: It included full wiring.

180
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:14,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

181
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:14,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

182
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:16,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

183
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:29,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to look at, I tried to in those quotes, I tried to look at things that would alleviate the lift on a strain district system and try to make sure that we would deliver the system.

184
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:35,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 1.9 million is for a system that would be 100% cloud based.

185
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:47,203
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some discussion as to whether or not maintaining servers is a better way to go for less chance of hacking or other security challenges with that.

186
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I would certainly like to be involved in any conversation on that point.

187
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:54,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, happy to.

188
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

189
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:07,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So Peter, the new things that you, I just want to make sure that I got them as you were talking because that's first I was listening and then I was like, oh wait, I'm the note taker.

190
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I should start writing some things down.

191
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:10,704
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to make sure I got them all.

192
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:16,528
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the bike racks, the door sweeps, the freight elevator motor.

193
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:16,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

194
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I miss anything?

195
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,200
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't.

196
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the list is fairly comprehensive to begin with.

197
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:32,108
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as capital needs.

198
00:22:32,328 --> 00:22:33,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.

199
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,049
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, too, is

200
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:37,865
[SPEAKER_00]: We're including it in the HVAC maintenance.

201
00:22:38,205 --> 00:22:53,040
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do think, you know, it may be something that we want to call out individually is all of our network closets and other technology spaces across the district have independent from the native building systems.

202
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,846
[SPEAKER_00]: They have independent mini split systems so that regardless

203
00:23:00,015 --> 00:23:11,485
[SPEAKER_00]: of the main building system, they are to essentially run 24-7, monitor themselves, and to make sure that they're providing cooling.

204
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:20,932
[SPEAKER_00]: The overwhelming number of these systems across the district, and I think the number is 14 off the top of my head, have failed.

205
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:23,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have doors open to make sure.

206
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:26,917
[SPEAKER_00]: It is part of the overall HVAC process.

207
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,759
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been very clear about that.

208
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:39,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to really continually changing refrigeration, and I'm sure people have heard me talk about R22 and various things like that.

209
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:52,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to really constant changing in the HVAC world, the systems that we would need to replace these so that we're not replacing them with already outdated

210
00:23:53,335 --> 00:24:06,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the materials and equipment will not be available until Q two of the current calendar of the upcoming calendar year, so we're expecting them to be available in March.

211
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:10,325
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planning that that will be one of the first phases of our, um.

212
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:34,863
[SPEAKER_00]: capital investment in the HVAC systems that will go district-wide because what they do, and Member Ruseau can speak to this, and I'm sure many other people can as well, but they help keep very sensitive equipment temperature regulated, and right now we are experiencing challenges with temperature in some of these rooms.

213
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:42,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing, when you said it's included in the HVAC project, do you mean just at McGlynn and Andrews?

214
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:48,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is included, uh, in that in that it is.

215
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

216
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,012
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not included in the overall cost price of $20 million.

217
00:24:53,132 --> 00:24:55,914
[SPEAKER_00]: It is additional to that $20 million.

218
00:24:56,454 --> 00:25:00,036
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only about the initial estimate is in the neighborhood of 200 to $250,000.

219
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,297
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is in addition to, um, the estimate of the 20 million.

220
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:02,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

221
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:15,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

222
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:29,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm just going to make some notes.

223
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:30,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

224
00:25:44,540 --> 00:26:10,872
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you want like grant funded that's through uh community preservation what is sorry uh the bike racks the bike bike modernization and we do have an application in right now uh it i've been told that it's a very competitive round uh but to look at a uh historic assessment of the curtis tough school

225
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:22,912
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what we need to really get that building envelope, stairs, windows, and other things along those lines funded through that.

226
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:28,239
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the last of those types of buildings still used as a school in the city.

227
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:39,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has significant value, I think, and others think in speaking to at City Hall for its impact on South Medford.

228
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:45,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really want to look and see what we can do to make that building really shine again.

229
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:51,899
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry.

230
00:26:55,438 --> 00:26:56,698
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.

231
00:26:57,439 --> 00:27:05,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So Peter, for that project, is the estimate still $20,000, or is it something different?

232
00:27:05,782 --> 00:27:07,002
[SPEAKER_00]: It's between $20,000 and $40,000.

233
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just an assessment.

234
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,266
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the replacement of the stairwell.

235
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:18,606
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not include

236
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:32,802
[SPEAKER_00]: like the actual replacement, this is to understand what the total cost would be around roof repair, cupola repair, front stairs, doors, things along those lines.

237
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:41,229
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is what of these

238
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,822
[SPEAKER_02]: can or should be bundled right does it.

239
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:47,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to do.

240
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:58,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it help to do all the HVAC together because of a vendor or because of timing, or is everything here, like the roof rebuilds does it not matter which building it's on.

241
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:12,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember, Reinfeld, the other thing that is that is being actively bundled with the HVAC project is this recommissioning process that we've talked about a couple of times.

242
00:28:13,688 --> 00:28:16,910
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is something that is being bundled in with that.

243
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:22,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And what what recommissioning is going to tell us is how much light do we have left on the roof?

244
00:28:24,457 --> 00:28:31,500
[SPEAKER_03]: how much life do we have left in the HVAC system and those kinds of things, as well as like smaller, easier things to address and fix.

245
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: So the team was working on a proposal for that piece of the work around recommissioning for all of the buildings outside of McGlynn and Andrews, except for MHFs and Curtis Tufts, so Brooks, Missituk, Roberts.

246
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:53,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that would be included in that work and in that budget.

247
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:56,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I think from a city perspective.

248
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,464
[SPEAKER_03]: The, I think the mayor and the council broadly know that the HVAC replacement is going to cost $20M.

249
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:09,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the exact costs I think are still very much being refined and defined.

250
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so the funding source of that in terms of how it'll be paid for, I think still is.

251
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:22,280
[SPEAKER_03]: technically uncommitted because we're just not like ready to do that, to take that step just yet.

252
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:35,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think the one question is like what really should be bundled in there when it comes to like the networked closets and the roof placements, et cetera.

253
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:44,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So certainly if you're going to, I think that's a question for us and maybe a question to ask Alicia if we are able to have her join us next time.

254
00:29:45,655 --> 00:30:12,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Is really to think about if we're thinking about McGlynn and McGlynn complex and Andrews, um, we should be thinking about all of these parts as part of that bid, um, where the other schools, Brooks, Mr. Chuck Roberts may need to be in a subsequent planned round where, um, we do the recommissioning first and then it sort of leads us from a priority perspective.

255
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:16,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

256
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,605
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes perfect sense.

257
00:30:18,205 --> 00:30:19,246
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

258
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:20,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just trying to Peter.

259
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:37,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, has the roof been officially deemed as part of the scope for the McGlynn, or not yet?

260
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.

261
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:46,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just so everyone's aware, we have weekly meetings with our owners project manager, JLL, and our design team, P2Q.

262
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:51,161
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have another one tomorrow at 11 AM, just so everyone's aware.

263
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:57,866
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned last week that a lot of the equipment, particularly in the McGlynn,

264
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:21,373
[SPEAKER_00]: because they now have to have energy recovery wheels on the equipment as part of energy efficiency standards, that in particular, the McGlynn space, which is kind of the attic of the auditorium, it's going to be extraordinarily difficult to get equipment in there unless it's custom built, which would then add to the cost.

265
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we may have to be cutting into the roof.

266
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:35,433
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question that we had today, myself, John McLaughlin, Paul Riggie, and Gerry McCue, was we're going to have a roof assessment completed, uh, as soon as possible.

267
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:46,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Garland Roofing will come out and take a look at the roof, understand where it is in its lifespan, and really try to get a sense of, um,

268
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:57,562
[SPEAKER_00]: what we should do with the roof, especially if we're going to have to cut significant holes into it, and then start patching those holes with a potentially aged roof.

269
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Building's now 22 years old.

270
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:03,454
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this project is done, it'll be at 23 years old.

271
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:05,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Really try to understand the life.

272
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:20,542
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do a roof replacement, it helps us with the sizing of the equipment for the HVAC because in 2011, the building codes in Massachusetts changed, and there's now a requirement for significantly more insulation.

273
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:28,633
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will reduce the amount of heating and cooling that is actually needed in the building.

274
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:38,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And having been through a project like this before, I will say it is surprising how significant the reduction is by replacing the insulation on the roof.

275
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:44,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it is something that we are going to be doing pretty quickly to have an assessment of that roof done.

276
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:52,632
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know if we're going to be including that, um, which I can't really venture against because I'm not a roofer.

277
00:32:52,652 --> 00:32:56,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, the McGlynn is a large complex.

278
00:32:56,613 --> 00:33:04,475
[SPEAKER_00]: The Andrews roof about three or four years ago in anticipation of solar had an application that I believe is called the White Knight.

279
00:33:05,756 --> 00:33:08,558
[SPEAKER_00]: and a white roofing film.

280
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:14,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Film is probably too light a word, but the roof was essentially sealed with a new film.

281
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:29,172
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't necessarily get the R value of new insulation, but it does provide you a really good surface to install solar on, as well as protecting any imperfections that have developed in the roof over time.

282
00:33:31,937 --> 00:33:45,448
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Andrews, we don't anticipate having to cut into the roof as much as potentially the sides of the building where there are already vents available to make this HVAC replacement happen.

283
00:33:53,922 --> 00:34:09,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that reminds me of one of the resolutions we just had, I think last month or maybe it was the beginning of this month, around understanding what the needs to upgrade electrical systems to move away from fossil fuels.

284
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:20,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize that's not a specific project, but that's something we want to be planning for so that we're not kind of forced into making these decisions around.

285
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:27,269
[SPEAKER_02]: just on the basis of cost and availability.

286
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:30,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an assessment that we need.

287
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:51,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forget if I mentioned member Reinfeld during the, and I don't think I did, I may have mentioned it at the city council meeting, but the committee of the whole, if we had decided to go with a full electric option at the Brooks for the hot water heater, for example,

288
00:34:51,889 --> 00:35:05,787
[SPEAKER_00]: the lead time for the, and now this is an emergent, essentially an emergency repair because the hot water heater fails, but if let's say one of our other buildings, we're looking at about a 12-month lead time

289
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:13,451
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the necessary grid upgrades done for transformers outside of the building.

290
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:19,013
[SPEAKER_00]: And for anyone who's an electrical engineer and is cringing at how I'm describing it, I apologize.

291
00:35:19,573 --> 00:35:29,617
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially to upgrade the transformers outside the building to be able to deliver the power that would be needed for some of these systems, you're looking at about a 12 month lead time.

292
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:35,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that work is 100% the cost responsibility of the district.

293
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:42,478
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a plug and play, it's you have to plug and pay for those new transformers yourself.

294
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:50,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I don't want that to be a discouraging factor, but it is something to consider.

295
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:58,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Though presumably that's the kind of thing, I guess then that question comes to the same question we had before.

296
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,486
[SPEAKER_02]: If we wait on that, does the price go up or down?

297
00:36:01,506 --> 00:36:11,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some capital projects, the price goes up if you don't do it right away, and sometimes it goes down significantly if you give it a year for the technology to catch up.

298
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:15,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So which direction does this lean?

299
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:16,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know?

300
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:19,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't answer that.

301
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,101
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can say is,

302
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:23,529
[SPEAKER_00]: uh that the hot water heater was initially anticipated $110,000.

303
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:24,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

304
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:26,749
[SPEAKER_00]: We've budgeted $267,000.

305
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:33,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in all honesty the costs are only going to go up.

306
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:44,893
[SPEAKER_03]: On the topic of hot water heaters, do we have other hot water heaters that are in need of replacement?

307
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:47,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So end of life.

308
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this was the last one to go.

309
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,696
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the last of the original.

310
00:36:53,678 --> 00:37:08,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to start working on like so one of the one of the other things with Operation Hero is as we add new equipment, we can QR code all the equipment and then it will store all of the maintenance

311
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,648
[SPEAKER_00]: and essentially history of whatever the piece of equipment is.

312
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:20,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So as new equipment is deployed, and as we make repairs to things, we will be adding QR codes.

313
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:32,464
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually having our maintenance staff train tomorrow on this feature so that we can start tracking and asset tagging all of our equipment in the district.

314
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,407
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we're going to do with the new McGlynn playground, it's elements there.

315
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:56,737
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we want to do is we want to make sure that we essentially have clear and concise records, not saying that we don't right now, but clear and concise records on all of our equipment, especially the new things that we're installing that are high tech and really require a high level of skill to maintain and operate.

316
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:09,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, and so the cost of doing that is people's time, correct?

317
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:10,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it time and training?

318
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:15,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it hiring of people?

319
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:16,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Time and training.

320
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:31,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as we look at our maintenance team, I think we really have to look at what can we maintain in district and what are the things that we're going to have to go out for.

321
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:38,703
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the asset tagging is something that can definitely be done in district with the staff that we have now.

322
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:41,765
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to provide them some training and then

323
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:54,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the three members have district-issued devices, so we are recommending that we provide the third with a device so that they can easily scan and upload.

324
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:59,761
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a speech-to-text functionality that's, like many speech-to-text, very good.

325
00:39:00,362 --> 00:39:05,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a matter of typing in, it's just a matter of speaking in and updating that way.

326
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:16,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then my other question in terms of making this list.

327
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:19,657
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the things that we know are

328
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,402
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be big problems soon-ish.

329
00:39:27,522 --> 00:39:42,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a kind of middle tier list of things that we know are coming in the medium term, but if we don't proactively maintain them, they're going to get worse and become even exponentially more expensive to fix?

330
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:43,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking about

331
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,536
[SPEAKER_02]: The analogy here is things like our roads.

332
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:59,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot harder to repair roads that are severely weather damaged and potholes and all of this than to do maintenance on things that are showing wear and tear.

333
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:04,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And that saves us from doing desperate repairs later on.

334
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:09,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we didn't, I didn't ask you to prepare this in advance of this meeting.

335
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:14,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this is a better question for November, but I want to think about

336
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:24,486
[SPEAKER_02]: what we need to fix now to stop it from becoming a huge cost?

337
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:27,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a really good question for November.

338
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:39,411
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I will say on it is that working with Paul Riggie and Gerry McCue, we are looking at the preventative maintenance contracts that we need to have in place to make sure that we are being responsive.

339
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:54,635
[SPEAKER_00]: The district has operated on a, as opposed to preventative maintenance, has acted on, operated on a break then fix operational history for the last several years.

340
00:40:55,535 --> 00:41:04,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes from, when you cut a budget in a school, you wanna cut as far away from students as possible.

341
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:15,658
[SPEAKER_00]: And facilities is a great place to make those cuts because what you do is you live on a wing and a prayer or a whim and a prayer that things won't break.

342
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:18,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they always do.

343
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:19,339
[SPEAKER_00]: right?

344
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:37,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very easy to also, member Reinfeld and others, just to say, you know, if we have preventative maintenance contracts in place, oh, you know, we spend $2,500 a year or $3,500 a year on turf maintenance at the New McGlynn field or $3,500 a year on turf maintenance at the Brooks field.

345
00:41:38,051 --> 00:41:44,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I actually think the Brooks field is a really great example of what happens when you don't maintain annually a field.

346
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:47,497
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go there and you can see the seams separating.

347
00:41:48,123 --> 00:41:49,003
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a criticism.

348
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:55,906
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply saying that when budget cuts come, you want to take the budget as far from students as possible.

349
00:41:56,026 --> 00:42:00,528
[SPEAKER_00]: And where you think that is, is in the facility side of the house.

350
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:10,651
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're cutting from the places where kids sit, the places where kids play, the kids places where kids study, and the places where kids eat their lunches.

351
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:15,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, it is not away from where students are.

352
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:17,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Members, so?

353
00:42:18,944 --> 00:42:37,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just don't want to disagree with Peter, but we are definitely, you sort of almost got there where I was going, but we're just cutting future kids, not the kids in front of us now, is what we're doing, as if they don't matter anywhere near as much.

354
00:42:37,828 --> 00:42:45,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really, I do think that treating it as, you know,

355
00:42:48,342 --> 00:42:50,644
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, what's the word I'm looking at?

356
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:52,384
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a values proposition here.

357
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:59,968
[SPEAKER_05]: By not cutting from any of the kids now, everybody, the kids, the community can think everything is dandy.

358
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:08,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we end up in full-on crisis when there's nothing left that can be done, which is where we are in Medford.

359
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think, by the way, that

360
00:43:14,437 --> 00:43:17,160
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's been a couple of years it's been a couple of decades at least.

361
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:25,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I'm sort of beating that horse but it is, these are these are decisions that I think very much.

362
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,354
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make and understand that.

363
00:43:31,598 --> 00:43:43,327
[SPEAKER_05]: do things do cost more over time, even if they don't get more expensive, you know, exponentially, at a minimum, they're gonna get more expensive from inflation and all the other things.

364
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:59,580
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we've got to stop saying no, and we've got to, if we need a million dollars in maintenance costs a year, and we have to choose between maintaining our facilities or taking services away from kids, we need to take services away from kids.

365
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:02,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's do that another time.

366
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just worry about the list.

367
00:44:03,626 --> 00:44:03,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

368
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:04,707
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

369
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:05,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

370
00:44:05,888 --> 00:44:10,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wanted to put those things out there as they have to be factored in here.

371
00:44:10,952 --> 00:44:15,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're probably at a point where we need to now start that prioritization.

372
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:19,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so as you've been talking, what I've been trying to do is

373
00:44:20,934 --> 00:44:22,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's create some buckets here.

374
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:27,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, certainly the top bucket is the stuff that's in progress and and funded.

375
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:31,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so the HVAC project is up there.

376
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:35,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, exactly how it's funded, how it will be funded.

377
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we know that yet, but we do know that it's on the radar and, um.

378
00:44:41,923 --> 00:44:45,486
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, being planned for so that's everything up here.

379
00:44:45,546 --> 00:44:48,648
[SPEAKER_03]: The Brooks hot water heater is I did move that up here as well.

380
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:51,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's this top piece of, like, here's what's in progress.

381
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:53,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And moving forward.

382
00:44:55,965 --> 00:45:22,956
[SPEAKER_03]: down here is all the the rest of it i guess i would say i would call it and i grouped these three things um the roof rebuild the networked closet mini split replacements and the recommissioning assessment i put that on here as its own line item as the things that um are not committed yet but have been talked about as sort of part and parcel to that um that larger h back project so

383
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:43,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I will work with Peter and Alicia to determine between now and our next meeting, can those things move above the line and be bundled, or is there something else that has to happen for that to be effective, or does it have to come into the rest of the list?

384
00:45:43,232 --> 00:45:51,316
[SPEAKER_03]: That is maybe a different grouping than this next group, which based on what we were talking about,

385
00:45:53,044 --> 00:46:02,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounded to me like the most urgent imminent things that we would be talking about prioritizing here.

386
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:04,615
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last grouping.

387
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:13,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the things to plan for future many of which all of this stuff in particular is to be validated during recommissioning.

388
00:46:13,933 --> 00:46:15,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So not ready to do it yet.

389
00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:23,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I did put district wide security upgrades down here for next year based on the feedback about the grant.

390
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:28,562
[SPEAKER_03]: The playground renovations are down here as well.

391
00:46:28,582 --> 00:46:42,406
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on the radar parking lot, parking lot paving, and then the ADA plaza remediation, the settling remediation, and the district-wide electrification enablement assessment.

392
00:46:44,347 --> 00:46:54,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the first question, member Rousseau, member Reinfeld, do any of the things on this bottom chunk belong in the middle as we should be doing this this year?

393
00:47:01,024 --> 00:47:06,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, ADA compliance to me feels like we really need to get in compliance.

394
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:12,553
[SPEAKER_02]: But tell me more.

395
00:47:12,593 --> 00:47:13,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're waiting.

396
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:21,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we had identified some things at the high school, and I think we're waiting for member Branley to call the building and grounds meeting on that.

397
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this go with that?

398
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:29,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dr. Cushing, do you have a sense of the scope of this project?

399
00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:37,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yes, yes, to a certain degree.

400
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:44,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could do a we could look at a temporary fix of doing concrete ramps up.

401
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:52,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually just trying to find a video if you want to see it, but I'm just trying to find it as I'm looking here.

402
00:47:52,967 --> 00:48:02,017
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do some concrete ramps up, but the problem is that's not exactly the best because there's a potential that weather will get in there and cause cracking and breaking of that.

403
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:03,258
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an issue.

404
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:12,448
[SPEAKER_00]: The plazas in front of the McGlynn and the schools do not appear to have settled and the schools certainly haven't raised.

405
00:48:13,231 --> 00:48:25,730
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's anywhere between I'd say between one and three, possibly four inches in some area where what used to be a a smooth transition into the building for a person with mobility issues now.

406
00:48:27,065 --> 00:48:28,906
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we've spray painted them yellow.

407
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:31,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly can't even put a dollar value on it.

408
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:36,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's definitely an issue of compaction underneath.

409
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:41,512
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably not done properly at the start of at the building construction.

410
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:51,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there's been settling to it since I honestly can't even venture a guess of what the cost would be because we haven't gotten to that stage.

411
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:54,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

412
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:08,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, can we maybe take a to-do to talk to Paul Riggi about that to get a better assessment of what we might be looking at?

413
00:49:08,874 --> 00:49:13,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I met with him and let me see if I can find, just give me one second here.

414
00:49:16,877 --> 00:49:19,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will recognize that I jumped on member Ruseau.

415
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:20,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was also going to say something.

416
00:49:21,898 --> 00:49:23,219
[SPEAKER_02]: We should see that we should finish this.

417
00:49:25,381 --> 00:49:37,066
[SPEAKER_05]: The only other thing I see in the bottom list that I think it would behoove us to have as soon as possible is the electrification assessment.

418
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:41,648
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I have no clue how expensive that is.

419
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:46,410
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like the kind of thing you do at one elementary school and you can copy and paste.

420
00:49:48,691 --> 00:49:51,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And the middle schools as well.

421
00:49:51,493 --> 00:50:02,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't actually think it makes any sense to consider electrification at the high school at this moment in time.

422
00:50:02,622 --> 00:50:14,731
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the other schools, I think knowing what it would cost so we're not dealing with a break fix scenario and don't have a real understanding of the,

423
00:50:15,768 --> 00:50:19,183
[SPEAKER_05]: the gulf between what an electrification option would be and

424
00:50:22,324 --> 00:50:23,624
[SPEAKER_05]: going with gas or whatever.

425
00:50:24,364 --> 00:50:27,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I just moved that up with the like recommissioning assessment.

426
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:31,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say that category is recommissioning for me.

427
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:36,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the question is, can that be bundled or not?

428
00:50:36,427 --> 00:50:40,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So by the time we have our next meeting, I think we can answer that question.

429
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:46,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will invite Alicia as well to join us if she would like to.

430
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:49,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will try to get the answer in the meantime anyway.

431
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe more to come on that one.

432
00:50:53,311 --> 00:51:11,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, one other thing on that one, on electrification, is that, is there any sort of grant to support that assessment for climate mitigation, for energy, alternative energies?

433
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

434
00:51:17,145 --> 00:51:21,028
[SPEAKER_02]: but that seems like something that should be supported.

435
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:31,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

436
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:32,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

437
00:51:32,658 --> 00:51:40,965
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two items that were in this like near range situation were the door sweeps, Dr. Cushing.

438
00:51:41,926 --> 00:51:43,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you had any sense of what

439
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:54,536
[SPEAKER_03]: That number is and the other 1 is about the drainage at the Brooks field and I will.

440
00:51:57,051 --> 00:52:01,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I will mention that when that field was put in, we were promised that maintenance would happen.

441
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:08,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually am going to be critical about that, that we were promised that that would happen, and it didn't.

442
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:13,182
[SPEAKER_03]: We also were imminently promised that the drainage was going to be fixed, and it hasn't.

443
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:19,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And my kids are in high school and eighth grade now, and they were in third grade at the time.

444
00:52:19,606 --> 00:52:22,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have to get back to that.

445
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:40,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to look through my email because John may have sent me something about that, but Peter, I will let you answer as well about the door.

446
00:52:40,415 --> 00:52:51,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and on the drainage, is there any, I know that's something that you were really thinking about with the new McGlynn playground because, I mean, that playground was,

447
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,442
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly not draining to understatement.

448
00:52:57,023 --> 00:53:05,949
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue at the Brooks is the hill and the water comes like it sort of runs down the hill and spills onto the field.

449
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:12,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a drainage issue, but there is a drainage issue there.

450
00:53:12,374 --> 00:53:15,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just wondering if there's a service contract to be maintaining

451
00:53:18,072 --> 00:53:32,577
[SPEAKER_02]: this turf setting, does it also, is it possible to bundle that with the other school, even though they're, however- I believe the turf is being, I believe we are finally on the maintenance contract at the Brooks, right?

452
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:33,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

453
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:37,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

454
00:53:37,418 --> 00:53:43,480
[SPEAKER_02]: With the door sweeps, there was also a dumpster mitigation that I wrote down that I don't see in here.

455
00:53:46,368 --> 00:53:48,628
[SPEAKER_02]: the general, there were two pest control issues.

456
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:56,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the issue too is, and I have to get, some of our dumpsters are at the end of their life.

457
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,390
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been repaired to the point where they can be repaired no more.

458
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:02,051
[SPEAKER_00]: We own our dumpsters in Medford.

459
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:13,053
[SPEAKER_00]: We rent the recycling dumpsters that we added at the end of last year, or the middle of last year, but we own the dumpsters and the compactors.

460
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:19,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are at the end of their life, so I'm looking at pricing right now to see if it's better to lease.

461
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when there's an issue, they just get replaced.

462
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:29,227
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also a citywide issue around small furry animals.

463
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:34,108
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to be doing is we're going to be filling some holes and things with concrete.

464
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:44,212
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really looking at door suites, dumpster mitigation, and addressing a critter problem.

465
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all one project?

466
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:49,333
[SPEAKER_02]: That should all be in line 27 or are they separate lines?

467
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:51,754
[SPEAKER_00]: That would all be one bundled project.

468
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:01,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those reports really only came in recently.

469
00:55:03,124 --> 00:55:05,885
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't been able to build costs on those.

470
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:20,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be, I think, may be helpful for our next meeting as well.

471
00:55:21,011 --> 00:55:26,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was just looking in my email to see if I ever got

472
00:55:27,485 --> 00:55:36,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, a quote from John about the drainage project, and I'm not seeing it, but I don't know, Peter, you have that or if we need to.

473
00:55:38,822 --> 00:55:39,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that.

474
00:55:40,824 --> 00:56:00,056
[SPEAKER_00]: I will check in with John on that, but I also know we were looking to have DPW work on that as well for some cost mitigation, but also to see if our CCL students up in the shop

475
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:12,464
[SPEAKER_00]: What it seems to require is excavation, installation of a trench drain, and then to be able to drain into the city drains that are near the brooks to be able to pull the water away.

476
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:17,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So not $800.

477
00:56:17,788 --> 00:56:20,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not.

478
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:28,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so that you're, I don't mean to jump around on you, but I do have a quote for the scope of work.

479
00:56:29,747 --> 00:56:52,305
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can share out on the geotechnical services, the design and the bidding and the construction administration for the plazas at the McGlynn and the Andrews and just for those services and again that is not

480
00:56:53,197 --> 00:57:02,203
[SPEAKER_00]: the replacement or the fixing of it, but geotech design, bidding and construction administration to make sure that it's built correctly, that is $45,500.

481
00:57:02,423 --> 00:57:16,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from someone, that's from a company on one of the city's house doctor services.

482
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:24,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like project management as well or no?

483
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:24,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

484
00:57:25,314 --> 00:57:25,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

485
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:28,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

486
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:30,877
[SPEAKER_00]: With the construction management piece, that's what it, that's what it is.

487
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:37,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Geotechnical comes in at 6,500 design, 18,000 bidding, 6,400 and construction administration, 14,600.

488
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

489
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:46,424
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just separated that into two lines so that we have both of them on the list.

490
00:57:47,044 --> 00:57:47,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

491
00:57:49,643 --> 00:57:51,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay.

492
00:57:51,724 --> 00:58:00,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this middle group is the group that we, a, we need to try to get some better pricing to understand where these projects are at.

493
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:10,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And then B, um, we'll ultimately need to sort of prioritize and recommend, um, the go forward path on in the short term.

494
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:14,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that sound right to you?

495
00:58:14,852 --> 00:58:15,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else that's.

496
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:26,191
[SPEAKER_03]: listed here that should move up.

497
00:58:39,881 --> 00:59:03,443
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'll say about the ADA project at the McGlynn is, correct me if I'm wrong, it may be good to bundle that with the HVAC just because if we're hopefully doing the lion's share of construction of the HVAC program during the summer, maybe it's just those two buildings are under construction

498
00:59:04,369 --> 00:59:08,513
[SPEAKER_00]: over the summer if we're able to get these projects lined up.

499
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:24,950
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like, okay, we're going to do the roof slash HVAC and then we have all this construction equipment around the buildings and then we're ripping out the plaza or fixing the plaza or something along those lines.

500
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if we want to move those kind of closer together.

501
00:59:27,872 --> 00:59:36,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thinking from someone who's never done construction in his life's like thought of like maybe just the projects come together.

502
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:44,545
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know like those two buildings are offline next summer for summer projects and summer affairs.

503
00:59:46,306 --> 00:59:49,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put in maybe we can circle back and talk about that next time.

504
00:59:52,113 --> 01:00:00,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, part of my question on that is, what does that do to summer programs that we're offering in different schools?

505
01:00:00,481 --> 01:00:10,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I know most of our programming this summer was at Missittuck and high school, unless I'm missing something.

506
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:11,451
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Roberts.

507
01:00:12,232 --> 01:00:12,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

508
01:00:16,296 --> 01:00:16,376
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

509
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:20,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, member Graham?

510
01:00:21,098 --> 01:00:21,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

511
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:30,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at the policy, and you may be going right next to this, but we are supposed to create four lists.

512
01:00:30,644 --> 01:00:33,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we have one list all done, which is the all projects.

513
01:00:33,706 --> 01:00:34,407
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at it.

514
01:00:36,048 --> 01:00:44,834
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, when we pass this, you know, one of the lists is projects that are eligible for Community Preservation Act funding.

515
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:50,357
[SPEAKER_05]: net school spending, and then things that are not eligible for either.

516
01:00:51,898 --> 01:01:01,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just wondering, who has the expertise to decide whether something is eligible for CPC funding or CPA funding?

517
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:09,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's four pillars that are eligible for CPC funding.

518
01:01:09,306 --> 01:01:12,448
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is affordable housing, so that broadly doesn't apply to us.

519
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:22,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, then there's like historic restoration, open space, and I'm forgetting the fourth tier.

520
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:24,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's recreation.

521
01:01:24,526 --> 01:01:24,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

522
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:33,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So historic I think only would apply under the Curtis-Tufts.

523
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:44,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And the CPC is not looking to necessarily, from what I understand in my meetings with them, repair playground.

524
01:01:44,862 --> 01:01:46,403
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to do routine maintenance.

525
01:01:48,223 --> 01:01:53,766
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more along the lines of the rebuild or renovations or things along those lines.

526
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:56,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

527
01:01:59,236 --> 01:02:09,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so members, so I think this spreadsheet actually gets us to all of those places just in a different version.

528
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,173
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can add this net school spending.

529
01:02:13,237 --> 01:02:31,046
[SPEAKER_03]: piece on and I think Noel that may be something that I can work with you on offline to tag these as whether or not they are sort of inclusive in that school spending or excluded from.

530
01:02:33,407 --> 01:02:35,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can do that before the next meeting as well.

531
01:02:37,099 --> 01:02:41,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't even think, that's not really an opinion, that's fact kind of thing.

532
01:02:41,242 --> 01:02:47,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as I recall, there's the determination based on what the project is, and then there's also a funding threshold, right?

533
01:02:47,707 --> 01:03:00,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm looking, if I'm remembering correctly, and I might not be, it was 250,000 was a cutoff, and I'm looking right there at network closet mini split.

534
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:06,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what borderline is gonna dictate

535
01:03:07,754 --> 01:03:08,855
[SPEAKER_02]: how things are classified.

536
01:03:08,935 --> 01:03:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's if we need to look at that quote a little more carefully for that determination, we might need to do that.

537
01:03:18,302 --> 01:03:21,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure knows that number much better than I do.

538
01:03:22,805 --> 01:03:31,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I will share this with Noel after we're done here and ask that that be added to before our next meeting.

539
01:03:41,874 --> 01:03:48,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other projects that you all have on your mind that haven't made this list just yet?

540
01:03:55,523 --> 01:04:10,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the only thing that comes to mind is we have talked about getting elementary school students into middle school spaces, whether it's after school or some other reorganization down the line.

541
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:30,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that that is concrete enough, but I know that when I spoke to Nick Tucci, for example, the concerns around having elementary school students in there would require some changes to classrooms.

542
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:37,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the timeframe is that maybe the superintendent knows that a little bit better or somebody who's been talking.

543
01:04:38,061 --> 01:04:41,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're due to get an update on after school at the Andrews.

544
01:04:42,243 --> 01:04:50,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is something that is potentially a capital project.

545
01:04:52,249 --> 01:04:58,512
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're looking at changing who is in the middle school building, the what are currently the middle school buildings.

546
01:05:03,178 --> 01:05:04,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do dinner in a minute.

547
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:12,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can certainly update this once we hear from the afterschool program, if there's a capital need there.

548
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:17,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it might just be building in grounds.

549
01:05:18,303 --> 01:05:20,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, quite capital, but right.

550
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:22,064
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a question.

551
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:22,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

552
01:05:23,365 --> 01:05:27,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully not a capital need, but I hope not, but it is.

553
01:05:29,366 --> 01:05:31,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

554
01:05:31,287 --> 01:05:35,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can circle back to that at our next meeting as well.

555
01:05:36,348 --> 01:05:37,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else?

556
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:49,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, Dr. Cushing, you mentioned the roof as being ready for solar.

557
01:05:50,251 --> 01:05:56,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other solar projects that are possibilities down the line?

558
01:05:57,361 --> 01:05:59,482
[SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned that for the Andrews, are we?

559
01:06:01,022 --> 01:06:07,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's serious consideration for the McGlynn as well.

560
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:12,865
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, there's really no other project being thought of.

561
01:06:13,325 --> 01:06:18,947
[SPEAKER_00]: But the McGlynn HVAC project is being done in consideration of solar.

562
01:06:23,325 --> 01:06:31,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think maybe we can get some details about the like evolving scope of that project, which sounds like it's everything in the kitchen sink in that building.

563
01:06:31,728 --> 01:06:47,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, um, we can, we can update it if necessary, but, um, I think the other, you know, the recommissioning process will also tell us whether that's an option for, um, the outside buildings.

564
01:06:51,849 --> 01:07:04,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And Member Graham, I just wanted to add a comment to Member Reinfeld's ask about if there is a different configuration, would it need to be capital projects?

565
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:14,216
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer to your question would be yes, if the committee deemed that a different configuration would need to take place with one of the other buildings.

566
01:07:14,336 --> 01:07:20,638
[SPEAKER_04]: But between now and the next meeting, we might be able to have a little more information to provide.

567
01:07:21,658 --> 01:07:23,299
[SPEAKER_04]: to that conversation, to that topic.

568
01:07:29,623 --> 01:07:29,763
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

569
01:07:36,907 --> 01:07:37,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Erica.

570
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:40,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

571
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:41,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

572
01:07:41,209 --> 01:07:46,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to a third grader who apparently they like to be fed.

573
01:07:46,372 --> 01:07:47,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

574
01:07:47,032 --> 01:07:47,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

575
01:07:48,253 --> 01:07:48,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So is.

576
01:07:52,446 --> 01:07:53,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fourth grade, whoops.

577
01:07:53,807 --> 01:08:18,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I was gonna say, I think this is when I was having audio trouble, but anything Curtis Tufts, I assume that those calculations are being made with MSBA thinking in mind of what's worth doing in a building if we really are looking to co-locate and that five to seven, sorry, five year plan.

578
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:19,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

579
01:08:20,003 --> 01:08:40,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think the other thing that is the consideration when we get to feasibility is do the administrative offices stay at the high school or do they get relocated and to a place like Curtis Tufts is always sort of something that is a possibility as well.

580
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:47,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the administrative offices, if I'm remembering correctly, generally are not reimbursable under MSBA.

581
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:52,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So to rebuild the administrative offices, we would have to pay in totality.

582
01:08:52,190 --> 01:09:02,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So that may be a good way to change the use of that space instead of shutting it down completely.

583
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:08,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

584
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other changes that people think we should make this evening?

585
01:09:21,018 --> 01:09:25,120
[SPEAKER_03]: The agenda for our next meeting is exactly the same.

586
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:34,304
[SPEAKER_03]: It's to continue this conversation so that we can agree amongst this group what we're going to recommend.

587
01:09:35,484 --> 01:09:47,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that will go to a committee of the whole in December, where we will walk through what this is and what is on here and formalize a recommendation from the school committee that will be shared with

588
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:56,653
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor and obviously may will be there, but the mayor and the council in terms of funding needs and so that.

589
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,894
[SPEAKER_03]: At a capital level, we can plan accordingly.

590
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:07,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think we can make a motion to continue this meeting.

591
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:09,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?

592
01:10:12,398 --> 01:10:13,899
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think we can.

593
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:16,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so.

594
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:19,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to continue the meeting?

595
01:10:19,519 --> 01:10:24,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to continue the meeting to a date yet to be determined.

596
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:28,122
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we have that date.

597
01:10:28,402 --> 01:10:28,882
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

598
01:10:29,482 --> 01:10:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the 19th of November.

599
01:10:31,502 --> 01:10:33,003
[SPEAKER_03]: The 19th of November, correct.

600
01:10:33,243 --> 01:10:34,143
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

601
01:10:34,323 --> 01:10:35,703
[SPEAKER_05]: To November 19th then.

602
01:10:35,863 --> 01:10:36,364
[SPEAKER_05]: At what time?

603
01:10:37,084 --> 01:10:37,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know that?

604
01:10:37,904 --> 01:10:38,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Five.

605
01:10:39,904 --> 01:10:40,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Five o'clock.

606
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:41,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

607
01:10:43,045 --> 01:10:44,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

608
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:46,166
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion on the floor to continue the meeting.

609
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:47,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second that.

610
01:10:48,736 --> 01:10:50,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Second by Member Reinfeld.

611
01:10:51,677 --> 01:10:52,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I will take a roll call.

612
01:10:52,798 --> 01:10:53,758
[SPEAKER_03]: So Member Ruseau?

613
01:10:54,498 --> 01:10:54,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

614
01:10:55,658 --> 01:10:56,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Reinfeld?

615
01:10:56,959 --> 01:10:57,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

616
01:10:57,779 --> 01:10:58,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

617
01:10:58,359 --> 01:10:58,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

618
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

619
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,581
[SPEAKER_03]: The meeting is continued until November 19th.

620
01:11:07,302 --> 01:11:08,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that take the place of adjournment?

621
01:11:09,422 --> 01:11:10,023
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

622
01:11:10,043 --> 01:11:10,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

623
01:11:10,623 --> 01:11:10,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
