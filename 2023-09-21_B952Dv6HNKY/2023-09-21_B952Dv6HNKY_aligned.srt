00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:03,110
Hello, this is Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,931
Happy Monday.

3
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:05,552
I hope you all have a wonderful week.

4
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:08,133
Just wanted to start the week off with some great news.

5
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:17,279
I'm going to talk a lot about a number of grants that we received this week, and then next week I'll do a good news video on all the amazing events that are coming up this fall.

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:24,644
So first up, everybody's excited that we have groundbreaking for the Clippership Connector.

7
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:30,147
That will be in September, where the City's working with DCR to do a groundbreaking ceremony.

8
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:35,276
but that is going to connect our bike path and be an amazing addition to the city of Medford.

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,377
Also, please keep an eye out or look above, click the link.

10
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,718
Please take our charter study committee survey.

11
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:52,421
That is now open and will be open for several months, but we want anybody and everybody's input so we can update our very, very outdated charter.

12
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:56,902
Next up, I want to thank the senior center and our director, Pam Kelly,

13
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:09,839
for applying for and receiving a $45,000 digital literacy grant that will help our seniors throughout the fall and winter and into 2024 to help them with tech access.

14
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,639
So thank you, Pam, for applying.

15
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,140
We're so excited you got that grant.

16
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:25,351
Next up, we had our tree warden, Aggie Tudin, and our DPW commissioner, Tim McGivern, apply for an urban forestry grant to strengthen the resiliency of our urban forest network.

17
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:26,832
And we did receive that.

18
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:29,114
That's an over $100,000 grant.

19
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:30,235
So congratulations.

20
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:31,456
Very exciting.

21
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:36,040
And it definitely goes towards all the work we're doing on municipal vulnerability preparedness.

22
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:37,622
Next up,

23
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:52,715
Todd Blake, our director of traffic and transportation, has applied for a number of grants and received two community connection grants, one for over $30,000 for bike parking and one for close to $150,000 for blue bike stations.

24
00:01:53,215 --> 00:02:02,139
As you know, the city, with director Blake and planning, has expanded our blue bike network and we are not stopping.

25
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:05,281
So we're trying to get them at our schools and some of our parks.

26
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,392
City Hall, Police Station.

27
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:11,056
We have a lot in the works and we're excited about that.

28
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:13,558
So congratulations and thank you to Todd Blake.

29
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:21,024
Last but not least, I want to wish every student, faculty, families the best of luck.

30
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:28,090
We start school on the 30th of September, which is Wednesday, and we hope everybody has a great day and a great week and a great school year.

31
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,631
Thank you.
