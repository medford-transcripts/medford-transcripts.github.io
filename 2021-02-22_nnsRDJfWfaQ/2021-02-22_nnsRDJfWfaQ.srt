[SPEAKER_11]: Each of the individual policy, they're in a different order, I apologize, than the order that is on the agenda.

154
01:25:46,863 --> 01:26:00,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Each of the minutes, each of the new policies or updated policies are separated down into here and all seven of them were approved by the subcommittee unanimously to be sent up to us.

155
01:26:01,154 --> 01:26:05,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so maybe we take them one at a time for those that have questions on each individual.

156
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:07,530
[SPEAKER_04]: each individual paper.

157
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:12,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So first up we have JB, equal educational opportunities.

158
01:26:12,312 --> 01:26:18,474
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wanna just give us a summary of that and then we can move for approval.

159
01:26:19,314 --> 01:26:22,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, just a lot of windows right now, one second.

160
01:26:24,276 --> 01:26:25,176
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of windows.

161
01:26:26,216 --> 01:26:27,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, JB.

162
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:35,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course it's the last one.

163
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:41,332
[SPEAKER_11]: So Policy JB is the Equal Educational Opportunities Policy.

164
01:26:41,852 --> 01:26:46,154
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the first time that Medford is adopting this policy.

165
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:54,937
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes from, the latest version of it comes from the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, February, 2019 policy newsletter that they send.

166
01:26:55,817 --> 01:27:05,221
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a, all of these policies other than that schedule policy are actually required by the upcoming

167
01:27:06,366 --> 01:27:10,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Education Stability Program Review, which is formerly known as the CPR.

168
01:27:10,947 --> 01:27:14,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford is one of the first 60 districts that will be evaluated.

169
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:20,970
[SPEAKER_11]: So we needed to get these policies on our books because they are required for this review.

170
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:27,491
[SPEAKER_11]: So that first policy is probably the simplest of all policies in this pile.

171
01:27:27,811 --> 01:27:29,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, too many windows here.

172
01:27:31,472 --> 01:27:34,153
[SPEAKER_11]: This policy is pretty standard.

173
01:27:34,173 --> 01:27:34,633
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the,

174
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:39,639
[SPEAKER_11]: that we won't discriminate based on all the things that we won't discriminate on.

175
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:40,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any questions on this?

176
01:27:44,381 --> 01:27:46,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And no questions for me.

177
01:27:46,502 --> 01:27:49,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by member Graham, was that you?

178
01:27:49,783 --> 01:27:50,784
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not McLaughlin.

179
01:27:50,904 --> 01:27:52,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

180
01:27:53,025 --> 01:27:53,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

181
01:27:53,805 --> 01:27:55,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham, roll call.

[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

184
01:27:58,447 --> 01:27:58,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

185
01:27:59,928 --> 01:28:00,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

186
01:28:00,929 --> 01:28:01,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

187
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:03,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

188
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:05,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

189
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:05,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

190
01:28:05,461 --> 01:28:06,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Miss Stone.

191
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:06,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

192
01:28:07,623 --> 01:28:08,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

193
01:28:08,964 --> 01:28:09,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

194
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:10,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot?

195
01:28:11,005 --> 01:28:11,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

196
01:28:12,006 --> 01:28:12,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longo-Klein?

197
01:28:13,407 --> 01:28:13,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

198
01:28:13,807 --> 01:28:15,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

199
01:28:16,449 --> 01:28:17,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper is approved.

200
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:22,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, we have JFABC, Homeless Students Enrollment Rights and Services.

201
01:28:23,934 --> 01:28:24,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you, Mayor.

202
01:28:25,315 --> 01:28:28,377
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the Homeless Students Enrollment Rights and Services policy.

203
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:35,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this one's a new one for Medford or an update.

204
01:28:35,579 --> 01:28:37,120
[SPEAKER_11]: It says it's an update in the agenda.

205
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,781
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll believe what I wrote before.

206
01:28:39,521 --> 01:28:45,305
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a set of policies on the rights of homeless students.

207
01:28:45,905 --> 01:28:55,731
[SPEAKER_11]: It's several pages long and it is again, a copy of the policy that we received in the policy service that we subscribe to.

208
01:28:56,111 --> 01:28:59,473
[SPEAKER_11]: We did not make any amendments or changes to that policy.

209
01:29:00,053 --> 01:29:01,414
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there are any questions.

210
01:29:02,885 --> 01:29:03,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion of approval.

211
01:29:04,246 --> 01:29:04,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

212
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:08,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Move for approval by Member Van der Kloot, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

213
01:29:08,648 --> 01:29:09,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

214
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:10,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

215
01:29:11,229 --> 01:29:11,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

216
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:13,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz.

217
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:14,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

218
01:29:14,851 --> 01:29:15,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

219
01:29:16,432 --> 01:29:17,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

220
01:29:19,173 --> 01:29:19,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

221
01:29:20,494 --> 01:29:21,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

222
01:29:21,855 --> 01:29:22,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

223
01:29:22,835 --> 01:29:23,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot.

224
01:29:24,036 --> 01:29:24,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

225
01:29:25,156 --> 01:29:25,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longo-Khan.

226
01:29:26,337 --> 01:29:26,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

227
01:29:26,557 --> 01:29:28,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

228
01:29:28,298 --> 01:29:29,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper is approved.

229
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:30,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

230
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:34,411
[SPEAKER_04]: JFABE educational opportunities for military children.

231
01:29:34,431 --> 01:29:36,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

232
01:29:36,452 --> 01:29:48,162
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a new policy for Medford, I believe, and is a, like the other policies we've discussed, is a required policy that we should have.

233
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:59,931
[SPEAKER_11]: We had some conversations on this particular policy about whether or not this should cover just K to 12, or whether it should include up to age 22,

234
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:06,094
[SPEAKER_11]: for students with disabilities that have rights up until that age.

235
01:30:06,974 --> 01:30:09,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you all what I experienced.

236
01:30:09,256 --> 01:30:16,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I took on the task of attempting to get an answer to that question so that we could expand this up to age 22.

237
01:30:17,202 --> 01:30:28,430
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's a reflection of the last administration at the federal government level, or if it's a longstanding challenge with the Department of Veterans Affairs or not,

238
01:30:28,941 --> 01:30:38,547
[SPEAKER_11]: But their websites that they have set up for this matter are filled with links that go to no pages, chat features that do nothing and are broken.

239
01:30:38,567 --> 01:30:48,494
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really quite two hours of clicking around in their multiple federal government webpages that were all dead, dead links.

240
01:30:49,535 --> 01:30:53,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I just eventually gave up because, you know,

241
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,961
[SPEAKER_11]: The help pages and FAQs don't go anywhere.

242
01:30:56,981 --> 01:30:58,441
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of hard to get the answer.

243
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:20,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do, I think we should stick a pin in it to expand this to age 22, if in fact we can figure out how to get the answer to the question about whether or not this, it is a federal law, the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunities for Military Children.

244
01:31:21,155 --> 01:31:28,542
[SPEAKER_11]: getting the answer to whether or not that, when they say military children, do they need up to 22 or just K to 12?

245
01:31:29,002 --> 01:31:31,365
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a difficult thing to get an answer to.

246
01:31:34,127 --> 01:31:36,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor, Member McLaughlin.

247
01:31:38,071 --> 01:31:38,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

248
01:31:38,511 --> 01:31:40,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Ruseau for poking around on that website.

249
01:31:41,074 --> 01:31:46,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's a bunch of dead links, but I am fully confident in saying that

250
01:31:47,725 --> 01:31:58,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Our students are students until age 22 in the transition program for our students with disabilities and should qualify for everything that our K through or pre-K through 12 qualify for.

251
01:31:58,973 --> 01:32:02,515
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would recommend to the committee that we vote to move this forward.

252
01:32:02,635 --> 01:32:13,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there are further questions, I would also recommend that the administration could reach out to Mass Advocates for Children, which is a free legal organization that can offer

253
01:32:14,217 --> 01:32:18,280
[SPEAKER_05]: advice or the Federation for Children with Special Needs that can offer advice in this capacity.

254
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:23,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So I make a motion to move this forward.

255
01:32:24,924 --> 01:32:30,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Van der Kloot.

256
01:32:30,608 --> 01:32:31,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

257
01:32:32,189 --> 01:32:33,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

258
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:33,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

259
01:32:35,111 --> 01:32:36,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz.

260
01:32:49,308 --> 01:32:49,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

261
01:32:50,689 --> 01:32:51,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

262
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:53,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can.

263
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:53,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

264
01:32:55,171 --> 01:32:56,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

265
01:32:56,432 --> 01:32:57,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone?

266
01:32:57,272 --> 01:32:57,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

267
01:32:58,513 --> 01:32:59,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

268
01:33:00,134 --> 01:33:00,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

269
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:01,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot?

270
01:33:02,055 --> 01:33:02,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

271
01:33:03,356 --> 01:33:04,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Longo-Khan?

272
01:33:04,596 --> 01:33:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

273
01:33:04,897 --> 01:33:06,137
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 for Ms.

274
01:33:06,157 --> 01:33:06,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Zierden, the negative.

275
01:33:07,038 --> 01:33:08,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper passes.

276
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:13,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four, JFABF, Educational Opportunities for Children in Foster Care.

277
01:33:14,498 --> 01:33:15,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

278
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:25,168
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a policy also required for our upcoming, I wanna say CPR, I forget what the new name is, our new audit, our upcoming audit.

279
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:37,660
[SPEAKER_11]: This of course is a policy related to the McKinney-Vento Act, as well as Title I and Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015.

280
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:46,496
[SPEAKER_11]: and this just lays out the rights of students, as well as the definition of students that are in foster care.

281
01:33:46,516 --> 01:33:49,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there are any questions.

282
01:33:49,398 --> 01:33:50,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Motions to approve.

283
01:33:50,899 --> 01:33:55,082
[SPEAKER_04]: For approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Van der Kloot, roll call.

284
01:33:56,623 --> 01:33:57,204

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

286
01:33:58,685 --> 01:33:59,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Krentz.

287
01:33:59,886 --> 01:34:00,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

288
01:34:01,127 --> 01:34:02,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

289
01:34:02,328 --> 01:34:03,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

290
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:03,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

291
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:05,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

292
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:05,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

293
01:34:06,411 --> 01:34:07,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot.

294
01:34:07,592 --> 01:34:07,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

295
01:34:08,471 --> 01:34:09,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Long, O'Connor.

296
01:34:09,652 --> 01:34:12,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the paper passes.

297
01:34:12,673 --> 01:34:19,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five, GBEBC, gifts to and solicitations by staff, update.

298
01:34:20,277 --> 01:34:20,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

299
01:34:21,478 --> 01:34:22,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

300
01:34:22,898 --> 01:34:33,904
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a policy that really is just a codification of the annual ethics training, frankly, that everybody who's a public employee has to take.

301
01:34:34,746 --> 01:34:37,808
[SPEAKER_11]: There is nothing in here that is Medford specific.

302
01:34:37,928 --> 01:34:41,530
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the law as laid out in a policy.

303
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:43,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

304
01:34:44,232 --> 01:34:44,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

305
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a question.

306
01:34:47,634 --> 01:35:02,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an update, but where it says the solicitation of personal items shall only be to benefit students, does that mean like our CCSR group couldn't

307
01:35:03,025 --> 01:35:04,586
[SPEAKER_04]: do a coat drive for the homeless?

308
01:35:06,147 --> 01:35:10,230
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Mayor, this is just for, this is only for employees.

309
01:35:13,773 --> 01:35:16,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so employees soliciting donations.

310
01:35:16,935 --> 01:35:17,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

311
01:35:17,296 --> 01:35:19,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so student groups could, perfect, thank you.

312
01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:25,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by member... Banderclute.

313
01:35:25,222 --> 01:35:29,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Banderclute, seconded by... Member McLaughlin.

314
01:35:29,805 --> 01:35:31,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, roll call.

315
01:35:32,863 --> 01:35:33,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

316
01:35:34,783 --> 01:35:34,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

317
01:35:36,144 --> 01:35:36,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

318
01:35:37,144 --> 01:35:37,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

319
01:35:38,564 --> 01:35:39,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

320
01:35:40,124 --> 01:35:41,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

321
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:41,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

322
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:43,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

323
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:44,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

324
01:35:44,885 --> 01:35:45,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Vanden Heuvel.

325
01:35:46,045 --> 01:35:46,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

326
01:35:47,106 --> 01:35:47,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

327
01:35:50,546 --> 01:35:52,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

328
01:35:52,387 --> 01:35:57,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my question was meant for number six, sorry.

329
01:35:58,828 --> 01:35:59,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Number six.

330
01:35:59,947 --> 01:36:05,111
[SPEAKER_04]: GBEBD online fundraising and solicitation crowdfunding, new.

331
01:36:07,372 --> 01:36:07,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

332
01:36:08,653 --> 01:36:20,361
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a policy that is also required, I believe, and is a codification of state ethics and conflict of interest rules.

333
01:36:20,862 --> 01:36:25,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say that the specification of this policy

334
01:36:26,254 --> 01:36:31,316
[SPEAKER_11]: online fundraising platforms like GoFundMe, Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Mutecaring, DonorsChoose.

335
01:36:32,557 --> 01:36:35,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are examples, it's not an exhaustive list.

336
01:36:35,798 --> 01:36:50,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that I believe in our last term, there were issues around one of the online fundraising platforms where one of our student groups, or maybe it was a sports or something like that,

337
01:36:51,098 --> 01:36:57,941
[SPEAKER_11]: was using and they were taking, I think a 30% cut or some very large cut of the donations.

338
01:36:58,061 --> 01:37:17,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that I believe is part of the motivation behind this is to make sure that folks are using platforms that are not gouging people making donations, but also to make sure that the superintendent is aware and importantly from the school committee perspective to make sure that we are aware

339
01:37:19,337 --> 01:37:31,346
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to know when people feel the need to fundraise so that if those things really should be part of our budget, we get that insight and can make decisions on it.

340
01:37:31,426 --> 01:37:39,352
[SPEAKER_11]: If everything is covered by fundraising and nobody ever tells us on the school committee that that's how it's actually being paid for, well, we won't know.

341
01:37:39,612 --> 01:37:42,314
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the motivation behind that.

342
01:37:42,374 --> 01:37:43,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any questions?

343
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:48,031
[SPEAKER_04]: No questions.

344
01:37:48,091 --> 01:37:49,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval.

345
01:37:50,311 --> 01:37:50,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Member.

346
01:37:51,772 --> 01:37:52,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval.

347
01:37:52,932 --> 01:37:56,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Graham seconded by Member Kreatz.

348
01:37:56,734 --> 01:37:57,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

349
01:37:59,895 --> 01:38:00,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

350
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:01,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

351
01:38:02,396 --> 01:38:02,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

352
01:38:03,356 --> 01:38:03,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

353
01:38:05,157 --> 01:38:05,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

354
01:38:05,897 --> 01:38:06,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

355
01:38:06,277 --> 01:38:06,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

356
01:38:07,137 --> 01:38:07,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

357
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:08,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

358
01:38:09,418 --> 01:38:09,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

359
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:11,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

360
01:38:11,827 --> 01:38:12,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven.

361
01:38:12,347 --> 01:38:14,228
[SPEAKER_04]: The affirmative zero in the negative paper passes.

362
01:38:14,608 --> 01:38:15,468
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't call my name.

363
01:38:16,009 --> 01:38:16,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

364
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:17,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Vandepest.

365
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:22,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

366
01:38:22,251 --> 01:38:27,093
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, annual reports and presentations policy, new.

367
01:38:27,113 --> 01:38:29,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

368
01:38:29,374 --> 01:38:32,695
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was the actual work we had to do.

369
01:38:32,715 --> 01:38:36,076
[SPEAKER_11]: The other policies were relatively easy because they were written for us.

370
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:36,977
[SPEAKER_11]: So the purpose of this

371
01:38:38,065 --> 01:39:06,003
[SPEAKER_11]: is to create a schedule, not actual dates, but a schedule of annual reports and presentations, although some of them are in fact semi-annual, to provide clarity to school committee members who are coming in and who wanna know when something's gonna happen or find out whether or not something is gonna happen, as well as guidance for the administration to know, okay, this is the list of things we've committed to doing and when do they normally happen

372
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:10,310
[SPEAKER_11]: try to bring that institutional knowledge onto paper.

373
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:18,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is one amendment to this that I like to make on page two.

374
01:39:20,313 --> 01:39:24,334
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a bolded to-do insert link to a definitions page.

375
01:39:24,874 --> 01:39:26,114
[SPEAKER_11]: One does not exist, create one.

376
01:39:26,614 --> 01:39:30,335
[SPEAKER_11]: That actually should be the MPS URL slash definitions.

377
01:39:31,276 --> 01:39:32,136
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a page that will,

378
01:39:32,724 --> 01:39:34,104
[SPEAKER_11]: be created very, very shortly.

379
01:39:34,224 --> 01:39:41,707
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would offer that one amendment so that it is actually correct in the policy.

380
01:39:41,927 --> 01:39:47,128
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the schedule is the thing at the end.

381
01:39:48,049 --> 01:39:59,132
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are the, I won't read through the entire schedule, but it has the name of the actual report or presentation, what type of meeting we expect to have it at,

382
01:39:59,735 --> 01:40:13,198
[SPEAKER_11]: whether it's statutory, so whether the law or regulation mandates it, and the frequency as well as if there are any special details on when we would expect it, like prior to budget, and then a description if necessary.

383
01:40:13,778 --> 01:40:14,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Any questions?

384
01:40:15,139 --> 01:40:15,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor?

385
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:16,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Van der Kloot?

386
01:40:18,739 --> 01:40:19,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Through you, through the chair,

387
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:27,315
[SPEAKER_15]: First, I want to thank the committee for laying this out and Paul for the work you were doing on this.

388
01:40:28,496 --> 01:40:34,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's an excellent working document to have at our disposal.

389
01:40:34,597 --> 01:40:45,380
[SPEAKER_15]: The one thing I wasn't certain if I saw, and I could be terribly wrong, but I didn't see super, I saw goals, but superintendent's evaluation.

390
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:50,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I may, Mayor.

391
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:51,102
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

392
01:40:52,235 --> 01:40:58,517
[SPEAKER_11]: When we were meeting about this, we had that same kind of like, well, what about this?

393
01:40:59,477 --> 01:41:02,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And there were many, many of those things.

394
01:41:03,398 --> 01:41:19,322
[SPEAKER_11]: This was, I think if I'm, and the member McLaughlin and member Graham can correct me, but the way we ended up landing on what we mean by this is things that will be coming to us for presentation.

395
01:41:21,125 --> 01:41:33,313
[SPEAKER_11]: And we decided that meetings that we must have, such as, you know, the annual, the first example that came up was the annual budget hearing, you know, that is by law must happen.

396
01:41:33,773 --> 01:41:34,814
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not on here.

397
01:41:35,634 --> 01:41:42,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though it will be a presentation, it's really that there's a, the meeting is what's required.

398
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:48,322
[SPEAKER_11]: So the superintendent goals,

399
01:41:52,118 --> 01:41:53,099
[SPEAKER_11]: an evaluation.

400
01:41:53,579 --> 01:41:55,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, is that not in here somewhere?

401
01:41:57,701 --> 01:42:15,289
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw district goals, but I didn't see any specificity around self-evaluation or, you know, that that would be part of what the school committee can expect on an annual basis.

402
01:42:16,609 --> 01:42:20,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we didn't want this to be an actual calendar, but

403
01:42:21,994 --> 01:42:25,335
[SPEAKER_11]: We also didn't want to add things that simply, for the most part, don't exist right now.

404
01:42:25,475 --> 01:42:32,696
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure we have actually had meetings to do that, but would that be a report or presentation that we would get?

405
01:42:32,836 --> 01:42:34,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Or will we get together and do something?

406
01:42:35,337 --> 01:42:39,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Like when we do the superintendent's evaluation, we get together and we do something.

407
01:42:40,178 --> 01:42:48,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not a report that would end up on the agenda or a presentation on the agenda that we would receive a file that we would stick on the public website.

408
01:42:48,259 --> 01:42:49,160
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

409
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:59,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I see your point that it is annual and that there is, in fact, a format to it, but it's not something we will receive.

410
01:42:59,998 --> 01:43:01,159
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something we will do.

411
01:43:01,959 --> 01:43:14,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we receive, if I may, we receive from the superintendent her, and we need to expect to receive the self-evaluation.

412
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:15,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, yep.

413
01:43:18,059 --> 01:43:30,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, so that's, again, and I'm thinking as if I were a new member looking at this, that if it was put on that, oh yeah, one of the things I'm gonna get is the superintendent's evaluation, and that's gonna start the process.

414
01:43:32,106 --> 01:43:35,107
[SPEAKER_15]: So in my mind, I think it's appropriate.

415
01:43:36,748 --> 01:43:41,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, I understand the committee deliberated it a long time, but that was my question.

416
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:44,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, the other, I think you did a great job.

417
01:43:45,632 --> 01:43:46,673
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I may,

418
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:49,049
[SPEAKER_11]: just writing some notes on this.

419
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:54,991
[SPEAKER_11]: So are you offering an amendment to add the superintendent self-evaluation for a regular meeting?

420
01:43:55,671 --> 01:43:58,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it's statutory, I believe, annually.

421
01:43:59,412 --> 01:44:00,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, exactly.

422
01:44:01,613 --> 01:44:01,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

423
01:44:09,016 --> 01:44:09,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions?

424
01:44:11,797 --> 01:44:12,597

442
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:44,871
[SPEAKER_04]: that we have a special education and behavioral health.

443
01:44:44,891 --> 01:44:45,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper passes as amended.

444
01:44:45,451 --> 01:44:46,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two.

445
01:44:46,032 --> 01:44:52,155
[SPEAKER_04]: We have special education, behavioral health subcommittee meeting, which took place on February 11th 2021.

446
01:44:52,896 --> 01:44:54,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin chair.

447
01:44:54,797 --> 01:44:55,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

448

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.

449
01:45:05,623 --> 01:45:09,624
[SPEAKER_05]: a good number of parent participants and staff members participating.

450
01:45:10,324 --> 01:45:14,966
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some conversation about the EPIC Leaders Presentation with the Common Ground Program at the high school.

451
01:45:15,026 --> 01:45:19,987
[SPEAKER_05]: And the EPIC Leaders Program is about disability, civil rights, ableism, and person first language.

452
01:45:20,287 --> 01:45:25,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And we further discussed the Common Ground Program that currently exists at the high school.

453
01:45:25,468 --> 01:45:35,251
[SPEAKER_05]: The Common Ground is currently a reverse inclusion program where general education, non-disabled students, for lack of a better word,

454
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:47,023
[SPEAKER_05]: join disabled students in their classroom, which fosters friendships and continued community relationships.

455
01:45:47,544 --> 01:45:53,969
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a program that has been very successful at the high school and we are having discussion about expanding this program to the middle school.

456
01:45:54,509 --> 01:46:00,994
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been engaging the middle school principals and other staff members at the middle school to find, to garner interest there.

457
01:46:01,854 --> 01:46:13,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It was suggested by the director of people's services and others that, and educators, teachers, both special education and general education, that we look at this as a potential elective course.

458
01:46:14,623 --> 01:46:16,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And we look at what a syllabus would look like.

459
01:46:16,484 --> 01:46:29,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And Susanna Campbell, who is the, I believe, Director of Speech and Language, has been presenting a disability awareness course and shared her syllabus with us to be thinking about what a syllabus might look like for a course like this.

460
01:46:29,733 --> 01:46:38,199
[SPEAKER_05]: We had several staff members that had been part of the disability awareness curriculum and raved about it and said how important they think this is at a middle school level.

461
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:39,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really good to hear.

462
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:53,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from the behavioral health component, we had a parent who was a lot of parents who are very concerned, of course, about social, emotional needs of our children, particularly through the pandemic.

463
01:46:53,895 --> 01:46:58,977
[SPEAKER_05]: and there was a parent who was asking specifically about art therapy for the district.

464
01:46:59,958 --> 01:47:22,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We shared that there was a music therapy grant that had existed at preschool that was driven by a parent and that we believe that that was not available currently, but asking about how we might pursue that and whether there was even also potentially community members that might be able to or interested in providing art or music therapy

465
01:47:23,247 --> 01:47:27,610
[SPEAKER_05]: within our district and what that would look like.

466
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:35,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cushon talked about initial stages of planning some summer work and hoping to build more outside activities through nature.

467
01:47:38,776 --> 01:47:39,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, sorry.

468
01:47:43,088 --> 01:47:52,234
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to do more research into the art therapy and social emotional piece, Stacey Shulman talked about Lesley University's art therapy program and how excellent they are.

469
01:47:52,274 --> 01:47:57,378
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had a parent who was very concerned about behavior supports for children in our schools and

470
01:47:58,217 --> 01:48:07,762
[SPEAKER_05]: how that really alienates our children who are struggling with social emotional needs and exhibit that struggle through communicating by behavior.

471
01:48:08,483 --> 01:48:16,207
[SPEAKER_05]: We noted that there are four behavior specialists in the program in a district of 4,000 students, which was very concerning, understandably.

472
01:48:16,887 --> 01:48:22,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will be continuing this conversation and recommending policy by the year end.

473
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:24,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next meeting is March 18th from 5 to 6.30.

474
01:48:26,392 --> 01:48:32,116
[SPEAKER_05]: we will do behavioral health first, 5 to 545, and special ed will be 545 to 630.

475
01:48:33,037 --> 01:48:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

476
01:48:35,438 --> 01:48:36,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

[SPEAKER_04]: Minutes are approved.

495
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:09,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Number six, we have community participation.

496
01:49:10,422 --> 01:49:16,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Emails, questions, or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

497
01:49:18,067 --> 01:49:23,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

498
01:49:24,651 --> 01:49:26,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot, do we have any emails?

499
01:49:27,092 --> 01:49:28,874
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no emails today.

500
01:49:28,894 --> 01:49:35,057
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to mention that there is a curriculum subcommittee from 4 to 5.30 this Wednesday.

501
01:49:35,978 --> 01:49:45,904
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to be going back to what was on the agenda for a meeting that was canceled, had to do with our world language program

502
01:49:47,008 --> 01:49:50,829
[SPEAKER_15]: and also technology.

503
01:49:52,230 --> 01:49:52,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

504
01:49:54,450 --> 01:49:56,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Number seven, we have report for superintendent.

505
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:59,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, superintendents updates and comments.

506
01:49:59,452 --> 01:50:00,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

507
01:50:04,273 --> 01:50:04,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

508
01:50:09,114 --> 01:50:10,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Pool testing is going well.

509
01:50:10,835 --> 01:50:14,538
[SPEAKER_13]: For our high school athletes, COVID testing is mandatory.

510
01:50:15,399 --> 01:50:21,043
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is just another step towards some sense of normalcy as sports are on the way back.

511
01:50:22,124 --> 01:50:27,928
[SPEAKER_13]: This past season, the only sports that could be offered were girls' ice hockey and gymnastics.

512
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:36,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Beginning March 1st, boys' and girls' basketball, swimming, and boys' ice hockey will begin their competitive seasons.

513
01:50:38,078 --> 01:50:49,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Also on March 1st, fall two pre-season conditioning starts with girls volleyball, boys and girls soccer, golf, cross country and football.

514
01:50:50,523 --> 01:50:57,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, at all times, all aspects of sports will be following COVID safety regulations.

515
01:50:58,246 --> 01:51:04,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford High School will only compete against other GBL teams and there will be no fans allowed.

516
01:51:05,845 --> 01:51:09,347
[SPEAKER_13]: We are so appreciative of the testing that keeps our community safe.

517
01:51:10,048 --> 01:51:11,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go Mustangs.

518
01:51:12,769 --> 01:51:26,037
[SPEAKER_13]: So last week, last Wednesday on CBS4 at 6 p.m., the Mustang Unity Poetry Contest received some great publicity from news anchor, Lisa Hughes.

519
01:51:27,538 --> 01:51:33,602
[SPEAKER_13]: This month, nationally, CBS News has been featuring segments on unifying America.

520
01:51:35,278 --> 01:51:39,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Lisa Hughes wanted to do something locally and came across our poetry contest.

521
01:51:41,001 --> 01:51:51,488
[SPEAKER_13]: On Friday, February 12th, she went to the Roberts Elementary School and taped our third grader, Mr. Joe Hogan, as he read his unity poem.

522
01:51:53,377 --> 01:52:05,819
[SPEAKER_13]: On President's Day last week via Zoom, Lisa interviewed Violet Bell and Ibrahim Ammar from the Roberts, both remote learners who also submitted poems.

523
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:17,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Lisa told me she felt the students' poems give us all hope that we can become a more united community and world.

524
01:52:18,842 --> 01:52:20,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I agreed wholeheartedly.

525
01:52:21,828 --> 01:52:26,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, the segment seems to have been a big hit on our social media channels.

526
01:52:27,713 --> 01:52:31,596
[SPEAKER_13]: We have received approximately 65 entries for the contest.

527
01:52:32,937 --> 01:52:44,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Lisa Hughes will be following up with me to find out who the Mustang Unity Poem winners are and the hopes to feature them on CBS4 Boston streaming service.

528
01:52:46,247 --> 01:52:47,969
[SPEAKER_13]: So for any students who are listening,

529
01:52:49,065 --> 01:52:51,589
[SPEAKER_13]: I am still accepting poems until 1159 p.m.

530
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:51,830
[SPEAKER_13]: tonight.

531
01:52:54,790 --> 01:53:05,855
[SPEAKER_13]: please feel free to email your poem on Unity of not more than 10 lines to superintendent at medford.k12.ma.us.

532
01:53:06,615 --> 01:53:10,497
[SPEAKER_13]: We are also accepting poems in your native language.

533
01:53:11,137 --> 01:53:13,598
[SPEAKER_13]: If it is not English, we will get it translated.

534
01:53:14,179 --> 01:53:21,442
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are also accepting illustrations for students that that would be appropriate for them to submit in entry.

535
01:53:22,042 --> 01:53:25,283
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have until 11 59pm this evening.

536
01:53:26,023 --> 01:53:33,246
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do also want to share with the school committee that I did receive my very first poetry entry from a parent today.

537
01:53:33,266 --> 01:53:37,227
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we have parents that have been inspired.

538
01:53:37,827 --> 01:53:43,709
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I was so happy reading that poem that I wanted to just put it out there to those that are listening.

539
01:53:44,915 --> 01:54:02,303
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have parents out there, members of the school committee who may be inspired, you wanna write a poem on poetry, please submit your entry to superintendent at medford.k12.ma.us on unity, up to 10 lines, any kind of poem you want it to be.

540
01:54:03,223 --> 01:54:13,988
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to share that good news and I was really pleased with the wonderful segment that highlighted the positive things that are happening in Medford public schools.

541
01:54:15,512 --> 01:54:17,695
[SPEAKER_13]: I also have additional good news to share.

542
01:54:17,715 --> 01:54:21,239
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really happy our Mustangs are back at it again.

543
01:54:22,961 --> 01:54:27,667
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to say congratulations to our Mustangs Ethics Bowl team.

544
01:54:28,688 --> 01:54:32,012
[SPEAKER_13]: That group is under the direction and leadership of Mr. Essner.

545
01:54:33,815 --> 01:54:46,199
[SPEAKER_13]: They compiled a 3-1 record and reached the semifinals with wins over Phillips Andover, Boston University Academy, and yes, Lexington High School.

546
01:54:46,919 --> 01:54:50,300
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want you to know our Mustangs are doing phenomenal work.

547
01:54:51,212 --> 01:54:53,294
[SPEAKER_13]: under these wonderful COVID conditions.

548
01:54:54,214 --> 01:54:55,996
[SPEAKER_13]: So what does the Ethics Bowl do?

549
01:54:56,496 --> 01:55:06,504
[SPEAKER_13]: The Ethics Bowl promotes respectful, supportive, and rigorous discussion of ethics among high school students nationwide.

550
01:55:07,965 --> 01:55:14,370
[SPEAKER_13]: It differs from a debate competition, as students are not assigned opposing views.

551
01:55:15,374 --> 01:55:23,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Rather, they defend whichever position they think is correct with proper data and always respectfully.

552
01:55:25,381 --> 01:55:37,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Ethics Bowl members learn ethical awareness, critical thinking, civil discourse, civic engagement, and an appreciation for multiple points of view.

553
01:55:38,710 --> 01:55:40,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Great job, Mustangs.

554
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:41,652
[SPEAKER_13]: We are very proud of you.

555
01:55:44,295 --> 01:55:53,764
[SPEAKER_13]: As we begin to prepare for the upcoming school year, so many parents have asked, what will the school year look like for next year?

556
01:55:57,104 --> 01:56:04,169
[SPEAKER_13]: While there is much we do not know yet about next year, we want to provide you with an opportunity to share your experiences.

557
01:56:04,930 --> 01:56:12,016
[SPEAKER_13]: To that end, we will be hosting listening sessions, which begin next week on March 4th.

558
01:56:12,816 --> 01:56:22,944
[SPEAKER_13]: These sessions have been broken up by grade level and will provide opportunities for students, parents, caregivers, faculty, and staff to participate.

559
01:56:24,065 --> 01:56:26,607
[SPEAKER_13]: All the listening sessions will be held via Zoom

560
01:56:27,512 --> 01:56:47,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Each session will feature three breakout rooms, Cohort A students, Cohorts B and C, and Cohorts D. Please be advised that translators will be available in Portuguese, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Arabic, and closed captioning will be also provided.

561
01:56:49,062 --> 01:56:59,913
[SPEAKER_13]: For those who may be unable to attend these sessions, we are accepting feedback via the email info at medford.k12.ma.us.

562
01:57:00,714 --> 01:57:07,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, feedback can be sent to info at medford.k12.ma.us.

563
01:57:08,282 --> 01:57:11,224
[SPEAKER_13]: The questions that will guide these conversations include,

564
01:57:12,126 --> 01:57:13,147
[SPEAKER_13]: What has gone well?

565
01:57:13,608 --> 01:57:15,129
[SPEAKER_13]: What are the areas for growth?

566
01:57:15,549 --> 01:57:18,572
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you possibly like to see for the upcoming school year?

567
01:57:19,493 --> 01:57:27,581
[SPEAKER_13]: The entire schedule is listed on our website, the MPS Facebook page, the MPS blog, and PTO Facebook pages.

568
01:57:28,362 --> 01:57:33,246
[SPEAKER_13]: As noted, we will begin on Thursday, March 4th with elementary education.

569
01:57:33,747 --> 01:57:36,849
[SPEAKER_13]: From 3.30 to 4.30, we will listen to students.

570
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:40,312
[SPEAKER_13]: From 5 to 6, faculty and staff.

571
01:57:40,792 --> 01:57:44,676
[SPEAKER_13]: And from 6.30 to 7.30, parents and caregivers only.

572
01:57:46,077 --> 01:57:51,882
[SPEAKER_13]: On Tuesday, March 9th, the same schedule will follow and we'll continue with our middle schools,

573
01:57:53,346 --> 01:57:57,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And our third session will be on Thursday, March 11th.

574
01:57:57,710 --> 01:57:59,712
[SPEAKER_13]: We will host high school education.

575
01:58:00,453 --> 01:58:02,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, the same schedule will be followed.

576
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:10,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Our hope is that these sessions will provide us with invaluable feedback as we prepare for the upcoming school year.

577
01:58:10,802 --> 01:58:16,147
[SPEAKER_13]: As always, please feel free to reach out to us at any time with questions or concerns.

578
01:58:17,713 --> 01:58:25,782
[SPEAKER_13]: This Thursday, February 25 will be our second building bridges to kindergarten presentation via zoom.

579
01:58:26,282 --> 01:58:30,267
[SPEAKER_13]: This session will take place in the morning from 11am to 12 noon.

580
01:58:31,147 --> 01:58:35,012
[SPEAKER_13]: We hope, incoming kindergarten parents and caregivers can join us.

581
01:58:35,694 --> 01:58:47,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, if you can't join, we are hosting another presentation in March, and you can always contact Assistant Superintendent Suzanne Galusi with any questions or concerns.

582
01:58:49,925 --> 01:58:58,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a reminder, next week, Tuesday, March 2nd, we will be hosting a district-wide professional development day.

583
01:58:59,632 --> 01:59:05,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Therefore, there will be no instruction, whether remote or in school, on that particular day.

584
01:59:07,683 --> 01:59:18,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Marie Cassidy of the Medford Family Network has informed me, and there's an all call, that many members of our community are in need of diapers.

585
01:59:20,119 --> 01:59:25,586
[SPEAKER_13]: They are especially in need of sizes two, three, and six.

586
01:59:26,657 --> 01:59:32,858
[SPEAKER_13]: If anyone is able to assist, please contact Marie Cassidy at 781-393-2106.

587
01:59:32,878 --> 01:59:41,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, they are in need of diapers sizes two, three, and six.

588
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:51,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Our partners from Melrose-Wakefield Hospital are offering free, safe at home classes via Zoom.

589
01:59:53,276 --> 02:00:03,912
[SPEAKER_13]: They're offering a class for students in grades four through six, and it's the safe sitter program, safe sitter.

590
02:00:04,513 --> 02:00:08,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Completing this program does not mean that a student is ready to stay home alone.

591
02:00:09,995 --> 02:00:24,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Only the students' parents can make that decision, but it will help students learn how to practice safe habits, how to handle common household emergencies, and how to address illness or injury.

592
02:00:25,282 --> 02:00:31,625
[SPEAKER_13]: The classes are being held on Saturday, March 13th, from 10 to 11.30 a.m., and also on Wednesday, March 31st, from 4.30 to 6 p.m.

593
02:00:38,305 --> 02:00:49,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, coming up in April, they plan to also offer safe sitter classes for students entering grades six through eight, our middle school age students.

594
02:00:50,068 --> 02:00:55,489
[SPEAKER_13]: For them to be safe when they are home alone, watching younger siblings or babysitting.

595
02:00:56,449 --> 02:01:04,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Students will learn life-saving skills such as how to rescue someone who's choking and what to do during severe weather.

596
02:01:04,978 --> 02:01:09,022
[SPEAKER_13]: The lessons are filled with fun activities and role-playing exercises.

597
02:01:09,582 --> 02:01:20,812
[SPEAKER_13]: For further information or to register, please email che at Melrose Wakefield.org or call 781-338-7561.

598
02:01:21,253 --> 02:01:22,894
[SPEAKER_13]: February, lastly, is fast coming to a close.

599
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:36,471
[SPEAKER_13]: But the Medford High School Black History celebrations continue.

600
02:01:37,772 --> 02:01:48,015
[SPEAKER_13]: School committee members, you are being invited if you're interested on Thursday, February 25th, Monday, March 1st, or Thursday, March 4th.

601
02:01:48,675 --> 02:01:57,278
[SPEAKER_13]: The F Know Haitian dance performances are continuing to take place at the high school gym with strict social distancing protocols.

602
02:01:58,153 --> 02:02:01,335
[SPEAKER_13]: All performances run from 9 to 9.50 in the morning.

603
02:02:02,155 --> 02:02:07,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, special thanks to assistant principal Sherose Walker, who has spearheaded that initiative.

604
02:02:08,019 --> 02:02:11,040
[SPEAKER_13]: If you'd like to attend, please contact her and let her know.

605
02:02:12,161 --> 02:02:14,862
[SPEAKER_13]: The performance is quite uplifting and interactive.

606
02:02:15,463 --> 02:02:23,767
[SPEAKER_13]: And in honor of Black History Month, let us remember the words of representative John Lewis, who yesterday would have been 81 years old.

607
02:02:26,989 --> 02:02:28,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes you have to get in the way.

608
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:36,053
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to make some noise by speaking up and speaking out against injustice and inaction.

609
02:02:37,254 --> 02:02:40,775
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford Public Schools, we are committed to doing that.

610
02:02:41,496 --> 02:02:41,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

611
02:02:45,337 --> 02:02:46,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

612
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:55,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, we have COVID-19 public health update and Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update.

613
02:02:56,258 --> 02:02:57,319
[SPEAKER_04]: nurse supervisor, Ms.

614
02:02:57,339 --> 02:03:01,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Toni Ray, and Mr. David Murphy.

615
02:03:04,006 --> 02:03:04,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

616
02:03:05,848 --> 02:03:09,271
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide both community data and school data tonight.

617
02:03:10,813 --> 02:03:19,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So the February 18th report that came out from the Department of Public Health, Medford continues to be in the yellow zone.

618
02:03:21,204 --> 02:03:30,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Our percent positivity decreased to 1.08%, which is almost 50% less than two weeks ago.

619
02:03:31,611 --> 02:03:35,734
[SPEAKER_00]: And this aligns with the decrease in the number of positive cases reported statewide.

620
02:03:35,774 --> 02:03:39,776
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are very excited to make that benchmark.

621
02:03:41,693 --> 02:03:45,935
[SPEAKER_00]: For school data, our pool testing program started on February 4th.

622
02:03:46,895 --> 02:03:51,677
[SPEAKER_00]: As of February 18th, 416 pools were tested.

623
02:03:52,517 --> 02:03:58,259
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified three positive pools and completed the reflex testing.

624
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:09,823
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflex testing identified the three positive cases through a Binax rapid test, and it was confirmed by a positive PCR test.

625
02:04:12,317 --> 02:04:17,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Athletes were tested on Thursday, February 18th, and no positive pools were identified.

626
02:04:19,261 --> 02:04:26,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Pool testing resumed today at all schools for cohorts A and B, and results are expected in tomorrow morning.

627
02:04:28,676 --> 02:04:38,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to also take this time to refer back to a request by member Rousseau, who had asked about the new CDC guidelines that were published on February 12th.

628
02:04:39,325 --> 02:04:42,247
[SPEAKER_00]: And I reviewed them and would just like to make a couple highlights.

629
02:04:43,168 --> 02:04:53,377
[SPEAKER_00]: The report focused on five major points of mitigation, mandatory masking, ventilation, sanitation, contact tracing, and testing.

630
02:04:54,731 --> 02:04:56,912
[SPEAKER_00]: We meet guidelines one through four.

631
02:04:57,673 --> 02:05:00,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Our students and staff are wearing masks regularly.

632
02:05:01,515 --> 02:05:03,977
[SPEAKER_00]: We've improved ventilation at all schools.

633
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:08,820
[SPEAKER_00]: We are following the sanitation guidelines that are outlined by the CDC.

634
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:15,484
[SPEAKER_00]: And our school nurses are collaborating with the Medford Board of Health to complete contact tracing within the school.

635
02:05:17,085 --> 02:05:21,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Of importance is that we are exceeding guidelines in two areas.

636
02:05:22,693 --> 02:05:29,497
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made additional PPE available to all our staff, such as face shields and desk shields.

637
02:05:31,558 --> 02:05:34,319
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also conducting surveillance testing.

638
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:49,888
[SPEAKER_00]: The CDC does not recommend universal surveillance testing of all students and staff, and instead advises school administrators to determine, in conjunction with their local health officials, whether to implement any testing strategy.

639
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:55,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Our testing program, supported by Tufts University, has been operational since September of 2020.

640
02:05:56,343 --> 02:06:10,252
[SPEAKER_00]: As we have frequently discussed in this forum, the program has been instrumental in identifying positive cases, quickly isolating them, and determining the close contacts from the school population.

641
02:06:11,353 --> 02:06:19,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would like to discuss the report in any further detail, then we can make arrangements to do so.

642
02:06:21,884 --> 02:06:22,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

643
02:06:23,785 --> 02:06:24,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Miss Ray.

644
02:06:24,885 --> 02:06:25,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Murphy.

645
02:06:25,626 --> 02:06:26,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything to add?

646
02:06:26,746 --> 02:06:29,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple of quick comments as both.

647
02:06:30,188 --> 02:06:33,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the superintendents that I think Mr. Raymond mentioned as well.

648
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:41,974
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing a really good job in terms of our ramping up our testing program and as our testing numbers.

649
02:06:43,075 --> 02:06:48,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Increase our positivity rate consistent with the community's rate is significantly decreasing.

650
02:06:48,357 --> 02:06:49,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that

651
02:06:51,611 --> 02:07:00,717
[SPEAKER_01]: it will require a continued vigilance to make sure that the testing program continues to be as robust as it is and participation continues to be as high as it is.

652
02:07:01,218 --> 02:07:08,583
[SPEAKER_01]: That is particularly important with regard to student athletes and students who are participating in extracurricular programming in person.

653
02:07:09,043 --> 02:07:18,330
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an element of the program that we are tightening as we speak and student athletes and families of student athletes should know

654
02:07:19,151 --> 02:07:31,877
[SPEAKER_01]: That lack of participation in the in-school portion of the testing program will result in exclusion from those activities if the students aren't testing.

655
02:07:31,937 --> 02:07:34,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're sending out communications to that effect.

656
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:48,564
[SPEAKER_01]: The athletics department is communicating through coaches and other school personnel to make sure that that message is reaching students and families, because the last thing we want is for anyone to be excluded from any activity.

657
02:07:48,644 --> 02:07:58,086
[SPEAKER_01]: But given the nature of the programming and as part of that continued vigilance that I mentioned, all students and families should keep that in mind.

658
02:07:58,106 --> 02:08:00,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're going to be communicating that again,

659
02:08:01,257 --> 02:08:07,039
[SPEAKER_01]: in a variety of forms, but it is something that I think the committee and the community at large should be aware of.

660
02:08:09,921 --> 02:08:10,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

661
02:08:13,022 --> 02:08:13,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau.

662
02:08:14,703 --> 02:08:15,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

663
02:08:15,543 --> 02:08:16,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the report.

664
02:08:16,443 --> 02:08:17,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it very much.

665
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:27,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I don't know if you're supposed to have the week off last week, but I am grateful you managed to get through that guidance.

666
02:08:28,148 --> 02:08:29,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I did have a question.

667
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:38,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen a number of articles and about somewhat the unnecessary level of cleaning.

668
02:08:38,426 --> 02:08:52,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that some early on in the pandemic people were isolating their mail for days and we certainly cleaning of our facilities was a major component of our work over the summer as to what the plan was going to be.

669
02:08:52,478 --> 02:08:59,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And I certainly am understanding of how some things we do

670
02:08:59,988 --> 02:09:01,448
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe just make us feel better.

671
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:06,889
[SPEAKER_11]: But my question is, are we doing cleaning that is unnecessary?

672
02:09:06,909 --> 02:09:12,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think there's two aspects to doing anything unnecessary around cleaning that concern me.

673
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:14,190
[SPEAKER_11]: One is the cost, obviously.

674
02:09:14,691 --> 02:09:18,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other is something I talked about numerous times last year.

675
02:09:18,231 --> 02:09:28,733
[SPEAKER_11]: And there wasn't a lot of feedback, but concern about whether or not these chemicals have truly, the chemical industry isn't exactly known as the most trustworthy industry who's concerned about all of our safety until

676
02:09:29,152 --> 02:09:32,893
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, until they can go out of business after killing a bunch of people.

677
02:09:33,273 --> 02:09:51,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So my concern is, do we need to be doing cleaning, all of the cleaning we're doing, and can we cut any cleaning out that is truly not necessary, even though it may make, and if we can, we should communicate that this is definitely no longer necessary.

678
02:09:51,919 --> 02:09:54,020
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been proven to be not necessary.

679
02:09:57,735 --> 02:10:00,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody have any feedback on that?

680
02:10:01,058 --> 02:10:11,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good question, and I think it's something that has been on our minds as the data and the evidence has continued to evolve over the course of the past year.

681
02:10:11,307 --> 02:10:18,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a scientist, and I think that this is a virus that didn't, to the best of our knowledge, exist 15 months ago.

682
02:10:19,093 --> 02:10:24,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should all sort of have that humility in recognizing that we don't know

683
02:10:25,211 --> 02:10:28,512
[SPEAKER_01]: We know more than we did a year ago, but probably not as much as we will a year from now.

684
02:10:29,012 --> 02:10:47,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would say is that there's it seems as though there's a consensus that this that the surface based transmission concerns were potentially are not quite as great as they were at the beginning of the pandemic right that there's a pretty large body of evidence that that being said.

685
02:10:48,698 --> 02:11:00,784
[SPEAKER_01]: There's solid data that what is used to clean the schools are non-toxic chemicals that are good for sanitation purposes.

686
02:11:01,304 --> 02:11:11,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not, I've seen no evidence and no data to suggest that they're being used to a point of reaching diminishing returns.

687
02:11:11,289 --> 02:11:17,772
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, we're not cleaning to the point where you feel like you're going to school in a Windex bottle.

688
02:11:18,547 --> 02:11:41,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, and I think while there's some, there have been folks that have said, and this has come up in some of the conversations we've had with various constituents, including some, those representing some of the employees, that sometimes when the, what's known as the fogger comes in and sanitizes a room, like it can be irritating to some people.

689
02:11:41,206 --> 02:11:46,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we try to time that in a way that you're not getting blasted with

690
02:11:47,074 --> 02:11:51,399
[SPEAKER_01]: this non-toxic chemical immediately upon coming into a room.

691
02:11:51,479 --> 02:12:00,407
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't seen anything to suggest that we need to scale back those efforts because I've seen no evidence to suggest that it would do any harm.

692
02:12:01,048 --> 02:12:10,317
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't reached a point where we're exceeding our financial capacity due to some of the financial support that we received specific to the pandemic relief.

693
02:12:11,100 --> 02:12:22,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we're striking the right balance there, but I think it'll be something that certainly going forward, we'll have to take a closer look at, because if there is the evidence that it doesn't actually do any good, I think we have to look at the cost aspect of it.

694
02:12:24,547 --> 02:12:24,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

695
02:12:25,047 --> 02:12:38,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had a second question in this, around, I've heard, you know, I'm very happy to hear that there's a robust sounding protocols around sports participation.

696
02:12:41,672 --> 02:12:46,913
[SPEAKER_11]: or unclear about why music is not happening yet.

697
02:12:47,354 --> 02:13:05,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And anybody who's played an instrument and anybody who has participated in the support, I find it hard to believe that unless you're doing maybe a trombone or some of those instruments with excessive requirements, why are we not doing music?

698
02:13:07,388 --> 02:13:09,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to answer that for you.

699
02:13:10,671 --> 02:13:19,498
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of exhalation that comes out of any of the instruments is the point of concern by the medical community.

700
02:13:20,459 --> 02:13:29,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we can figure out a way to successfully filter that, the recommendation stands to avoid doing that in person.

701
02:13:31,248 --> 02:13:33,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have followed those recommendations.

702
02:13:34,251 --> 02:13:44,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that a group of percussionists will start getting together soon because that is an instrument where there's no exhalation.

703
02:13:45,359 --> 02:13:49,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the color guard is also having practice sessions.

704
02:13:50,864 --> 02:13:56,829
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are making the strides that we are allowed to make right now.

705
02:13:57,149 --> 02:13:58,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And there hasn't been any further

706
02:13:58,950 --> 02:14:02,552
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations from the Department of Education on that.

707
02:14:03,653 --> 02:14:14,499
[SPEAKER_11]: So, sorry to beat this horse a little bit, but we can all acknowledge that sports gets a very different level of attention and concern from our society in general.

708
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:24,365
[SPEAKER_11]: So my question is, so the studies about the amount of exhalation for these instruments, similar studies have said that

709
02:14:25,292 --> 02:14:30,455
[SPEAKER_11]: doing all this physical activity in close quarters is in fact not producing the same amount of exhalation.

710
02:14:30,595 --> 02:14:33,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I feel like I'm not terribly in shape.

711
02:14:33,177 --> 02:14:44,063
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, maybe I just breathe an awful lot if I even start to work out, but I just think it's like, we have this robust scientific base standard for music, which is great.

712
02:14:44,903 --> 02:14:48,125
[SPEAKER_11]: And then do we really have that same standard for sports?

713
02:14:50,827 --> 02:14:50,927
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

714
02:14:52,075 --> 02:14:59,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd say I wait for the guidelines to come out and I make recommendations based on those guidelines.

715
02:14:59,921 --> 02:15:04,565
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I've, you know, that's the position I've taken.

716
02:15:06,767 --> 02:15:10,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Following whatever safe, you know, safety procedures we can.

717
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:11,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

718
02:15:12,171 --> 02:15:12,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

719
02:15:12,912 --> 02:15:14,113
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best I can answer you.

720
02:15:16,115 --> 02:15:18,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say it's a very fair question.

721
02:15:19,278 --> 02:15:31,007
[SPEAKER_01]: One aspect is with the music program being part of the school day, there are restrictions on the mandatory testing element that we're able to impose on athletics because they're extracurricular in nature.

722
02:15:31,327 --> 02:15:41,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't answer what I think the point of the question is, which is the discrepancy in terms of potential scientific standards, but it is one variable that does distinguish the two situations, at least internally for us.

723
02:15:46,623 --> 02:15:47,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Van der Kloot, did you have a hand up?

724
02:15:54,207 --> 02:15:56,188
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess to that point, is the orchestra playing?

725
02:15:59,510 --> 02:16:00,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe so.

726
02:16:00,911 --> 02:16:02,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at the moment.

727
02:16:03,192 --> 02:16:13,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say that I think that assuming the progress, and that's sort of why I tried to start my comments with this idea of heightened vigilance, it's my hope

728
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:38,108
[SPEAKER_01]: that if the data continues to be favorable, that vigilance is the word that we keep going back to because that it will become an increasing need for us to remind ourselves of the need to have a robust testing program, of the need to stay out of school or out of work if you have symptoms, of the need to if you are close contact to make sure that you're quarantining because if the trends continue

729
02:16:39,448 --> 02:16:47,611
[SPEAKER_01]: The likelihood is we're going to be receiving new recommendations around music, around occupancy, and around some of these restrictions.

730
02:16:48,071 --> 02:17:04,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're going to be hearing any news about masks anytime soon, but for these types of things, these are conversations that we're hopeful that we're going to be having in the spring and seeing what elements of, as Dr. Fauci would say, normality that we can begin to re-institute within the district.

731
02:17:04,997 --> 02:17:08,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that will stretch from the academic programming to scheduling to extracurricular.

732
02:17:09,562 --> 02:17:10,943
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on and so forth.

733
02:17:11,663 --> 02:17:13,424
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all of these things.

734
02:17:13,484 --> 02:17:18,566
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little premature right now, but I think right now, if we were able to maintain that vigilance, that could be where the conversation goes next.

735
02:17:20,386 --> 02:17:21,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

736
02:17:23,648 --> 02:17:28,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have number three, report on financial update for the city of Medford, Ms.

737
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:32,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin, Chief Financial Officer for the city.

738
02:17:34,052 --> 02:17:35,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us, Alicia.

739
02:17:39,112 --> 02:17:40,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, school committee members.

740
02:17:40,392 --> 02:17:42,913
[SPEAKER_12]: May I share my screen for the presentation tonight?

741
02:17:44,333 --> 02:17:44,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

742
02:17:44,994 --> 02:17:46,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

743
02:17:46,214 --> 02:17:46,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be good to go.

744
02:17:46,994 --> 02:17:47,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you're a co-host.

745
02:17:52,776 --> 02:17:58,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you able to see my screen right now with the presentation?

746
02:17:59,278 --> 02:17:59,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

747
02:18:00,158 --> 02:18:00,258
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

748
02:18:04,254 --> 02:18:12,396
[SPEAKER_12]: So for Q2, the city is meeting its target revenue estimates in total, but not by every single revenue stream.

749
02:18:12,796 --> 02:18:20,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So for instance, my Q2 budget estimate for motor vehicle excise is higher than what I actually collected.

750
02:18:21,378 --> 02:18:24,358
[SPEAKER_12]: My boat excise tax is about on target.

751
02:18:25,159 --> 02:18:27,359
[SPEAKER_12]: My penalties and interest is actually up.

752
02:18:28,619 --> 02:18:31,340
[SPEAKER_12]: No pilots because they're not expected until Q3 and Q4.

753
02:18:33,037 --> 02:18:35,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Hotel excise is down, which we would expect.

754
02:18:35,417 --> 02:18:37,838
[SPEAKER_12]: The hotels got hit the hardest due to COVID-19.

755
02:18:39,198 --> 02:18:41,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Our local meals tax is doing well.

756
02:18:41,159 --> 02:18:44,619
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a community impact fee, it's extremely small.

757
02:18:44,679 --> 02:18:46,720
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the first year we're receiving it.

758
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:49,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Our fees are higher than estimated.

759
02:18:49,940 --> 02:18:52,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Our rentals are on target.

760
02:18:53,141 --> 02:18:55,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Our departmental revenue is on target.

761
02:18:56,201 --> 02:18:58,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Our license and permit is below what we would have expected.

762
02:19:00,285 --> 02:19:04,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Our Medicaid is actually below what we would have expected.

763
02:19:04,672 --> 02:19:06,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, excuse me, above our estimate.

764
02:19:07,837 --> 02:19:10,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Fines and forfeits is below.

765
02:19:10,362 --> 02:19:13,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Our investment income is below because the rates have dropped so much.

766
02:19:14,804 --> 02:19:17,086
[SPEAKER_12]: and miscellaneous is about where we would expect it.

767
02:19:17,366 --> 02:19:27,534
[SPEAKER_12]: As of right now, there's still no federal stimulus, and we're watching the American Rescue Plan with Biden, hoping he's gonna give us some additional stimulus to cities and towns.

768
02:19:27,634 --> 02:19:30,476
[SPEAKER_12]: He did extend the CARES Act to December 31, 2021.

769
02:19:33,878 --> 02:19:35,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Here are the actual numbers.

770
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:40,363
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can see my Q2 budgeted receipts versus what I actually received.

771
02:19:40,403 --> 02:19:43,145
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can see for my motor vehicle, I'm actually down 82,000,

772
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:46,421
[SPEAKER_12]: For my boat excise, I'm up 546.

773
02:19:46,481 --> 02:19:47,702
[SPEAKER_12]: For my penalties and interest, I'm up 90,674.06.

774
02:19:49,123 --> 02:19:49,964
[SPEAKER_12]: For my hotel, I'm down 9,925.76.

775
02:19:50,004 --> 02:19:50,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Local meals, I'm up 22,105.

776
02:19:50,684 --> 02:19:55,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Community impact fee, I did not budget for, as I said, it was new, and that's only 2,986.35.

777
02:20:10,565 --> 02:20:14,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Fees are up $156,871.47.

778
02:20:14,667 --> 02:20:15,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Rentals are on target.

779
02:20:16,548 --> 02:20:17,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Departmental revenue up $14,832.81.

780
02:20:18,148 --> 02:20:19,429
[SPEAKER_12]: License and permits is down $110,540.85.

781
02:20:19,469 --> 02:20:20,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Medicaid is up $82,232.85.

782
02:20:20,929 --> 02:20:22,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Fines and forfeits is down $28,926.20.

783
02:20:35,212 --> 02:20:44,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Investment income is down 50,095 and 53, and miscellaneous is up by 5,777 and 16 cents.

784
02:20:49,422 --> 02:20:52,023
[SPEAKER_12]: This is my 2021 cherry sheet receipts.

785
02:20:52,083 --> 02:20:53,004
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the final.

786
02:20:53,264 --> 02:20:57,307
[SPEAKER_12]: When we did the budget, we had done that 10% projected conservative cut.

787
02:20:58,228 --> 02:21:04,432
[SPEAKER_12]: And when the governor level funded the chapter 70, we reprogrammed that difference back to the schools, to the city council.

788
02:21:06,103 --> 02:21:10,747
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the final 2021 cherry sheet assessments to the city of 12,000,716,837.

789
02:21:10,807 --> 02:21:13,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Here is my local aid summary from 2021 for chapter 70.

790
02:21:13,189 --> 02:21:16,272
[SPEAKER_12]: We had budgeted 11,053,769.

791
02:21:16,312 --> 02:21:17,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually got 12,143,306.

792
02:21:17,212 --> 02:21:19,154
[SPEAKER_12]: That 1,000,089,537 was reprogrammed back to the schools.

793
02:21:32,792 --> 02:21:35,993
[SPEAKER_12]: and unrestricted general government aid, also known as UGA.

794
02:21:36,593 --> 02:21:37,114
[SPEAKER_12]: We budgeted $11,916,986.

795
02:21:37,274 --> 02:21:39,214
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually received $12,880,443, a difference of $963,457.

796
02:21:39,414 --> 02:21:42,055
[SPEAKER_12]: In other revenue streams, we budgeted $1,031,317.

797
02:21:42,095 --> 02:21:42,976
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually got $2,317,259.

798
02:21:43,056 --> 02:21:44,756
[SPEAKER_12]: For our assessments, we budgeted $11,884,634.

799
02:22:01,872 --> 02:22:03,113
[SPEAKER_12]: but our actual assessment was 12,716,837.

800
02:22:03,193 --> 02:22:05,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will actually pay 832,203 more than what we thought we were going to have to pay.

801
02:22:05,355 --> 02:22:07,377
[SPEAKER_12]: And do you notice a little asterisk I put is 82,442 is directly to the public library.

802
02:22:21,096 --> 02:22:24,819
[SPEAKER_12]: This is our fiscal year 2022 preliminary revenues.

803
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:29,283
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you can see right away, we actually dropped from 27,341,008 to 27,001,262, the biggest being charter.

804
02:22:29,303 --> 02:22:30,064
[SPEAKER_12]: The charter went from 1.9 to 900.

805
02:22:30,124 --> 02:22:32,146
[SPEAKER_12]: So we lost a million right off the top on the charter.

806
02:22:32,166 --> 02:22:35,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Our fiscal year 2022 preliminary assessments are more than fiscal year 21s.

807
02:22:49,388 --> 02:22:49,788
[SPEAKER_12]: at 12,948,591 versus 12.7.

808
02:22:49,848 --> 02:22:58,573
[SPEAKER_12]: So this translates into 132,420, which is a slight increase in chapter 70, a three and a half percent increase to unrestricted general government aid of 450,816, but a decline in our other aid by 840,029.

809
02:22:58,633 --> 02:23:00,774
[SPEAKER_12]: And the largest decline, as I pointed out, was due to the charter.

810
02:23:00,794 --> 02:23:02,494
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, our assessments are up

811
02:23:18,451 --> 02:23:22,613
[SPEAKER_12]: from 12,716,837 to 12,948,591.

812
02:23:23,673 --> 02:23:26,174
[SPEAKER_12]: That's 231,754 more.

813
02:23:26,454 --> 02:23:31,657
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a direct hit in a reduction to our budget revenues by 488 by 47.

814
02:23:33,458 --> 02:23:46,083
[SPEAKER_12]: So due to COVID-19 and the resurgence and the economic decline that's happening and that we're in a recession right now, the city implemented a spending freeze for non-emergency expenditures and hiring.

815
02:23:47,766 --> 02:23:54,828
[SPEAKER_12]: The state has indicated that we're in a recession with a recovery range between fiscal year 23 and fiscal year 25.

816
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:08,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Massachusetts said, since this is currently in an economic recession, it gave these figures.

817
02:24:09,031 --> 02:24:12,052
[SPEAKER_12]: So as of February 2020, GDP decreased by 3.4%.

818
02:24:14,185 --> 02:24:17,987
[SPEAKER_12]: and 31.6% in second quarter declining tax revenue.

819
02:24:18,267 --> 02:24:20,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Meals and motor vehicle decline shown in April, 2020.

820
02:24:22,350 --> 02:24:25,232
[SPEAKER_12]: July, 2020 state taxes started to recover.

821
02:24:25,252 --> 02:24:27,913
[SPEAKER_12]: 48% of jobs recovered in October.

822
02:24:28,033 --> 02:24:32,436
[SPEAKER_12]: However, the pace of economic recovery declined due to the resurgence of COVID-19.

823
02:24:33,617 --> 02:24:34,657
[SPEAKER_12]: State growth dropped from 6.8% to 2.2%.

824
02:24:38,897 --> 02:24:49,426
[SPEAKER_12]: In fiscal year 21, year-to-date state tax collections, 2.7% more than fiscal year 20, but two thirds of that revenue is collected between December and June.

825
02:24:50,046 --> 02:24:51,588
[SPEAKER_12]: So the state said a lot could change.

826
02:24:51,608 --> 02:24:53,830
[SPEAKER_12]: It might get less than what they're thinking.

827
02:24:54,830 --> 02:24:59,915
[SPEAKER_12]: At the state level, 8.1% increase in regular sales tax, negative 31.9% in meals, an 8.7 increase in motor vehicle sales,

828
02:25:06,868 --> 02:25:09,769
[SPEAKER_12]: a negative 53% in room occupancy.

829
02:25:11,689 --> 02:25:18,191
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the big concerns is what our assessors will be facing, which is commercial market, fair market value is slowing down.

830
02:25:18,611 --> 02:25:22,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Certain property types are really struggling, such as retail, malls.

831
02:25:25,033 --> 02:25:28,954
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're also concerned about businesses closing effective January 1st.

832
02:25:29,694 --> 02:25:36,316
[SPEAKER_12]: This will affect our assessments, our values and our new growth and pressure on assessors to abate.

833
02:25:37,723 --> 02:25:47,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Hotel occupancy rates plummeted and don't expect to recover until full implementation of a vaccine and the prediction to return to normals between 2023 and 2025.

834
02:25:48,374 --> 02:25:51,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Massachusetts lost 4,000 restaurants due to the pandemic.

835
02:25:52,819 --> 02:25:55,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Independent restaurant sales are down by 30% rural, 40% suburban, and 45% urban.

836
02:26:03,545 --> 02:26:06,687
[SPEAKER_12]: So how does that affect our city with the economic decline?

837
02:26:06,887 --> 02:26:11,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So our local receipts for fiscal year 20, we projected 20,063,416, and we actually received 19,105,993.

838
02:26:11,090 --> 02:26:12,891
[SPEAKER_12]: So we were actually short 957,423 last year.

839
02:26:12,911 --> 02:26:15,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Fiscal year 21, we projected 15,830,089, a $4.2 million loss from the prior year due to COVID-19.

840
02:26:31,291 --> 02:26:41,541
[SPEAKER_12]: New growth and assessed values could decline in fiscal year 22 due to significant decline in the commercial sectors, as I said before, such as shopping malls, office space, retail, auto dealerships.

841
02:26:42,622 --> 02:26:45,985
[SPEAKER_12]: The decrease in projected fiscal year 22 local cherry sheet aid of $488,547.

842
02:26:46,065 --> 02:26:48,308
[SPEAKER_12]: We currently have a $5 to $8 million budget deficit projected.

843
02:26:54,133 --> 02:26:59,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Fixed costs such as health insurance, waste management, pension, they continue to increase.

844
02:27:00,216 --> 02:27:03,617
[SPEAKER_12]: The city used free cash last year to subsidize the general fund budget.

845
02:27:04,458 --> 02:27:11,621
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's important to note that free cash is our only general fund reserve, is a one-time surplus, it isn't guaranteed every year.

846
02:27:12,622 --> 02:27:17,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And we cannot deplete our entire reserve, this would be catastrophic to the city's finances and bond rating.

847
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:23,121
[SPEAKER_12]: And without additional federal aid for revenue losses, the city is facing a tough fiscal year 22.

848
02:27:24,842 --> 02:27:29,523
[SPEAKER_12]: But we are watching the package up at the federal level and we are very, very hopeful.

849
02:27:31,904 --> 02:27:39,606
[SPEAKER_12]: So with the CARES Act that came out, we have gotten extended to December 31st, 2021, which is great.

850
02:27:42,615 --> 02:27:46,577
[SPEAKER_12]: but it restricted us to only COVID-19 eligible expenses.

851
02:27:47,217 --> 02:27:51,639
[SPEAKER_12]: The good news was there was no cap on the school.

852
02:27:51,699 --> 02:27:57,842
[SPEAKER_12]: So relating to the school's HVAC, getting the air better for the children, there was no restriction on that.

853
02:27:58,082 --> 02:28:03,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas there was a cap on eligible capital expenses on the city side of 150,000.

854
02:28:04,665 --> 02:28:08,367
[SPEAKER_12]: So the city is still experiencing large revenue losses.

855
02:28:09,634 --> 02:28:14,178
[SPEAKER_12]: and the reduction in the budget is entirely due to the economic fallout due to COVID-19.

856
02:28:22,665 --> 02:28:25,908
[SPEAKER_12]: The CARES Act was awarded May 14th, 2020, extended to 12-31-2021.

857
02:28:25,968 --> 02:28:29,091
[SPEAKER_12]: The city has been charging 75% of COVID-related expenses to FEMA and 25% to CARES.

858
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:52,765
[SPEAKER_12]: The landscape at the federal level shifted with the change in administrations as a result of the shift FEMA's indicated that both eligibility and reimbursement rates for the FEMA public assistance program will be expanded upon and we're still waiting for the guidance on how that's going to work.

859
02:28:53,145 --> 02:28:57,867
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still waiting to hear back also on our October submission that we sent to FEMA.

860
02:29:00,355 --> 02:29:01,835
[SPEAKER_12]: The CARES Act award to the city was 5,093,008.

861
02:29:02,075 --> 02:29:03,836
[SPEAKER_12]: In fiscal year 20, the city had encumbered 65,756.22, expended 132,155.03.

862
02:29:03,876 --> 02:29:05,536
[SPEAKER_12]: This includes 25% of the COVID-19 FEMA eligible expenses.

863
02:29:05,556 --> 02:29:07,117
[SPEAKER_12]: In fiscal 21, the city has encumbered 1,611,030 and expended 2,741,800.

864
02:29:28,925 --> 02:29:39,954
[SPEAKER_12]: The schools in the city will be using the remaining 2.1 for PPE, contact tracing, vaccination, and various other COVID-19 related expenses until December 31st.

865
02:29:41,195 --> 02:29:44,117
[SPEAKER_12]: FEMA doesn't have an expiration or award total.

866
02:29:44,458 --> 02:29:47,560
[SPEAKER_12]: The program is open for eligible COVID-19 expenses.

867
02:29:48,301 --> 02:29:50,563
[SPEAKER_12]: In fiscal 20, the city had encumbered 47,384.03 and expended 288,388.36.

868
02:29:56,525 --> 02:30:00,927
[SPEAKER_12]: In fiscal year 21, the city has encumbered 78,529 and expended 184,340.

869
02:30:01,547 --> 02:30:04,809
[SPEAKER_12]: FEMA funds were drawn down on October 15th.

870
02:30:04,909 --> 02:30:06,850
[SPEAKER_12]: We still haven't heard back from the Fed.

871
02:30:09,971 --> 02:30:17,735
[SPEAKER_12]: As stated earlier, the FEMA directives on eligibility have shifted from the Trump administration to the Biden administration, and the city is awaiting further guidance on the new directives.

872
02:30:21,416 --> 02:30:25,018
[SPEAKER_12]: The CARES Act funds, 53% were allocated to the schools.

873
02:30:26,408 --> 02:30:45,962
[SPEAKER_12]: 2.64 million has been expended by the schools year to date, and I just showed a little graph so you could see the infrastructure, such as the HVAC and facility modification, personal protective equipment, sanitation supplies, technology, instructional materials, and contact tracers.

874
02:30:52,746 --> 02:31:02,169
[SPEAKER_12]: In fiscal year 21, the schools were awarded 2.3 million under the CRRSA Act or the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act.

875
02:31:03,290 --> 02:31:10,732
[SPEAKER_12]: ESSER II Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund Grant signed into law on December 27th, 2020.

876
02:31:11,693 --> 02:31:17,775
[SPEAKER_12]: And below are the three buckets taken from DESE, which are academic, social, emotional operations,

877
02:31:19,369 --> 02:31:23,673
[SPEAKER_12]: These slides were shared with me through the school finance side.

878
02:31:24,074 --> 02:31:29,259
[SPEAKER_12]: So any specific ESSER questions should be directed to the school assistant superintendent of finance.

879
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:40,750
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the academic focus from DESE, high quality instruction, early literacy, K-12, skill building, planning and implementation, summer learning, diagnostic assessments.

880
02:31:42,314 --> 02:32:00,649
[SPEAKER_12]: social and emotional focus, unique needs of low-income children, students with disabilities, English learners, racial and ethnic minorities, students experiencing homelessness, foster care youth, behavioral and mental health support and services, an additional 10,000 provided per district allocation for mental health services and support.

881
02:32:03,586 --> 02:32:14,738
[SPEAKER_12]: and operations focus, educational technology, supplies and services, school ventilation system improvements, planning for and coordinating during long-term closure, and other activities.

882
02:32:17,121 --> 02:32:23,528
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is just a summary of those three buckets just broken down further in a summary view.

883
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:36,291
[SPEAKER_12]: So free cash and retained earnings include actual receipts in excess of revenue estimates and unspent amounts in departmental budget lines, items for the year just ending.

884
02:32:36,611 --> 02:32:39,595
[SPEAKER_12]: So this was certified by the Department of Revenue on January 4, 2021.

885
02:32:39,835 --> 02:32:41,437
[SPEAKER_12]: The general fund free cash is $8,534,241.

886
02:32:47,668 --> 02:32:51,231
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Enterprise Fund Water and Sewer Retained Earnings is $6,059,512.

887
02:32:51,772 --> 02:32:59,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And I put a note on the bottom, Enterprise Water and Sewer Fund budget is independent of the general fund school budget.

888
02:32:59,939 --> 02:33:01,040
[SPEAKER_12]: It's completely different.

889
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:03,362
[SPEAKER_12]: It operates its own expenses.

890
02:33:03,382 --> 02:33:05,403
[SPEAKER_12]: It's for the rate payers of water and sewer.

891
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:10,048
[SPEAKER_12]: The Enterprise Fund budget was $24,800,089 with Enterprise Fund Water and Sewer Retained Earnings of $6,059,512.

892
02:33:16,263 --> 02:33:20,206
[SPEAKER_12]: In conclusion, the city's Q2 revenues are in line with our prediction overall.

893
02:33:20,506 --> 02:33:23,488
[SPEAKER_12]: But as you can see, some of the revenue streams are below what we expected.

894
02:33:24,189 --> 02:33:31,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though overall we met our projection for the quarter, we're expecting more of a decline to start in Q3 with the COVID-19 resurgence.

895
02:33:31,554 --> 02:33:38,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Therefore, the city implemented a non-essential hiring and spending freeze in January, while closely monitoring revenues throughout the pandemic.

896
02:33:39,673 --> 02:33:46,294
[SPEAKER_12]: The city's CARES Act stimulus has been extended under President Bunnin to December 31, 2021, with the COVID-19 resurgence.

897
02:33:47,295 --> 02:33:56,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Under President Bunnin, the FEMA public assistance program will be expanded upon to increase reimbursements from 75% to 100% for certain expenditure types, and we're waiting for the guidance.

898
02:33:57,537 --> 02:34:04,078
[SPEAKER_12]: The city's local aid cherry sheet estimate is less than prior years, decreasing our fiscal year 22 budget funding.

899
02:34:05,218 --> 02:34:08,619
[SPEAKER_12]: The schools were awarded an additional 2.3 million in ESSER II funds.

900
02:34:09,812 --> 02:34:21,156
[SPEAKER_12]: The city is hopeful that President Bynum will award additional stimulus to cities and towns greatly impacted by the health pandemic to help offset the projected fiscal year 22, five to $8 million budget deficit.

901
02:34:21,816 --> 02:34:25,537
[SPEAKER_12]: And the following slide is just a display of general fund school expenses year to date.

902
02:34:28,238 --> 02:34:30,879
[SPEAKER_12]: And it has payroll posted through February 11th.

903
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:36,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alicia, for the presentation.

904
02:34:36,201 --> 02:34:38,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you presented to the city council on

905
02:34:39,727 --> 02:34:49,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Wednesday of last week and I thank you for coming to the before the school committee to present as well Just to give us an overall picture of where we're at You're welcome here.

906
02:34:50,551 --> 02:35:04,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Um Let me just make sure there's no questions and we can move on where Yes, ma'am Yes, member russo the member of mandaclou.

907
02:35:04,636 --> 02:35:04,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

908
02:35:04,916 --> 02:35:06,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we please stop sharing the screen?

909
02:35:06,697 --> 02:35:07,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So we sure

910
02:35:10,492 --> 02:35:11,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

911
02:35:12,253 --> 02:35:13,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the presentation, Alicia.

912
02:35:13,994 --> 02:35:14,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

913
02:35:14,155 --> 02:35:15,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Nunley, excuse me.

914
02:35:17,397 --> 02:35:18,718
[SPEAKER_11]: You said charter a couple of times.

915
02:35:19,038 --> 02:35:21,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to be clear that that's charter school reimbursement, correct?

916
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:22,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

917
02:35:23,441 --> 02:35:24,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

918
02:35:25,002 --> 02:35:30,286
[SPEAKER_11]: You also mentioned in one of the early slides that the additional funds were reprogrammed to the schools.

919
02:35:30,926 --> 02:35:39,532
[SPEAKER_11]: We did not do a supplemental budget, so I don't know where that money went or who decided where it would go, but I noticed that in the last recession,

920
02:35:40,141 --> 02:35:47,524
[SPEAKER_11]: that the school committee came together and did a supplemental budget when there was more money available than had been anticipated.

921
02:35:48,504 --> 02:35:49,264
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't do that.

922
02:35:49,424 --> 02:35:56,647
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just confused how money can just be reprogrammed from city council unless that money was sent to facilities or something.

923
02:35:56,707 --> 02:35:58,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody know where that million went?

924
02:35:59,388 --> 02:35:59,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Murphy.

925
02:36:02,410 --> 02:36:12,898
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the appropriation that was made at the end of August, or I think it was initially introduced on the floor of the city council at the end of August and then appropriated in mid-September.

926
02:36:13,498 --> 02:36:28,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, in terms of where it technically sits, it's in a personnel line item because there were positions that, as I understand it, were technically eliminated from the FY21 budget with the understanding that

927
02:36:30,818 --> 02:36:41,701
[SPEAKER_01]: if the district was made whole, by way of this additional appropriation when the chapter 70 funds came in, that the those positions would be restored and so when it became clear in.

928
02:36:42,481 --> 02:36:46,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this was my arrival but only by a short period of time.

929
02:36:47,343 --> 02:36:55,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I was the positions were essentially restored at the very beginning of August, that ate into a large chunk of that funding.

930
02:36:56,085 --> 02:36:56,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And

931
02:36:57,171 --> 02:37:07,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Other components of it have been made as it's in a personnel line item, the personnel needs that were identified over the course of the year.

932
02:37:08,258 --> 02:37:20,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to go back and actually check, but I believe it's technically the million dollars is still intact, but it's necessary to bridge other gaps that were identified as we went through and reconstructed the FY 21 budget.

933
02:37:22,602 --> 02:37:42,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to make a more comprehensive presentation as to exactly what those priorities were, how they were identified, but essentially that it's primarily in personnel and positions that needed to exist in reality, but couldn't exist in the budget at the time the budget was adopted.

934
02:37:44,030 --> 02:37:44,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

935
02:37:44,730 --> 02:37:50,473
[SPEAKER_11]: So speaking of the budget though, so when we get to our next budget,

936
02:37:51,933 --> 02:37:56,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the budget going to say that the last year's budget was 62,500,000 or 62,250,000?

937
02:37:56,695 --> 02:38:03,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it going to say that it was 63 million and change?

938
02:38:05,139 --> 02:38:10,482
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand this, like we can just throw money onto the budget that wasn't in the budget.

939
02:38:10,782 --> 02:38:15,204
[SPEAKER_11]: So when the next year comes along, what was last year's budget?

940
02:38:15,504 --> 02:38:18,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Because year over year comparisons matter a lot.

941
02:38:19,066 --> 02:38:20,587
[SPEAKER_01]: It should include that million dollars.

942
02:38:21,388 --> 02:38:22,508
[SPEAKER_11]: But we never approved that.

943
02:38:22,608 --> 02:38:26,350
[SPEAKER_11]: So that cannot, how can that include that we did not approve that budget?

944
02:38:26,490 --> 02:38:29,251
[SPEAKER_01]: The appropriation was made to the school department.

945
02:38:29,371 --> 02:38:34,792
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can go back, as I said, make a more comprehensive presentation so that it's been formally adopted.

946
02:38:35,733 --> 02:38:39,134
[SPEAKER_11]: So is the school committee actually not required to approve a budget?

947
02:38:39,154 --> 02:38:41,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it can be any number we want.

948
02:38:41,994 --> 02:38:44,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's approve a budget for $100,000.

949
02:38:44,615 --> 02:38:47,656
[SPEAKER_11]: The city can allocate a whole bunch more and everybody's fine.

950
02:38:47,736 --> 02:38:49,257
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't matter whether we did it or not.

951
02:38:49,357 --> 02:38:49,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that true?

952
02:38:51,043 --> 02:38:55,784
[SPEAKER_12]: I think what's what I think to be defined is the school committee adopted a budget.

953
02:38:56,364 --> 02:39:03,966
[SPEAKER_12]: City Council, a supplemental appropriation came through which the mayor said, you know, we're going to hold the schools harmless.

954
02:39:04,206 --> 02:39:09,327
[SPEAKER_12]: So if chapter 70 comes in higher than we expected, we're going to she gave that money back.

955
02:39:09,907 --> 02:39:11,847
[SPEAKER_11]: So I understand that.

956
02:39:12,028 --> 02:39:13,608
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the city council at that point

957
02:39:14,713 --> 02:39:15,734
[SPEAKER_12]: programed it back.

958
02:39:16,374 --> 02:39:21,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know the mechanisms after the point of which the mayor to city council, then how it comes back to you.

959
02:39:21,697 --> 02:39:27,821
[SPEAKER_12]: I just know as long as a supplemental revenue comes in before the tax rate is set, it can be added to the budget.

960
02:39:28,721 --> 02:39:29,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

961
02:39:29,582 --> 02:39:37,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually, I paid all the attention during those times and I'm very happy the money came back and that the, you know, the promise was there.

962
02:39:37,727 --> 02:39:39,448
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not at all my concern.

963
02:39:39,998 --> 02:39:40,398
[SPEAKER_11]: at all.

964
02:39:40,998 --> 02:39:43,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody did everything they could here in this regard.

965
02:39:43,679 --> 02:39:45,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm very happy about that.

966
02:39:45,399 --> 02:39:46,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I don't know.

967
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:56,282
[SPEAKER_11]: And member Van der Kloot was here for the 2008 recession when there was supplemental budgets that were sent to the school committee for approval.

968
02:39:58,063 --> 02:40:02,544
[SPEAKER_11]: If that is not legally required, then just somebody has to say that and I'm fine with it.

969
02:40:02,955 --> 02:40:13,221
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we start comparing year-over-year budgets, which as a school committee member, I have done for the last decade or more of budgets, I need to know which document is the real document.

970
02:40:13,601 --> 02:40:21,565
[SPEAKER_11]: So if money can just be tacked on willy-nilly, not willy-nilly, money we were promised and we were given and that's awesome.

971
02:40:22,486 --> 02:40:23,686
[SPEAKER_11]: But what's the truth?

972
02:40:23,907 --> 02:40:24,947
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the budget number?

973
02:40:25,387 --> 02:40:31,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought the number we approved that we spend months in meetings to get to

974
02:40:32,605 --> 02:40:34,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Like that last budget was not fun.

975
02:40:34,567 --> 02:40:36,148
[SPEAKER_11]: The next one's going to be worse.

976
02:40:36,728 --> 02:40:37,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to do it all?

977
02:40:37,849 --> 02:40:42,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And then in the end of the day, whatever we approved was sort of like pointless.

978
02:40:42,513 --> 02:40:44,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Like did we really not do all that work for a reason?

979
02:40:46,847 --> 02:40:50,708
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I think what you're saying, it makes sense.

980
02:40:50,748 --> 02:40:54,648
[SPEAKER_12]: But what we're saying is since there was additional funds, we just programmed them back.

981
02:40:55,249 --> 02:41:03,790
[SPEAKER_12]: At that point, whether or not you, the superintendent or the assistant superintendent, programs the supplemental, I don't know.

982
02:41:03,810 --> 02:41:04,950
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't define that.

983
02:41:05,070 --> 02:41:11,771
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can tell you that your budget can be added on to anytime before the tax rate is set if supplemental funds are available.

984
02:41:13,612 --> 02:41:13,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

985
02:41:15,095 --> 02:41:17,076
[SPEAKER_11]: One more question, I'll just get out of the way.

986
02:41:18,956 --> 02:41:23,517
[SPEAKER_11]: So with the, is it the CRRTS?

987
02:41:24,177 --> 02:41:25,918
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a lot of different letters in that one.

988
02:41:26,478 --> 02:41:29,979
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very happy to see the three buckets.

989
02:41:31,379 --> 02:41:34,320
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of those buckets in particular to me is staff.

990
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:43,802
[SPEAKER_11]: So are we actually able to hire full-time employees, not contractors, not in money that will disappear tomorrow, actually add

991
02:41:44,239 --> 02:41:48,102
[SPEAKER_11]: full-time employees from those grants?

992
02:41:48,582 --> 02:41:50,263
[SPEAKER_01]: You're asking about the $2.3 million?

993
02:41:51,344 --> 02:41:51,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

994
02:41:52,164 --> 02:42:07,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the answer to that is yes, but we should... The sort of important cautionary note with that is that as of right now, that funding is intended to last over the course of the next two plus fiscal years.

995
02:42:07,835 --> 02:42:08,195
[SPEAKER_01]: And so

996
02:42:10,887 --> 02:42:14,269
[SPEAKER_01]: $2.3 million spread out over that period of time.

997
02:42:14,450 --> 02:42:21,134
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's all of our hope that there'll be additional injections of federal funding at both the city and school side.

998
02:42:21,654 --> 02:42:34,262
[SPEAKER_01]: But as of right now, it's a $2.3 million reservoir on a budget that already has, as was mentioned, what is effectively a million dollar reduction out of the charter school reimbursement.

999
02:42:34,722 --> 02:42:39,325
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit of a misnomer to call it a reduction, I think, but certainly practically that's what it amounts to.

1000
02:42:40,897 --> 02:42:42,979
[SPEAKER_01]: over close to three years.

1001
02:42:43,279 --> 02:42:50,422
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not a lot of personnel, I think is sort of the point that I'm making.

1002
02:42:50,582 --> 02:42:55,285
[SPEAKER_11]: So we should not get excited that we're gonna be able to hire a bunch of counseling staff.

1003
02:42:55,985 --> 02:43:05,870
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like a big number, but even if we could hire all of them, the day that the grant money runs out, we'd have to fire them all or find something else to cut in our school budget to make up for it.

1004
02:43:05,990 --> 02:43:07,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are at present,

1005
02:43:07,757 --> 02:43:10,438
[SPEAKER_11]: have no capacity to add mental health counseling.

1006
02:43:10,798 --> 02:43:11,939
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no money for that, really.

1007
02:43:12,619 --> 02:43:24,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the $2.3 million is not a sustainable funding source for a significant number of additional staff over time.

1008
02:43:25,465 --> 02:43:26,545
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it's not that much money.

1009
02:43:26,945 --> 02:43:29,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, it's over a long period of time.

1010
02:43:29,707 --> 02:43:32,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And the point that you're making is that making

1011
02:43:34,215 --> 02:43:45,558
[SPEAKER_01]: charging reoccurring expenses like personnel to one time funds creates in effect a fiscal cliff that we get to a point in which we still need the Councilors, but we don't have the money.

1012
02:43:45,959 --> 02:43:54,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that doesn't mean we can't think about strategic investments to help bridge some of the gaps that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.

1013
02:43:55,229 --> 02:43:56,090
[SPEAKER_01]: with this funding.

1014
02:43:56,170 --> 02:44:01,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's the case that no portion of $2.3 million will go toward personnel.

1015
02:44:01,416 --> 02:44:02,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some will.

1016
02:44:02,578 --> 02:44:05,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think we have to be smart and strategic about how those investments are made.

1017
02:44:07,364 --> 02:44:07,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1018
02:44:09,566 --> 02:44:21,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, it's just the fixed costs that are going up as well that we have to cover on both the city and the school side that is gonna greatly be affected by, good or bad, the Biden bill.

1019
02:44:22,252 --> 02:44:24,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that the state legislature, Rep.

1020
02:44:24,453 --> 02:44:33,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Donato, Gabarly, and Barber are advocating for that charter school reimbursement to try to supplement that somehow for the city of Medford.

1021
02:44:33,558 --> 02:44:35,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're actively having meetings on that.

1022
02:44:36,317 --> 02:44:37,797
[SPEAKER_04]: my fingers crossed for that as well.

1023
02:44:38,617 --> 02:44:39,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

1024
02:44:41,718 --> 02:44:42,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1025
02:44:43,578 --> 02:45:00,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there, what I was hearing during that conversation was there was no process for supplemental budget should the, in the, you know, odd occasion that we are reallocated additional funds.

1026
02:45:00,542 --> 02:45:01,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that accurate?

1027
02:45:02,502 --> 02:45:02,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,

1028
02:45:03,424 --> 02:45:05,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say that there's no process for it.

1029
02:45:05,966 --> 02:45:13,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if the committee would like us to make a more comprehensive presentation on this, I think that would be a good idea.

1030
02:45:13,692 --> 02:45:27,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And to Mr. So's point, there would be nothing wrong with taking a vote to formally adopt the budget, including the supplemental portion that was made in September.

1031
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:49,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, this does not in any way, this next comment is not in any way to diminish that process, but it would be to some extent a formality due to the expenses that, as I said, existed in reality, but were not necessarily incorporated into the FY21 budget.

1032
02:45:50,477 --> 02:45:57,560
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some priorities that the committee could identify that could be rendered by that

1033
02:45:58,437 --> 02:46:12,928
[SPEAKER_01]: additional vote, but it would not be to the tune of over a million dollars because of the expenses that are baked into the budget and the need to have the financial runway to close the fiscal year.

1034
02:46:14,409 --> 02:46:16,610
[SPEAKER_05]: May I, Mayor, just respond?

1035
02:46:17,611 --> 02:46:18,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1036
02:46:18,732 --> 02:46:19,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1037
02:46:19,893 --> 02:46:21,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hear you.

1038
02:46:22,875 --> 02:46:28,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly, we were in need of that million dollars and more, and so I understand that

1039
02:46:28,732 --> 02:46:46,778
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there were expenses that were already there for that to be allocated towards, but, or, and to member Ruseau's point, our charge as school committee members is to approve a budget for the school and how the money that is allocated to us from the city is spent.

1040
02:46:47,558 --> 02:46:54,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the off occasion, in this extreme circumstance where there is an additional allocation,

1041
02:46:55,491 --> 02:47:11,364
[SPEAKER_05]: it seems to me there needs to be some process getting back again to that flow chart that we have a meeting to approve a supplemental budget before moving forward with any spending.

1042
02:47:11,384 --> 02:47:19,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think if the committee would like us to make a more comprehensive presentation, I don't think the administration would object to that in any way.

1043
02:47:19,750 --> 02:47:20,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that

1044
02:47:21,141 --> 02:47:29,488
[SPEAKER_01]: that the administration did brief the school committee in mid-September after this appropriation was made and did formally notify the committee of this additional funding that came in.

1045
02:47:30,189 --> 02:47:33,772
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say that the committee did not take any action at that time.

1046
02:47:34,212 --> 02:47:42,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the committee would like the administration to formulate recommendations or options, I don't think there would be any problem with that.

1047
02:47:42,679 --> 02:47:44,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly something that we could do going forward.

1048
02:47:48,164 --> 02:47:49,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin, are you done?

1049
02:47:50,862 --> 02:47:51,082
[SPEAKER_01]: for now.

1050
02:47:51,642 --> 02:47:53,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Van der Kloot and member Rousseau.

1051
02:47:54,404 --> 02:47:57,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I just wanted to thank Ms.

1052
02:47:57,386 --> 02:47:59,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Nunley for her presentation.

1053
02:47:59,747 --> 02:48:04,330
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was curious, Alicia, could you send this to us?

1054
02:48:05,491 --> 02:48:11,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Because there was a lot in it and a few things I'd really like to go back and take a look at more.

1055
02:48:11,715 --> 02:48:13,576
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, appreciate the report.

1056
02:48:13,656 --> 02:48:14,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Please send it to us.

1057
02:48:15,237 --> 02:48:19,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I will send it directly to the assistant superintendent of finance to provide to the school committee.

1058
02:48:19,579 --> 02:48:19,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1059
02:48:21,222 --> 02:48:21,802
[SPEAKER_12]: member Rousseau.

1060
02:48:24,504 --> 02:48:28,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I am about whether to have a actual supplemental budget or anything like that.

1061
02:48:28,367 --> 02:48:31,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to also there's an optics thing going on here.

1062
02:48:31,870 --> 02:48:34,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope everybody is aware.

1063
02:48:35,072 --> 02:48:40,335
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, last year we had a lot of conversation about whether it was a level funded or whether it was a cut.

1064
02:48:41,356 --> 02:48:45,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I think most school committee members will tell you that a level fund is a cut.

1065
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:46,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And

1066
02:48:48,250 --> 02:48:56,372
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if you're in finance and you're talking dollars, well, $1 is $1, but our budget was cut by $3.5 million.

1067
02:48:56,652 --> 02:49:09,294
[SPEAKER_11]: And the optics around whether we're gonna have another cut coming up and whether that is a $1 million cut or a $5 million cut, we need to be able to all agree what the real number is.

1068
02:49:09,835 --> 02:49:16,596
[SPEAKER_11]: So if people flip open the budget from last year and it's 62.5 million, it doesn't look good for the mayor.

1069
02:49:17,558 --> 02:49:27,740
[SPEAKER_11]: if really it was 63.5 million, because if we go to 63.5 million, well, that looks like we added a million.

1070
02:49:31,161 --> 02:49:34,962
[SPEAKER_11]: This coming year will be 63.5, 63.5 million, not 62.5 million.

1071
02:49:35,242 --> 02:49:45,545
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really do need to, as a committee and as a city council and everybody, frankly, needs to agree on, well, what was the number?

1072
02:49:46,887 --> 02:49:51,968
[SPEAKER_11]: That number is absolutely going to be a major talking point very, very soon.

1073
02:49:52,668 --> 02:49:59,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we're all talking with different numbers about what last year's budget was, it's not going to get, it's going to be, we're all going to get to be right.

1074
02:49:59,629 --> 02:50:01,510
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all going to say we increased the budget.

1075
02:50:02,510 --> 02:50:04,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Others of us will be able to say we cut the budget.

1076
02:50:04,810 --> 02:50:14,792
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a waste of time when we're actually supposed to be talking about what's in the budget and what's the effect of the budget, not whether the numbers really went up or down.

1077
02:50:15,636 --> 02:50:17,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I think it's an important point.

1078
02:50:17,918 --> 02:50:23,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care whether we get around to having a vote on an actual supplemental budget.

1079
02:50:23,221 --> 02:50:25,443
[SPEAKER_11]: The money came in, we knew it might come in.

1080
02:50:25,663 --> 02:50:29,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm super happy it came in and we can restore some staff.

1081
02:50:30,367 --> 02:50:33,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody disagrees with any of that stuff if I can assert that.

1082
02:50:34,129 --> 02:50:41,695
[SPEAKER_11]: But what that number is, is critically important that we cannot be disagreeing on by the time we get to the next budget.

1083
02:50:42,912 --> 02:50:55,682
[SPEAKER_12]: I think to be clear, the budget number was 61250000, and it went up by your supplemental appropriation to 62339537, and that would be a fact.

1084
02:50:56,323 --> 02:51:02,447
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that you had a budget, and then you had a supplemental appropriation to increase your budget, that is your budget number.

1085
02:51:02,668 --> 02:51:08,112
[SPEAKER_12]: So your number is that increased number, not the original vote, but the supplemental on top.

1086
02:51:09,133 --> 02:51:11,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And in addition to that, we also reprogram capital funds

1087
02:51:12,775 --> 02:51:16,216
[SPEAKER_12]: for you guys to use for any capital items that you needed.

1088
02:51:17,376 --> 02:51:24,718
[SPEAKER_12]: That was also in addition to the 2.6 that was allocated from the CARES Act.

1089
02:51:25,718 --> 02:51:27,879
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's important to see the whole picture.

1090
02:51:27,899 --> 02:51:40,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think even more so, and I'll try to make a point of doing this for the school committee, is showing you the actual costs that are on the city side that are the schools, like the Medicare, the workers' compensation,

1091
02:51:41,735 --> 02:51:43,700
[SPEAKER_12]: the health insurance, the dental.

1092
02:51:43,880 --> 02:51:49,132
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll try to break that out so you can see all pieces to make it really, really clear of how all the pieces actually work.

1093
02:51:50,125 --> 02:51:51,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1094
02:51:52,046 --> 02:51:55,047
[SPEAKER_04]: 53% of the city's budget, it does go to the schools.

1095
02:51:55,287 --> 02:51:56,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And when Ms.

1096
02:51:56,267 --> 02:52:04,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Patterson decided to do a 5% increase without the city's knowledge, that led to the three and a half million over level funding.

1097
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:10,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I argue that we did not cut the budget, but I can see what your point, Ms.

1098
02:52:10,373 --> 02:52:17,015
[SPEAKER_04]: DeRusso, a level funded budget seems like a cut budget when you talk about fixed costs that are going up every year.

1099
02:52:17,475 --> 02:52:18,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a tough one to swallow.

1100
02:52:20,112 --> 02:52:22,613
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tough situation we are once again facing.

1101
02:52:23,753 --> 02:52:24,794
[SPEAKER_11]: May I respond, Mayor?

1102
02:52:25,414 --> 02:52:26,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

1103
02:52:26,775 --> 02:52:27,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1104
02:52:28,315 --> 02:52:30,976
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a budget document that sits on the website.

1105
02:52:32,097 --> 02:52:39,460
[SPEAKER_11]: We can all figure and say what the budget is, the public, and frankly, I think most of us, flip open that document.

1106
02:52:39,720 --> 02:52:47,583
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the number, not the number that's in the, not in Excel, not the number that is in the finance software.

1107
02:52:48,020 --> 02:52:52,582
[SPEAKER_11]: The number is the number in black and white on the official budget document.

1108
02:52:53,102 --> 02:53:04,506
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're comparing ourselves to other communities, which I know I do all the time, and the public does it, and I think most of us in this meeting do it.

1109
02:53:05,166 --> 02:53:08,307
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a painfully apples and orange comparison.

1110
02:53:08,447 --> 02:53:11,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford Public Schools, we take care of our own buildings.

1111
02:53:11,288 --> 02:53:17,910
[SPEAKER_11]: In Somerville, the custodial services, all buildings, all utilities are completely on the city side.

1112
02:53:18,328 --> 02:53:31,156
[SPEAKER_11]: So somebody would look at the Somerville Public Schools budget, looking at that same document like we have, and they would make a very wild conclusion about spending in their schools compared to ours.

1113
02:53:31,616 --> 02:53:37,660
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just an unfortunate reality of the way Massachusetts does school funding.

1114
02:53:38,101 --> 02:53:47,867
[SPEAKER_11]: But my point is that the number that's on that document, that is the budget, not any number that you say, with all due respect, Ms.

1115
02:53:47,887 --> 02:53:48,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Nunley,

1116
02:53:49,060 --> 02:53:53,941
[SPEAKER_11]: The numbers that you named are numbers in accounting software.

1117
02:53:54,001 --> 02:53:59,242
[SPEAKER_11]: And unless we all in the public have the ability to just log in and look at them, those aren't the numbers.

1118
02:53:59,342 --> 02:54:00,763
[SPEAKER_11]: The numbers are the black and white numbers.

1119
02:54:00,783 --> 02:54:02,423
[SPEAKER_12]: My general ledger is a public record.

1120
02:54:02,703 --> 02:54:07,544
[SPEAKER_12]: It is audited by outside exterior accounts and it is supplemented by those votes.

1121
02:54:08,244 --> 02:54:10,825
[SPEAKER_12]: And my general ledger actually supersedes that budget book.

1122
02:54:11,588 --> 02:54:17,052
[SPEAKER_12]: So in law, when I get audited, that gets submitted up to the federal and the state and is audited.

1123
02:54:17,113 --> 02:54:20,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So my books are law, and I can submit the law to you on that.

1124
02:54:21,056 --> 02:54:23,518
[SPEAKER_11]: But so can you send me the URL so I can access them?

1125
02:54:23,918 --> 02:54:24,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1126
02:54:25,219 --> 02:54:31,985
[SPEAKER_12]: I can send you the report with the number, and I can also send you the URL to the law on my general ledger, on my books.

1127
02:54:32,045 --> 02:54:34,146
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean the URL to the general ledger.

1128
02:54:34,607 --> 02:54:38,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's an ERP system, so there's not going to be a URL into an ERP.

1129
02:54:38,550 --> 02:54:39,731
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can send you the report.

1130
02:54:41,078 --> 02:54:44,741
[SPEAKER_11]: the public wants to know that number randomly in the middle of the night next week.

1131
02:54:45,361 --> 02:54:46,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Where do they go to get it?

1132
02:54:46,682 --> 02:54:47,222
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't.

1133
02:54:47,503 --> 02:54:48,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we shared it.

1134
02:54:48,483 --> 02:54:50,284
[SPEAKER_12]: We did share it during the city council.

1135
02:54:50,345 --> 02:54:53,026
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's on the report that was provided to city council.

1136
02:54:53,527 --> 02:54:55,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I also provided a copy of that to the media.

1137
02:54:55,208 --> 02:54:57,970
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm also going to provide a copy of the presentation tonight to you.

1138
02:54:59,591 --> 02:55:01,852
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's also in the last slide.

1139
02:55:03,213 --> 02:55:06,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy, Member Van der Kloot, Member McLaughlin.

1140
02:55:06,796 --> 02:55:10,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just gonna say, I think that the point that's being made is that

1141
02:55:10,695 --> 02:55:16,417
[SPEAKER_01]: there needs to be consistency between the public facing documents and the official documents that Ms.

1142
02:55:16,637 --> 02:55:17,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Nunley is referring to.

1143
02:55:17,778 --> 02:55:21,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can work closely with the city to make sure that each of those numbers align.

1144
02:55:21,900 --> 02:55:34,805
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other point I would just add is that the million dollar supplement is just one component of why there is at times variability because there are, just as another example,

1145
02:55:35,430 --> 02:56:00,545
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the 2.3 million that we expect to flow in two different chunks for lack of a better term over the course of the spring, but then extend beyond the fiscal year, we were also notified, and I referenced this in the presentation at the last meeting, that DESE was allocating an additional, had a formula that produced an additional allocation for

1146
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:07,703
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID-related relief funds from the initial grant that we were up until January under the impression had been fully exhausted.

1147
02:56:08,083 --> 02:56:13,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another $216,000 variance that's come in.

1148
02:56:13,326 --> 02:56:24,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not, at least under these circumstances under which we're operating, uncommon to have those types of injections that, and so the budget is fluid in that sense.

1149
02:56:25,051 --> 02:56:28,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that takes away from Mr. Rousseau's point, or at least it's not intended to,

1150
02:56:29,117 --> 02:56:39,185
[SPEAKER_01]: that in order for the communication and understanding as to what the amount of funding that the district is using to operate, we need to make sure that we have as much consistency as possible.

1151
02:56:39,545 --> 02:56:56,138
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is not as simple as just making sure that Alicia sends me a document and I put it up on the website because there is that level of fluidity, particularly when the state and the federal government are swooping in at various points with funding that at times has certain restrictions on it.

1152
02:56:56,958 --> 02:56:59,740
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think consistency and clarity is the point.

1153
02:56:59,780 --> 02:57:01,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think, everyone's priority.

1154
02:57:01,641 --> 02:57:03,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something we can reaffirm our efforts on.

1155
02:57:05,404 --> 02:57:07,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1156
02:57:07,345 --> 02:57:08,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot, then Member McLaughlin.

1157
02:57:09,411 --> 02:57:32,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, well, Mr. Murphy just referenced this, but, and he said it would not necessarily solve the problem, but I can't, in order to address some of my colleagues' concerns, can we post where we have our budget, a page explaining additional funding was coming from the supplemental, and then, you know,

1158
02:57:34,454 --> 02:57:40,736
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, doing the addition or whatever and the final number, just to make it clear and to keep track.

1159
02:57:41,377 --> 02:57:41,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

1160
02:57:42,077 --> 02:57:42,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1161
02:57:42,257 --> 02:57:43,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important that we do.

1162
02:57:44,317 --> 02:57:44,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1163
02:57:44,778 --> 02:57:47,999
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could do that, I think that that would at least be a start.

1164
02:57:48,639 --> 02:57:54,881
[SPEAKER_01]: It may change at various points, because as I said, what I would have posted in January is not going to be the same as what we would post now.

1165
02:57:55,861 --> 02:58:00,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And to reference the federal legislation, it is conceivable that that number could change as a result of that.

1166
02:58:01,933 --> 02:58:09,055
[SPEAKER_01]: If it does, I hope there aren't too many restrictions on it, and I hope it's not time sensitive, but that is another potential variable.

1167
02:58:09,095 --> 02:58:17,958
[SPEAKER_15]: So clearly what you're expressing to us is it's a fluid situation so that when you post it, you can post it with that caveat as well.

1168
02:58:18,438 --> 02:58:23,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I would say is that means it's our obligation to update the postings as necessary.

1169
02:58:23,720 --> 02:58:29,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in any way suggesting that we shouldn't be as transparent as possible when these numbers change.

1170
02:58:29,262 --> 02:58:29,682
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that

1171
02:58:31,255 --> 02:58:33,796
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone should understand that it's it's not set in stone.

1172
02:58:34,276 --> 02:58:34,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1173
02:58:34,636 --> 02:58:35,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1174
02:58:37,556 --> 02:58:37,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1175
02:58:38,017 --> 02:58:38,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Van der Kloot.

1176
02:58:38,857 --> 02:58:39,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

1177
02:58:43,058 --> 02:58:43,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1178
02:58:44,078 --> 02:58:49,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also still looking for and maybe Mr. Murphy can help with this or my colleagues.

1179
02:58:49,459 --> 02:58:51,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also still looking for a process regarding this.

1180
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:52,960
[SPEAKER_05]: So I still want

1181
02:58:53,505 --> 02:59:00,287
[SPEAKER_05]: some process of when this happens in addition to, I think it's great to have in a budget addendum posted on our website.

1182
02:59:00,327 --> 02:59:01,367
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds good.

1183
02:59:02,328 --> 02:59:21,093
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that I want to see this at some sort of process in the budget flow chart or timeline for when this occurs, what the community and the school committee can expect that the process will be around the understanding and notification of

1184
02:59:22,679 --> 02:59:23,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Supplemental funding.

1185
02:59:24,641 --> 02:59:36,369
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to forward the vote when the city council votes the money to school committee or to the assistant superintendent finance to provide to the school committee to vote on how they want to put that in the budget.

1186
02:59:37,430 --> 02:59:48,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that type of formal communication would be helpful, but I do want to stress that the administration did immediately brief the school committee when this funding was appropriated.

1187
02:59:48,538 --> 02:59:52,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what I'm hearing is a desire for a more formalized process

1188
02:59:52,534 --> 02:59:59,598
[SPEAKER_01]: and to make sure that there is the adoption consistent with the sort of traditional adoption process that occurs in the spring.

1189
02:59:59,918 --> 03:00:01,499
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is smart.

1190
03:00:01,779 --> 03:00:02,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important.

1191
03:00:02,940 --> 03:00:05,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's necessary from a clarity perspective.

1192
03:00:06,141 --> 03:00:17,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want anyone who only hears a strand of this conversation under the impression that the city council appropriated a million dollars and the administration stuck it in a drawer somewhere because that is not what happened in September.

1193
03:00:18,701 --> 03:00:20,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Fully understand that, Mr. Murphy.

1194
03:00:20,145 --> 03:00:20,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1195
03:00:20,546 --> 03:00:21,028
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're right.

1196
03:00:21,088 --> 03:00:22,973
[SPEAKER_05]: A formalization of the process would be helpful.

1197
03:00:23,033 --> 03:00:23,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1198
03:00:23,415 --> 03:00:24,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1199
03:00:25,119 --> 03:00:25,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1200
03:00:29,540 --> 03:00:32,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Alicia, for your presentation.

1201
03:00:32,422 --> 03:00:53,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to sort of close out the conversation around the supplemental appropriation, I think one of the most valuable parts of the budget process for the community, and I know for myself, is that's the opportunity where we say, we're gonna hire a middle school health teacher, for example.

1202
03:00:54,504 --> 03:00:57,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And that person, that headcount is in the budget.

1203
03:00:57,786 --> 03:01:00,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we know what to look forward to the next year.

1204
03:01:00,628 --> 03:01:08,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think we should get a full accounting of the budget's plan for that million dollars plus.

1205
03:01:09,233 --> 03:01:14,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Not because I disagree with or I anticipate disagreeing with how you

1206
03:01:15,317 --> 03:01:30,682
[SPEAKER_02]: have spent it because as you said the reality of the positions we needed versus the positions we could afford to pay for before that amount of money in in the form of teachers, aids, etc like the, that reality.

1207
03:01:32,022 --> 03:01:34,664
[SPEAKER_02]: was just exactly that.

1208
03:01:34,724 --> 03:01:35,664
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a reality.

1209
03:01:35,984 --> 03:01:51,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And further, the money came so very late in the cycle that I am completely comfortable that you all had to put teachers in place to start the year literally within days of the appropriation.

1210
03:01:53,879 --> 03:02:23,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think that it's a matter of feeling like there's discretionary money in there, but I do think it's worth the time to say, this allowed us to reinstate four elementary school teachers, three middle school teachers, two high school teachers, whatever, because to us, to the community, to the kids who have those teachers, they don't know that those teachers weren't gonna be there had that money not come through.

1211
03:02:24,069 --> 03:02:24,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1212
03:02:24,390 --> 03:02:25,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you all know that.

1213
03:02:25,631 --> 03:02:33,018
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's really important for the community to know just how, you know, just exactly how that happened.

1214
03:02:33,138 --> 03:02:35,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think that is important.

1215
03:02:35,400 --> 03:02:47,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think to make sure that the community is clear that you have the support of this committee, we should take an official vote to make sure that that can live as part of the

1216
03:02:48,490 --> 03:02:49,671
[SPEAKER_02]: the overall documents.

1217
03:02:49,731 --> 03:02:52,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy to make a motion if that's necessary.

1218
03:02:53,812 --> 03:02:57,534
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just want to put it on a future agenda, I'm fine with that as well.

1219
03:02:57,954 --> 03:03:13,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that is really important when it comes to people understanding the situation as it unfolded in real time, how that has translated across the year, and to establish an important baseline for the next discussions of the budget.

1220
03:03:16,247 --> 03:03:19,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Superintendent, do you want me to make a motion or do you want to just provide that accounting?

1221
03:03:21,952 --> 03:03:29,938
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if you make the motion, are you stating that you're going to accept what has already gone forward or you still would like an additional presentation?

1222
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:34,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like a presentation so that we can vote on it.

1223
03:03:34,682 --> 03:03:36,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what we would be voting on.

1224
03:03:36,784 --> 03:03:38,025
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll definitely get a presentation.

1225
03:03:38,145 --> 03:03:40,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made it very clear.

1226
03:03:41,268 --> 03:03:42,849
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely going to get a presentation.

1227
03:03:42,929 --> 03:03:44,170
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get an itemization.

1228
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:48,062
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll do our best to flesh that out.

1229
03:03:48,523 --> 03:04:02,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather just commit now to a comprehensive presentation that you would frankly need anyway, because as was referenced earlier, it's the starting point for FY, or one of the many starting points for FY 22.

1230
03:04:03,713 --> 03:04:08,777
[SPEAKER_01]: The other caveat that I would put on that is that we're at a place in the fiscal year, Ms.

1231
03:04:08,797 --> 03:04:13,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Nunley referenced the freeze on non-emergency spending that the city has imposed.

1232
03:04:13,513 --> 03:04:19,218
[SPEAKER_01]: The district has also imposed a freeze on non-essential spending.

1233
03:04:19,738 --> 03:04:38,414
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means essentially is it's not a complete freeze on all spending, but all administrators and department heads have been notified that any spending, including any hiring of personnel at this point, will be subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny prior to the approval of any purchase orders.

1234
03:04:38,614 --> 03:04:42,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is not because we are expecting

1235
03:04:43,071 --> 03:04:57,179
[SPEAKER_01]: any type of crisis as we close out the fiscal year, but it is because we've gotten to a place in the fiscal year in which we have a responsibility to have a heightened vigilance with regard to our financial position.

1236
03:04:57,819 --> 03:05:04,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be reflected in where that funding currently sits and where it stands.

1237
03:05:05,244 --> 03:05:09,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the committee should just be aware of that prior to us coming in, because if we come in and say,

1238
03:05:10,717 --> 03:05:21,161
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 750, I don't know that this is the exact number, but if we say there's 700,000, 750,000 remaining from that million after we restored positions, I don't think it's that much.

1239
03:05:21,782 --> 03:05:36,828
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we go in and say that, it may be the case that that's the 700,000 that we need to bridge all other gaps and have the funding necessary in order to close out the fiscal year without getting too close to being in the negative, which we're not allowed to do.

1240
03:05:38,364 --> 03:05:49,336
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of fluidity at this point in the fiscal year, which is why, depending on the level of concern, that sort of determines the sort of tightness of the freeze, if you will.

1241
03:05:50,016 --> 03:05:55,462
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, we're at the point where it's not a complete freeze, but it's a non-emergency spending freeze.

1242
03:05:57,224 --> 03:05:57,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1243
03:05:59,102 --> 03:06:00,863
[SPEAKER_02]: That I think that would be helpful.

1244
03:06:00,963 --> 03:06:20,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I do think as a committee, we should take a vote to formally approve those numbers so that they can be posted to the website and there can be no mistake about the committee support or lack of, but I don't anticipate that personally support for the supplemental budget.

1245
03:06:20,995 --> 03:06:22,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be really helpful.

1246
03:06:22,255 --> 03:06:25,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it would be important for the reasons that you've stated.

1247
03:06:26,398 --> 03:06:28,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And I promise this is the last caveat that I will add,

1248
03:06:29,043 --> 03:06:48,042
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the time that we presented on the supplemental appropriation in September, you may recall that there was a significant number of personnel question marks as we began to, as we continued to implement the hybrid learning plan and as we sifted through some of the personnel challenges that were coming up as a result of the pandemic.

1249
03:06:48,901 --> 03:06:51,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those question marks resulted in additional costs.

1250
03:06:52,025 --> 03:06:56,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those question marks just have lingered throughout the entire school year.

1251
03:06:56,689 --> 03:07:09,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a real sort of personnel heavy focus on some of that conversation in for members of the community who might be wondering, well, why is the committee not voting to adopt this until March, potentially.

1252
03:07:10,379 --> 03:07:19,183
[SPEAKER_01]: that is reflective of the sort of uncertainty and additional fluidity, both in terms of how much money would flow in and what types of costs there might be.

1253
03:07:19,503 --> 03:07:38,290
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a significant, I don't wanna go into too much detail about this, but like we had a not insignificant adjustment that occurred today as a result of various like pandemic related personnel changes that isn't frankly uncommon, but it would have an impact on the types of numbers that we're talking about here.

1254
03:07:39,091 --> 03:07:47,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just that just happened to that that's just is indicative of what sort of the day to day life is like in operating this type of budget with this many variables in a pandemic.

1255
03:07:47,863 --> 03:07:50,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise that's the last thing I'll say until I

1256
03:07:51,950 --> 03:07:52,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm muting you.

1257
03:07:54,111 --> 03:07:54,811
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ms.

1258
03:07:54,831 --> 03:07:56,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Nunley, I had a couple of other questions for you.

1259
03:07:58,432 --> 03:08:09,975
[SPEAKER_02]: You referenced being able to provide information to us around costs that are incurred by the city that are reflective of schools.

1260
03:08:10,075 --> 03:08:13,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And my question for you is, are you planning to do that for all departments?

1261
03:08:13,996 --> 03:08:17,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would not want to see you do that only for the school department and not

1262
03:08:18,457 --> 03:08:29,324
[SPEAKER_02]: do an equal allocation out of those costs to all departments, because that will kind of skew the look of those costs.

1263
03:08:29,344 --> 03:08:33,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So either you're going to do it, or I don't want you to do it special for us.

1264
03:08:35,087 --> 03:08:37,428
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're not going to do it for the rest of the city's department.

1265
03:08:37,448 --> 03:08:43,471
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean we do it we do it for enterprise fund which is separate and then they have indirect costs so we break those out.

1266
03:08:43,671 --> 03:08:56,297
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important for the school committee to see those costs so that they understand that those are on the city side so when you see those increases we don't just think okay we're increasing the city side but we're cutting the school.

1267
03:08:56,798 --> 03:08:57,718
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not the case.

1268
03:08:58,879 --> 03:09:03,261
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's a seven percent you know increase to school health insurance

1269
03:09:03,803 --> 03:09:10,712
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be stated it's a 7% increase to school health insurance, not 7% we took from the schools and we gave to the city.

1270
03:09:10,753 --> 03:09:12,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's really important for the public.

1271
03:09:13,056 --> 03:09:15,279
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's really important for the school committee to see that.

1272
03:09:17,737 --> 03:09:31,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I am fine with that as long as that 7% increase, which is going to be applied to the police department, the fire department, the department of public works and all the other departments in the city that hold staff, that same increase would happen across the board.

1273
03:09:31,339 --> 03:09:46,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So all I'm asking is that if we're going to provide that level of information that we do so in a collectively objective way and that we don't cherry pick out

1274
03:09:47,322 --> 03:09:56,425
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff for the schools that we are not cherry picking out to all the other organizations because that has the potential.

1275
03:09:56,526 --> 03:10:02,488
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just confused if you could just clarify there's a city side budget and a school budget and I think but all I'm trying to do is show

1276
03:10:03,648 --> 03:10:07,990
[SPEAKER_12]: what is in the city's budget that applies to schools, because the schools have its own.

1277
03:10:08,371 --> 03:10:19,856
[SPEAKER_12]: If I was to take all the costs that were in the budget and put it to the schools, when they do their chapter 70 calculation, it would actually give less funding to the schools.

1278
03:10:20,236 --> 03:10:26,119
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason why, but I think it's important for the- I know, that's not what I'm saying.

1279
03:10:26,179 --> 03:10:30,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I am saying is, when you talk about the school as a department,

1280
03:10:33,031 --> 03:10:43,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not unlike talking about any other department in the city in terms of every department brings forward a budget and the community watches those budgets and they watch the numbers.

1281
03:10:43,400 --> 03:10:44,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they go up?

1282
03:10:44,081 --> 03:10:44,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they go down?

1283
03:10:45,542 --> 03:10:58,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I'm saying is if you're gonna present that information as money for the schools, which it certainly is, we just need to make sure that we're having a rounded discussion about that so that the money for the schools for health insurance is,

1284
03:10:59,534 --> 03:11:12,804
[SPEAKER_02]: is identified for whatever it is for the employees who are here, but then that comparable money for the city's employees, whatever they are, it is talked about in the same way.

1285
03:11:13,064 --> 03:11:13,544
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1286
03:11:13,905 --> 03:11:16,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I don't want people getting something and then

1287
03:11:20,229 --> 03:11:46,098
[SPEAKER_02]: other departments are or aren't like there's health insurance across every department in the city because everyone who has employees incurs health insurance and that is paid for by the the sort of city's general line items so if you're going to break out city line items i just want to make sure that we're really breaking it out and we're not just sort of tagging it to school because that to me that causes other problems and how we talk about this

1288
03:11:46,218 --> 03:11:50,940
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it would be like, for instance, 18 million is health insurance, 12 is the school, 6 is the city.

1289
03:11:51,061 --> 03:11:52,481
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be the type of breakdown.

1290
03:11:53,102 --> 03:11:54,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, city versus school.

1291
03:11:55,163 --> 03:12:01,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So $17,223,842 went to the school's health insurance.

1292
03:12:01,126 --> 03:12:04,668
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 81% of health insurance, where the city side is 19%.

1293
03:12:05,628 --> 03:12:12,271
[SPEAKER_04]: We break it down from city and school, not by city department and school department, because you have special ed, you have

1294
03:12:14,284 --> 03:12:15,485
[SPEAKER_04]: maintenance.

1295
03:12:15,545 --> 03:12:17,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do city and school.

1296
03:12:17,726 --> 03:12:20,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't have Alicia breaking it down every single department.

1297
03:12:21,027 --> 03:12:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would take far too long.

1298
03:12:23,448 --> 03:12:32,772
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as there's some way to understand and rationalize those numbers, like the city, the school, right, has more employees, which is why those numbers are higher.

1299
03:12:33,753 --> 03:12:40,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as there's just a way for somebody to reasonably look at the information and say, I understand what this is telling me, I'm fine with that.

1300
03:12:40,936 --> 03:12:42,617
[SPEAKER_02]: What I don't want to see is us

1301
03:12:44,384 --> 03:13:00,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Throwing numbers back and forth in a way that confuses that confuses the discussion about whether the city's appropriation to the schools, increased or decreased I feel like that number, like I feel like when we start talking about but we pay for other things.

1302
03:13:00,837 --> 03:13:02,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's always to.

1303
03:13:03,499 --> 03:13:08,022
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of demonstrate that that appropriation is not the only thing that comes to the school.

1304
03:13:08,062 --> 03:13:08,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's true.

1305
03:13:09,442 --> 03:13:14,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's true for every department that gets an amount of money in their budget from the school.

1306
03:13:14,145 --> 03:13:18,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure we're talking about apples and apples.

1307
03:13:18,427 --> 03:13:23,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about that appropriation, we all can just be clear about what's in, what's not in.

1308
03:13:25,291 --> 03:13:29,172
[SPEAKER_02]: what that number is, what it is not, and did it go up, did it go down, or did it stay the same?

1309
03:13:29,212 --> 03:13:32,514
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be no debate about that information.

1310
03:13:33,314 --> 03:13:46,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we sort of alluded to, when we talk about the school budget, a disproportionate amount of the school budget, perhaps unlike many other departments in the city, is based on personnel.

1311
03:13:46,879 --> 03:13:49,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Those costs go up every year by contract.

1312
03:13:50,400 --> 03:13:53,341
[SPEAKER_02]: But like 90% of our budget is personnel oriented.

1313
03:13:53,381 --> 03:14:08,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about increases or decreases, that affects real people in the school department in a way that is not necessarily the case in any other sort of budget.

1314
03:14:08,604 --> 03:14:12,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually there's a little bit more non-personnel charges in a budget, right?

1315
03:14:13,925 --> 03:14:18,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something very unique about what we pay for in our budget.

1316
03:14:19,606 --> 03:14:30,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we talk about increases, decreases, et cetera, we are talking about people positions disproportionately than maybe people generally expect.

1317
03:14:31,069 --> 03:14:33,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure that we're doing

1318
03:14:34,290 --> 03:14:37,513
[SPEAKER_02]: our part on the school side to have a more clear and transparent budget.

1319
03:14:37,553 --> 03:14:44,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys did a fabulous job on the city side last year and really sort of changing the professionalism and the look of the budget.

1320
03:14:44,338 --> 03:14:45,199
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very clear.

1321
03:14:45,719 --> 03:14:46,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I want us to do the same.

1322
03:14:46,900 --> 03:15:02,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I want us to be really transparent about our revolving accounts and our grant funding and the CARES Act stuff I think is a great example of all the grant funding that we receive from various sources, it all has rules.

1323
03:15:04,194 --> 03:15:31,922
[SPEAKER_02]: while we're getting 2.3 million dollars for the next couple years we just had a discussion about how that's it's really not a viable funding source to add Councilors because those are people and they have ongoing recurring costs so I just want to make sure particularly as the conversation starts to unfold about the budget that we can be clear about the fact that the people in Medford public schools who service our students are part of

1324
03:15:32,502 --> 03:15:49,272
[SPEAKER_02]: The budget that is served by the city's appropriation the grant funds that are being issued to us via for purposes of like pandemic mitigation have strings and we should just be clear about what they are and how we've spent them and Mr. Murphy did a presentation.

1325
03:15:49,832 --> 03:16:12,388
[SPEAKER_02]: last time so that there can just be no confusion about but we got more money like if that money doesn't come without sort of strings we have to on you know we we can't spend it if we're not honoring the the intent of that money so I just want to be really clear so that we're not confusing the community about like what does this extra money mean does this extra money mean we could have hired

1326
03:16:13,108 --> 03:16:15,491
[SPEAKER_02]: a teacher to do something, yes or no.

1327
03:16:16,432 --> 03:16:17,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to be super clear about that.

1328
03:16:18,014 --> 03:16:29,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my last question is, when will the school department expect to receive the city's appropriation number for us to be able to start our budgeting process?

1329
03:16:30,687 --> 03:16:37,854
[SPEAKER_12]: So we haven't given a definitive number because we didn't want to give you a really, really low number, not knowing what the Biden administration is doing.

1330
03:16:37,994 --> 03:16:39,496
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been watching that.

1331
03:16:39,876 --> 03:16:45,221
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully, fingers crossed, in the next few weeks, they'll have something.

1332
03:16:45,282 --> 03:16:46,503
[SPEAKER_12]: We're hoping the Fed will.

1333
03:16:47,524 --> 03:16:48,285
[SPEAKER_12]: If they don't,

1334
03:16:49,986 --> 03:16:54,591
[SPEAKER_12]: We will meet with the school administration and discuss numbers.

1335
03:16:54,811 --> 03:16:59,336
[SPEAKER_12]: But as of right now, as I told you, $5 to $8 million deficit is what we're looking at.

1336
03:17:00,317 --> 03:17:02,079
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no way around it.

1337
03:17:02,119 --> 03:17:09,326
[SPEAKER_12]: If we don't get any more federal funding, we're in another bad position for fiscal year 22.

1338
03:17:10,655 --> 03:17:19,301
[SPEAKER_12]: But from what we're hearing, Biden has said he wants to give money to cities and towns, just can they agree, settle it, and how's that gonna look?

1339
03:17:20,041 --> 03:17:24,084
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, it's just too fluid, so we don't have a definitive number as of right now.

1340
03:17:24,564 --> 03:17:29,267
[SPEAKER_12]: But as soon as we do, we will definitely let the school administration know.

1341
03:17:30,568 --> 03:17:38,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there a sort of a date where you will say, we don't have a number and we have to move forward with our budget planning?

1342
03:17:39,841 --> 03:17:41,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and I'd have a discussion with the mayor on that.

1343
03:17:41,662 --> 03:17:44,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Or I'd let the mayor make that call.

1344
03:17:46,364 --> 03:17:50,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that decision hasn't been made yet, is what you're saying?

1345
03:17:51,226 --> 03:17:53,847
[SPEAKER_12]: No, because we're still waiting for the Fed.

1346
03:17:54,167 --> 03:17:57,468
[SPEAKER_12]: So we haven't made an ultimate timeline.

1347
03:17:57,508 --> 03:17:57,968
[SPEAKER_12]: This is it.

1348
03:17:58,789 --> 03:18:00,509
[SPEAKER_12]: We're waiting right now, hopefully.

1349
03:18:00,529 --> 03:18:04,151
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't wanna be too quick to draw and then something changes.

1350
03:18:04,171 --> 03:18:07,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanna give a really good number.

1351
03:18:08,295 --> 03:18:08,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1352
03:18:08,555 --> 03:18:16,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And the scenario and the five to eight million, some of the lower end of that is without increases.

1353
03:18:16,162 --> 03:18:20,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking more towards the eight plus budget gap.

1354
03:18:20,125 --> 03:18:23,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So what Biden has proposed could cover that.

1355
03:18:23,688 --> 03:18:26,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hearing it come as soon as the end of March.

1356
03:18:27,330 --> 03:18:40,368
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am hesitant to start either budget until we, at least until the end of March, because that is, I don't know where we will find $8 million to cut.

1357
03:18:43,118 --> 03:19:06,013
[SPEAKER_04]: just we've already turned over all the rocks here so definitely not um okay that that's helpful just to know like are we talking about a week a month or whatever okay thank you the last i've heard is by the end of march they're expecting it and just my fingers across and as soon as we hear something we will let school committee and city council know great thank you may i remember graham is there a motion on the floor mayor no

1358
03:19:07,591 --> 03:19:19,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just to get accounting for the 1 million, which I would expect within the next month, month and a half, Mr. Murphy, but there's no motion.

1359
03:19:19,700 --> 03:19:26,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we trust that we will get that in one of the next, one of the two or three upcoming school committee meetings.

1360
03:19:26,626 --> 03:19:33,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's the next one or the one after that, depending on what else you have on the agenda would be my expectation.

1361
03:19:34,172 --> 03:19:36,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can certainly, we can provide just,

1362
03:19:37,977 --> 03:19:43,842
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a detailed analysis of it and writing even before that, so that you can, you know, be prepared for the conversation as well.

1363
03:19:43,862 --> 03:19:46,824
[SPEAKER_01]: That wouldn't necessarily have to wait till the presentation, I don't think.

1364
03:19:47,865 --> 03:19:48,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1365
03:19:48,325 --> 03:19:48,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot?

1366
03:19:49,486 --> 03:19:51,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, again, I'd like to thank Ms.

1367
03:19:51,688 --> 03:19:56,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Nunley, and I'd like to make a motion to accept their report and put it on file.

1368
03:19:57,332 --> 03:19:59,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive in place on file by Member Van der Kloot.

1369
03:19:59,914 --> 03:20:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor?

1370
03:20:00,655 --> 03:20:01,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

1371
03:20:02,316 --> 03:20:05,499
[SPEAKER_11]: We have not received the report, so I don't know how we can receive it and place it on file.

1372
03:20:06,127 --> 03:20:07,828
[SPEAKER_15]: We did, well, we received the report.

1373
03:20:08,749 --> 03:20:13,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not seen the report other than the presentation that was displayed on screen.

1374
03:20:13,852 --> 03:20:16,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and in our conversation, I did ask Ms.

1375
03:20:16,833 --> 03:20:23,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Nunley to send it to us, which I trust she will, but it is typical that you receive a report and place it on file.

1376
03:20:25,699 --> 03:20:28,400
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I don't have any reason to...

1377
03:20:30,437 --> 03:20:33,659
[SPEAKER_15]: not think that this presentation then counts.

1378
03:20:34,079 --> 03:20:43,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul, it's the way that you move on the conversation when we don't have another motion to approve.

1379
03:20:44,505 --> 03:20:46,826
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the way that we end the discussion and move on.

1380
03:20:47,947 --> 03:20:51,289
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, I mean, there was a lot of numbers and a lot of

1381
03:20:51,862 --> 03:20:58,247
[SPEAKER_11]: slides that were excellent and I would dig into, and I would have spent hours digging into them before the meeting if I had them.

1382
03:20:58,847 --> 03:21:06,953
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, unless we want to have this presentation done again at the next meeting, I need to see this thing before I can vote to accept it.

1383
03:21:07,473 --> 03:21:09,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you've made your motion, so.

1384
03:21:10,587 --> 03:21:14,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'll make the motion to say, I mean, Ms.

1385
03:21:14,129 --> 03:21:24,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Nunley already said to me that she was going to supply to us, but I make a motion that the director, the city director of finance supply to the school committee, a copy of her report.

1386
03:21:27,195 --> 03:21:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, motion on the floor by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member Kreatz, roll call.

1387
03:21:36,400 --> 03:21:36,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

1388
03:21:38,248 --> 03:21:38,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1389
03:21:39,348 --> 03:21:39,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz.

1390
03:21:40,409 --> 03:21:40,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1391
03:21:41,670 --> 03:21:42,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1392
03:21:44,511 --> 03:21:44,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ms.

1393
03:21:44,871 --> 03:21:45,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Stone.

1394
03:21:45,431 --> 03:21:45,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1395
03:21:46,712 --> 03:21:47,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

1396
03:21:48,192 --> 03:21:48,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1397
03:21:49,393 --> 03:21:50,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot.

1398
03:21:50,413 --> 03:21:50,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1399
03:21:52,014 --> 03:21:52,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1400
03:21:53,115 --> 03:21:54,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1401
03:21:56,576 --> 03:21:57,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion is approved.

1402
03:21:57,897 --> 03:21:59,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, thank you, Ms.

1403
03:21:59,797 --> 03:22:00,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Nunley-Benjamin.

1404
03:22:00,838 --> 03:22:03,219
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate the presentation and the update.

1405
03:22:03,299 --> 03:22:03,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1406
03:22:03,759 --> 03:22:04,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been sent.

1407
03:22:05,020 --> 03:22:05,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1408
03:22:06,007 --> 03:22:08,110
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do a money dance to the feds.

1409
03:22:10,133 --> 03:22:10,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1410
03:22:11,134 --> 03:22:12,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1411
03:22:12,416 --> 03:22:20,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four, we have a report on Medford's selection as one of four participating districts for the Massachusetts Family School Partnership Initiative.

1412
03:22:21,288 --> 03:22:23,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Desi, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.

1413
03:22:24,679 --> 03:22:34,087
[SPEAKER_13]: This was just to formally announce that back in January, on January 26, we submitted an application.

1414
03:22:35,328 --> 03:22:46,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin helped and worked with the district saying, let's take our chance to pursue the Massachusetts Family School Partnership initiative.

1415
03:22:47,297 --> 03:22:50,740
[SPEAKER_13]: And this was something that was offered for the entire Commonwealth.

1416
03:22:51,540 --> 03:22:57,666
[SPEAKER_13]: and we were really pleasantly surprised that Medford was selected for this opportunity.

1417
03:22:58,326 --> 03:23:15,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is an opportunity to work with the school to look at family and school partnerships initiatives working collaboratively with DESE and that they will

1418
03:23:16,233 --> 03:23:35,756
[SPEAKER_13]: work with a tactical team, a small group of administrators, parents, possibly 10 to 12 people to say how can we further improve our school and family partnerships as a district.

1419
03:23:38,043 --> 03:23:49,835
[SPEAKER_13]: They particularly asked for team members from special education, English learners, a community partner, student support staff.

1420
03:23:50,676 --> 03:23:57,462
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of the work that we have prioritized working with our most vulnerable, but

1421
03:23:59,090 --> 03:24:16,619
[SPEAKER_13]: being part of this collaborative with DESE where they would support us with professional development and coaching and additional training to help us as a district to further promote our family school partnerships.

1422
03:24:17,139 --> 03:24:27,245
[SPEAKER_13]: So this was just to notify the school committee that we were one of four districts that was selected for this year to participate in the initiative.

1423
03:24:28,005 --> 03:24:33,166
[SPEAKER_13]: and as additional information becomes available we will definitely share it with the committee.

1424
03:24:35,427 --> 03:24:35,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor.

1425
03:24:37,647 --> 03:24:39,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

1426
03:24:39,208 --> 03:24:39,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot.

1427
03:24:40,908 --> 03:24:46,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes so first I want to thank my colleague Melanie McLaughlin for bringing this to our attention.

1428
03:24:46,750 --> 03:24:48,010
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there was a phone call

1429
03:24:48,606 --> 03:25:00,470
[SPEAKER_15]: a couple of days afterwards and I know I was on it and Melanie was on it and in fact took a, you know, participated and Dr. Edouard-Vincent was on it as well.

1430
03:25:01,330 --> 03:25:06,171
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that probably really helped that you both were there.

1431
03:25:06,491 --> 03:25:18,215
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just, I don't know exactly, is there a dollar amount attached to this or is it more in terms of hours of training or how is it stipulated?

1432
03:25:19,348 --> 03:25:20,069
[SPEAKER_15]: member McLaughlin.

1433
03:25:20,309 --> 03:25:22,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and then member McLaughlin.

1434
03:25:22,971 --> 03:25:24,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I give the floor to member McLaughlin.

1435
03:25:24,472 --> 03:25:24,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1436
03:25:26,773 --> 03:25:30,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Firstly, I want to say thank you so much for being open to the opportunity.

1437
03:25:30,075 --> 03:25:32,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a really exciting opportunity for Medford.

1438
03:25:33,197 --> 03:25:38,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will have an orientation with DESE on Thursday, the 26th.

1439
03:25:38,821 --> 03:25:40,902
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be finding out more.

1440
03:25:40,942 --> 03:25:44,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be an announcement of the four districts that were selected.

1441
03:25:45,981 --> 03:25:57,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's primarily going to be an understanding of some frameworks and some training and a look at best practices and implementation and strategy.

1442
03:25:58,307 --> 03:26:02,949
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will be hearing more and can report more out after the orientation on the 26th.

1443
03:26:03,149 --> 03:26:08,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1444
03:26:11,833 --> 03:26:12,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sorry.

1445
03:26:12,554 --> 03:26:15,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Just filling my water up, sorry.

1446
03:26:17,367 --> 03:26:18,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van de Kloop?

1447
03:26:19,777 --> 03:26:20,841
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm done.

1448
03:26:20,861 --> 03:26:21,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, thank you.

1449
03:26:22,206 --> 03:26:22,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

1450
03:26:24,609 --> 03:26:26,070
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really exciting.

1451
03:26:26,090 --> 03:26:28,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for doing the work to get this in.

1452
03:26:28,952 --> 03:26:38,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how the group that they will work with will be formed, but I would just like to ask that at least one member of this committee is included in the working group.

1453
03:26:39,577 --> 03:26:50,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the visibility for the committee to have into some of this work is really important when we talk about connecting to the community and

1454
03:26:52,023 --> 03:27:03,493
[SPEAKER_02]: you know certainly budgetary questions that come when you start talking about really formalizing systems and structures that would be needed to support enhancing our communication protocols.

1455
03:27:03,553 --> 03:27:11,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So any you know I don't know exactly what the makeup of the committee is but I would just want to make sure that there is some representation from the school committee.

1456
03:27:11,779 --> 03:27:14,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes member member McLaughlin has

1457
03:27:16,935 --> 03:27:20,799
[SPEAKER_13]: definitely actively been involved in this process.

1458
03:27:21,099 --> 03:27:35,113
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to confirm and work with some of the administrators and the different stakeholder groups, but many of the stakeholder groups are the populations that we did identify as our most vulnerable.

1459
03:27:35,914 --> 03:27:59,258
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to respond to member Van der Kloot's question about the cost, we're not technically receiving a monetary amount, but the training, the coaching, you know, access to DESE personnel, that's, everything is kind of being covered by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Ed.

1460
03:27:59,933 --> 03:28:19,014
[SPEAKER_13]: So it won't be a hard number, but again, how we quantify the training and the mentoring and the professional development, I'm sure it will be valued at a significant amount of, if we could come up with a number, it would be substantial.

1461
03:28:19,634 --> 03:28:23,315
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I think it's an honor for us.

1462
03:28:23,755 --> 03:28:29,257
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't sure that we were going to have a chance because we are a much smaller district.

1463
03:28:30,037 --> 03:28:38,160
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was just assuming that the larger districts probably would be given the benefit of the doubt.

1464
03:28:38,480 --> 03:28:47,683
[SPEAKER_13]: So I, again, want to also just extend a special thank you to Member McLaughlin, who reached out last month and said we should

1465
03:28:49,897 --> 03:28:53,700
[SPEAKER_13]: take a chance and give it a try to see if we have a chance.

1466
03:28:53,980 --> 03:28:57,102
[SPEAKER_13]: And thankfully it worked out for Medford.

1467
03:28:57,202 --> 03:29:12,593
[SPEAKER_13]: So I look forward to updating the committee about as we get more information, but updating you on the progress and the training and you know, what Desi will be offering to us.

1468
03:29:12,693 --> 03:29:16,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause we won't know until we start going to the information sessions.

1469
03:29:17,557 --> 03:29:17,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1470
03:29:20,650 --> 03:29:20,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1471
03:29:20,910 --> 03:29:21,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

1472
03:29:21,771 --> 03:29:24,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member.

1473
03:29:24,453 --> 03:29:24,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1474
03:29:25,694 --> 03:29:27,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

1475
03:29:30,238 --> 03:29:31,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1476
03:29:31,619 --> 03:29:31,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1477
03:29:32,980 --> 03:29:33,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Katz.

1478
03:29:34,061 --> 03:29:34,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1479
03:29:35,422 --> 03:29:36,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1480
03:29:39,286 --> 03:29:40,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

1481
03:29:40,527 --> 03:29:40,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1482
03:29:41,908 --> 03:29:42,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

1483
03:29:43,569 --> 03:29:43,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1484
03:29:44,830 --> 03:29:45,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot.

1485
03:29:46,031 --> 03:29:46,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1486
03:29:47,032 --> 03:29:47,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1487
03:29:48,428 --> 03:29:50,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven, the affirmative, zero, and the negative.

1488
03:29:50,109 --> 03:29:51,129
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

1489
03:29:52,390 --> 03:29:56,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Number eight, we have old business, which I don't believe we have any.

1490
03:29:57,212 --> 03:29:59,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Number nine, communications.

1491
03:30:00,934 --> 03:30:05,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And then number 10 is new business, and we have one resolution offered by myself.

1492
03:30:06,177 --> 03:30:17,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the administration provide to the Medford School Committee an update on progress toward renovation and upgrades to the two Medford High School student restrooms as contemplated

1493
03:30:17,792 --> 03:30:22,293
[SPEAKER_04]: by previous allocations of funding and direction by the school committee.

1494
03:30:23,073 --> 03:30:47,397
[SPEAKER_04]: We had further resolved that the administration be prepared to provide an update related to these projects at the next regular scheduled meeting of the Medford School Committee on March 8th, 2021 to determine what if any portion of the September 2020 capital improvement appropriation should be directed toward the advancement of these projects as well as adding additional bathroom upgrades to the list to be complete on or before the start of the next school year.

1495
03:30:49,217 --> 03:30:50,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I put this on the agenda.

1496
03:30:50,279 --> 03:30:53,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we voted on this probably almost a year ago.

1497
03:30:53,803 --> 03:31:00,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And since that time, we had a number of upgrades that we've done to all of our schools.

1498
03:31:01,553 --> 03:31:05,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Four and a half million has been put in to get our kids and teachers safely back to school.

1499
03:31:05,718 --> 03:31:10,161
[SPEAKER_04]: and part of that was HVAC and fans and windows and HEPA filters.

1500
03:31:10,561 --> 03:31:22,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that building and grounds have been very busy, but I wanted this to be put on because I think the restroom projects are extremely important and where we were able to use CARES funding for all the other work.

1501
03:31:23,388 --> 03:31:33,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's the 816,000, which we need to do a few things with, but once we figure out cost estimates for the security upgrades and the boiler,

1502
03:31:35,305 --> 03:31:43,631
[SPEAKER_04]: really hope that we could do more than two bathrooms at the high school, because I know they sorely are in need of renovation and upgrading.

1503
03:31:43,811 --> 03:31:45,693
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard that for quite some time.

1504
03:31:45,753 --> 03:31:50,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thank Mr. McLaughlin for being on tonight and kind of giving us an update.

1505
03:31:51,277 --> 03:31:54,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I know member Kreatz has the building and grounds subcommittee.

1506
03:31:54,880 --> 03:32:00,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of this work obviously will flow through that, but I just think it's important the committee talk about that 816,000 in depth so that we can

1507
03:32:03,473 --> 03:32:06,815
[SPEAKER_04]: work on getting that spent on much needed improvements in our district.

1508
03:32:08,176 --> 03:32:08,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

1509
03:32:11,839 --> 03:32:12,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1510
03:32:12,279 --> 03:32:28,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you, is there any indication of, um, I know it might be, you know, sort of digging down into the details a little bit early, but I'm wondering if there's any indication of which bathrooms I'm specifically thinking of, um, the bathroom that the public uses whenever they come into the high school facility.

1511
03:32:29,375 --> 03:32:31,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also an accessible bathroom.

1512
03:32:31,477 --> 03:32:47,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And every single time I go into that bathroom or I bring my children into that bathroom, I cringe and I think about all of the community that is one of their first introductions, frankly, to our school, that bathroom right in the entrance way.

1513
03:32:47,629 --> 03:32:53,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm wondering, is there any priority list for which bathrooms would be renovated first?

1514
03:32:58,030 --> 03:33:08,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, I'm really concerned to make sure we get them done this summer while our students are not in and before the start of the school year, but I can pass it off to Mr. McLaughlin if you have any updates on that and then member crops.

1515
03:33:12,880 --> 03:33:16,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, good evening, Mayor and School Committee and Superintendent.

1516
03:33:17,623 --> 03:33:24,067
[SPEAKER_09]: We did make the choice that we were going to do two second floor bathrooms at the guidance suite.

1517
03:33:25,969 --> 03:33:34,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Our original pricing came in a little bit more than we expected, so procurement had me hire an architect

1518
03:33:35,555 --> 03:33:42,442
[SPEAKER_09]: at which we do have the plans and the specs that are ready to go out for pricing information.

1519
03:33:42,942 --> 03:33:58,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would assume that it would be a vote of the school committee to send that forth, the specs and the plans to get pricing on the two bathrooms next to the second floor guidance suite.

1520
03:34:06,482 --> 03:34:06,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1521
03:34:07,103 --> 03:34:07,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz.

1522
03:34:12,247 --> 03:34:13,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1523
03:34:13,428 --> 03:34:13,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1524
03:34:13,709 --> 03:34:18,153
[SPEAKER_14]: So I actually have a building and ground subcommittee meeting scheduled for next week.

1525
03:34:19,013 --> 03:34:21,336
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were going to have this on the agenda.

1526
03:34:21,416 --> 03:34:23,838
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I saw it as a resolution on tonight's meeting.

1527
03:34:24,450 --> 03:34:46,097
[SPEAKER_14]: So before tonight's meeting, John and I, he had sent me the specs and I believe everything is ready to go over to or for us to take a vote to send it over to procurement so they can send it to the specs to go out for bid so that

1528
03:34:47,397 --> 03:34:53,438
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, we can get the cost and then we'll know more about how many bathrooms we would be able to do.

1529
03:34:54,819 --> 03:35:06,121
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not sure, you know, I was thinking that maybe this evening, we would take a vote to send the RFP, like the specs out to go out for RFP this evening.

1530
03:35:10,122 --> 03:35:10,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

1531
03:35:14,978 --> 03:35:15,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1532
03:35:15,658 --> 03:35:18,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.

1533
03:35:18,900 --> 03:35:24,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm fine with taking a vote or making a motion to take a vote to send out an RFP.

1534
03:35:25,444 --> 03:35:40,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I would just like it on the record that I think that that bathroom should be a priority for bathrooms that we're doing, especially with it being an accessible bathroom and meeting ADA compliance as well.

1535
03:35:42,102 --> 03:35:43,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just put that out there as well.

1536
03:35:43,883 --> 03:35:50,466
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm happy to make a motion to move this to an RFP for bathroom renewal, if I can have a second.

1537
03:35:51,887 --> 03:36:00,811
[SPEAKER_04]: My only question on the RFP is if we're able to do more than two and put it up out to bid for two bathrooms and with the 816,000, we're able to do more than that.

1538
03:36:00,971 --> 03:36:04,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure we can capitalize on how many we can do.

1539
03:36:04,693 --> 03:36:05,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

1540
03:36:11,862 --> 03:36:14,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just had a couple questions.

1541
03:36:16,103 --> 03:36:29,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's always customary to see the specs or the designs before you would send it out to RFP, and I just wondered if the original resolution was to do this at the next meeting, which would afford time for

1542
03:36:30,228 --> 03:36:35,270
[SPEAKER_02]: us to see like whatever it is that the architect has come up with.

1543
03:36:35,630 --> 03:36:37,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be helpful.

1544
03:36:37,650 --> 03:36:51,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess the other question that I have about the $816,000 is, it sounds like Mayor, you're suggesting we spend more money on bathrooms, but we still haven't had a capital planning meeting.

1545
03:36:52,114 --> 03:36:53,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm concerned that

1546
03:36:54,195 --> 03:37:10,938
[SPEAKER_02]: there are other capital needs that should super, we should do the bathrooms too, in my opinion, but if there's only $816,000, are we sure that that's the best spend of that $816,000 or are there capital needs that are more pressing that we should be focused on?

1547
03:37:10,998 --> 03:37:22,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I would just also not want us to commit to spending that money until we have that capital improvement planning discussion

1548
03:37:23,740 --> 03:37:26,102
[SPEAKER_02]: to know what other expenses are ahead of us.

1549
03:37:28,944 --> 03:37:30,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We could call one next week.

1550
03:37:30,325 --> 03:37:41,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Mr. Murphy, you have like three projects plus the potential ADA accessibility improvements in the front entrance that I think are the four projects that we could use for this 816.

1551
03:37:42,094 --> 03:37:44,016
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know how you want to handle that.

1552
03:37:44,036 --> 03:37:46,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it makes sense to

1553
03:37:47,950 --> 03:37:50,552
[SPEAKER_01]: present it in as comprehensive a format as possible.

1554
03:37:50,692 --> 03:38:03,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if the committee has specific priorities that they would like the administration to move forward on it, I think certainly we'd want that direction and I'd encourage you to take that vote.

1555
03:38:04,143 --> 03:38:17,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure voting on a specific RFP based on a bathroom, I could see a situation in which that would potentially

1556
03:38:17,568 --> 03:38:30,338
[SPEAKER_01]: hinder the administration's flexibility to issue those RFPs as necessary, which I don't think would be an intended precedent, but that might be, I think, something that would be worth taking that into account.

1557
03:38:30,438 --> 03:38:42,447
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't, I think that if the committee would like to see the specifications on this particular project first, I think that's something that is, I think was mentioned, it's already been provided to the subcommittee.

1558
03:38:42,467 --> 03:38:45,229
[SPEAKER_01]: We can certainly circulate that to the broader

1559
03:38:46,344 --> 03:38:47,064
[SPEAKER_01]: to the full committee.

1560
03:38:48,625 --> 03:38:49,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one piece.

1561
03:38:50,726 --> 03:39:12,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we could, I'm pretty sure we'd be able to issue the RFPs with the necessary flexibility to make sure that we, even if we had issued two, frankly, that we could receive potential proposals, both with the flexibility of doing more than one set of bathrooms and the ones that were previously identified on the second floor.

1562
03:39:13,317 --> 03:39:14,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could do that.

1563
03:39:14,117 --> 03:39:15,658
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that would be a reason I would say that

1564
03:39:16,612 --> 03:39:25,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the committee's given what it believes to be sufficient direction to the administration, we should begin issuing those so as to not wait any longer than is necessary.

1565
03:39:25,658 --> 03:39:28,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to the final point, yes, I think it would be good

1566
03:39:29,320 --> 03:39:34,484
[SPEAKER_01]: if we presented the list of some of the capital priorities that we see as most pressing.

1567
03:39:34,944 --> 03:39:48,814
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason the 816 is still intact, frankly, and this may sound like it echoes the conversation related to the Chapter 70 supplement, is because we initially intended to use that for emergency measures related to the pandemic.

1568
03:39:49,815 --> 03:39:55,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Our access to the CARES funding based on what the state was saying was eligible criteria was expanded.

1569
03:39:56,372 --> 03:39:58,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up using more CARES funding.

1570
03:39:58,174 --> 03:40:05,580
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, the 816 is still there, but I do think a comprehensive articulation of those priorities would be in the committee's interest.

1571
03:40:05,600 --> 03:40:06,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can prepare that.

1572
03:40:07,722 --> 03:40:16,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike the itemization of the million, if we had more than a week on the capital articulation, I think that would probably make it for a more detailed presentation.

1573
03:40:19,351 --> 03:40:21,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1574
03:40:23,385 --> 03:40:29,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can withdraw the motion for that information, if we can have it between now and the next school committee meeting.

1575
03:40:30,147 --> 03:40:39,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I would ask also on any ADA compliance or accessibility issues that are there, that those are shared as well, please.

1576
03:40:41,830 --> 03:40:42,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1577
03:40:43,571 --> 03:40:47,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be clear, that's shared as part of that articulation of the capital priorities?

1578
03:40:47,552 --> 03:40:47,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1579
03:40:48,132 --> 03:40:48,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

1580
03:40:54,567 --> 03:41:08,475
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess, Mayor, the one thing I, is there any, is it the position of the committee that you'd like us to hold off on issuing the RFPs related to the restrooms until you've had a chance to take a vote?

1581
03:41:08,515 --> 03:41:11,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with those specifications having already been shared,

1582
03:41:13,004 --> 03:41:24,731
[SPEAKER_01]: My inclination would be to get the RFPs out as quickly as possible, understanding the need for the flexibility that if there's the capacity to do more than the original set of bathrooms, then we'd wanna try to maintain that flexibility if possible.

1583
03:41:24,751 --> 03:41:32,836
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that's the direction the committee wants us to provide, just because of the timeline that gets attached to these, I'd rather get the RFPs out.

1584
03:41:32,936 --> 03:41:37,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's still room and time for us to articulate the broader set of priorities.

1585
03:41:39,231 --> 03:41:42,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm interested in moving the process forward.

1586
03:41:42,933 --> 03:41:46,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know it was at that stage when I inquired a couple of weeks ago.

1587
03:41:46,616 --> 03:41:51,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought it kind of fell to the wayside because of all the HVAC improvements that were getting done.

1588
03:41:52,539 --> 03:41:56,001
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sense that all we've done is get quotes.

1589
03:41:56,081 --> 03:42:04,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we've done, and Mr. McLaughlin spoke to this, his work with procurement has put us in a position where we're now ready to issue the RFPs.

1590
03:42:06,177 --> 03:42:11,202
[SPEAKER_01]: lack of moving forward on the funding as a result of being mindful of the pandemic related expenses.

1591
03:42:12,943 --> 03:42:13,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

1592
03:42:15,406 --> 03:42:20,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's not my sense that you need our approval to issue an RFP.

1593
03:42:20,671 --> 03:42:21,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?

1594
03:42:22,052 --> 03:42:22,452
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be.

1595
03:42:22,492 --> 03:42:28,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that precedent of needing to issue an RFP, so I would be hesitant to adopt that precedent now.

1596
03:42:28,838 --> 03:42:29,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1597
03:42:30,623 --> 03:42:44,951
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to require a vote based on a set of specs that I haven't seen, I'm not gonna be in a position to say yes, but I also am perfectly fine if there is no need for a vote to get you to issue an RFP.

1598
03:42:45,071 --> 03:42:46,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally fine with that too.

1599
03:42:46,512 --> 03:42:47,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still like to see the specs.

1600
03:42:48,753 --> 03:42:50,254
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't been provided to me.

1601
03:42:50,374 --> 03:42:54,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I've just fell off the email or if there are others.

1602
03:42:54,096 --> 03:42:55,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to see the specs.

1603
03:42:56,457 --> 03:43:03,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't personally need to vote on having you issue an RFP because I feel like that's regular course of business for the administration.

1604
03:43:03,182 --> 03:43:05,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.

1605
03:43:06,344 --> 03:43:21,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we'll need to call a capital improvement plan meeting, especially as it relates to the 816,000 so that we can get a better idea of what needs those four projects that need to be done and if there's any extra to do additional work.

1606
03:43:22,854 --> 03:43:23,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz?

1607
03:43:24,472 --> 03:43:27,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I have the specs that John forwarded to me.

1608
03:43:27,735 --> 03:43:31,778
[SPEAKER_14]: I can share them with Susie and she can send them to everybody.

1609
03:43:31,798 --> 03:43:32,859
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be great.

1610
03:43:33,559 --> 03:43:34,120
Yep, thanks.

1611
03:43:35,661 --> 03:43:45,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so which can just amend this resolution to call a capital improvement plan meeting to especially discuss the 816,000.

1612
03:43:45,109 --> 03:43:48,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion for approval?

1613
03:43:51,761 --> 03:43:52,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved.

1614
03:43:52,982 --> 03:43:54,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot seconded by.

1615
03:43:54,463 --> 03:43:54,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1616
03:43:55,844 --> 03:43:56,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz, roll call.

1617
03:44:00,768 --> 03:44:01,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1618
03:44:02,069 --> 03:44:02,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1619
03:44:04,151 --> 03:44:05,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

1620
03:44:06,333 --> 03:44:06,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1621
03:44:07,714 --> 03:44:11,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1622
03:44:11,497 --> 03:44:12,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

1623
03:44:12,537 --> 03:44:12,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1624
03:44:13,738 --> 03:44:14,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

1625
03:44:15,540 --> 03:44:15,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1626
03:44:16,681 --> 03:44:17,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot.

1627
03:44:18,202 --> 03:44:18,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1628
03:44:20,003 --> 03:44:20,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1629
03:44:21,056 --> 03:44:23,658
