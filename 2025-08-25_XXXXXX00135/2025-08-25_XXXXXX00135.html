    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=149.664">Lots</a>  of progression in your participation on the podcast, but I know you've answered this question before, but a vitally important question to the podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=158.07">What</a>  is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=162.198">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=162.998">So</a>  that, you know, I thought about that and I'm like, well, you know, Goldilocks is always a good pick, but I know, but then I thought, well, you know, I think I said that last time and it's still, it's still up there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=176.224">Um,</a>  but I thought maybe this time I would give a plug to the farmer's market. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=181.726">Um,</a>  because I love going to the farmer's market. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=186.168">Um,</a>  they, you can get empanadas, you can get samosas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=191.909">you</a>  can get really delicious cupcakes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=194.551">Um,</a>  these are all the things I like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=196.272">I</a>  love the bread that you can get there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=199.093">Um,</a>  and, and, you know, you can, you can just put, put together a dinner from these awesome vendors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=206.738">Um,</a>  grab a nice loaf of bread, grab a nice hunk of cheese, get a nice fresh tomato and like have a picnic or something, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=217.324">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=217.884">And,</a>  and that's right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=219.445">And</a>  they, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=222.26">They</a>  take snap too, so that's also a plus.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=231.187">Yeah,</a>  my kids are very picky, but they could polish off a full baguette from that bread place any time of week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=239.993">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=240.233">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=242.025">I</a>  know we're here mostly to talk about your campaign for City Council, and people may know your name from other things, like especially charter review over the years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=252.273">But</a>  I'm curious to hear, also you had a child who ran for City Council a few years ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=257.697">I'm</a>  curious to hear kind of how you arrived at this moment and kind of what has motivated you to run.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=271.677">You</a>  know, sort of been a person, always been a hard worker. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=278.663">I</a>  kind of got my work ethic from my mom, who is an Italian immigrant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=283.467">She</a>  came to the United States in the 1950s at the age of 27. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=286.63">And</a>  it was kind of a culture shock for her, because the first time she had experienced running water, electricity, and heat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=295.817">So</a>  being raised by her and my Italian heritage and my experience as the daughter of a working class immigrant contributes to sort of who I am today and who I've sort of become and my views on the importance of tolerance and listening and empathy and kindness. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=316.33">I</a>  also like to get things done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=319.712">And</a>  a few years ago, I decided that I'd been hearing about charter review in Medford for too long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=325.307">And</a>  that it was time to get it done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=328.389">So.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=328.769">In</a>  2021, I sort of tried to rally people together, and we started this group, or we sort of continue to group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=337.954">I</a>  mean, I was connecting with Jim Silva at that point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=341.456">He</a>  had been very involved with charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=344.323">Um,</a>  in previous iterations, or the attempts to get charter review to happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=349.604">Um,</a>  so we sort of revived the Medford charter review coalition, and we were pursuing different ways to get a charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=357.246">And</a>  1 of those was. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=358.947">To</a>  ask the mayor to form a committee, because what we learned was that most communities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=365.168">Review</a>  their charters that way using. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=369.57">a</a>  special act, which is what Medford ended up doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=373.032">So</a>  the mayor said, yes, I will form a committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=375.213">And</a>  I was honored to be appointed as a co-chair initially. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=379.675">And</a>  then Laurel Siegel, the other co-chair, left and I became the sole chair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=385.998">And</a>  we went from about 2022 to 2024, which you know, because you were on the committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=391.561">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=394.291">And</a>  we, yeah, so we dove into all things charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=397.813">So,</a>  um, and I know we'll be talking probably about that more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=402.255">But</a>  it was basically my experience on the committee learning about local government, listening and talking to residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=410.698">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=411.899">All</a>  of it just was, you know, it was inspirational and inspired me to stay involved with the city council run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=419.643">I'd</a>  like to just sort of continue that work and bring that level of research and depth and listening to work on the city council.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=430.426">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=430.806">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=431.427">And</a>  I, you know, having witnessed a lot of your work and in some part of it, like, I think that was, it was a huge undertaking and it did involve a lot of like, deep research and also involvement with the community and hearing what people think and trying to like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=449.532">interpret</a>  that and make that into a charter that felt like it represented all that we learned. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=455.496">I'm</a>  wondering for you, so like you kind of started that description out with like why like equity and empathy and like belonging are important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=464.202">How</a>  does that to you, like how does that connect to the importance of a charter?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=470.006">Well,</a>  in the charter is the sort of foundational document for the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=476.431">And</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=478.49">It</a>  involves sort of how people are represented. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=481.613">And</a>  what sort of, because it's a structure of the government and so representation was 1 of the big things that we talked about and Medford being 1 of the only cities left in the state. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=498.167">For</a>  a long time, it's been one of the only cities that doesn't have board representation for particularly city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=506.071">I</a>  feel like that addresses some of what you just talked about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=511.413">Not</a>  only because it allows people a more localized representative, it also creates more accessibility for running for office. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=525.798">So,</a>  you know, the, the hope is that when this charter passes, which I'm very much hoping that it doesn't November by 2027, we will have that new structure in place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=538.767">And</a>  that could open doors for a lot, a lot more people to run for office that maybe couldn't do it or wouldn't have considered it before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=547.673">And</a>  we heard some of that, you know, we heard that from some people in the listening sessions we did around the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=553.617">Um,</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=555.177">You</a>  know, some people said, oh, well, maybe if there was ward representation, I'd run for office.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=560.981">Because</a>  that would mean you're only running against your ward, not the whole city, which is how it currently is.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=566.706">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=567.006">And</a>  covering, I mean, there's about 60,000 people in the city, and the wards are about 7,000 to 8,000 people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=579.281">That's</a>  a huge difference in terms of mailings, in terms of canvassing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=586.123">I</a>  mean, all that sort of work of campaigning, and it's a pretty big difference. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=593.364">So</a>  that's one thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=595.905">Also,</a>  the other thing, when we looked at Article 8, the citizen participation mechanisms, would hopefully give people more opportunity to be involved <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=608.897">in</a>  government respond to issues, um, maybe, um, have the opportunity to be able to get something on the ballot if they sort of tried to go through, um, the local government and they didn't and they couldn't do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=624.648">They</a>  have a mechanism to use where they can make that happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=628.21">Um,</a>  so those things, I think also, um, I mean, if you're talking specifically about sort of equity and representation and things like that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=639.559">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I mean, I know, at least for myself, there is a lot that I learned just about how the, how our local government operates and other options for how it could operate under a different charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=649.123">And</a>  so I wonder if, if elected, if there were any things that you'd look at sort of changing about the way that the city operates in terms of like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=658.748">Yeah,</a>  or just like any sort of critiques or things that you would hope for, we'd be like, priorities for change.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=663.47">So,</a>  I mean, you know, there's definitely people talked a lot about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=669.468">how</a>  long the council meetings are, and I know that the council is aware of that, and I know it's something that they're already thinking about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=679.917">But</a>  that's one thing in terms of just operations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=687.143">There's</a>  so many issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=690.125">Zoning</a>  is what people are talking about right now quite a lot, and that's definitely something that we need to change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=699.006">We</a>  need to redo the zoning for because we need more housing we need and we need to increase our tax base. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=706.812">So,</a>  I think that is definitely a change that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=711.415">I</a>  think it's, I think it's going to happen so much work on it has already been done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=715.478">And</a>  at this point, the good news is, I think that that people are really aware of it now more than they have been in the past. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=725.525">So</a>  it gives people an opportunity to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=728.435">uh,</a>  offer really constructive, specific feedback and so that we can move forward with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=734.238">Um,</a>  cause I think that's important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=736.539">Um,</a>  there's also a lot of really important work to be done, um, like with, uh, uh, funding the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=744.504">Um,</a>  the board just recently released a really great action plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=748.286">Um,</a>  and part of that is a community land trust, which is also something that I really support. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=754.269">And,</a>  um, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=756.528">hope</a>  that that can evolve. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=758.97">That's</a>  where this community land trust sort of becomes a non-profit that holds land to benefit the public basically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=768.235">And</a>  so it's affordable housing units that aren't going to go away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=774.787">I</a>  think traffic calming is kind of something that I would like to see change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=780.191">Um,</a>  and that's important, um, especially with the, um, you know, this eventual change in rezoning and things like that traffic is increasing anyway. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=791.278">Um,</a>  so I think, um, and I know that that's been worked on, like the street where I near where I live, they just put speed tables on and it's making a huge difference, but, um, bump outs, things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=805.484">I</a>  think we need to look at all those things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=808.745">Um,</a>  I think climate resiliency is really important and our city's done a really good job at that so far, but we need to just like, keep on that and make sure that the benchmarks in the climate action adaptation plan are being met. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=821.889">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=823.369">But,</a>  you know, some of them I'd like to even see increase, like, I'd like to see even more people use the curbside composting program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=830.772">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=832.412">The</a>  community increase in the tree canopy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=835.898">Um,</a>  and and there's a lot of really great ideas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=839.699">I</a>  loved some of the ideas I've heard from fellow candidates. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=842.92">Like,</a>  when I listened to Miranda on your show, she was talking about more benches and shelters at teas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=849.542">And</a>  I just, yeah, I think that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=851.702">I</a>  love that idea. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=852.503">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=854.478">Another</a>  thing that I would really like to see happen is I'd like to see an arts coordinator at City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=862.801">I've</a>  talked to people in the arts community and we have so many great arts organizations in the city, but we don't have, we have the Arts Council, but there's not really a central kind of unifying anchor at City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=879.306">And</a>  I think that would, I think that could be really good for the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=885.174">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=885.574">So</a>  those are just some of the things.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=887.435">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=888.575">So</a>  when I hear and see people kind of talking about who they would vote for in the municipal elections, there's always this idea of people voting for folks that are with our revolution and that a lot of people may be voting for those candidates exclusively. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=907.743">I'm</a>  hearing, though, a lot of your points seem very similar to theirs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=911.064">And</a>  so I guess I'm wondering, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=913.587">you</a>  made the decision not to be part of our revolution or if there's or if you sort of see yourself in a different like in a different space as those folks.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=922.998">I</a>  mean, you know, 1 of the 1 of the reasons was because I, I entered the race on the way side. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=929.723">So,</a>  you know, that was a practical reason. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=934.007">But</a>  I also, I tend, I feel like I just tend to be sort of an independent minded person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=939.911">I</a>  do happen to align with a lot of the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=945.215">Policy</a>  ideas, but I also. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=948.999">I,</a>  you know, I, yeah, I just, I consider myself independent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=953.931">So,</a>  I mean, it wasn't like... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=956.971">Like</a>  I said, it wasn't so much of a tough decision because of the point at which I entered the race kind of made the decision for me anyway. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=964.677">So,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=968.48">I</a>  think that sometimes when folks are trying to understand, obviously it's not a partisan race, but that when people are trying to understand where people sit politically, that's an easy way to know that about somebody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=982.871">So</a>  it's helpful to hear <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=984.973">higher</a>  thinking about these issues and that you agree with, you know, kind of more progressive ideas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=990.038">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=992.601">Are</a>  there any other points, like any other campaign points you want to mention or any important issues that you want us to know about?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1000.556">Well,</a>  one of the other things that I would really like to work on, um, if elected is the creation of an LGBTQ plus commission for the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1010.923">Um,</a>  I know that the council's working to overhaul the human rights commission, and I think that's great, but, um, you know, other cities have LGBTQ plus commissions, um, in Arlington it's called the rainbow commission and I'm a little partial to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1027.935">And</a>  I like that name, but, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1031.362">I</a>  think that that that would be an important step. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1036.686">In</a>  the city towards sort of promoting equality visibility for our LGBT plus community and empowerment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1046.492">And</a>  I, I see that work as maybe separate from what. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1050.615">You</a>  know, or separate or enhancing and what might be done on the human rights commission. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1056.819">So</a>  I think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1058.792">You</a>  know, there's different commissions in other cities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1063.835">They</a>  do cool programming, obviously pride, but, you know, I think we don't have to limit things to just June. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1072.92">I</a>  think an LGBTQ plus commission would be a year round endeavor and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1080.6">whatever</a>  the commission worked on, but the sort of, it would be focused around the mission statement, obviously, but they could look at policies, programs, advocacy, um, community conversations, community buildings, crosswalk painting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1097.567">I</a>  mean, there's just so many, um, you know, so many options. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1100.688">So</a>  I, I would like to see that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1102.768">I</a>  think that would be, um, a pretty great thing for the city.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1107.819">That's</a>  not something that I've heard of and it makes a lot of sense and Medford is a it seems to be a great place for that because there are a lot of a lot of us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1116.269">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1119.732">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1120.073">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1120.714">Any</a>  like any ways people can get involved in your campaign or any events that you're having that you want to mention?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1125.599">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1127.888">I</a>  am having a couple of events with music, because I love music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1134.455">I</a>  love to sing, but I love music, and I have musicians in my family. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1139.544">make</a>  sense for me to bring music into my campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1142.306">So</a>  on, and they're both going to be at Mrs. Murphy's, which is an Irish pub on Salem Street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1149.669">It's</a>  I believe 25 Salem Street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1152.751">On</a>  August 29th, which is a Friday from six to eight, we're going to have Celtic music with Alistair White, who's a great fiddler and Eric McDonald on guitar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1165.018">Alistair</a>  used to play in the Battlefield Band, which if anybody out there knows Celtic music knows that that's a pretty big name in Celtic music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1173.026">And</a>  he's a, you know, he's a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1176.153">Scottish</a>  guy and he really knows the tradition. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1179.734">So</a>  that's going to be a really fun night of music and networking and etc. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1186.156">And</a>  on September 7th from 3 to 5 p.m. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1191.057">we'll</a>  have the Shereen Klezmer duo. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1193.498">And</a>  for people who aren't familiar with Klezmer music, it's really fun music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1198.779">It's</a>  basically Eastern European Jewish folk music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1202.541">Um,</a>  it's very, it's very fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1205.944">So,</a>  um, and both of those, uh, events, I will be there to meet people, talk to people about my platform, et cetera. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1213.75">Um,</a>  people will be able to order off the menu, um, and just have a great evening and afternoon and, uh, learn about the campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1222.317">So</a>  those are the two events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1225.299">Um,</a>  there's probably going to be other house parties too in the works, but those are the main things right now.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J72AsQbfoDaD1bM6vQcOR?t=1232.343">And</a>  a good excuse to go to Mrs. Murphy's.</p>
