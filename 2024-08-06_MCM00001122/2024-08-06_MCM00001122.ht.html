 Apre sa, dapre dispozisyon Chapit 20 Lwa 2021 yo, reyinyon Komisyon Istorik Vil Medford sa a pral fèt adistans.
 Manm piblik ki vle patisipe nan reyinyon an ka fè sa atravè lyen Zoom yo bay sou ajanda a.
 Yo p ap pèmèt piblik la patisipe an pèsòn, epi piblik la pral sèlman kapab patisipe nan nenpòt odyans piblik pandan reyinyon sa a a distans.
 Oke, kriz la te rezoud epi tout moun te antre nan.
 Oke, mwen pral kòmanse ak ajanda nou an.
 Peter Hedlund, bonjou epi akeyi, mwen wè ou la.
 Se konsa, nou mete ou an premye, kidonk poukisa nou pa kòmanse avèk ou?
 Mwen panse ke nou pral mache nan Thomas Brooks Park.
 Mwen pral kite ou okipe li soti isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

 Ou pa pral kapab fè sa jiskaske sit la fin vann nèt.
 Men, mwen te panse menm bagay la, Jen, epi mwen idantifye ak yon lòt egzanp ke nou te wè.

 Mwen panse ke nou tout gen enkyetid pou tout bagay ap grandi sou flè jòn kouvri nan fèy oswa lòt plant natif natal.
 Èske depatman pak vil la ka soti epi fè kèk antretyen chak ane?
 Mwen vle di, li mande anpil efò pou yo netwaye ak netwaye
 Asire w ke bagay yo pa twò gwo oswa kache, oswa jis pèmèt plant yo toujou jwe yon wòl enpòtan nan kreye diferan espas sa yo nan pak la.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon karakteristik enpòtan yo kenbe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1834.285s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mwen definitivman panse ke nou ta ka mande DPW a sou sa.
 Natirèlman nou te pale ak yo tou.
 Yo ale la pou koupe zèb elatriye.
 Se konsa, mwen definitivman panse sa a, epi li pa sèlman nou, dwa?
 Gen lòt pwojè pak ki finanse pa CCP atravè vil la.
 Gen yon kalite antretyen ki bezwen fè ki pa ka itilize ak CPC.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke li se,
 Nou bezwen kalkile sa, e mwen panse ke pral gen yon diskisyon pi laj sou bidjè vil la ak ki jan kèk nan antretyen an rive yon fwa pwogram CPC a antre nan jwèt paske fon CPC pa ka itilize pou antretyen.
 Pou egzanp, nou te gen menm konvèsasyon an sou Brooks Manor.
 Se konsa, mwen santi tankou wi, nou dwe rezoud pwoblèm nan nan vil sa a yon jan kanmenm.
 Mwen konnen, nan yon pwen, te gen yon gwoup zanmi ak kèk vwazen ap pale.
 Se konsa, pou egzanp, nan Brooks Manor, nou fè yon netwayaj prentan ak yon netwayaj otòn.
 Petèt gen yon bagay pou di isit la pou kèk nan vwazen yo.
 Lè sa a, ou ale deyò epi netwaye zòn nan yon fwa chak ane oswa yon bagay tankou sa.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1925.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hey, se sèl pwoblèm mwen, men mwen vrèman renmen jan tout bagay mache.
 Se konsa, wi, trè byen fè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1932.39s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Wi, mwen vle di, mwen panse, mwen pa konnen, ou mesye di m sa ou panse, men opinyon mwen se nou pa ta dwe, nou ta dwe pran pwòp desizyon nou.
 Nan yon fason, mwen pa vle enkyete sou antretyen pandan ke nou kalkile li, men nou pa ta dwe kite li mete nan chemen desizyon nou an, oswa petèt nou ta dwe, mwen pa konnen, mwen ta enterese tande sa lòt moun gen pou di.
 Douglas, ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1955.86s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Wi.
 Mwen renmen lide ke kominote pak la gen yon kalite enterè nan, ou konnen, ap eseye ankouraje sa a an komen ak achte nan tout pak la, mwen devine.
 Li evidan ou pa ka fòse li, men li ta bèl si vwazen yo ki santi tankou yo posede pak la ta ka fè plis pase sa yo aktyèlman fè, tankou ou te di, ale la yon fwa chak ane epi ede yon ti kras, paske jan nou konnen, vil la toujou ap lite ak antretyen.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon gwo etap pi devan.
 Mwen te vrèman renmen sa mwen te wè.
 Mwen renmen lide yon toune istorik paske evidamman,
 Nan toude direksyon, pi devan ak dèyè, si w ap soti nan nò ale nan sid oswa vise vèrsa.
 Mwen gen yon kesyon rapid.
 Mwen te vle gen yon egzibisyon fotografi nan kòmansman an.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se antre ki pi nò a, prèske sou pon an, epi li sanble ak yon espas nan miray la.
 Èske sa pa diferan de pasaj pou pyeton an sou bò nò a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2011.958s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Oke, wi.
 Foto sa a nan miray la kase se sou Canyon Road.
 Wi, pral gen yon seri poz pandan w ap mache.
 An reyalite, gen youn isit la, mwatye nan mòn lan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2031.04s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Pyè, raple m ke se pa tout kote yo bezwen aksesib.
 Nou ap fè li aksesib nan pakin nan.
 OK
 OK
 Men, se pa tout fant nan mi yo nesesèman aksesib.
 Èske sa kòrèk?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2044.128s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: OK
 Ou pral fè li.
 Mwen vle di, objektif la isit la, ki poko egziste, se bay yon wout aksesib.
 Se konsa, si yon moun te deklare ke yo nan yon chèz woulant yon kote nan pak la, mwen ta pi sansib a li paske mwen chire ACL mwen an kèk ane de sa pandan mwen te sote leve, li desann.
 Mwen te panse, oke, mwen jwenn li.
 Mwen konprann poukisa règ aksè sa yo enpòtan anpil.
 Men wi, se konsa wout aksesib a isit la.
 Ou ka gen yon espas pakin aksesib, ki vrèman jis signalisation paske wout la deja la, ak Lè sa a, gen twotwa a, ak Lè sa a, gen wout sa a isit la.
 Wi, tout pak la pa bezwen aksesib.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2091.472s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Mon pa krwar sa, me mon anvi vwar li akoz evidaman, ou konnen, nou esey agrandi aksesib kot nou kapab, evidaman, kot nou ye.
 Mwen panse ou gen rezon.
 Definitivman pa plis pase 120.
 Mwen te pase nan li anpil fwa
 Mwen pa panse ke li posib ke anpil kalifikasyon yo bezwen pou reyalize sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2107.038s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sa a se definitivman zòn ki pi plat, tankou w ap monte monte.
 Sa a pita glise nan direksyon pon an tren.
 Wout la se likidasyon e li gen gwo gout, kidonk sa a se definitivman kote ki pi laj ak plat.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2125.295s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Pedro, èske gen nenpòt amelyorasyon ki nesesè oswa yon koupe nan twotwa a soti nan yon twotwa aksesib a yon pasaj pou pyeton?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2133.12s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Wi, sa se yon kesyon enteresan.
 Donk si nou gade li, se sa... se sa nou te fè.
 Ou te la pou pale de separasyon an.
 Sa a se koneksyon nan nò.
 Mwen panse se LaVine oswa Jackson, mwen konfonn.
 Se la nou te wè twotwa nou an.
 Koulye a, gen de fason pou fè sa.
 Ou ka fè sa ou fè nòmalman epi mete pave pou wout ou a trase ak Lè sa a, mete pave sou lòt bò a tou, oswa ou ka gen yon tablo vitès.
 Konseptyèlman, tablo vitès yo gwo paske yo ka fè de bagay alafwa.
 Yo ralanti trafik ak machin, e menm si gen yon boul la, machin yo pral kouri sou bagay sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2180.82s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Magouy sa a pa mache.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2182.381s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Wi.
 Magouy sa a pa mache.
 Men, li ta bon pou gen pasaj trase trase e petèt kèk siyal.
 Li jis konseptyèlman kenbe pyeton yo sou menm nivo.
 Se pa ke ou oblije desann nan domèn machin epi tounen nan domèn moun.
 Bay pyeton yo, men li ka itil pou w pale ak ou
 DPW anvan nou finalize li paske si ou gen kontè vitès isit la, pasaj siperyè, Lè sa a, ou dwe okipe drenaj la.
 Epi ou gen drenaj anba epi mwen sèten wout la koube epi li gen yon vout
 Dlo a ap koule sou koub sa a epi li tonbe.
 Se konsa, si ou kreye yon kontè vitès epi ou gen yon pant k ap desann, w ap bezwen yon tiyo drenaj pou kolekte dlo a.
 Pafwa li pa travay, li pa fè lajan, men</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2244.435s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Konprann.
 Mwen sèten yon reyinyon ak depatman jeni DPW vil la ta 100% apwopriye yon fwa nou fin pase etap konsèp la.
 De plis kesyon senp.
 Sa a pi enpòtan pou Jen ak Ryan.
 Èske non Pomswall deja ofisyèl, oswa tout moun jis rele l konsa paske yo konnen ki sa li pral vin?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2266.053s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Li poko ofisyèl.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2268.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Oke, wi, li definitivman pa ofisyèl.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2270.917s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Nou fè sa nan respè pou 100 moun sa yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2274.299s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Nou’n apel li sa pour plizyer lannen akoz nou konnen management i totalman on board.
 ann wè.
 Se konsa, makè miray esklav.
 Yo pral pran li ale, pa vre?
 Akòz tout bagay k ap pase kounye a, yo te pwopoze yon nouvo logo ki ta ka ranplase li.
 OK?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2291.53s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: John Anderson te di sosyete istorik la kounye a revize tout siy li yo epi diskite sou mete ajou yo ak enfòmasyon ki kòrèk la.
 Li te di ke nou ta ka sètènman pran inisyativ la nan sitiyasyon sa a si nou te vle, paske siyal la te patikilyèman kòrèk.
 Yo te fè anpil sipozisyon men yo pa t fè okenn rechèch pou fè bak yo.
 Um, pou nou ka sètènman remix plat la pwochen epi reitilize wòch la si nou toujou vle, men nou ka definitivman fè lòt bagay tou.
 Ou konnen, sètènman mwen pa ta ekri anpil mo sou wòch sa a.
 Ankò, mwen jis pral di "Mi Pompeii," petèt dedye li bay Pompeii, petèt nonmen moun ki esklav yo.
 Yon bagay ki piti petèt ta ka li sou twotwa a lòtbò lari a, kòm nivo ekriti sa a ka wè sou kèk nan siyal entèpretasyon Pyè te pwopoze pou mache istorik la, e se la kote moun ta aktyèlman li li, si yo li li ditou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2360.117s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Epi li nan move direksyon an, ki se danjere.
 Mwen vle di, evidamman, gen yon milyon pwoblèm ak logo sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2366.062s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Yeah, jis make li, ou konnen, make li jan li ye.
 Men, fondamantalman, li dwe lizib nan machin, bisiklèt, oswa moun ki pase.
 Sa a, se konsa petèt mwen ta di, ou konnen, mi yo nan Pompeii te bati alantou 1760.
 Ou konnen, se li, ak pi gwo tèks.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2385.707s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Oke, plis detay tanpri, mwen se youn nan lòt manm komite yo rantre nan.
 Jis de blòk soti nan Sagamore John Memorial la.
 Èske ou panse ke petèt lè nou te fè signalisation sou pati Ameriken Endyen an nan santye istorik la, èske te gen okenn tantativ pou mare bagay yo ansanm, oswa li te twòp, Ryan?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2408.11s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sue Anna Crowley te di m ke premye objektif nou ta dwe envite tribi endijèn yo ak pèp endijèn yo rakonte pwòp istwa yo epi kite yo konplètman deside sa yo vle di sou panèl entèpretasyon an.
 Mwen 100% konvenki sa a se bon bagay yo fè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2431.12s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Mwen avèk ou.
 Yon dènye kesyon oswa kòmantè se, nou te pale sou yon pati nan istwa a nan kote sa a se transpò a, ray tren an, kanal la tou pre.
 Sa a se pa yon pati nan yon vwayaj istorik, oswa petèt li se.
 Kisa ou panse de sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2449.449s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Mwen jis pral antre nan.
 Pyè, si nou tounen nan planifikasyon sit, plan sit ou a.
 OK
 Wi.
 Mwen panse ke gen yon opòtinite yo ale nan dèyè tè a epi kreye yon bouk, ou konnen, konekte chemen an dèyè a chemen devan ou ak wout aksesib epi fè tout tè a yon bagay pou ke, ou konnen, si nou plante li, li limite a yon zòn sikilè la epi, ou konnen, Lè sa a, ou ka mete yon panèl entèpretasyon nan dèyè.
 Gendwa gen plis pale sou Middlesex Canal, ray tren e petèt menm,
 Plis istwa fanmi Brooks paske w ap gade Brooks Playground Park konsa gen anpil opòtinite pou ajoute anpil plis siyal adisyonèl pi lwen pase twa ke nou genyen yo, ou ta ka pwobableman ajoute twa e petèt sa a se li, ou konnen, petèt nou pral fè youn nan devan sou premye a ak dezyèm lan sou dezyèm lan, men ou konnen omwen li la epi ou konnen nou ka di ke se istwa a tout antye nan sit la.
 Si ou vle konnen istwa a tout antye, li prèske fòse moun yo deplase, konsa fè tout pak la an sekirite paske gen moun ki ap mache nan do a.
 Mèsi.
 Isit la nan kòmantè mwen an, jis pwolonje chemen istwa a nan sit la tout antye ak bouk nan li.
 Isit la li ye, dwa.
 Wi.
 Nan dèyè, si te gen yon gwo pwoblèm, te gen yon tiyo dlo sis pous oswa tiyo drenaj ki te kouri soti nan dèyè kay la pou rive nou, epi tout vil la pa menm konnen sou wout nou te jwenn la pandan fouye akeyolojik la.
 Se konsa, li te koupe depi lontan.
 Se konsa, sa a pa pral yon klasifikasyon.
 P'ap gen pwoblèm.
 OK
 Bon konnen.
 Wi.
 Yeah, yo mande nou si nou rele Dig Safe ak Dig Safe pa t 'konnen li te la tou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2568.206s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Se konsa, tout bagay anfòm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2569.888s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2570.628s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Mèsi pou poze kesyon an, Doug, paske mwen te panse te gen yon bon kòmantè dènye fwa e mwen imajine istwa trafik la sou siy akeyi a, men nan yon pwen.
 Ou ka jwenn anpil enfòmasyon sou siy akeyi sa a.
 Byenveni nan pak la oswa yon bagay.
 Poukisa pak egziste?
 Li bon tou lè w nan pak sa a.
 Mwen renmen tren yo, yo ale trè vit e mwen te panse li ta plezi jwenn yon chans tounen isit la.
 mwen vle
 Mache li ankò konvenk mwen ke li te tou plat.
 Mwen panse ke sa ta ka aktyèlman ka a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2623.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mwen renmen lide a, Ryan, e mwen panse tou ke, ou konnen, lè nou tande vwazen yo lè nou fè reyinyon piblik yo, ou konnen, yo ap evidamman konsène sou twòp ekspoze, ou konnen, bagay yo ap chanje nan pak sa a.
 Men, mwen panse ke si nou konsantre sou zòn sa a, nou fè kèk plante kreyatif isit la, petèt fè kèk eklèsi ak reyèlman eseye fè tras sa a espesyal.
 Sa a se yon lòt rezon ki fè yo kite rès la nan pak la intact.
 Ou konnen, se ankò kèk netwaye soti nan bwa ki mouri a ak tout bagay.
 Men, sanble ke nou jis konsantre sou zòn sa a.
 Nou pa fè anyen nan espas vèt la nan moman an.
 Nou pa pral manyen rès santye yo, abri, oswa nenpòt bagay timoun yo te jwi pandan ane yo.
 Epi peye atansyon sou sik istorik sa a.
 Mwen panse ke nou ka di ke nou te tande vwa yo e se te yon konpwomi bèl nan pati istorik la nan, ou konnen, kite kominote a ak renmen li pou sa li te ye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2690.567s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.
 Kidonk, jan Pyè konnen, nou te jwenn finansman nan men CPC pou fè tout koupe twotwa yo, tout twotwa yo, epi enjenyè vil la ak moun trafik yo te di ke sètènman yo pa pral mete twotwa nan chak lari, men yo pral mete twotwa nan gwo entèseksyon.
 Mwen panse ke de sa yo enpòtan, petèt yo pral kenbe yo separe
 Soti isit la se yon lòt lari pou rezon sekirite.
 Pral gen yon dekoupaj twotwa nan chak antre, ki se kote lajan an soti.
 Gen ase lajan pou achte afich.
 Lè sa a, gen lajan pou koupe ak replante pye bwa yo.
 Espesyalman, si gen vye pye bwa ki mouri sou wout la, nou ka sètènman konsantre sou zòn sa a epi imedyatman replante yo epi kite yo grandi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2743.615s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bon, gen yon mesye sou Jackson Road k ap pale avè m. Mwen panse mwen anjeneral pake devan kay sa a nan kay sa a.
 Bèl nèg, isit la nan revizyon li: Mwen vrèman renmen amelyorasyon yo isit la, menm si.
 Kounye a, gwo pye bwa sa yo ap vin pi vizib, epi gen travay pou fèt, epi souvan li pa bon mache pou fè yon moun fè li epi fè li byen, men li depann sou kominote a.
 Sa ou te fè te ogmante valè tout propriétés sa yo.
 Si mwen te rete nan katye sa a epi toudenkou gwo miray wòch sa a ak miray brik retabli sa a ta parèt, sa t ap yon etap pozitif pou kominote a.
 Se pou moun konprann ke se sa ki pral rive paske moun yo deyò yo sansib.
 Mwen panse ke entèvansyon nou yo dwe fè atansyon ak lejè.
 Paske moun pwoteje li.
 Yo vle bagay yo vin pi bon, men mwen dakò, Jen, yo mande, kisa ou pral fè?
 Yo trè pwoteksyon paske sa a se kote yo kenbe chen yo epi yo panse ke sa a se pak yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2822.235s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Yon pati nan potansyèl plan prensipal simityè nou sot diskite a se chen, men kounye a pa gen okenn règ pou chen.
 Simityè a ap diskite sou konbyen moun ki pral mache chen yo la alavni.
 Youn nan bagay mwen sijere se ke petèt si vil la di epi li kòmanse aplike règleman pou mache chen yo, yo ta ka petèt tounen yon pati nan Placedead Park nan yon pak pou chen isit la nan Medford pou gen yon kote pou ale andeyò Falls yo, petèt nan.
 Ou konnen, Thomas Brooks Park vin tounen yon pak istorik, ou konnen, nou panse ak tout itilizatè yo nan kote sa yo, nou bay ekipman pou yo, epi si nou retire yon bagay, nou mete l 'yon lòt kote pou tout moun gen menm aksè.
 Lè sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2880.235s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mwen panse sa tou, mwen vle di, paske mwen te mache chen mwen isit la, ou konnen, ou reyèlman rete sou santye yo paske si ou eseye, mwen vle di, mwen konnen mwen pa pral kite chen mwen kouri ale jis paske ou pa konnen ki sa yo pral entèfere ak.
 Ou pa vle pran si yo frape yon baton oswa yon bagay.
 Se konsa, mwen panse, ou konnen, mwen panse ke nan lavni an, si gen yon kalite kontrent nan bouk la,
 Ou konnen, petèt jis kèk bon signalisation ak jan nou mande dousman, ou konnen, pa kite chen ou desann kèk kalite ranp isit la sof si ale yon lòt kote.
 Men, ankò, mwen pa t 'reyèlman wè nenpòt lòt moun sou santye nan enprovize lè mwen te la, epi wi, li te pi an sekirite, wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2924.395s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Peter, mwen gen yon kesyon ke ou ka sètènman pran kèk tan yo reflechi sou.
 Èske gen lòt opsyon? Se konsa, youn nan responsablite vil la (yon lòt vil, petèt kounye a pataje an pati ak MBTA) se ke nou ta dwe kenbe kloti sou MBTA a.
 Menm lè a.
 MBTA te aparamman repare kloti w la pou kenbe l pwòp.
 Èske gen yon bagay ki pi atire oswa pi bon mete ke ou ta renmen kache?
 Mwen vle di, èske gen yon lyen nwa ki ta pi dirab ak disparèt nan background vèt nan tan kap vini an?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2965.794s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Isit la nan yon bagay mwen te aprann, oswa nou tout te aprann, sou pak la, de nan estipilasyon yo nan papye kay la se ke ou dwe kenbe miray la, miray Majestic la, kanpe, epi ou dwe kenbe kloti a sou ray tren an, otreman Brooks Estate a ka teknikman kraze l ', ki mwen sèten pa gen moun konnen, dwa?
 Men wi, genyen
 Paske gen sèlman Chainlink kounye a, pa vre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2995.863s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2997.044s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: OK
 MBTA posede l epi mete l?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3002.778s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Se konsa, mwen panse ke gen kloti nan vil la.
 Lè sa a, mwen panse ke sou tan, kòm moun koupe wout la ak pye bwa yo tonbe sou li, MBTA a te fè reparasyon, men li pa t 'yon kloti trè byen bati.
 Kòm plis ak plis bagay tonbe sou li, li kraze.
 Donk, ou konnen, mwen ta renmen wè yon bagay vin tounen yon ranplasman pi pèmanan nan tan kap vini, sitou si nou pral envesti nan pwogram sa a, ou konnen, nou ta ka osi byen fè tout zòn nan atire.
 Menm si nou jis kòmanse ak ti zòn sa a, nou pral evantyèlman jwenn li tout fè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3032.888s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Wi, mwen pral pwobableman tounen la ak kèk sijesyon, men wi, gen definitivman pi bon altènativ yo fè sa.
 Jis pa atire atansyon twòp, men se yon bon divizyon.
 Kloti yo chè.
 Sa a se yon seksyon trè long, men mwen ka bay kèk egzanp sou sa li ta ka, petèt jis yon pri jeneral pou chak pye oswa yon bagay tankou sa, pye lineyè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3066.362s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi, mwen vle anpeche moun koupe l. Ou konnen, yon sèl bagay nou ka fè se plante yon bagay yon ti kras mwens anvayisan, pou egzanp, mwen gen yon kloti fil poul kote mwen plante bluebells.
 Glwa maten yo pa kalite plant ou vle grandi isit la jan yo pral fou, men li kreye yon miray vèt ak yon miray flè vèt.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, li sispann moun nan eseye sote sou kloti, koupe kloti ak sou sa.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, petèt nou ka panse sou sa tou.
 Petèt Ivy ka jwenn sou li oswa yon bagay.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3101.182s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: OK
 Wi.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3142.51s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Mwen panse
 Mwen panse ke si nou te fè yon bagay, yon fwa nou te jwenn enfòmasyon an isit la, mwen panse ke sa mwen ta sijere se bèl anpil kouvri epi ranpli kote ou ta mete yon kalite baryè pwoteksyon, menm jan ak ki jan ou ta panse a li kòm yon brownfield, ki se yon twal fò, dirab ak Lè sa a, plati sou tèt la ak, mwen pa konnen, petèt kat pous nan tè, ase tè pou ke ou ka grandi limyè sa a, ak Lè sa a, oswa yon bagay tankou sa a.
 Sa a pwoteje sit la soti nan pneu.
 Si ou ta fouye, li ta mande yon gwo kantite efò.
 Men, ou konnen, mwen reyèlman panse ke pandan n ap kontinye amelyore kote sa a ak amelyore wout yo ak tout ekipman yo, mwen reyèlman pa panse moun yo se pwoblèm nan.
 Mwen panse ke yo pral polis tèt yo.
 Mwen vle di, sa rive detanzantan, men se tankou yon kote tankou yon pak nasyonal, kote gen plizyè dizèn de milye de kawo tè moun pa fouye.
 Donk se jis yon kesyon de respekte sit la.
 Plis nou peye atansyon sou li epi pataje istwa li yo, plis moun pral respekte sit la epi yo pa fè anyen sou li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3223.258s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Sa vle di, si yo kwè ke li te detere.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3229.583s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.
 Bon, swa nou konnen sa ki la epi yon moun ka imajine sa ki la san yo pa bezwen fouye anba tè, pa vre?
 Nou gen kèk zafè ke ou ka wè soti nan tè a, kidonk pa gen okenn nesesite, eksitasyon nan jwenn li tèt ou fini, dwa?
 Paske nou konnen sa w ap jwenn.
 Epi li fasil pou di moun,
 Akeyoloji se yon resous fini.
 Yon fwa ou mete pèl la sou tè a epi vire l sou, ou fini.
 Li fè pou tout tan.
 Mwen panse ke moun konprann sa.
 Se vre wi yon moun ta konprann, menm yon pwofàn ki fè yon bagay konsa.
 Men ou konnen,
 Èske sa ap dekouraje nenpòt kriminèl reyèl?
 Li pa enpòtan si yo fè li oswa ou pa.
 Moun ki reyèlman vle travay isit la ap chèche sit la epi jwenn li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3291.215s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen gen yon kesyon pou ou, Pedro.
 Èske ou pwojte yon sèten imaj de poto sa yo?
 Konseptyèlman, mwen
 Mwen mande: yo wo?
 Èske yo pre tè a?
 Ki sa ou panse sou sa a?
 OK
 Mwen panse ke ou te montre yon bagay, menm si.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3311.672s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Wi, mwen pa t montre anyen espesifik, men mwen t ap panse ak yon bagay ki sanble.
 Se poutèt sa, li ka sèvi kòm yon makè fwontyè inivèsèl.
 Anplis de sa, sa yo se
 Bor ki graj, tèt lis, apeprè 18 cm segondè.
 Se konsa, si yon moun la epi li vle sispann epi panse oswa fè yon lòt bagay, li ta ka yon chèz.
 Sa a wotè ak gwosè mwen te konsidere.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3351.814s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mwen renmen sibtilite apwòch ou a.
 Mwen pa gen okenn lide.
 Mwen pa konnen poukisa mwen pa panse sa a fre, men mwen imajine yo tankou yon bagay tankou eleman vètikal sa yo, wi, men mwen pa konnen, mwen pa konnen si sa a fre, men mwen panse ke li bezwen kèk siyal entèpretasyon, ou konnen, tankou sa.
 Moun sèlman wè wòch sa yo sou tè a.
 Mwen te panse sa t ap yon gwo opòtinite pou eksplike fèm nan ak sa li ye.
 Mwen vle di, mwen panse ke ou prèske oblije gen tou de eleman yo konprann sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3399.215s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Wi nan kou.
 Panse mwen se ke siyal sa a ta ka egziste.
 Mwen te eseye konekte
 Men, se te yon bon lide anvan konsèp boukle sa a te soti pou mwen te kapab chanje li, ki te lide mwen sou pozisyon zwazo a.
 Siy eksplikasyon sou kote kay la isit la.
 Men, si nou vle vire sa a alantou, petèt se pa tout moun bezwen kole sou chemen lineyè sa a.
 Petèt se konsa li ta ka, dwa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3444.115s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mwen renmen lide bouk la tou.
 Mwen panse ke li ofri yon ti kras plis
 Mwen vle di, mwen konprann tou ke moun nan katye a jis vle li prèske sovaj.
 Yo te sanble vrèman rekonesan.
 Mwen panse ke gen obsèvatè zwazo ale la ak sou sa.
 Mwen panse ke se bote nan apwòch la sibtil, paske aktyèlman ou pa nesesèman
 Oke, mwen pa panse sit la ta dwe dezenfekte, ou konnen, epi vin, uh, jis ale nan lòt ekstrèm nan, ou konnen, vin tounen yon vèsyon desen Disneyland.
 Ou konnen, mwen panse ke gen kèk benefis nan lefèt ke li se prèske yon dezè.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3513.582s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Wi, plis mwen reyini ansanm epi vin konnen kèk nan vwazen yo epi obsève sa a, mwen vle di, kèk ide enteresan te parèt nan dènye reyinyon an sou lòt bagay nan Philadelphia.
 Mwen panse ke Ben Franklin te site yon fason diferan pou imajine kisa kay la ta sanble.
 Men, mwen panse.
 Mwen panse ke sibtilite se pi bon apwòch la.
 Se prèske tankou ou bite nan zòn sa a pa aksidan.
 Se konsa, poukisa zòn sa a transparan?
 Poukisa plantasyon sa a isit la?
 Mwen toujou panse ak yon bagay ki soti nan C.S.
 Lewis oswa yon bagay.
 Poukisa kwen baz sa yo isit la?
 Gen yon siy ki eksplike sa, kidonk petèt ou pral prèske tach zòn sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3560.728s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen renmen sa.
 Mwen renmen apwòch sa a kòm yon apwòch jeneral.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3568.531s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Briyan.
 Nenpòt lòt kòmantè oswa kòmantè?
 Mwen apresye tan ou isit la ak tout kòmantè ou yo.
 Nou tout gen bèl lide.
 Ann wè, ak sa a, mwen panse ke nou ka ale yon lòt lap ankò.
 Mwen pral kontakte ou
 Ryan oswa nenpòt moun, ak Lè sa a, tounen ak rafine li yon ti kras.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3592.382s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sa a sanble gwo.
 Mèsi anpil Pedro.</p>

 Mèsi tout pou kòmantè ou yo.
 Sa se gwo.
 Anvan nou ale nan pwochen atik la sou ajanda a, nou gen yon lòd ki an reta.
 Donk mwen espere nou aksepte sa.
 Ryan, èske ou rive voye yon lyen sou pwoblèm sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3617.923s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Heck, non.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3618.883s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sa ta gwo.
 Ou vle avanse?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3626.692s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi, si ou vle telechaje bagay sa yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3629.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Wi, oke, mwen pral fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3631.016s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Mesye, pandan n ap pale de bidjè, kounye a se moman pou w depanse rès bidjè w la.
 Kidonk, si moun yo ta kwè, nou gen pwojè Thomas Brooks Park, epi mwen pral mande $1,100 pou yo depanse nan Cross Street Cemetery.
 nou.
 Sa vle di konsèy simityè a ak administratè yo te kapab resevwa $4,800 nan pwogram ti sibvansyon CPC.
 Mwen te resevwa tou yon sibvansyon $5,000 nan Distri Istorik Nasyonal Freedom Trail pou fè evalye wòch simityè yo.
 Sa a kite kèk lajan anplis pou fè kèk bagay
 Fè yon vizit sou sit anvan ou fè evalyasyon an tèt li paske sa pral afekte evalyasyon an.
 Se poutèt sa, mwen pral mande Konsèy la pou l depanse $1,100 nan bidjè ki rete a pou pwojè sa a ak konpreyansyon ke simityè a pral kòmanse bidjè nan sezon otòn la pou chèche finansman nan men CPC pou restorasyon simityè a.
 Kidonk, mwen pa konnen, pwobableman nou gen $5,000 oswa plis ki rete pou MHC Form B la.
 Èske gen nenpòt zòn nan vil la ke ou panse bezwen yo dwe adrese, oswa Doug, ke ou ta renmen konsantre sou pou pwochen pwojè CBC, kalite bagay sa yo?
 Peter, mwen wè ou leve men ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3724.039s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Oke, yon ti zwazo te di m 'Tufts t'ap chache fè fè yo sou ti mòn lan.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3733.241s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3733.541s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen ka tcheke si mwen konnen gen yon tab zòn pou zòn nan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3740.105s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Paske mwen te dekouvri sa, men wi, mwen ka mande John pou l prepare yon fòm MHC B pou bilding lan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3749.95s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen pa gen okenn lide.
 Ou konnen, se yon rimè mwen tande.
 Donk mwen pa konnen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3754.273s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Non, sa byen.
 Mwen vle di, li bon pou konnen ki sa bilding yo nan zòn nan, ou konnen ki sa Tufts ap fè.
 Lè sa a,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3762.743s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen panse ke Tufts gen li kounye a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3764.825s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Wi.
 Non, sa a te alantou pou yon ti tan.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3769.47s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Eske yo posede l depi lontan, Pyè?
 Mwen pa konnen.
 Mwen pa gen okenn lide.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3772.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Li te jis te vann.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3773.854s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Wi, mwen pa sonje yo te mèt magazen an paske mwen konnen nèg ki dirije magazen sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3777.958s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen pa sèten si se pwopriyetè a, men mwen te tande pale de zwazo sa a,
 Li te di ke sa a se vre.
 Kidonk, mwen pa konnen.
 Mwen pa ka garanti pou sous mwen yo, men mwen pa vle mete ou nan pwoblèm, nan lòt mo, menm si.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3794.919s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Ebyen se bilding ki sou goch la k ap deplase.
 Ou konnen, se esansyèlman li.
 Lè sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3803.947s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Tout lòt kote nou te kapab panse a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3805.948s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Ryan, mwen vle di kèk ane de sa, èske nou te mande Tufts yo mete ansanm yon bagay pou yo depanse pwòp lajan yo sou?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3812.089s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Mwen pa panse ke nou te resevwa anyen nan men yo.
 Oh, nou pèdi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3828.513s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Fondamantalman li nan tout sou fowòm rejyonal yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3844.894s">[Doug Carr]</a>: padon.
 Nou te mande Tufts University pou kreye yon fòma distri pou kanpis yo paske nou konnen toujou gen nouvo pwojè, nouvo adisyon nan tout bagay.
 Mwen pa kwè nou la ankò, men mwen espere ke yo depanse lajan yo, pa lajan nou, pa lajan vil la, pou fè yon bon evalyasyon sou kanpis yo ak bilding enpòtan yo sou kanpis yo, ki mwen panse ke nou konnen trè ti kras sou kounye a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3875.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Mwen ka mande kiyès ki responsab relasyon kominotè e nou ka wè sa li te prepare.
 Mwen vle di, petèt li fè sans, menm si nou gen kèk lajan, petèt nou patnè ak yo pou yo ka jwenn plis lajan.
 Mwen vle di, mwen ta sètènman renmen dokimante kèk bilding, ak nan kèk fason sa a se responsablite nou an, men chak bilding, non, mwen pa panse vil la ta dwe responsab pou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3901.861s">[Doug Carr]</a>: E yon fòma rejyonal kanpis sèlman?
 Èske li twò gwo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3907.703s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Mwen vle di, gen anpil bagay pou dokimante, epi ta ka gen diferan zòn, tankou separasyon kwadrang istorik la nan tèt sèten zòn nan kanpis la.
 Ou konnen, sa a se devlope separeman de ranje Pwofesè a, ki se devlope separeman nan zòn ki lwen.
 Touf.
 Kare, pou mank de yon tèm pi bon, kote mawon an ak byè ta dwe (si li te toujou la).
 Li se yon ne biznis endepandan.
 Lè sa a, mwen ka mande zòn sa a sou lakou lekòl la epi wè sa nou ka jwenn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3949.086s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Lè sa a, Tufts University te akeri li ane pase a pou Hellaside Hardware.
 Wi.
 Nan 2022, tout sit la vann.
 Walnut Hill Properties se yon konpayi byen imobilye Tufts.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3976.398s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Oke, se yon bilding remakab, se pou asire w.
 Mwen vle di, kote, tankou.
 Li ta gwo si yon bagay bon ta ka rive la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3987.832s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.
 Mwen vle di, si nou vle yon pwojè reyitilizasyon adaptasyon, sa se gwo.
 Petèt yo te kenbe bilding orijinal la ak bati yon bagay nouvo sou tèt.
 Sa se gwo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3996.915s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, yo ta ka definitivman ajoute yon etaj oswa de nan bilding lan.
 Li ta koul, men se pa yon rimè map tande, rimè map tande a se yon demo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4008.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Montre epi kòmanse ankò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4184.774s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi, jan mwen te eksplike, nou bezwen $1,100 pou fè travay jaden ak teste fondasyon wòch yo pou wè ki jan yo kenbe nan tè a.
 Se konsa, mwen te bezwen yon sibvansyon $1,100 pou konplete li epi pou m kapab konplete li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4204.205s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Trè emosyonèl.
 Èske gen yon dezyèm?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4209.348s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: dezyèm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4211.497s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ebyen, mosyon pou apwouve $1,100 pou Cross Street Cemetery.
 Sa a se sipòte.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4231.292s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Ryan, pandan n ap vin pi pre bidjè a, kisa nou fè lè nou rive nan fen a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4237.677s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Apeprè 4000 oswa konsa.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4245.896s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Kidonk, èske gen lòt metòd ki sanble?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4248.358s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi, gen tan pou w itilize pwochen 30 jou yo pou w gade kominote w la epi gade kominote w la.
 Si w wè yon bilding ki parèt abandone pandan w ap kondui yon otobis oswa yon tren, tanpri fè m konnen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4262.242s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Oke, ann jwenn youn pou Greenleaf.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4265.224s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, mwen vle di, yeah, nou gen bilding sa a, kidonk mwen te fè yon mosyon pou allocate $ 500 a 82 Greenleaf, ki se yon bilding ki domaje dife ki pral tonbe, men nou ta dwe fè li.
 Nou poko revize siyifikasyon ki sanble ak sa nou te wè a.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4323.288s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Gen yon tab zòn men li trè ansyen.
 Li se yon zòn bèl, sere, kontra enfòmèl ant.
 Konsiltan yo deja konstwi pwopriyete Hall Bradley a pi lwen sou wout la, kidonk si yo te enterese nou ta ka sètènman mande yo si yo te vle bati yon bèl kominote nan yon sèl lari.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4341.174s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Gen toujou konstriksyon k ap fèt la ak nan vi a mwen ka predi yon moun pral pran yon desizyon,

 Nenpòt lòt moun gen nouvo biznis?
 Oke, ann tounen nan biznis kòm dabitid.
 Mwen pa panse ke nou pral jwenn okenn mizajou pandan reta demo a.
 Mwen pa t 'tande li.
 Oke, pa gen Sid ki soti nan Wareham Street ak Winchester.
 Li pa gen anyen pou wè ak fanm sa.
 Pa gen okenn pèmisyon reyèl pou mete ajou.
 Mwen kontakte nouvo espesyalis konstriksyon an.
 Nou fè echanj kèk imèl.
 Mwen pral eseye konvenk ou vin nan pwochen reyinyon nou an, oswa mwen pral rankontre avèk ou jis di mwen ta renmen prezante tèt mwen, di bonjou epi bati yon nouvo relasyon.
 Mwen voye yon imèl, jis pou w konnen, mwen voye yon imèl bay ekip Depatman Bilding jodi a pandan n ap jwenn pèmi pou pwopriyete 82 Greenleaf la.
 Se konsa, mwen voye yon imèl ba yo epi mwen di, hey, ou konnen, fè yo ranpli dokiman Demo a.
 Pou nou ka avanse pi vit posib.
 Mwen di, donk, chak fwa gen yon dife sou yon pwopriyete, tanpri fè pwopriyetè yo konnen pou yo rapòte li imedyatman pou nou ka kòmanse deplase yo pi vit posib pou yo ka kòmanse rekonstwi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4465.097s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Poze yon kesyon absoliman estipid depi li te poze nan yon kontèks diferan,
 Si ou gen malere ase pou posede yon pwopriyete ki byen asire ki sanble yo te soufri kalite domaj dife, èske frè nou an ap enkli nan peman asirans ou a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4490.858s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Nou pa chaje okenn frè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4492.1s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Wi, nou pa chaje okenn frè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4493.463s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Depatman bilding lan chaje yon frè pèmi, men nou pa gen yon pèmi.</p>

 Non, yo pa janm mete yo.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4514.894s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Non, sèl bagay nou ap mande kounye a se ke aplikan yo peye depans piblisite lejitim.</p>

 Oke, Ryan deja revize Cross Street Cemetery, kidonk nou pare pou yon mizajou, pa vre?

 Nenpòt mizajou sou pwojè rechèch sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4546.562s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Konsiltan te voye anpil aplikasyon pou Fulton Heights.

 Yo panse ke yo pral kapab fè li nan mwa me, ki se yon bon nouvèl pou nou.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4565.373s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Eksepsyonèl.
 Èske gen Doug nan Thomas Brooks Park?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4580.196s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Donk yo te apwouve aplikasyon an, yo te apwouve aplikasyon an long paske mwen te la pou prezantasyon an ak diskisyon, men nou ap tann pou yo ale nan konsèy vil la.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4593.243s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Mwen panse ke sa a kòrèk.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4598.706s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Èske gen yon dezyèm pakèt aplikasyon ki bezwen apwouve?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4604.397s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Mwen pa panse sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4606.178s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mwen kontinye wè pòs sosyal konsa: Tout pwojè yo la, men nou pa la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4613.42s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Kite m tcheke.
 Mwen pral kontakte ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4615.88s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Oke, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4616.921s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Men, yo te fè li, yo apwouve li.
 Men, yo, mwen panse ke yo, Ryan, ou menm ak mwen t ap voye mesaj tèks lannwit sa a epi mwen panse ke yo te eseye jwenn
 Yon ti koupe te nesesè paske yo te vle vil la fè kèk travay sou pye bwa yo.
 Mwen te di, byen, si ou fè sa, ou pi bon kenbe pawòl ou.
 Ou ap pale nan non DPW san yo pa mande yo.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke yo apwouve li, men yo pa apwouve li, li te mwens pase sa ki te egzije, men li te ase yo fè sa Ryan te santi te kritik.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4645.373s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.
 Wi.
 Mwen vle di, gen lajan deyò pou fouye, siyalizasyon, koupe ADA.
 Lè sa a, te gen yon anpil nan chanjman nan tretman an nan pye bwa.
 Se pa tout nan li, nan kou, men sa a oke.
 Mwen panse ke sa enpòtan tou.
 Mwen kontan ak li.
 Mwen vle di, mwen panse ke nou te di, mwen panse ke nou te di, yo te di nou sou 200,000 oswa yon bagay konsa.
 Men, sètènman, li ta ka pran kèk ajisteman minè epi, ou konnen, si depatman pye bwa a di yo pa ka fè li, petèt yo pral tounen epi yo di, non, fè wonn sa a epi kite yo fè tout pak la.
 Yon lòt bagay se ke Sant Kiltirèl Islamik la te kontakte nou pou mande yon lèt sipò pou pwochen sibvansyon yo.
 Enkyetid prensipal mwen an se: Èske yo te bay CPC nenpòt kalite etid oswa nenpòt bagay ki nesesè nan plan bilding lan oswa konsèvasyon?
 Paske mwen konnen mwen te wè yo ap travay sou fenèt yo.
 Men, mwen panse ke kòm yon kondisyon pou finansman travay sa a, yo pral bay Pati Kominis Chinwa a ak yon plan prezèvasyon.
 Apre sa, mwen pa wè anyen.
 Se poutèt sa, kòm yon komisyonè, mwen ta ezite sipòte nenpòt kalite sibvansyon si yo pa satisfè obligasyon yo nan PCC la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4719.346s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Mwen pral mande Teresa.
 Reyinyon an se demen aswè.
 Mwen pral pale ak li an premye.
 Mwen pa wè anyen, Ryan.
 Men, sa pa vle di li pa rive nan nivo egzekitif la.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4730.525s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Wi, yo te mande nou ekri yon lèt, epi mwen te di, si ou ka voye nou enfòmasyon sou pwojè a, mwen ka mete l 'sou ajanda a ak Lè sa a, nou ka pale sou ekri yon lèt.
 Men, mwen pa ka jis di ou ekri yon lèt jiskaske nou konnen ki jan pwojè ou a prale.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4747.531s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Si ou pa mande, yo pral.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4751.672s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: OK
 Mwen vle di, mwen panse ke nou te trè adamant ak PCC a te trè adamant sou asire w ke nou gen yon plan an plas anvan nou kontinye travay, si nou vle oswa ou pa.
 Epi, ou konnen, li santi bon lè mwen wè fenèt yo disparèt epi retounen.
 Men, mwen panse ke li enpòtan yo konprann sa k ap pase.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4769.633s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Ki lè ou wè yo ap travay sou fenèt yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4771.994s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Oh, epi yo te antre ak soti nan bilding lan depi omwen Desanm.
 Se konsa, si ou gade ak anpil atansyon, ou pral wè ke kèk nan yo te fiks yo.
 Kidonk, mwen pa konnen kiyès ki fè travay la pou yo, men evidamman yo peye moun pou fè li.
 Mwen pa konnen si yo ap mande nenpòt kalite ranbousman nan men CPC, men li ta bon pou konnen.
 Paske mwen sonje nan reyinyon sa a, yo te premye devlope yon plan yo nan lòd yo finanse efò konsèvasyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4799.844s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Briyan.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4803.545s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Wi.

 Èske gen yon lòt bagay nenpòt lòt moun ta renmen di anvan nou apwouve minit yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4814.208s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Briyan.
 Jis yon kesyon senp.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4826.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Nou ka sove li pou pwochen reyinyon an.</p>

 Jis tankou krikèt yo deyò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4839.953s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bon, mwen vle di, yo ta ka kòmanse di moun ke lè yo ogmante nivo yo, si yo pa jwenn prezidan an, yo pral jwenn prezidan an antye.
 Wi, paske lè sa a ou tout pran nan travay la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4853.563s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Wi, se pa plan an, men mwen rekonesan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4858.127s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sa ka fè kèk moun anbarase epi fòse yo pou yo monte jwèt yo epi eseye fè kèk zanmi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4861.89s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Li ase pou di: Yon aplikasyon mande pou yon salè sis chif pou wòl tout volontè nouvo prezidan an.

 Èske gen nenpòt aktyalizasyon sou South Street?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi, se konsa South Street te vote pou ale pi devan ak prezantasyon an bay Konsèy Vil la epi byen vit mwen te di yo yo te bezwen pale ak Komite Devlopman Kominotè a.
 Mwen pa sèten si Dennis toujou la men si li la li ta bon pou konnen si yo la
 Jwenn opinyon yo ak apwobasyon nan Komite Devlopman Kominotè a paske sa a se yon etap nesesè anvan ou ale nan Konsèy Vil la.
 Yo sipoze ale nan Meri demen swa, donk mwen pa konnen si sa pral rive, men mwen pa t tcheke ajanda a pou wè si se te.
 Mwen konnen Chris Bader an vakans semèn sa a, se konsa dènye fwa mwen tcheke yo pa t ap pandye.
 Se konsa, li definitivman pa bon pou HTC, men li se jis premye etap la.
 Petèt nan pwochen mwa yo pral amelyore, petèt konsantre yo se sou pote pwoblèm nan nan konsèy vil la.
 Se konsa, petèt li ta bèl si yo aktyèlman rankontre demen.
 Malerezman, dapre nati ajanda a, mwen pa panse demen swa se pi bon swa pou diskite sou sijè sa a.
 Men, konnen nati an patikilye nan diskisyon an ki pral pran plas, mwen panse ke ta gen anpil moun ki ta natirèlman objeksyon nan yon bagay tankou sa a.
 Kidonk, si yo te pwoche bò kote l demen, yo ta prèske voye l nan lanmò demen.
 City Hall.
 Lè sa a, Dennis te di yo pa t 'montre nan panèl la CD ankò.
 Se konsa, sa a dwe rive.
 Sa dwe fèt anvan yo ale nan konsèy vil pou konplete pwosesis la.
 Fondamantalman, Komisyon Konsèy Devlopman Kominotè a se konsèy planifikasyon vil nou an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Se konsa, li pa t 'rive.
 Se konsa, esansyèlman,
 Pa gen anpil ki te pase depi dènye fwa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5016.394s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi, yo vle avanse.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5034.973s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Yon lòt kesyon paske ou te distribye li semèn pase a, Ryan.
 Mwen sètènman pa te gen okenn pwoblèm ak antèn nan Saltonstall Building.
 Mwen pa kwè nou gen anyen pou nou di, men mwen jis vle asire nou sou menm paj la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi, mwen vle di, mwen pa t '.
 Mwen panse ke nou te di sa sou achitekti nan tèt li.
 Mwen panse ke pwojè konstriksyon an ap avanse.
 Kidonk, mwen pa gen anyen pou m di, e si pa gen lòt moun ki di li, mwen pral poste kòmantè nou yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wi, mwen pa gen okenn pwoblèm ak sa tou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Li trè komen pou resevwa bagay sa yo move, move pou revizyon.
 Men, mwen vle di, sa ki deklanche li se nati a nan sansi a.
 Mwen vle di, pafwa nou jwenn bon rezilta.
 Menm jan yo pa janm bati monopole jeyan nan 93 nan Spot Pond akòz opozisyon an la.
 Se konsa, pafwa li travay.
 Pafwa bezwen pou gwo fò won selilè trè gwo pran priyorite sou prezèvasyon istorik.
 Mwen ta di ke nan Stoneham ki tou pre nou yo se pwobableman yon ti kras konsène paske nou yo enkyete sou nati a nan sekirite wout.
 Vil Stoneham ap goumen demolisyon Lopital Stoneham pou yon pwojè 40B planifye.
 Mwen pa konnen si yo ka sispann sa paske
 40 B anjeneral trè fò, mwen konnen yo pa satisfè restriksyon lojman paske yo te kòmanse yon lòt pwojè apre prèske yon dekad nan batay vil la.
 Se konsa, hehe.
 Yo ka fè demann epi nou ka jwenn fidbak sou prezèvasyon istorik.
 Mwen vle di, sit sa a trè istorik.
 Mwen pa kwè lopital la gen okenn siyifikasyon istorik, men ou konnen, yo te ka mande konsèy, epi nou ka gen opòtinite pou fè sa akòz boulva, lagon, elatriye.
 Si w poko wè l lòt bò vil, lopital Maldon pa egziste ankò donk yon lopital pral ranplase l.
 Zòn nan gen enstalasyon swen sante mantal ki trè ba nan dansite.
 Vil Malden ap reprann apeprè sis a uit kawo tè ki pral konsève pou tout tan nan kad pwojè a.
 Se konsa, sa a se yon sitiyasyon genyen-genyen pou Hallmark Health ak vil la nan Malden.
 Nou rive nan limit nou an.
 An reyalite, nan ane 1950 yo, mwen pa konnen si moun toujou sonje,
 Si w la, lè sa a yo deplase fwontyè ki genyen ant Medford ak Malden pou akomode lopital la paske ER ak sal akouchman an te okòmansman Medford, e menm si w nan Lopital Malden, yo dwe anrejistre tout nesans nan Medford ak Malden.
 Se konsa, yo te chanje limit zòn sa a.
 Se konsa, lè ou gade nan Google Maps, gen aktyèlman kèk rekòt.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5217.229s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Men, sa fè li difisil pou kèk moun jwenn yon paspò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5222.312s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.
 Wi, mwen sèten li se.
 Mwen sèten li se.
 Mwen vle di... li awesome.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5228.555s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: kote nesans.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5231.336s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Peyi pesonn.
 Gen dragon isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5233.877s">[Doug Carr]</a>: OK
 Zòn demilitarize ant Menford ak Baldwin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5239.2s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Wi.
 Se poutèt sa ou ka jwenn yon batistè nan Dorchester.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5245.867s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Ou konnen, li bon ke lopital la finalman fè yon bagay sou sit sa a.
 Mwen sezi ke yo, mwen konnen yo te eseye vire l 'nan lojman, men mwen se etone ke, ou konnen, yon moun pa t' eseye ale nan wout la ba dansite la.
 Men, ou konnen, lefèt ke yo te reprann tout tè a kòm espas vèt apre yo fin bati ti etablisman medikal sa a se yon bèl souke tèt sou itilizasyon anvan an nan sit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5272.631s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Èske sa a sou Maldon River?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5274.872s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Non, sa a se sou plato a.
 Si w konnen, ou ka wè nan gwo kay won radyo a ke, di, w ap mache desann Fells Road nan direksyon Fells Road, kote li divize an lès ak lwès.
 Gade anlè, gen gwo kay won an.
 Anvan ou te kapab wè lopital Maldon la.
 Ou pa ka wè li kounye a.
 Kidonk yo pap wè anyen la paske se sèlman yon bilding ki ba de etaj ki pral konstwi la.
 Lè sa a.
 Ou pa sèlman retabli orizon an, ou restore tout bagay, ou konnen.
 zòn nan tout antye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5312.021s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Se konsa, oke, Peter voye minit yo.
