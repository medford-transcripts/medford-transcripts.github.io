    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1.558s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Простите всех, я опаздываю.
 Тогда, как сказано в главе 20 Деяний 2021 года, заседание комитета по истории города Медфорда будет проводиться дистанционно.
 Представители общественности, желающие присутствовать на собрании, могут сделать это по ссылке Zoom, указанной в повестке дня.
 Публике не будет разрешено присутствовать лично, и она сможет присутствовать только удаленно на любых публичных слушаниях во время собрания.
 Да, кризис разрешился, и все уже в самолете.
 Хорошо, позвольте мне начать с нашей повестки дня.
 Питер Хедлунд Здравствуйте и добро пожаловать, увидимся здесь.
 Итак, мы ставим вас на первое место, так почему бы не начать с вас?
 Думаю, мы прогуляемся до парка Томаса Брукса.
 Я позволю вам решить эту проблему отсюда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=55.843s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Да, спасибо, Джен.
 Привет Райан и все остальные.
 Приятно познакомиться со всеми вами.
 Итак, давайте посмотрим, поделюсь ли я своим экраном.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=63.104s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ой, подожди
 Мне нужно сделать его сервером, чтобы я мог поделиться его экраном.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=69.345s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=69.865s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Подожди
 Позвольте мне добавить вас.
 Могу ли я добавить вас в качестве организатора?
 О, Райан, только Райан может это сделать, потому что я не ведущий.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=79.187s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Да, я пойду туда.
 Ждать</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=80.487s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Хорошо, извини.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=82.728s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Где ты?
 Вы здесь.
 Great co-host.
 Ладно, посмотрим, сможем ли мы продолжить или нет?
 Давайте посмотрим.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1520.35s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Является ли это возможным? Да, это было бы идеально.
 Продолжай, Джен.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1529.697s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Что вы думаете?
 Позвольте мне начать.
 Я люблю лилии.
 Я большой поклонник этого.
 Мне нравится идея иметь желтые цветы в помещении.
 Лично мне бы хотелось, чтобы с участка удалили некоторые сорняки, но я понимаю, что должен быть баланс между тем, чтобы не видеть, это всего лишь приглашение копать.
 Что меня беспокоит в золотых листьях, так это то, что листьев так много, что я не хочу, чтобы они их закрывали.
 Было бы неплохо, если бы это была каким-то образом разграниченная и охраняемая территория, где можно было бы увидеть цветы.
 Мне нравится, когда он растет длинным.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1585.317s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Идеальный.
 Итак, Джен, ты сказала, что твое беспокойство по поводу папоротников слишком скрыто?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1593.289s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Нет, я думаю о желтых цветах, боюсь, что листья будут накапливаться много лет и не будут чистыми.
 Затем мы каждый год сажаем красивые разноцветные цветы, спрятанные за осенними листьями.
 Потому что весна не обязательно должна быть красивой.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1612.681s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Не уверен.</p>

 Они наметят точки, а потом прорисуют края, понимаете, это дикие места, и у нас нет четких границ.
 Значит, вы правы, они могут пойти куда угодно, верно?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1653.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Есть ли способ создать естественную границу из камня?
 Возможно, две вещи имеют внешнюю границу, тогда цвет внутри — это способ попытаться немного закрыть ее.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1668.332s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: У меня есть это.
 Однако у меня есть версия, которая показывает трансграничное
 Было интересно поговорить с Сюзанной, потому что после разговора с ней я некоторое время разговаривал с Райаном.
 Я очень чувствителен к этому, вы знаете, вы только что провели хаотичное расследование в отношении всех членов Апелляционного комитета.
 Да, Деннис МакДугалл является одним из членов комитета?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1698.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Он наш менеджер.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1700.196s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Ну, Деннис - следующий шаг.
 Идеальный.
 Потому что, возможно, я был слишком осторожен или что-то в этом роде, но в целом Сьюзен сказала, что вы не хотите помещать туда сценарий.
 Вам просто нужно пойти немного глубже.
 Если у вас есть эти
 Во-первых, мы не знаем, где находится дом.
 Ну, это приблизительная оценка того, где я нахожусь.
 Если вы разъясните это, и вы поставите эти краеугольные камни, и вы нарисуете линию фундамента, и вы разъясните это всем, и это будет в невидимом укрытии дороги, он действительно беспокоится об этом, он беспокоится о Массачусетсе.
 Национальный исторический совет скажет «нет».
 Вы не сможете это сделать, пока сайт не будет распродан.
 Но я тоже так думаю, Джейн и я сочувствуем другому примеру, который мы видим.
 Многие люди поднимают руки, но стоит ли мне им звонить?
 Нисколько.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1768.713s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Дуг идет к Элени.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1772.603s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Анна Первого дворца.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1773.624s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1777.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Мне нравится, как этот план превратился в парк, и мне нравится использовать местные растения для создания разных пространств.
 Мне нравится лавандовая стена.
 Мне нравятся папоротники.
 Но что касается комментария Джен об уходе, это, как вы знаете, у меня частый вопрос.
 Я думаю, нас всех беспокоит все, что растет на желтых цветах, покровных листьях или других местных растениях.
 Может ли департамент городских парков проводить ежегодное техническое обслуживание?
 Я имею в виду, что уборка и дезинфекция требуют много усилий.
 Убедитесь, что вещи не слишком велики и не скрыты, или просто позвольте деревьям продолжать играть важную роль в создании различных пространств в парке.
 Я думаю, что это важная функция, которую нужно поддерживать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1834.285s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Я действительно думаю, что мы можем спросить об этом DPW.
 Конечно, мы с ними тоже разговаривали.
 Они идут туда косить траву.
 Значит, я так думаю, и это касается не только нас, не так ли?
 По всему городу есть и другие парковые проекты, финансируемые CCP.
 Существуют виды технического обслуживания, которые необходимо выполнять, чего не требует CPC.
 Так что я думаю
 Нам нужно хорошенько подумать, и я думаю, что будет более широкое обсуждение городского бюджета и того, как будут проводиться некоторые ремонтные работы, когда программа КТК вступит в силу, потому что средства КТК не могут быть использованы для ремонта.
 Например, аналогичный разговор у нас происходит о поместье Брукс.
 Поэтому я чувствую, что нам придется иметь дело с этим городом.
 Я знаю, что однажды там разговаривала группа друзей и несколько соседей.
 Так, например, в Brooks Manor мы проводим весеннюю и осеннюю уборку.
 Возможно, здесь есть что сказать соседям.
 Затем вы выходите убирать территорию раз в год или чаще.
 Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1925.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Эй, это моя единственная проблема, но мне очень нравится, как все работает.
 Да, отличная работа.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1932.39s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Да, я имею в виду, я думаю, что не знаю, вы скажите мне, что вы думаете, но мое мнение таково, что мы не должны, мы должны решить сами.
 В любом случае, я не хочу беспокоиться об осторожности, когда мы учимся, но мы не должны позволять ей мешать нашим решениям, или, может быть, нам следует, я не знаю, я хочу услышать, что говорят другие.
 Дуглас, продолжай.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1955.86s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Это верно.
 Мне нравится идея, что у сообщества парка есть некоторый интерес, вы знаете, пытаясь продвигать владение и приобретение по всему парку.
 Очевидно, что вы не можете заставить его, но было бы хорошо, если бы соседи, которые чувствуют, что они владеют парком, могли бы делать больше, чем они делают, как вы говорите, приезжать туда раз в год и немного помогать, потому что, как мы знаем, в городе до сих пор есть проблемы с содержанием.
 Я считаю, что это большой шаг вперед.
 Мне очень нравится то, что я вижу.
 Мне нравится идея исторических туров, потому что, очевидно,
 В обоих направлениях вперед и назад, идете ли вы с севера на юг или наоборот.
 У меня есть быстрый вопрос.
 Сначала я хотел устроить фотовыставку.
 Думаю, это самый северный вход, почти через мост и выглядит как пролом в стене.
 Не отличается от северного перехода?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2011.958s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Да, да.
 Эта фотография разрушенной стены находится на Каньон-стрит.
 Да, во время ходьбы будет несколько пауз.
 На самом деле здесь есть один, полугорный.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2031.04s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Питер напоминает мне, что не везде доступно.
 Мы делаем доступной парковку.
 ок
 ок
 Но не все трещины в стене доступны.
 Это правда?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2044.128s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: ок
 Вы это сделаете.
 Я имею в виду, что цель здесь, которой пока нет, — предоставить доступ.
 Поэтому, если кто-то утверждает, что сидит в инвалидной коляске где-то в парке, я более чувствителен к этому, потому что несколько лет назад я порвал крестообразную связку, подпрыгивая вверх и вниз.
 Я думал, что все в порядке, я понимаю.
 Я понимаю, почему эти правила доступа так важны.
 Но да, сюда легко добраться до дороги.
 У вас может быть доступная парковка, которая является просто знаком, потому что дорога уже есть, есть тротуары, значит, вот эта дорога.
 Да, нет необходимости посещать весь парк.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2091.472s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Я не верю в это, но я хочу это увидеть, потому что, очевидно, вы знаете, что мы пытаемся расширить доступ настолько, насколько можем, очевидно, там, где мы находимся.
 Я думаю, ты прав.
 Конечно, не более 120.
 Я проходил через это много раз
 Я не думаю, что для этого потребуется много степеней.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2107.038s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Это определенно самая плоская местность, как будто вы идете в поход.
 Затем он соскользнул в сторону железнодорожного моста.
 Дорога ветреная и крутая, поэтому это самое большое и ровное место.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2125.295s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Педро Есть ли необходимость улучшить или сократить тротуары от тротуаров до перекрестков?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2133.12s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Да, это интересный вопрос.
 Итак, если мы посмотрим, это то, что мы сделали.
 Вы здесь, чтобы говорить о разлуке.
 Это северное соединение.
 Я думаю, что это Лавин или Джексон, я в замешательстве.
 Вот мы видим наши тротуары.
 Теперь есть два способа сделать это.
 Вы можете сделать то, что вы обычно делаете, и положить асфальтоукладчик на запланированный маршрут, а затем положить асфальтоукладчик на другой стороне или использовать диаграмму скорости.
 В принципе, скоростные панели хороши тем, что могут делать две вещи одновременно.
 Они замедляют движение и автомобили, и даже если произойдет столкновение, машина его наедет.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2180.82s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Эта афера не работает.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2182.381s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Это верно.
 Эта афера не работает.
 Но было бы лучше, если бы там были отмечены детали и, может быть, какие-то знаки.
 В идеале это просто удерживает пешеходов на одном уровне.
 Это не значит, что вам нужно спуститься в механическую сферу и вернуться обратно в человеческую сферу.
 Считайте это пешеходом, но с вами может быть полезно поговорить
 DPW, пока не доделаем, потому что если здесь есть спидометр, эстакада, то придется разобраться с дренажной системой.
 А у тебя под ним водосток, и я уверен, что дорога ветреная и извилистая.
 Вода течет по этой кривой и падает.
 Поэтому, если вы строите тахометр и у вас есть склон под уклон, вам понадобится дренаж для сбора воды.
 Иногда не получается, не заработать денег, но</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2244.435s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Понимать.
 Я уверен, что встреча с городским инженерным отделом DPW будет на 100% уместной, когда мы пройдем этап разработки концепции.
 Два простых вопроса.
 Это важнее для Джен и Райана.
 Есть ли уже официальное имя Помсуолла, или люди называют его просто потому, что знают, кем он будет?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2266.053s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Это еще не официально.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2268.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Да, это определенно не официально.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2270.917s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Мы делаем это в отношении этих 100 человек.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2274.299s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Мы назвали это много лет назад, потому что знали, что контроль полностью находится на плоскости.
 Давайте посмотрим
 Отсюда и маркеры рабских стен.
 Они его удалят?
 Пока всё работает, предлагается новый логотип, способный его заменить.
 Это нормально?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2291.53s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: По словам Джона Андерсона, историческое общество в настоящее время просматривает все свои знаки и обсуждает обновление их нужной информацией.
 «Мы определенно можем принять меры в этой ситуации, если захотим, потому что сигнал особенно точен», — сказал он.
 Они делают много предположений, но нет исследований, подтверждающих их.
 Хм, конечно, да, я это знаю, почему-то известно заранее.
 Знаете, я конечно не пишу много слов об этом камне.
 Опять же, я просто хочу сказать, что «Стены Помпеи» могут быть посвящены Помпеям, вероятно, названным в честь раба.
 Что-то маленькое можно прочитать на тротуаре через дорогу, потому что этот уровень письма можно увидеть на некоторых табличках с интерпретацией, которые Петр предложил для исторической прогулки, и именно там люди действительно прочитали бы это, если бы вообще прочитали.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2360.117s">[Doug Carr]</a>: И оно идет не в том направлении, что очень опасно.
 Я имею в виду, что с этим символом должны быть миллионы проблем.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2366.062s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Да, просто пометьте это, ну, и пометьте вот так.
 Но по сути это должно быть понятно велосипедистам или прохожим.
 Могу сказать, что вы знаете, что стены Помпеи были построены в 1760-х годах.
 Знаете, на этом вся статья побольше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2385.707s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Да, для более подробной информации, я один из других членов участвующего комитета.
 Всего в двух кварталах от Мемориала Сагамора Джона.
 Как вы думаете, может быть, когда мы ставили знак на первоначальном американском историческом участке дороги, была попытка связать все воедино или слишком много Райана?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2408.11s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Сью Анна Кроули рассказала мне, что нашей первой целью было пригласить племена и коренные народы рассказать свои собственные истории и позволить им полностью решить, что они хотят сказать на доске интерпретации.
 Я на 100% уверен, что это правильно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2431.12s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Я с тобой.
 Последний вопрос или мнение заключается в том, что мы говорили о части истории этого места как о транспортном средстве, железных дорогах, каналах поблизости.
 Это не часть исторического путешествия, а может быть, так оно и есть.
 Что вы думаете об этом?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2449.449s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Я только что вошел.
 Питер, если мы вернемся к планированию участка, спланируй свой участок.
 ок
 Да.
 Я думаю, что есть возможность пройти к задней части участка и создать петлю, ну, вы знаете, соединить заднюю дорожку с передней и подъездной дорогой и превратить всю землю во что-то, чтобы вы знали, что если мы ее посадим, она приклеится к кольцевой развязке, и вы знаете, вы можете поставить приборную панель сзади.
 Может быть, они говорят о канале Миддлсекс, железной дороге и даже.
 Больше семейной истории Брукса. Поскольку вы смотрите на детский сад Брукса, есть много возможностей добавить больше знаков, чем те три знака, которые у нас есть, вы можете добавить три знака и, может быть, это, и вы знаете, может быть, мы сделаем первый знак на первом, а второй знак на втором, но вы знаете, по крайней мере, он есть, и вы знаете, что мы можем сказать, что все это.
 Чтобы узнать всю историю, он почти заставил всех уйти, сделав весь парк безопасным, потому что сзади шли люди.
 Спасибо
 Это мое мнение, просто расширьте путь истории на весь сайт и повторите его.
 Это правильно.
 Это верно.
 Сзади, если возникает большая проблема, с задней части дома к нам идет шестидюймовая труба или водосток, и весь город не знает дорогу, которую мы там нашли во время археологических раскопок.
 Так что его уже давно вырезали.
 Так что это не будет рейтинг.
 Это не будет иметь значения.
 ок
 Приятно знать.
 Это верно.
 Да, они спросили, называем ли мы это Dig Safe, но Dig Safe не знали, что оно там есть.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2568.206s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Так что все в порядке.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2569.888s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: В.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2570.628s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Спасибо за вопрос, Даг, потому что в прошлый раз мне показалось, что был хороший комментарий, и я представляю себе долгожданную историю о морских перевозках, но в определенной степени.
 Вы можете найти много информации об этом приветственном знаке.
 Добро пожаловать в парк или что-то в этом роде.
 Почему парк?
 Также хорошо, когда вы останавливаетесь в этом парке.
 Мне нравятся поезда, они очень быстрые, и я думаю, что здорово иметь возможность вернуться сюда.
 я хочу
 Прогулка еще раз убедила меня в том, что она плоская.
 Я думаю, что это может быть правдой.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2623.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Мне нравится эта идея, Райан, и я также думаю, знаешь, когда мы получаем известие от соседей о публичных собраниях, они действительно беспокоятся о последствиях, понимаешь, в этом парке все меняется.
 Но я думаю, что если мы сосредоточимся на этой области, мы сделаем здесь несколько творческих посадок, может быть, немного более тонкими и действительно постараемся сделать эту дорогу особенной.
 Это еще одна причина, по которой остальная часть парка остается прежней.
 Знаете, опять же, расчистка валежника и все такое.
 Но, похоже, мы просто концентрируемся на этой области.
 Мы сейчас ничего не делаем в зеленой зоне.
 Мы не тронем остальную дорогу, приют и то, что дети любят годами.
 И обратите внимание на этот исторический цикл.
 Я думаю, мы можем сказать, что услышали их голоса, и это был исторически хороший компромисс: вы знаете, покинуть сообщество и полюбить его таким, какое оно есть.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2690.567s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Это верно.
 Итак, как знает Питер, мы получили от КТК финансирование на перерезание всех тротуаров, а городские инженеры и участники дорожного движения заявили, что они точно не будут ставить тротуары на каждой улице, но они установят тротуары на основных перекрестках.
 Я думаю, что эти двое важны, возможно, они разойдутся.
 Отсюда другой маршрут по соображениям безопасности.
 У каждого подъезда будут тротуары, где собираются деньги.
 Имейте достаточно денег, чтобы купить плакаты.
 Тогда есть деньги на вырубку деревьев.
 Особенно если на дороге есть старые мертвые деревья, мы определенно можем сосредоточиться на этом участке, немедленно посадить его заново и дать ему снова вырасти.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2743.615s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: На Джексон-стрит со мной разговаривал мужчина. Кажется, я обычно паркуюсь перед этим домом.
 Этот красавец - его обзор: Мне очень нравятся здесь улучшения.
 Теперь эти огромные деревья стали более заметными, предстоит проделать много работы, и часто нанимать людей, которые будут делать это и делать это хорошо, зачастую недешево, но это также зависит от сообщества.
 Что вы сделали, так это увеличили стоимость всех этих активов.
 Если бы я жил в этом районе и вдруг появилась огромная каменная стена и отреставрированная кирпичная стена, это было бы позитивным шагом для сообщества.
 Пусть люди поймут, что это происходит потому, что люди там такие чувствительные.
 Я думаю, что наше вмешательство должно быть осторожным и щадящим.
 Потому что люди защищают.
 Они хотят, чтобы дела пошли лучше, но я согласен, Джен, говорят, что ты собираешься делать?
 Они очень заботливы, потому что здесь они держат своих собак и думают, что это их парк.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2822.235s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Часть потенциального генерального плана кладбища, который мы только что обсуждали, предназначена для собак, но в настоящее время не существует никаких правил, касающихся собак.
 На кладбище обсуждают, сколько людей будут выгуливать там своих собак в будущем.
 Я бы посоветовал одну вещь: возможно, если город выскажет свое мнение и начнет обеспечивать соблюдение законов о выгуле собак, они могли бы превратить часть парка Placedead в парк для собак в Медфорде, чтобы иметь место за водопадом, возможно, внутри.
 Знаете, парк Томаса Брукса становится историческим парком, вы знаете, мы думаем обо всех людях, которые пользуются этими местами, мы даем им оборудование, а если что-то забираем, то ставим это где-то еще, чтобы у всех был равный доступ.
 В это время.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2880.235s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Я тоже так думаю, то есть, раз уж я привез сюда свою собаку, ты знаешь, ты на правильном пути, потому что если попробуешь, то есть я знаю, что не дам своей собаке убежать, ты просто не знаешь, какими они будут.
 Вы не хотите, чтобы вас ударили палкой или чем-то еще.
 Вот я думаю вы знаете, думаю в будущем будут ли ограничения в деревне.
 Знаешь, может быть, это просто какой-то хороший знак, и когда мы осторожно попросим, ​​ты знаешь, не спускай свою собаку со склона здесь, если только ты не пойдешь куда-нибудь еще.
 Но опять же, я действительно сразу никого не увидел на тротуаре, пока был там, и да, это было безопаснее, чем да.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2924.395s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Питер, у меня есть вопрос, над которым тебе определенно стоит подумать.
 Есть ли другие варианты? Таким образом, одна из обязанностей города (теперь еще один город может быть частично разделен с MBTA) заключается в том, что мы должны поддерживать ограждение от MBTA.
 В то же время.
 MBTA фактически починила ваш забор, чтобы он оставался чистым.
 Есть ли что-нибудь более привлекательное и красивое, чем одежда, которую вы хотите скрыть?
 Я имею в виду, есть ли черная ссылка, которая держится дольше и в будущем исчезает до синего цвета?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2965.794s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Вот что я узнал или мы все узнали о парке, два условия в контракте заключаются в том, что вы должны поддерживать стену Маджестик стоящей и держать забор на рельсах, иначе собственность Брукса может нарушить технику, о которой, я уверен, никто не знает?
 Но да, там
 Потому что теперь есть только Chainlink?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2995.863s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: В.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2997.044s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: ок
 Управляется ли им MBTA?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3002.778s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Так что я думаю, что в городе есть забор.
 Потом я думаю, что со временем, когда люди переходят дорогу и деревья падают, МБТА делает ремонт, но забор построен некачественно.
 Поскольку все больше и больше вещей разваливается.
 Итак, вы знаете, я хочу увидеть что-то, что станет более постоянным вариантом в будущем, особенно если мы инвестируем в эту программу, вы знаете, мы также можем сделать всю территорию привлекательной.
 Даже если мы только начинаем с этой маленькой области, со временем мы всего добьемся.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3032.888s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Да, я, вероятно, вернусь с некоторыми советами, но да, определенно есть варианты получше.
 Просто не привлекает слишком много внимания, но это хороший перерыв.
 Заборы дорогие.
 Это длинный раздел, но я могу привести несколько примеров того, что это может быть, может быть, просто стоимость за фут или что-то в этом роде, погонные футы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3066.362s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Да, я хочу помешать людям резать его. Знаете, мы можем посадить что-нибудь менее агрессивное, например, у меня есть забор из проволочной сетки для колокольчиков.
 Раннее утро — это не то растение, которое вы хотите посадить здесь, потому что оно сойдет с ума, но оно создает зеленые стены и зеленые цветочные стены.
 Итак, вы знаете, что это не позволяет людям перепрыгивать через заборы, пересекать заборы и так далее.
 Так что, знаешь, возможно, нам тоже стоит об этом подумать.
 Может быть, Айви сможет это понять или что-то в этом роде.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3101.182s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ок
 Да.
 Что-то с шипами.
 Это верно.</p>

 Да.
 Даже малина, знаете ли, местные растения, фруктовые растения, такие как малина или черника.
 Это верно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3113.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ну, я просто думаю, Питер, я хочу уважать твое время, поскольку мы пришли сюда поговорить на час.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3119.62s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Так что это нормально.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3121.162s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Есть ли у кого-нибудь другие предложения?
 Ой</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3127.458s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Думаю, у меня есть вопрос, и он действительно адресован комитету: не беспокоитесь ли вы о том, что привлечете слишком много внимания к местоположению дома?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3142.51s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Я думаю
 Я думаю, что если мы сделаем что-нибудь, когда получим здесь информацию, я думаю, что я хочу предложить, это покрыть и заполнить то место, где вы собираетесь установить барьер, подобно тому, как вы думаете об этом как о коричневом поле, которое представляет собой прочную и долговечную ткань, а затем положить его ровно сверху.
 Это защитит участок от землекопов.
 Если вы захотите копать, это потребует немало усилий.
 Но, знаете, я действительно думаю, что, поскольку мы продолжаем улучшать это место, улучшать дороги и все объекты, я действительно не думаю, что проблема в людях.
 Я думаю, они сами будут контролировать ситуацию.
 Я имею в виду, такое случается время от времени, но это похоже на место, напоминающее национальный парк с десятками тысяч акров неизведанной земли.
 Так что это просто вопрос уважения к сайту.
 Чем больше мы будем обращать на него внимание и делиться его историей, тем больше людей будут уважать этот сайт и не иметь к нему никакого отношения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3223.258s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: То есть, если они верят, что его раскопали.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3229.583s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Это верно.
 Ну, мы все знаем, что там, и могут ли они представить, что там, не копая под землей?
 У нас есть несколько артефактов, которые можно увидеть с земли, так что не обязательно, чтобы радость от их поиска прошла, не так ли?
 Потому что мы знаем, что вы получаете.
 И легко говорить людям
 Археология – ограниченный ресурс.
 Когда кладешь лопату на землю и снова включаешь.
 Это делается навсегда.
 Я думаю, люди понимают.
 Наверняка найдется кто-то, кто поймет даже тех, кто часто делает подобные вещи.

 В любом случае, я думаю, ты что-то показал.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3311.672s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Ну я не указывал на что-то конкретное, но думал о чём-то похожем.
 Таким образом, он может служить глобальным пограничным постом.
 Ну это
 Верхняя шероховатая кромка гладкая, высотой около 18 см.
 Так что, если кто-то здесь и хочет перестать думать или делать что-то еще, это может быть стул.
 Эту высоту и размер я рассматривал.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3351.814s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, мне нравится изысканность вашего подхода.
 Я не знаю.
 Я не знаю, почему я не считаю это крутым, но я представляю, что это похоже на эти вертикальные элементы, но я не знаю, не знаю, это круто, но я думаю, что это требует какой-то интерпретации, понимаете.
 Люди видят эти камни только на земле.
 Я думаю, что это хорошая возможность рассказать о ферме и о том, что она собой представляет.

 Я также понимаю, что люди по соседству просто хотят, чтобы это было почти дико.
 Кажется, они искренне благодарны.
 Я думаю, что туда ходят орнитологи.
 Я думаю, в этом прелесть такого мягкого подхода, потому что вам действительно не нужно этого делать.
 Да, Эл, для меня это звучит довольно дерьмово. Похоже, BT тоже не для меня.
 Знаете, я думаю, что в том, что он почти пуст, есть некоторые преимущества.
 Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3513.582s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Ну, по мере того, как я все больше и больше собирался вместе, знакомился с некоторыми соседями и наблюдал за этим, я имею в виду, что на последней встрече возникли некоторые интересные идеи о других вещах в Филадельфии.

 Но я думаю.
 Я думаю, что мягкость – лучший подход.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3631.016s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Вы говорите о бюджете, теперь пришло время потратить остальное.
 Итак, если люди поверят, что у нас есть проект строительства парка Томаса Брукса, я бы попросил 1100 долларов, чтобы потратить их на кладбище Кросс-стрит.
 Мы
 Это означает, что Совет кладбища и попечитель могут получить 4800 долларов США по Программе малых грантов КТК.
 Я также получил грант в размере 5000 долларов от Национального исторического района «Тропа Свободы» на оценку кладбищенского камня.
 Это сэкономит дополнительные деньги на выполнение некоторой работы.
 Прежде чем проводить оценку, посетите объект, поскольку это повлияет на оценку.
 Поэтому я хотел бы попросить совет потратить 1100 долларов из оставшегося бюджета на этот проект, понимая, что осенью кладбище начнет готовить средства для поиска финансирования у КТК на ремонт кладбища.
 Так что я не знаю, у нас, наверное, осталось 5000 долларов или больше на Model B MHC.
 Есть ли районы города, которые, по вашему мнению, необходимо уделить внимание или Дугу, на которых вы хотели бы сосредоточиться в будущих проектах CBC?

 Мы попросили Университет Тафтса создать региональную структуру для их кампуса, потому что знаем, что всегда есть новые проекты, новые дополнения ко всему.
 Я не думаю, что мы еще достигли цели, но я надеюсь, что они потратят свои деньги, а не наши деньги, а не деньги города, на хороший обзор своего кампуса и основных зданий своего кампуса, о которых, я думаю, на данный момент мы знаем очень мало.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3875.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Могу я спросить, кто отвечает за связи с общественностью, и мы посмотрим, что он подготовил?
 Я имею в виду, может быть, это имеет смысл, даже если у нас есть немного денег, может быть, мы сотрудничаем с ними, чтобы они могли зарабатывать больше денег.
 То есть я очень хочу задокументировать некоторые здания, и в каком-то смысле это наша ответственность, но не все здания, я не думаю, что город должен нести за это ответственность.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3901.861s">[Doug Carr]</a>: А как насчет формата территории только для кампуса?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4492.1s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Да, мы не взимаем никаких комиссий.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4493.463s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Строительный отдел собирает лицензионные сборы, но у нас нет лицензии.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4497.369s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Все хорошо.
 Все хорошо.
 Я думаю, что за отсрочку выступления придется заплатить 500 долларов.
 Или я ошибаюсь?
 Нет, они никогда его не носили.
 Все хорошо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4504.221s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Нисколько.
 Нет, нет, мы хотим пойти этим путем, но я не знаю.
 Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4510.072s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Не знаю, не знаю, не знаю, что не пускают.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4514.894s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Нет, единственное, о чем мы сейчас просим, ​​— это о том, чтобы кандидаты платили законную плату за рекламу.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4520.517s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Это, это, это можно включить, потому что это лицензионный сбор.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4528.861s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Хм
 Да.
 Что ж, Райан уже осмотрел кладбище на Кросс-стрит, так что мы готовы к обновлению, верно?
 Идеальный.
 Есть ли какая-нибудь новая информация об этом исследовательском проекте?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4546.562s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Консультанты подали несколько заявлений в Фултон-Хайтс.
 Я обработал ваш счет.
 Они думают, что смогут сделать это в мае, и это для нас хорошая новость.
 Этот проект превзойдет мои ожидания, очень хорошо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4565.373s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Особенный.
 Есть ли Даг в парке Томаса Брукса?
 Знаете ли вы, что одобрен второй этап нашего проекта?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4580.196s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Итак, они одобрили заявку, они одобрили заявку уже давно, потому что я был там, чтобы представить и обсудить, но мы ждем ее в городской совет.
 Дуглас, ты прав?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4593.243s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Я думаю, это правильно.
 Завтра будет встреча.
 Я проверю это.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4598.706s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Будет ли утвержден второй раунд программ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4604.397s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Я так не думаю.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4606.178s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: До сих пор вижу в социальных сетях такие посты: Все проекты есть, а нас нет.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4613.42s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Позвольте мне проверить.
 Я свяжусь с вами.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4615.88s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4616.921s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Но они это сделали, они согласились.
 Но я думаю, что они, Райан, мы с тобой переписывались той ночью, и я думаю, они пытались получить
 Его нужно немного сократить, потому что они хотят, чтобы город позаботился о некоторых деревьях.
 Я сказал, что если ты это сделаешь, то ты лучше сдержишь свое слово.
 Вы говорите от имени DPW, хотя вас об этом не просили.
 Так что я думаю, они согласились, но они не согласились, это было меньше, чем требовалось, но этого было достаточно, чтобы сделать то, что Райан считал важным.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4645.373s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Это верно.
 Это верно.
 Я имею в виду, что есть деньги на раскапывание сигналов ADA.
 После этого произошло много изменений в растительных лекарственных средствах.
 Конечно, не все, но ничего страшного.
 Я думаю, это тоже имеет значение.
 Я доволен этим.
 Я имею в виду, я думаю, мы говорим, я думаю, мы говорим, они говорят нам о 200 000 или что-то в этом роде.
 Но, конечно, его, возможно, потребуется немного подправить, и вы знаете, если Департамент ботаники скажет, что они не могут, возможно, они вернутся и скажут «нет», сделайте этот раунд и позвольте им обработать весь сад.
 Другое дело, что Исламский культурный центр связался с нами и попросил письмо поддержки для их следующей помощи.
 Меня больше всего беспокоит следующее: проводит ли КТК какие-либо исследования или что необходимо для строительства или консервационного проекта?
 Потому что я знаю, что видел, как они работали на подоконнике.
 Но я думаю, что для финансирования этой работы они предоставят Коммунистической партии Китая консервативный план.
 И я ничего не вижу.
 Поэтому, как член комиссии, я бы не хотел поддерживать какие-либо субсидии, если они не соответствуют обязательствам PCC.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4719.346s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Я спрошу Терезу.
 Встреча завтра вечером.
 Сначала я поговорю с ним.
 Я ничего не вижу, Райан.
 Но это не значит, что оно не достигает исполнительного уровня.
 Это верно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4730.525s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ну, они попросили нас написать письмо, и я сказал, что если бы вы прислали нам информацию о проекте, мы могли бы включить его в повестку дня, а затем поговорить о написании письма.
 Но я не могу сказать вам написать письмо, пока мы не узнаем, как работает ваш проект.
 ок</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4747.531s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Если вы не спросите, они это сделают.
 Это верно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4751.672s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: ок
 Я имею в виду, что я думаю, что мы очень заинтересованы, и PCC очень заинтересован в том, чтобы убедиться, что у нас есть план, прежде чем мы приступим к работе, хотим мы этого или нет.
 И, знаете, приятно видеть, как окно исчезает и возвращается.
 Но я думаю, что важно понимать, что происходит.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4769.633s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Когда вы увидите, как они работают над окнами?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4771.994s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: О, и они входили и выходили из здания, по крайней мере, с декабря.
 Если вы присмотритесь повнимательнее, вы увидите, что некоторые из них были исправлены.
 Так что я не знаю, кто у них работает, но они определенно платят за это другим.
 Не знаю, попросят ли они возврат денег у КТК, но очень приятно это знать.
 Потому что я помню, что на этой встрече впервые был составлен план финансирования природоохранных мероприятий.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4799.844s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Идеальный.
 Завтра вечером проверю.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4803.545s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Это верно.
 ок
 Что еще вы хотите сказать, прежде чем мы утвердим протокол?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4814.208s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Идеальный.
 Просто простой вопрос.
 Думаю, я скажу это еще раз.
 Что произошло в поместье Брукс?
 Есть ли что-нибудь хорошее?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4822.999s">[Doug Carr]</a>: У тебя есть час?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4826.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Мы можем сохранить это для следующей встречи.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4829.665s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Поиски президента продолжаются.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4831.346s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: В.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4833.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Бог спроси твою жизнь.
 Как сверчки там.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4839.953s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Я имею в виду, они могут начать говорить людям, что, когда они получат повышение, если они не получат президента, они получат целого президента.
 Ну, потому что тогда вам всем придется работать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4853.563s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Ну, это не план, но я благодарен.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4858.127s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Это может сбить с толку некоторых людей и заставить их приложить дополнительные усилия и попытаться завести друзей.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4861.89s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Достаточно сказать: в одном заявлении о приеме на работу требовалось шесть окладов для волонтерской роли нового президента.
 Я не смог адаптироваться.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4873.108s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Да Есть ли статьи о том, что вы ищете?
 Потому что у меня есть кое-что на сайте.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4880.73s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Есть полная публикация.
 Я публикую это везде.
 Если вы его еще не видели, возможно, он есть не везде.
 Но да, он есть в упаковке на нашем сайте, скажите, пожалуйста.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4889.733s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Привет, Райан, у меня к тебе вопрос.
 Есть какие-нибудь новости на Саут-стрит?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Да, поэтому Саут-Стрит проголосовала за продолжение представления городскому совету, и я немедленно сказал им, что им нужно поговорить с Комитетом общественного развития.
 Я не уверен, был ли там Деннис, но если да, то приятно знать, были ли они там.
 Получите обратную связь и одобрение Комитета по развитию сообщества, поскольку это необходимый шаг перед подачей заявки в городской совет.
 Они должны прийти в мэрию завтра вечером, поэтому я не знаю, произойдет ли это, но я не проверял повестку дня, чтобы узнать, произойдет ли это.
 Я знаю, что Крис Бейдер на этой неделе в отпуске, поэтому в последний раз я проверял, тусуются ли они.
 Это очень плохо для HTC, но это только начало.
 Возможно, в ближайшие несколько месяцев ситуация улучшится, возможно, их внимание будет сосредоточено на вынесении вопросов на рассмотрение городского совета.
 Так что было бы хорошо, если бы они действительно встретились завтра.
 К сожалению, в силу характера повестки дня, я не думаю, что завтрашний вечер будет самым подходящим вечером для обсуждения этой темы.
 Но зная специфику дискуссии, думаю, найдутся многие, кто, естественно, будет возражать против чего-то подобного.
 Так что если они приблизятся к нему завтра, то почти наверняка завтра его убьют.
 Ратуша.
 Затем Деннис сказал, что они больше не появляются на компакт-диске.
 Так что это должно произойти.
 Это необходимо сделать до того, как идти в городской совет для завершения процедуры.
 Важно отметить, что Совет общественного развития — это наш совет по городскому планированию.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Так этого и не произошло.
 Итак, в основном,
 С прошлого раза мало что произошло.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5016.394s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Да, они хотят двигаться вперед.
 Они пытаются двигаться дальше.
 Я с нетерпением жду возможности помочь им двигаться вперед и убедиться, что они поступают правильно.
 Хорошо для них.
 Итак, я хочу, чтобы вы двигались вперед, но мне также нужно помочь вам построить свою доску.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5034.973s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Еще один вопрос, потому что ты задал его на прошлой неделе, Райан.
 У меня действительно нет проблем с антенной в здании Солтонстолл.
 Я не думаю, что нам есть что сказать, но я просто хочу убедиться, что мы находимся на одной волне.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Да, я имею в виду, что я этого не делал.
 Я думаю, мы говорим о самой архитектуре.
 Я думаю, что строительство продвигается.
 Так что мне нечего сказать и если никто не выскажется, я выскажу ваше мнение.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Да, у меня тоже нет с этим проблем.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Очень часто приходится смотреть такие плохие и уродливые вещи.
 Но я имею в виду, что причиной этого стала трагедия.
 Я имею в виду, иногда мы получаем хорошие результаты.
 Как будто они никогда не строили гигантский односторонний проект в 1993 году в Спот-Понд из-за сопротивления там.
 Так что иногда это работает.
 Иногда потребность в больших вышках сотовой связи важнее сохранения исторического наследия.
 Я имею в виду, что возле Стоунхема мы можем быть немного обеспокоены, потому что нас беспокоит характер безопасности дорожного движения.
 Стоунхэм-Сити борется за снос больницы Стоунхэм, чтобы разместить запланированный проект 40B.
 Я не знаю, смогут ли они остановить это, потому что
 40 Б обычно очень сильны, я знаю, что они не соблюдали жилищные ограничения, потому что начали другой проект после почти десяти лет борьбы с городом.
 Так что хе-хе.
 Можно делать предложения и получать отзывы по вопросам сохранения исторического наследия.
 Я имею в виду, что это место очень историческое.
 Я не думаю, что больницы имеют историческое значение, но вы знаете, что они могут попросить совета, и у нас может быть такая возможность благодаря бульвару Лейк.
 Если вы не видели его на другом конце города, то больницы Мэлдон больше нет, поэтому на ее замену есть больница.
 В этом районе самая низкая плотность психиатрических учреждений.
 Малден получит от 6 до 8 акров земли, которая будет зарезервирована на постоянной основе в рамках проекта.
 Так что это беспроигрышная ситуация для Hallmark Health и Malden.
 Мы достигли своего предела.
 На самом деле в 1950-е годы, не знаю, помните?
 Если вы были там, они переместили границу между Медфордом и Молденом, чтобы разместить больницу, потому что отделение неотложной помощи и палата для первых родов находились в Медфорде, и даже если вы были в больнице Молдена, все рождения должны быть зарегистрированы в Медфорде и Молдене.
 Поэтому они изменили границы местности.
 Итак, если вы посмотрите на Карты Google, там действительно много посевов.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5217.229s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Но это затрудняет получение паспорта для некоторых людей.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5222.312s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Это верно.
 Да, я определенно знаю.
 Я уверен, что это так.
 Я имею в виду... это здорово.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5228.555s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Место рождения</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5231.336s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Человеческой земли нет.
 Здесь есть драконы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5233.877s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ок
 Демилитаризованная зона между Менфордом и Болдуином.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5239.2s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Это верно.
 Вот почему вы можете найти свидетельства о рождении в Дорчестере.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5245.867s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Знаете, хорошо, что больница что-то делает с этим местом.
 Я поражаюсь им, знаю, что они пытаются превратить его в жилище, но удивляюсь, что вы знаете, что кто-то не пытался идти по дороге с низкой плотностью движения.
 Но вы знаете, тот факт, что после строительства этого небольшого очистного сооружения они вернули всю землю под зеленую зону, является чудом для предыдущего использования этого места.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5272.631s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Это на берегу реки Мэлдон?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5274.872s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Нет, это на диске.
 Если вы знаете, вы можете увидеть радиовышку, когда идете по Феллс-роуд в сторону Феллс-стрит, например, там, где она разделяет восток и запад.
 Смотри, там башня.
 Прежде чем вы увидите больницу Мэлдон.
 Теперь можно это не смотреть.
 Так что они там ничего не увидят, потому что там построено всего два малоэтажных дома.
 В это время.
 Вы не только восстановили подножие небес, вы восстановили все, знаете ли.
 Вся территория.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5312.021s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Хорошо, Питер прислал протокол.
 Если у кого-то есть комментарий по поводу одобрения журнала, сделайте это.
