    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1.558s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: آسف للجميع، لقد تأخرت.
 في ذلك الوقت، كما هو مذكور في الفصل 20 لعام 2021، سيتم عقد اجتماع لجنة تاريخ مدينة ميدفورد عن بعد.
 ويمكن لأفراد الجمهور الراغبين في حضور الاجتماع القيام بذلك عبر رابط Zoom المتوفر في جدول الأعمال.
 لن يُسمح للجمهور بالحضور شخصيًا ولن يتمكنوا من الحضور إلا عن بعد في أي جلسات استماع عامة خلال الاجتماع.
 نعم، لقد تم حل الأزمة، والجميع على متن الطائرة بالفعل.
 حسنًا، دعوني أبدأ بجدول أعمالنا.
 بيتر هيدلوند أهلا ومرحبا بكم، نراكم هنا مرة أخرى.
 لذلك وضعناك أولاً، فلماذا لا نبدأ معك؟
 أعتقد أننا سوف نسير إلى حديقة توماس بروكس.
 سأترك لك حل هذه المشكلة من هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=55.843s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: نعم، شكرا لك، جين.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1516.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: مدهش.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1520.35s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: هل هذا ممكن؟ نعم، هذا سيكون مثاليا.
 استمر يا جين</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1529.697s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ماذا تعتقد؟
 اسمحوا لي أن أبدأ.
 أنا أحب الزنابق.
 أنا معجب كبير بهذا.
 أنا أحب فكرة وجود زهور صفراء في الداخل.
 شخصيًا، أود أن أرى إزالة بعض الأعشاب الضارة من الموقع، لكنني أفهم أنه يجب أن يكون هناك توازن بين عدم الرؤية، فهي مجرد دعوة للحفر.
 ما يزعجني بشأن الأوراق الذهبية هو أن هناك الكثير من الأوراق التي لا أريد أن تغطيها.
 سيكون من الرائع أن تكون هذه منطقة محددة ومحمية بطريقة ما حيث يمكن رؤية الزهور.
 أنا أحب ذلك عندما ينمو لفترة طويلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1585.317s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: مثالي.
 إذن يا جين، قلت أن قلقك بشأن السرخس مخفي للغاية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1593.289s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: لا، أفكر في الزهور الصفراء، وأخشى أن تتراكم الأوراق لسنوات عديدة ولن تكون نظيفة.
 ثم نقوم كل عام بزراعة زهور جميلة ملونة مخبأة خلف أوراق الخريف.
 لأن الربيع لا يجب أن يكون جميلاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1612.681s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: غير مقتنع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1616.625s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: ما مدى شيوعها؟
 أعني، إذا قاموا بتحديد موقع المنزل، أي بعد 10 سنوات من الآن، فهل سيبدو وكأنه جيل ثانٍ من وينكا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1635.254s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: أو با كا ليميت يو نان حد سا.
 سيحددون النقاط ثم يرسمون الحواف، كما تعلمون، هذه أماكن جامحة وليس لدينا حدود واضحة.
 إذن أنت على حق، يمكنهم الذهاب إلى أي مكان، أليس كذلك؟
 أنت سعيد لو ل sevi avek راسين يو.
 Se sa yo ta fe، pa vre؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1653.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: هل هناك طريقة لإنشاء حدود طبيعية من الحجر؟
 ربما هناك شيئين لهما حدود خارجية، ثم اللون الموجود في الداخل هو وسيلة لمحاولة إغلاقه قليلاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1668.332s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: لدي هذا.
 ومع ذلك لدي نسخة تظهر عبر الحدود
 كان من المثير للاهتمام التحدث إلى سوزان لأنه بعد التحدث معها، تحدثت إلى رايان لفترة من الوقت.
 أنا حساس جدًا لهذا الأمر، كما تعلمون، لقد أجريتم للتو تحقيقًا فوضويًا مع جميع أعضاء لجنة الاستئناف.
 نعم دينيس ماكدوغال هو أحد أعضاء اللجنة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1698.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: إنه مديرنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1700.196s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: حسنا، دينيس هو الخطوة التالية.
 مثالي.
 لأنه ربما كنت حذراً للغاية أو شيء من هذا القبيل، ولكن في الأساس قالت سوزان أنك لا تريد وضع السيناريو هناك.
 كل ما عليك فعله هو التعمق قليلاً.
 إذا كان لديك هذه
 بداية، نحن لا نعرف مكان المنزل.
 حسنًا، هذا تقدير تقريبي للمكان الذي أتواجد فيه.
 إذا قمت بتوضيحها، ووضعت تلك الركائز، ورسمت خط الأساس، ووضحتها للجميع، وكانت في الغطاء غير المرئي للطريق، فهو قلق حقًا بشأن ذلك، إنه قلق بشأن ماساتشوستس.
 المجلس التاريخي الوطني سيقول لا.
 لن تتمكن من القيام بذلك حتى يتم بيع الموقع.
 لكنني أعتقد ذلك أيضًا، أنا وجين نتعاطف مع مثال آخر نراه.
 كثير من الناس يرفعون أيديهم، لكن هل يجب أن أتصل بهم؟
 مُطْلَقاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1768.713s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: يذهب دوغ لرؤية إيليني.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1772.603s">[Doug Carr]</a>: آنا القصر الأول.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1773.624s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1777.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: أحب الطريقة التي تحولت بها هذه الخطة إلى حديقة وأحب استخدام النباتات المحلية لإنشاء مساحات مختلفة.
 أنا أحب جدار الخزامى.
 أنا أحب السرخس.
 لكن فيما يتعلق بتعليق جين حول المغادرة، فهذا، كما تعلمون، سؤال شائع لدي.
 أعتقد أننا جميعًا نشعر بالقلق إزاء أي شيء ينمو على الزهور الصفراء أو أوراق الغطاء أو غيرها من النباتات المحلية.
 هل تستطيع إدارة حدائق المدينة إجراء الصيانة السنوية؟
 ما أعنيه هو أن التنظيف والتطهير يتطلب الكثير من الجهد.
 تأكد من أن الأشياء ليست كبيرة جدًا أو مخفية، أو دع الأشجار تستمر في لعب دور مهم في إنشاء مساحات مختلفة في الحديقة.
 أعتقد أن هذه ميزة مهمة يجب دعمها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1834.285s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: أعتقد في الواقع أنه يمكننا أن نسأل DPW عن هذا الأمر.
 وبطبيعة الحال، تحدثنا معهم أيضا.
 يذهبون إلى هناك لجز العشب.
 لذا أعتقد ذلك، ولسنا نحن فقط، أليس كذلك؟
 هناك مشاريع منتزهات أخرى ممولة من الحزب الشيوعي الصيني في جميع أنحاء المدينة.
 هناك أنواع من الصيانة التي يجب إجراؤها والتي لا تتطلبها تكلفة النقرة.
 لذلك أعتقد
 نحن بحاجة إلى التفكير بعناية، وأعتقد أنه ستكون هناك مناقشة أوسع حول ميزانية المدينة وكيف سيتم إجراء بعض التجديدات عندما يدخل برنامج الحزب الشيوعي الصيني حيز التنفيذ، لأنه لا يمكن استخدام أموال الحزب الشيوعي الصيني في أعمال التجديد.
 على سبيل المثال، نحن نجري محادثة مماثلة حول ملكية بروكس.
 لذلك أشعر أنه سيتعين علينا التعامل مع هذه المدينة.
 أعلم أنه في أحد الأيام كانت هناك مجموعة من الأصدقاء وبعض الجيران يتحدثون هناك.
 على سبيل المثال، في Brooks Manor نقوم بالتنظيف في فصلي الربيع والخريف.
 ربما هناك ما يمكن قوله هنا للجيران.
 ثم تخرج لتنظيف المنطقة مرة واحدة في السنة أو أكثر.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1925.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: مهلا، هذه مشكلتي الوحيدة، لكني أحب حقًا الطريقة التي يعمل بها كل شيء.
 نعم، عمل عظيم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1932.39s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: نعم، أعني، أعتقد أنني لا أعرف، أخبرني برأيك، لكن رأيي هو أنه لا ينبغي لنا ذلك، يجب أن نقرر بأنفسنا.
 على أية حال، لا أريد أن أقلق بشأن توخي الحذر عندما نتعلم، لكن لا ينبغي لنا أن ندع ذلك يتداخل مع قراراتنا، أو ربما ينبغي علينا، لا أعرف، أريد أن أسمع ما يقوله الآخرون.
 دوغلاس، تفضل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1955.86s">[Doug Carr]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 تعجبني فكرة أن مجتمع المتنزه لديه بعض الاهتمام بمحاولة تعزيز الملكية والاستحواذ في جميع أنحاء المتنزه.
 من الواضح أنه لا يمكنك فرض ذلك، ولكن سيكون من الجيد أن يتمكن الجيران الذين يشعرون أنهم يمتلكون الحديقة من فعل أكثر مما يفعلون، كما تقول، الذهاب إلى هناك مرة واحدة في السنة وتقديم المساعدة قليلاً، لأنه كما نعلم، لا تزال المدينة تعاني من مشاكل الصيانة.
 أعتقد أن هذه خطوة كبيرة إلى الأمام.
 أنا حقا أحب ما أراه.
 تعجبني فكرة الجولات التاريخية لأنه من الواضح...
 في كلا الاتجاهين للأمام والخلف، سواء اتجهت من الشمال إلى الجنوب أو العكس.
 لدي سؤال سريع.
 في البداية كنت أرغب في تنظيم معرض للصور.
 أعتقد أن هذا هو المدخل الشمالي، عبر الجسر تقريبًا ويبدو وكأنه ثقب في الجدار.
 لا يختلف عن الممر الشمالي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2011.958s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: نعم نعم.
 تقع هذه الصورة للجدار المدمر في شارع كانيون.
 نعم، سيكون هناك عدة فترات توقف أثناء المشي.
 في الواقع، هناك واحد هنا، شبه جبلي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2031.04s">[Doug Carr]</a>: يذكرني بيتر أنه غير متوفر في كل مكان.
 نجعل مواقف السيارات متاحة.
 حسنا
 حسنا
 ولكن ليس كل الشقوق الموجودة في الجدار يمكن الوصول إليها.
 هذا صحيح؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2044.128s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: حسنا
 سوف تفعل ذلك.
 أعني أن الهدف هنا، والذي لم يتحقق بعد، هو توفير الوصول.
 لذلك، إذا ادعى شخص ما أنه يجلس على كرسي متحرك في مكان ما في الحديقة، فأنا أكثر حساسية تجاه ذلك لأنني منذ بضع سنوات مضت مزقت الرباط الصليبي الأمامي بسبب القفز لأعلى ولأسفل.
 اعتقدت أن كل شيء على ما يرام، وأنا أفهم.
 أفهم سبب أهمية قواعد الوصول هذه.
 ولكن نعم، من السهل الوصول إليه عن طريق البر.
 قد يكون لديك موقف سيارات يسهل الوصول إليه، وهو مجرد إشارة لأن الطريق موجود بالفعل، وهناك أرصفة، لذلك هذا هو الطريق.
 نعم، ليست هناك حاجة لزيارة الحديقة بأكملها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2091.472s">[Doug Carr]</a>: لا أصدق ذلك، ولكني أريد رؤيته لأنه من الواضح، كما تعلمون، أننا نحاول توسيع نطاق الوصول قدر الإمكان، كما هو واضح، حيث نحن الآن.
 أعتقد أنك على حق.
 طبعا لا يزيد عن 120.
 لقد مررت بهذا عدة مرات
 لا أعتقد أن الأمر سيتطلب درجات عديدة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2107.038s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: إنها بالتأكيد المنطقة الأكثر تسطحًا، كما لو كنت تتنزه سيرًا على الأقدام.
 ثم انزلق نحو جسر السكة الحديد.
 الطريق عاصف وشديد الانحدار، لذلك هذا هو المكان الأكبر والأكثر تسطحًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2125.295s">[Doug Carr]</a>: بيدرو هل هناك حاجة لتحسين أو تقصير الأرصفة من الأرصفة إلى التقاطعات؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2133.12s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: نعم، هذا سؤال مثير للاهتمام.
 فإذا نظرنا، هذا ما فعلناه.
 أنت هنا للحديث عن الانفصال.
 هذا هو الاتصال الشمالي.
 أعتقد أنه لافين أو جاكسون، أنا في حيرة من أمري.
 هنا نرى أرصفةنا.
 الآن هناك طريقتان للقيام بذلك.
 يمكنك القيام بما تفعله عادةً ووضع الرصف على المسار المخطط ثم وضع الرصف على الجانب الآخر، أو استخدام مخطط السرعة.
 في الأساس، الشيء الجيد في لوحات السرعة هو أنها تستطيع القيام بشيئين في نفس الوقت.
 تعمل على إبطاء حركة المرور والسيارات، وحتى في حالة حدوث تصادم فإن السيارة ستدهسها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2180.82s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: هذا الاحتيال لا يعمل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2182.381s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 هذا الاحتيال لا يعمل.
 ولكن سيكون من الأفضل لو كانت هناك تفاصيل وربما بعض العلامات هناك.
 من الناحية المثالية، هذا ببساطة يبقي المشاة على نفس المستوى.
 هذا لا يعني أنه عليك النزول إلى عالم الميكانيكا ثم العودة إلى عالم الإنسان.
 اعتبر هذا أحد المشاة، ولكن قد يكون من المفيد التحدث معك
 DPW، لن ننتهي منه بعد، لأنه إذا كان هناك عداد السرعة، جسر علوي، فسيتعين علينا التعامل مع نظام الصرف الصحي.
 ولديك مصرف تحته، وأنا متأكد من أن الطريق عاصف ومتعرج.
 يتدفق الماء على طول هذا المنحنى ويسقط.
 لذلك، إذا كنت تقوم ببناء مقياس سرعة الدوران وكان لديك منحدر منحدر، فستحتاج إلى الصرف الصحي لتجميع المياه.
 في بعض الأحيان لا ينجح الأمر، لا يمكنك كسب المال، ولكن</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2244.435s">[Doug Carr]</a>: يفهم.
 أنا واثق من أن الاجتماع مع قسم الهندسة في DPW بالمدينة سيكون مناسبًا بنسبة 100% بمجرد أن نجتاز مرحلة تطوير المفهوم.
 سؤالين بسيطين.
 هذا أكثر أهمية بالنسبة لجين وريان.
 هل يوجد اسم رسمي لبومسوال بالفعل، أم أن الناس يتصلون به فقط لأنهم يعرفون من سيكون؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2266.053s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: انها ليست رسمية بعد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2268.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: نعم، بالتأكيد ليس رسميًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2270.917s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: نحن نفعل هذا من أجل هؤلاء الأشخاص المائة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2274.299s">[Doug Carr]</a>: لقد أطلقنا عليها اسمًا منذ سنوات لأننا علمنا أن التحكم كان بالكامل على متن الطائرة.
 دعونا نرى
 ومن هنا علامات الجدار الرقيق.
 هل سيقومون بإزالته؟
 بينما يعمل كل شيء، يتم اقتراح شعار جديد يمكن أن يحل محله.
 هذا جيد؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2291.53s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: وقال جون أندرسون إن الجمعية التاريخية تقوم حاليًا بمراجعة جميع علاماتها وتناقش تحديثها بالمعلومات ذات الصلة.
 وقال: "يمكننا بالتأكيد اتخاذ إجراء في هذا الموقف إذا أردنا ذلك لأن الإشارة دقيقة بشكل خاص".
 إنهم يطرحون الكثير من الافتراضات، لكن لا يوجد بحث يدعمها.
 حسنًا، بالطبع، نعم، أعلم ذلك، لسبب ما، إنه معروف مسبقًا.
 كما تعلمون، أنا بالتأكيد لا أكتب الكثير من الكلمات عن هذا الحجر.
 مرة أخرى، أنا فقط أقول أن "أسوار بومبي" يمكن أن تكون حول بومبي، ربما سميت على اسم أحد العبيد.
 يمكن قراءة شيء صغير على الرصيف عبر الشارع لأن هذا المستوى من الكتابة يمكن رؤيته على بعض اللوحات التفسيرية التي اقترحها بيتر لمسيرة التاريخ، وهذا هو المكان الذي سيقرأه الناس بالفعل، هذا إذا قرأوه على الإطلاق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2360.117s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ويسير في الاتجاه الخاطئ، وهو أمر خطير للغاية.
 أعني أنه يجب أن يكون هناك مليون مشكلة مع هذا الرمز.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2366.062s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: نعم، فقط قم بوضع علامة عليها، كما تعلم، وقم بوضع علامة عليها بهذه الطريقة.
 ولكن في الأساس يجب أن يكون واضحًا لراكبي الدراجات أو المارة.
 أستطيع أن أخبرك أنك تعلم أن أسوار بومبي بنيت في ستينيات القرن الثامن عشر.
 كما تعلمون، هذا هو بيت القصيد من هذه المقالة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2385.707s">[Doug Carr]</a>: نعم، لمزيد من التفاصيل، أنا أحد أعضاء اللجنة الآخرين المشاركين.
 على بعد بنايتين فقط من نصب ساجامور جون التذكاري.
 هل تعتقد أنه ربما عندما وضعنا اللافتة على المسار التاريخي الأمريكي الأصلي كانت هناك محاولة لربط كل شيء معًا أو الكثير من رايان؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2408.11s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: أخبرتني سو آنا كراولي أن هدفنا الأول كان دعوة القبائل والسكان الأصليين لسرد قصصهم الخاصة والسماح لهم باتخاذ القرار الكامل بشأن ما يريدون قوله على لوحة الترجمة الفورية.
 أنا متأكد 100% أن هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2431.12s">[Doug Carr]</a>: أنا معك.
 السؤال أو الرأي الأخير هو أننا تحدثنا عن جزء من تاريخ هذا المكان مثل وسائل النقل والسكك الحديدية والقنوات القريبة.
 إنها ليست جزءًا من رحلة تاريخية، ولكن ربما تكون كذلك.
 ما رأيك في هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2449.449s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لقد دخلت للتو.
 بيتر، إذا عدنا إلى تخطيط الموقع، قم بتخطيط موقعك.
 حسنا
 نعم.
 أعتقد أن هناك فرصة للذهاب إلى الجزء الخلفي من قطعة الأرض وإنشاء حلقة، كما تعلمون، ربط المسار الخلفي بالأمام والممر وتحويل كل الأوساخ إلى شيء حتى تعرف إذا زرعناها، فسوف تلتصق بالدوار ويمكنك وضع لوحة القيادة في الخلف.
 ربما يتحدثون عن قناة ميدلسكس، والسكك الحديدية، وحتى.
 المزيد من تاريخ عائلة بروكس. نظرًا لأنك تنظر إلى Brooks Daycare، هناك الكثير من الفرص لإضافة علامات أكثر من العلامات الثلاث التي لدينا، يمكنك إضافة ثلاث علامات وربما هذه، كما تعلم، ربما سنفعل العلامة الأولى على الأولى والعلامة الثانية على الثانية، لكن كما تعلم، على الأقل هناك، وتعلم أنه يمكننا أن نقول إنها كل هذه العلامات.
 للحصول على القصة الكاملة، كاد أن يجعل الجميع يغادرون عن طريق جعل الحديقة بأكملها آمنة لأنه كان هناك أشخاص يسيرون خلفه.
 شكرا لك
 هذا رأيي، فقط قم بتمديد مسار القصة إلى الموقع بأكمله وكررها.
 هذا صحيح.
 هذا صحيح.
 في الخلف، إذا كانت هناك مشكلة كبيرة، فهناك أنبوب أو مصرف بقياس ستة بوصات قادم نحونا من الجزء الخلفي من المنزل، والبلدة بأكملها لا تعرف الطريق الذي وجدناه هناك أثناء التنقيب الأثري.
 لذلك تم قطعها منذ وقت طويل.
 لذلك لن يكون هذا التصنيف.
 لن يهم.
 حسنا
 من الجيد أن نعرف.
 هذا صحيح.
 نعم، سألوا إذا كنا نسميها Dig Safe، لكن Dig Safe لم تكن تعلم بوجودها هناك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2568.206s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: لذلك لا بأس.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2569.888s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: في.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2570.628s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: شكرًا على السؤال، دوج، لأنني اعتقدت أنه كان هناك تعليق جيد في المرة الماضية، وأنا أتخيل قصة شحن طال انتظارها، ولكن إلى حد ما.
 يمكنك العثور على الكثير من المعلومات حول علامة الترحيب هذه.
 مرحبا بكم في الحديقة أو شيء من هذا.
 لماذا حديقة؟
 إنه جيد أيضًا عند الإقامة في هذه الحديقة.
 أحب القطارات، فهي سريعة جدًا وأعتقد أنه من الرائع أن أتمكن من العودة إلى هنا.
 اريد
 أقنعتني المسيرة مرة أخرى أنها كانت مسطحة.
 أعتقد أن هذا قد يكون صحيحا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2623.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: تعجبني هذه الفكرة يا رايان، وأعتقد أيضًا، كما تعلم، عندما نسمع من الجيران عن التجمعات العامة، فإنهم يشعرون بالقلق حقًا بشأن العواقب، كما تعلمون، الأمور تتغير في هذه الحديقة.
 لكنني أعتقد أنه إذا ركزنا على هذه المنطقة، فسنقوم بعمل بعض المزروعات الإبداعية هنا، ربما أكثر دقة قليلاً، ونحاول حقًا أن نجعل هذا الطريق مميزًا.
 وهذا سبب آخر لبقاء بقية المنتزه على حاله.
 كما تعلم، مرة أخرى، إزالة الأخشاب الميتة وكل ذلك.
 ولكن يبدو أننا نركز فقط على هذا المجال.
 نحن لا نفعل أي شيء في المنطقة الخضراء الآن.
 ولن نمس بقية الطريق والمأوى وما أحبه الأطفال منذ سنوات.
 وانتبه لهذه الدورة التاريخية.
 أعتقد أنه يمكننا القول أننا سمعنا أصواتهم وكان ذلك حلاً وسطًا جيدًا تاريخيًا: كما تعلمون، ترك المجتمع وحبه كما هو.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2690.567s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 لذا، كما يعلم بيتر، فقد تلقينا تمويلًا من CPC لقطع جميع الأرصفة، وقال مهندسو المدينة ومستخدمو الطرق إنهم بالتأكيد لن يضعوا أرصفة في كل شارع، لكنهم سيضعون أرصفة في التقاطعات الرئيسية.
 أعتقد أن هذين الاثنين مهمان، ربما سيذهبان في طريقهما المنفصل.
 من هنا يوجد طريق مختلف لأسباب تتعلق بالسلامة.
 سيكون هناك أرصفة عند كل مدخل حيث يتم جمع الأموال.
 لديك ما يكفي من المال لشراء الملصقات.
 ثم هناك المال لقطع الأشجار.
 خاصة إذا كانت هناك أشجار ميتة قديمة على الطريق، يمكننا بالتأكيد التركيز على تلك المنطقة وإعادة زراعتها على الفور وتركها تنمو مرة أخرى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2743.615s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: كان هناك رجل يتحدث معي في شارع جاكسون. أعتقد أنني عادة أوقف سيارتي أمام هذا المنزل.
 هذا الجمال هو مراجعته: أنا حقًا أحب التحسينات هنا.
 الآن أصبحت هذه الأشجار الضخمة أكثر وضوحًا، وهناك الكثير من العمل الذي يتعين القيام به، وغالبًا ما يكون توظيف الأشخاص للقيام بذلك والقيام به بشكل جيد أمرًا غير رخيص، ولكنه يعتمد أيضًا على المجتمع.
 ما قمت به هو زيادة قيمة كل هذه الأصول.
 إذا كنت أعيش في هذه المنطقة وفجأة كان هناك جدار حجري ضخم وجدار من الطوب تم ترميمه، فسيكون ذلك خطوة إيجابية للمجتمع.
 دع الناس يفهمون أن هذا يحدث لأن الناس هناك حساسون للغاية.
 أعتقد أن تدخلنا يجب أن يكون حذرًا ولطيفًا.
 لأن الناس يحمون.
 إنهم يريدون أن تتحسن الأمور، لكنني أتفق معك، جين، يقولون ماذا ستفعل؟
 إنهم مهتمون جدًا لأن هذا هو المكان الذي يحتفظون فيه بكلابهم ويعتقدون أن هذه هي حديقتهم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2822.235s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: جزء من الخطة الرئيسية المحتملة للمقبرة التي ناقشناها للتو مخصص للكلاب، ولكن لا توجد حاليًا قواعد تتعلق بالكلاب.
 تناقش المقبرة عدد الأشخاص الذين سيمشون كلابهم هناك في المستقبل.
 شيء واحد أود أن أقترحه هو أنه ربما إذا اتخذت المدينة موقفاً وبدأت في تطبيق قوانين الكلاب، فيمكنها تحويل جزء من Placedead Park إلى حديقة للكلاب في ميدفورد للحصول على مساحة خلف الشلالات، ربما في الداخل.
 كما تعلمون، أصبح متنزه توماس بروكس متنزهًا تاريخيًا، كما تعلمون، نحن نفكر في جميع الأشخاص الذين يستخدمون هذه الأماكن، ونمنحهم المعدات، وإذا أخذنا شيئًا ما، فإننا نضعه في مكان آخر حتى يتمتع الجميع بإمكانية الوصول على قدم المساواة.
 في هذا الوقت.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2880.235s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: أعتقد ذلك أيضًا، أعني، منذ أن أحضرت كلبي إلى هنا، فأنت تعلم أنك على الطريق الصحيح لأنه إذا حاولت، أعني أنني أعلم أنني لن أترك كلبي يهرب، أنت فقط لا تعرف كيف سيكون شكلهم.
 أنت لا تريد أن تتعرض للضرب بعصا أو أي شيء.
 لذلك أعتقد، كما تعلمون، أعتقد أنه ستكون هناك قيود في القرية في المستقبل.
 كما تعلمون، ربما يكون هذا مجرد علامة جيدة وعندما نطلب بلطف، كما تعلمون، لا تدع كلبك يبتعد عن المنحدر هنا إلا إذا ذهبت إلى مكان آخر.
 لكن مرة أخرى، لم أرى على الفور أي شخص على الرصيف أثناء وجودي هناك، ونعم، كان الأمر أكثر أمانًا من نعم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2924.395s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: بيتر، لدي سؤال يجب أن تفكر فيه بالتأكيد.
 هل هناك خيارات أخرى؟ لذا فإن إحدى مسؤوليات المدينة (الآن قد تتم مشاركة مدينة أخرى جزئيًا مع MBTA) هي أنه يجب علينا الحفاظ على السياج من MBTA.
 في نفس الوقت.
 تقوم MBTA بالفعل بإصلاح سياجك للحفاظ على نظافته.
 فهل هناك ما هو أكثر جاذبية وجمالا من الملابس التي تريدين إخفاءها؟
 يعني هل هناك رابط أسود يستمر لفترة أطول ويتحول إلى اللون الأزرق في المستقبل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2965.794s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: إليك ما تعلمته أو تعلمناه جميعًا عن الحديقة، الشرطان في العقد هما أنه يجب عليك إبقاء الجدار المهيب قائمًا والحفاظ على السياج على القضبان وإلا فإن ملكية بروكس قد تزعج تقنية أنا متأكد من أنه لا أحد يعرف عنها؟
 ولكن نعم، هناك
 لأنه الآن لا يوجد سوى Chainlink؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2995.863s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: في.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2997.044s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: حسنا
 هل يتم تشغيله بواسطة MBTA؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3002.778s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لذلك أعتقد أن المدينة لديها سياج.
 ثم أعتقد أنه بمرور الوقت، عندما يعبر الناس الطريق وتسقط الأشجار، تقوم MBTA بإجراء إصلاحات، لكن السياج تم بناؤه بشكل سيء.
 كلما تنهار المزيد والمزيد من الأشياء.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، أريد أن أرى شيئًا يصبح خيارًا أكثر ديمومة في المستقبل، خاصة إذا استثمرنا في هذا البرنامج، كما تعلمون، يمكننا أيضًا أن نجعل المنطقة بأكملها جذابة.
 حتى لو بدأنا بهذه المنطقة الصغيرة، فمع مرور الوقت سنحقق كل شيء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3032.888s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: نعم، ربما سأعود ببعض النصائح، لكن نعم، هناك بالتأكيد خيارات أفضل.
 لا تحظى بالكثير من الاهتمام، لكنها استراحة جميلة.
 الأسوار باهظة الثمن.
 هذا قسم طويل، ولكن يمكنني أن أعطيكم بعض الأمثلة عما يمكن أن يكون، ربما مجرد تكلفة للقدم أو شيء من هذا القبيل، قدم خطية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3066.362s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: نعم، أريد منع الناس من قطعها. كما تعلمون، يمكننا زرع شيء أقل عدوانية، مثل أن يكون لدي سياج من سلك الدجاج للأزهار الزرقاء.
 الصباح الباكر ليس نباتًا تريد زراعته هنا لأنه سيجن جنونه، لكنه يخلق جدرانًا خضراء وجدرانًا من الزهور الخضراء.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، فهو يمنع الناس من القفز فوق الأسوار، وعبور الأسوار، وما إلى ذلك.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، ربما ينبغي لنا أن نفكر في ذلك أيضًا.
 ربما تستطيع آيفي اكتشاف ذلك أو شيء من هذا القبيل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3101.182s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: حسنا
 نعم.
 شيء مع المسامير.
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3104.886s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: الورود
 نعم.
 حتى التوت، كما تعلمون، النباتات المحلية، ونباتات الفاكهة مثل التوت أو التوت.
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3113.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: حسنًا، أعتقد يا بيتر أنني أريد أن أحترم وقتك منذ أن جئنا إلى هنا للتحدث لمدة ساعة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3119.62s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: لذلك لا بأس.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3121.162s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: هل لدى أي شخص أي اقتراحات أخرى؟
 أوه</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3127.458s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: أعتقد أن السؤال الذي لدي، وهو موجه بالفعل إلى اللجنة، هل أنت قلق بشأن لفت الكثير من الاهتمام إلى موقع المنزل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3142.51s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: أعتقد
 أعتقد أنه إذا فعلنا أي شيء بمجرد حصولنا على المعلومات هنا، أعتقد أن ما أريد أن أقترحه هو تغطية وملء المنطقة التي ستقوم بتثبيت الحاجز فيها، على غرار الطريقة التي تفكر بها كحقل بني وهو نسيج قوي ومتين، ثم وضعه بشكل مسطح في الأعلى.
 هذا سوف يحمي المنطقة من الحفارين.
 إذا كنت ترغب في الحفر، فسوف يتطلب الأمر الكثير من الجهد.
 لكن، كما تعلمون، أعتقد حقًا أنه مع استمرارنا في تحسين هذا المكان، وتحسين الطرق وجميع المرافق، لا أعتقد حقًا أن الناس هم المشكلة.
 أعتقد أنهم سيسيطرون على الوضع بأنفسهم.
 أعني أن هذا يحدث من وقت لآخر، ولكنه يشبه مكانًا يشبه الحديقة الوطنية بعشرات الآلاف من الأفدنة من الأراضي غير المستكشفة.
 لذا فالأمر يتعلق فقط باحترام الموقع.
 كلما اهتممنا به وشاركنا قصته، كلما زاد احترام الناس لهذا الموقع وليس لهم أي علاقة به.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3223.258s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: هذا إذا كانوا يعتقدون أنه تم حفره.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3229.583s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 حسنًا، كلنا نعرف ما هو موجود هناك، وهل يمكنهم تخيل ما هو موجود دون الحفر تحت الأرض؟
 لدينا العديد من القطع الأثرية التي يمكن رؤيتها من الأرض، لذا فإن متعة العثور عليها لا يجب بالضرورة أن تتلاشى، أليس كذلك؟
 لأننا نعرف ما ستحصل عليه.
 ومن السهل إخبار الناس بذلك
 علم الآثار هو مورد محدود.
 عندما تضع المجرفة على الأرض وتقوم بتشغيلها مرة أخرى.
 يتم ذلك إلى الأبد.
 أعتقد أن الناس يفهمون.
 بالتأكيد سيكون هناك شخص سيفهم حتى أولئك الذين يفعلون مثل هذه الأشياء في كثير من الأحيان.
 لكنك تعلم
 فهل هذا حقا سيوقف الجريمة؟
 لا يهم ما إذا كانوا يفعلون ذلك أم لا.
 أي شخص يريد حقًا العمل هنا سيبحث في هذا الموقع وسيجده.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3291.215s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: لدي سؤال لك، بيدرو.

 وبالتالي، يمكن أن تكون بمثابة مركز حدودي عالمي.

 أعتقد أن هذه فرصة جيدة للحديث عن المزرعة وعن موضوعها.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3399.215s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: نعم بالتأكيد.
 أعتقد أن هذه العلامة ممكنة.
 حاولت تسجيل الدخول
 لكنها كانت فكرة جيدة قبل أن تأتي هذه الفكرة الملتوية، حتى أتمكن من تغييرها، وهذه هي فكرتي عن مكان وجود الطيور.

 ولكن إذا أردنا أن نحدث فرقاً، فقد لا يضطر الجميع إلى اتباع هذا المسار الخطي.
 ربما كذلك، أليس كذلك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3444.115s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم، أحب فكرة الدورة أيضًا.
 أعتقد أنه يعطي أكثر من ذلك بقليل
 أفهم أيضًا أن الناس في الحي يريدون فقط أن يكون الأمر بريًا تقريبًا.
 يبدو أنهم ممتنون حقًا.
 أعتقد أن مراقبي الطيور يذهبون إلى هناك.
 أعتقد أن هذا هو جمال هذا النهج اللطيف لأنه ليس عليك فعل ذلك حقًا.
 نعم، آل، هذا يبدو سيئًا جدًا بالنسبة لي. يبدو أن BT ليس مناسبًا لي أيضًا.
 كما تعلمون، أعتقد أن هناك بعض المزايا لكونها شبه فارغة.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3513.582s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: حسنًا، عندما اجتمعت أكثر فأكثر وتعرفت على بعض الجيران ولاحظت ذلك، أعني أن الاجتماع الأخير طرح بعض الأفكار المثيرة للاهتمام حول أشياء أخرى في فيلادلفيا.
 أعتقد أن بن فرانكلين توصل إلى طريقة مختلفة لتخيل شكل المنزل.
 لكن أعتقد.
 أعتقد أن اللطف هو أفضل نهج.
 يبدو أنك أتيت إلى هذا المكان بالصدفة.
 فلماذا هذه المنطقة شفافة؟
 لماذا هذه المزرعة هنا؟
 لقد فكرت دائمًا في شيء ما من C.S.

 لماذا هذه القواعد هنا؟

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3568.531s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: مثالي.
 هل لديك أي تعليقات أو اقتراحات؟
 وأنا أقدر وقتك هنا وجميع تعليقاتك.
 لدينا جميعا أفكار عظيمة.
 ومع أخذ ذلك في الاعتبار، أعتقد أنه يمكننا أن نخطو خطوة أخرى إلى الأمام.
 سأتصل بك.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3592.382s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: يبدو رائعا.

 قبل أن ننتقل إلى البند التالي من جدول الأعمال، لدينا أمر متأخر.
 لذلك آمل أن تقبل هذا.
 ريان. هل حدث أن قمت بنشر رابط حول هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3617.923s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: الجحيم لا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3618.883s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: سيكون ذلك رائعا.
 هل تريد المضي قدما؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3626.692s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: نعم، إذا كنت ترغب في تنزيلها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3629.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: نعم، حسنا، سأفعل ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3631.016s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: أنت تتحدث عن الميزانية، والآن حان الوقت لقضاء الباقي.
 لذا، إذا كان الناس يعتقدون أن لدينا مشروع توماس بروكس بارك، فسأطلب 1100 دولار لإنفاقها على مقبرة كروس ستريت.
 نحن
 وهذا يعني أن مجلس إدارة المقبرة والوصي يمكن أن يحصلوا على 4800 دولار من برنامج المنح الصغيرة التابع لـ CTC.
 لقد تلقيت أيضًا منحة بقيمة 5000 دولار من منطقة Freedom Trail الوطنية التاريخية لتقييم حجر المقبرة.
 سيوفر لك هذا أموالاً إضافية عند القيام ببعض الأعمال.
 يرجى زيارة العقار قبل إجراء التقييم لأن ذلك سيؤثر على التقييم.
 ولذلك، أود أن أطلب من المجلس إنفاق 1100 دولار من ميزانيته المتبقية على هذا المشروع، على أساس أن المقبرة ستبدأ في إعداد الأموال في الخريف للحصول على تمويل من لجنة مكافحة الإرهاب لتجديد المقبرة.
 لذا لا أعلم، ربما يتبقى لدينا 5000 دولار أو أكثر في الموديل B MHC.
 هل هناك مناطق في المدينة تشعر أنها بحاجة إلى الاهتمام أو أقواس ترغب في التركيز عليها في مشاريع CBC المستقبلية؟

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3724.039s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: حسنًا، أخبرني طائر صغير أن عائلة تافتس حاولت صنعها على جبل.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3733.541s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: هل يمكنني التحقق من وجود جدول منطقة لهذه المنطقة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3740.105s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: منذ أن اكتشفت ذلك، يمكنني أن أطلب من جون تصميم نموذج MHC B لهذا المبنى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3749.95s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: لا أعرف.
 كما تعلمون، تلك كانت شائعة سمعتها.
 لذلك أنا لا أعرف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3754.273s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لا، لا بأس.
 أعني، من الجيد أن تعرف المباني في المنطقة، وأنت تعرف ما يفعله تافتس.
 المرة التالية</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3762.743s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: أعتقد أن تافتس لديه ذلك الآن.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3764.825s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 لا، لقد كان هذا يحدث لبعض الوقت.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3769.47s">[Doug Carr]</a>: كم من الوقت يحتفظون به؟
 لا أعرف.
 لا أعرف.</p>

 لذلك أنا لا أعرف.
 لا أستطيع التحقق من مصدري، ولكن لا أريد أن أسبب لك أي مشكلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3794.919s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: المبنى على اليسار يتحرك.
 كما تعلمون، هذه هي الأساسيات.
 في هذا الوقت.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3803.947s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: يمكننا أن نفكر في كل مكان.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3805.948s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ريان. أعني، قبل بضع سنوات طلبنا من عائلة تافتس أن ينفقوا أموالهم معًا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3812.089s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لا أعتقد أننا حصلنا على أي شيء منهم.
 أوه، لقد ذهبنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3828.513s">[Doug Carr]</a>: الأمر كله يتعلق بالمنصة الإقليمية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3833.361s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: يبدو أن شخصًا ما في غرب ميدفورد يقوم بتعديل النظام.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3841.118s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: دوج، أنت تتجمد في منتصف المحادثة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3844.894s">[Doug Carr]</a>: آسف
 لقد طلبنا من جامعة تافتس إنشاء هيكل إقليمي لحرمها الجامعي لأننا نعلم أن هناك دائمًا مشاريع جديدة وإضافات جديدة لكل شيء.
 لا أعتقد أننا وصلنا إلى هذه المرحلة بعد، لكني آمل أن ينفقوا أموالهم، وليس أموالنا، وليس أموال المدينة، على نظرة عامة جيدة على حرمهم الجامعي والمباني الرئيسية في حرمهم الجامعي، والتي أعتقد أننا لا نعرف عنها سوى القليل جدًا في هذه المرحلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3875.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: هل يمكنني أن أسأل من هو المسؤول عن العلاقات العامة ونرى ماذا أعد؟
 أعني، ربما يكون الأمر منطقيًا، حتى لو كان لدينا بعض المال، ربما نتشارك معهم حتى يتمكنوا من كسب المزيد من المال.
 أعني، أريد حقًا توثيق بعض المباني، وهذه مسؤوليتنا في بعض النواحي، ولكن ليس كل المباني، لا أعتقد أن المدينة يجب أن تكون مسؤولة عن ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3901.861s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ماذا عن تنسيق منطقة الحرم الجامعي فقط؟
 هل هو كبير جدا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3907.703s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: أعني أن هناك الكثير من الأعمال الورقية، ويمكن أن يكون هناك الكثير من الأجزاء المختلفة، مثل تقسيم الزوايا الأربع التاريخية في الجزء العلوي من جزء معين من الحرم الجامعي.
 كما تعلمون، تم تطويره بشكل منفصل عن البرنامج الرئيسي، والذي تم تطويره بشكل منفصل في المناطق النائية.
 بوش
 المربع، لقلة الكلمات، أفضل حيث ينبغي أن يكون البني والبيرة (إذا كان لا يزال موجودا).
 هذا مركز تجاري مستقل.
 ثم يمكنني طرح الأسئلة حول تلك المنطقة من الحرم الجامعي وأرى ما يمكننا العثور عليه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3949.086s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ثم تم شراؤها من قبل جامعة Tufts لصالح شركة Hellaside Hardware العام الماضي.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3976.398s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: أوه، هذا مبنى رائع بالطبع.

 سيكون أمرًا رائعًا أن تحدث أشياء جيدة هناك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3987.832s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 أعني، إذا كنا بحاجة إلى خطة إعادة استخدام تكيفية، فلا بأس بذلك.
 ربما احتفظوا بالمبنى الأصلي وقاموا ببناء شيء جديد في الطابق العلوي.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3996.915s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم يمكنهم إضافة طابق أو طابقين للمبنى.

 سأحاول أن أجعلك تأتي إلى اجتماعنا التالي أو مقابلتك من خلال القول ببساطة أنني أريد تقديم نفسي وإلقاء التحية وبناء علاقة جديدة.
 كما تعلم، لقد أرسلت إليك بريدًا إلكترونيًا اليوم عندما تلقينا إذن التخطيط لـ 82 جرينليف.
 لذا راسلتهم عبر البريد الإلكتروني وقلت لهم: "مرحبًا، حسنًا، اطلب منهم إجراء الاختبار".
 حتى نتمكن من المضي قدما في أسرع وقت ممكن.
 لذلك قلت كلما حدث حريق في منزل، اطلب من المالك الإبلاغ عنه على الفور حتى نتمكن من البدء في التحرك في أقرب وقت ممكن حتى يتمكنوا من البدء في إعادة البناء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4465.097s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: طرح الأسئلة أمر غبي تمامًا لأنه يتم طرحها في سياقات مختلفة،
 إذا كنت محظوظًا بما يكفي لامتلاك عقار مؤمن عليه بشكل صحيح ويبدو أنه تعرض لأضرار ناجمة عن الحريق، فهل سيتم تضمين رسومنا في قسط التأمين الخاص بك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4490.858s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: نحن لا نفرض أي رسوم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4492.1s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: نعم، نحن لا نفرض أي رسوم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4493.463s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: تقوم إدارة البناء بتحصيل رسوم الترخيص، لكن ليس لدينا ترخيص.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4497.369s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 أعتقد أنه سيكون هناك رسوم قدرها 500 دولار لتأجيل العرض.
 أم أنني مخطئ؟
 لا، لم يرتدوه قط.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4504.221s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: مُطْلَقاً.
 لا، لا، نريد أن نسير في هذا الطريق، لكني لا أعرف.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4510.072s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: لا أعلم، لا أعلم، لا أعلم أنهم لن يسمحوا لي بالدخول.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4514.894s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: لا، الشيء الوحيد الذي نطلبه الآن هو أن يدفع المرشحون رسوم الإعلان القانونية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4520.517s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 هذا، هذا، هذا يمكن تضمينه لأنه رسوم ترخيص.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4528.861s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: حسنًا
 نعم.
 حسنًا، لقد نظر رايان بالفعل إلى مقبرة كروس ستريت، لذا نحن مستعدون للحصول على تحديث، أليس كذلك؟
 مثالي.
 هل هناك أي معلومات جديدة حول هذا المشروع البحثي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4546.562s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: قدم الاستشاريون عدة طلبات في فولتون هايتس.
 لقد قمت بمعالجة حسابك.
 ويعتقدون أنهم قادرون على القيام بذلك في شهر مايو، وهو خبر جيد بالنسبة لنا.
 هذا المشروع سوف يتجاوز توقعاتي، بشكل جيد للغاية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4565.373s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: خاص.
 هل هناك دوج في توماس بروكس بارك؟
 هل تعلم أنه تمت الموافقة على المرحلة الثانية من مشروعنا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4580.196s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لذلك وافقوا على الطلب، لقد وافقوا على الطلب منذ وقت طويل لأنني كنت هناك لعرضه ومناقشته، لكننا ننتظر عرضه على مجلس المدينة.
 دوغلاس، هل أنت على حق؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4593.243s">[Doug Carr]</a>: أعتقد أن هذا صحيح.
 سيكون هناك اجتماع غدا.
 سوف أتحقق من ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4598.706s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: هل سيتم الموافقة على الجولة الثانية من البرامج؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4604.397s">[Doug Carr]</a>: أنا لا أعتقد ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4606.178s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ما زلت أرى منشورات كهذه على شبكات التواصل الاجتماعي: كل المشاريع موجودة، لكننا لسنا كذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4613.42s">[Doug Carr]</a>: اسمحوا لي أن تحقق.
 سأتصل بك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4615.88s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4616.921s">[Doug Carr]</a>: لكنهم فعلوا ذلك، وافقوا.
 لكنني أعتقد أنهم يا رايان، أنت وأنا كنا نرسل رسائل نصية في تلك الليلة وأعتقد أنهم كانوا يحاولون الحصول عليها
 يجب تقليصها قليلاً لأنهم يريدون أن تعتني المدينة ببعض الأشجار.
 قلت إذا فعلت هذا، فمن الأفضل أن تحافظ على كلمتك.
 أنت تتحدث بالنيابة عن DPW دون أن يُطلب منك ذلك.
 لذلك أعتقد أنهم وافقوا، لكنهم لم يتفقوا، لقد كان أقل مما هو مطلوب، لكنه كان كافيًا للقيام بما اعتقد رايان أنه مهم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4645.373s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 هذا صحيح.
 أعني أن هناك أموالًا يمكن إنفاقها في البحث عن إشارات ADA.
 منذ ذلك الحين، حدثت تغييرات كثيرة في الأدوية العشبية.
 بالطبع، ليس كل شيء، ولكن لا بأس.
 أعتقد أن هذا مهم أيضًا.
 أنا سعيد بهذا.
 أعني، أعتقد أننا نتحدث، أعتقد أننا نتحدث، إنهم يخبروننا بـ 200 ألف أو شيء من هذا القبيل.
 ولكن بالطبع قد يحتاج الأمر إلى القليل من التغيير والتبديل، وكما تعلم إذا قال قسم النبات إنهم لا يستطيعون ذلك، فربما يعودون ويقولون لا، ويفعلون ذلك ويتركونهم يقومون بالحديقة بأكملها.
 والشيء الآخر هو أن المركز الثقافي الإسلامي اتصل بنا وطلب خطاب دعم لمساعدتهم القادمة.
 شاغلي الرئيسي هو: هل تقوم CPC بإجراء أي بحث أو ما هو مطلوب لمشروع البناء أو الحفاظ على البيئة؟
 لأنني أعلم أنني رأيتهم يعملون على حافة النافذة.
 لكنني أعتقد أنهم سيقدمون للحزب الشيوعي الصيني خطة متحفظة لتمويل هذا العمل.
 وأنا لا أرى أي شيء.
 لذلك، بصفتي مفوضًا، سأكون مترددًا في دعم أي إعانات مالية ما لم تكن متسقة مع التزامات PCC.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4719.346s">[Doug Carr]</a>: سأسأل تيريزا.
 اللقاء مساء الغد .
 سأتحدث معه أولا.
 أنا لا أرى أي شيء، رايان.
 لكن هذا لا يعني أنها لا تصل إلى المستوى التنفيذي.
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4730.525s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: حسنًا، لقد طلبوا منا أن نكتب خطابًا وقلت لهم إذا كنتم سترسلون لنا معلومات حول المشروع، فيمكننا أن نضعها على جدول الأعمال ثم نتحدث عن كتابة الرسالة.
 لكن لا يمكنني أن أطلب منك أن تكتب خطابًا حتى نعرف كيف يعمل مشروعك.
 نعم</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4747.531s">[Doug Carr]</a>: إذا لم تسأل، فسوف يفعلون.
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4751.672s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: حسنا
 أعني، أعتقد أننا مهتمون جدًا، ولجنة التنسيق العامة مهتمة جدًا بالتأكد من أن لدينا خطة قبل أن نبدأ العمل، سواء أحببنا ذلك أم لا.
 وكما تعلم، من الجميل أن ترى النافذة تختفي ثم تعود.
 لكنني أعتقد أنه من المهم أن نفهم ما يحدث.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4769.633s">[Doug Carr]</a>: متى ستراهم يعملون على النوافذ؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4771.994s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: أوه، لقد كانوا يدخلون ويخرجون من المبنى منذ ديسمبر على الأقل.
 إذا نظرت عن كثب، سترى أن بعضها قد تم تصحيحه.
 لذلك لا أعرف من يعمل معهم، لكنهم بالتأكيد يدفعون للآخرين للقيام بذلك.
 لا أعرف ما إذا كانوا سيطلبون من KTK استرداد الأموال، ولكن من الجيد جدًا معرفة ذلك.
 لأنني أتذكر أنه في هذا الاجتماع، تم لأول مرة وضع خطة لتمويل الأنشطة البيئية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4799.844s">[Doug Carr]</a>: مثالي.
 سوف أتحقق من ذلك مساء الغد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4803.545s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 حسنا
 هل هناك أي شيء آخر تريد قوله قبل أن نوافق على البروتوكول؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4814.208s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: مثالي.
 مجرد سؤال بسيط.
 أعتقد أنني سأقول ذلك مرة أخرى.
 ماذا حدث في بروكس مانور؟
 هل هناك أي شيء جيد؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4822.999s">[Doug Carr]</a>: هل لديك ساعة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4826.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: يمكننا حفظ هذا للاجتماع القادم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4829.665s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ويستمر البحث عن الرئيس.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4831.346s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: في.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4833.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: اسأل الله عمرك .
 مثل الصراصير هناك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4839.953s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: أعني، يمكنهم البدء بإخبار الناس أنه عندما يحصلون على ترقية، إذا لم يحصلوا على الرئيس، فسوف يحصلون على الرئيس بأكمله.
 حسنًا ، لأنه بعد ذلك سيتعين عليك العمل جميعًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4853.563s">[Doug Carr]</a>: حسنًا، هذه ليست الخطة، لكنني ممتن.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4858.127s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: قد يؤدي ذلك إلى إرباك بعض الأشخاص ودفعهم إلى بذل جهد إضافي ومحاولة تكوين صداقات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4861.89s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ويكفي أن نقول: طلب وظيفة واحد يتطلب ستة رواتب للدور التطوعي للرئيس الجديد.
 لم أستطع التكيف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4873.108s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: نعم هل هناك مقالات حول ما تبحث عنه؟
 لأن لدي شيء على الموقع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4880.73s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: يوجد منشور كامل .
 أنا أنشر هذا في كل مكان.
 إذا لم تكن قد رأيته بعد، فقد لا يكون متاحًا في كل مكان.
 ولكن نعم، إنه موجود في العبوة الموجودة على موقعنا، من فضلك أخبرني.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4889.733s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: مرحبا ريان، لدي سؤال لك.
 هل هناك أخبار عن شارع الجنوب؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: نعم، صوتت شركة South Street لمواصلة العرض أمام مجلس المدينة وأخبرتهم على الفور أنهم بحاجة إلى التحدث إلى لجنة تنمية المجتمع.
 لست متأكدًا مما إذا كان دينيس هناك، لكن إذا كان الأمر كذلك، فمن الجيد معرفة ما إذا كانوا موجودين.
 احصل على تعليقات وموافقة لجنة تنمية المجتمع لأن هذه خطوة ضرورية قبل تقديم الطلب إلى مجلس المدينة.
 ومن المقرر أن يأتوا إلى قاعة المدينة مساء الغد، لذلك لا أعرف ما إذا كان ذلك سيحدث، لكنني لم أتحقق من جدول الأعمال لمعرفة ما إذا كان ذلك سيحدث.
 أعلم أن كريس بدر في إجازة هذا الأسبوع، لذا في المرة الأخيرة التي تأكدت فيها من أنهم كانوا يتسكعون.
 وهذا أمر سيء للغاية بالنسبة لشركة HTC، ولكنها مجرد بداية.
 ربما يتحسن الوضع في الأشهر القليلة المقبلة، وربما ينصب تركيزهم على عرض القضايا على مجلس المدينة.
 لذلك سيكون من الرائع لو التقيا غدًا.
 ولسوء الحظ، ونظراً لطبيعة جدول الأعمال، لا أعتقد أن مساء الغد سيكون المساء الأنسب لمناقشة هذا الموضوع.
 لكن بمعرفة تفاصيل المناقشة، أعتقد أنه سيكون هناك الكثير ممن سيعترضون بطبيعة الحال على شيء كهذا.
 لذا، إذا اقتربوا منه غدًا، فمن المؤكد أنهم سيقتلونه غدًا.
 مبنى البلدية.
 ثم قال دينيس إنهم لم يعودوا يظهرون على القرص المضغوط.
 لذلك يجب أن يحدث هذا.
 ويجب أن يتم ذلك قبل الذهاب إلى مجلس المدينة لاستكمال الإجراء.
 ومن المهم أن نلاحظ أن مجلس تنمية المجتمع هو مجلس تخطيط مدينتنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: لذلك لم يحدث هذا أبدا.
 لذلك في الأساس،
 لم يحدث الكثير منذ آخر مرة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5016.394s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: نعم يريدون المضي قدما.
 إنهم يحاولون المضي قدمًا.
 وإنني أتطلع إلى مساعدتهم على المضي قدمًا والتأكد من أنهم يفعلون الشيء الصحيح.
 جيد لهم.
 لذا، أريدك أن تمضي قدمًا، ولكنني بحاجة أيضًا إلى مساعدتك في بناء لوحتك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5034.973s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: سؤال آخر لأنك طرحته الأسبوع الماضي يا رايان.
 ليس لدي أي مشاكل حقًا مع الهوائي الموجود في مبنى سالتونستال.
 لا أعتقد أن لدينا ما نقوله، لكني أريد فقط التأكد من أننا على نفس الصفحة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: نعم، أعني أنني لم أفعل ذلك.
 أعتقد أننا نتحدث عن الهندسة المعمارية نفسها.
 أعتقد أن البناء يتقدم.
 لذلك ليس لدي ما أقوله، وإذا لم يتحدث أحد، فسوف أعبر عن رأيك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: نعم، ليس لدي مشكلة في ذلك أيضاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: في كثير من الأحيان عليك مشاهدة مثل هذه الأشياء السيئة والقبيحة.
 ولكن أعني أنه كان بسبب المأساة.
 أعني، في بعض الأحيان نحصل على نتائج جيدة.
 يبدو الأمر كما لو أنهم لم يبنوا أبدًا المشروع العملاق أحادي الاتجاه في عام 1993 في سبوت بوند بسبب المقاومة هناك.
 لذلك في بعض الأحيان يعمل.
 في بعض الأحيان تكون الحاجة إلى أبراج خلوية كبيرة لها الأولوية على الحفاظ على التراث التاريخي.
 أعني أنه بالقرب من ستونهام قد نشعر بالقلق قليلاً لأننا نشعر بالقلق إزاء طبيعة السلامة على الطرق.
 تكافح مدينة ستونهام من أجل هدم مستشفى ستونهام لاستيعاب مشروع 40 ب المخطط له.
 لا أعرف إذا كان بإمكانهم إيقاف ذلك بسبب
 عادةً ما يكون 40B قويًا جدًا، وأنا أعلم أنهم لم يفرضوا قيودًا على الإسكان لأنهم بدأوا مشروعًا آخر بعد قتال المدينة لمدة عشر سنوات تقريبًا.
 هكذا هيهي.
 يمكن تقديم الاقتراحات والتعليقات بشأن قضايا الحفاظ على التراث التاريخي.
 أعني أن هذا المكان تاريخي للغاية.
 لا أعتقد أن المستشفيات ذات أهمية تاريخية، ولكن كما تعلمون يمكنهم طلب النصيحة وقد تتاح لنا هذه الفرصة بسبب بحيرة بوليفارد.
 إذا لم تكن قد رأيته على الجانب الآخر من المدينة، فإن مستشفى مالدون لم يعد موجودًا، لذا هناك مستشفى ليحل محله.
 المنطقة لديها أدنى كثافة من مرافق الصحة العقلية.
 ستحصل مالدن على 6 إلى 8 أفدنة من الأراضي التي سيتم حجزها بشكل دائم كجزء من المشروع.
 لذا فهو وضع مربح للجانبين لشركة Hallmark Health وMalden.
 لقد وصلنا إلى الحد الأقصى لدينا.
 في الواقع في الخمسينيات، لا أعرف، أتذكر؟
 إذا كنت هناك، فقد قاموا بنقل الحدود بين ميدفورد ومالدن لاستيعاب المستشفى لأن غرفة الطوارئ وغرفة الولادة الأولى كانتا في ميدفورد، وحتى لو كنت في مستشفى مالدن، فيجب تسجيل جميع الولادات في ميدفورد ومالدن.
 لذلك غيروا حدود المنطقة.
 لذا، إذا نظرت إلى خرائط جوجل، ستجد في الواقع الكثير من المحاصيل هناك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5217.229s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: لكن هذا يجعل من الصعب على بعض الأشخاص الحصول على جواز سفر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5222.312s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 نعم بالتأكيد.
 أنا متأكد من ذلك.
 أعني ... إنه أمر رائع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5228.555s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: مكان الميلاد</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5231.336s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لا توجد أرض بشرية.
 هناك تنانين هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5233.877s">[Doug Carr]</a>: حسنا
 المنطقة منزوعة السلاح بين مينفورد وبالدوين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5239.2s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 ولهذا السبب يمكنك العثور على شهادات الميلاد في دورتشستر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5245.867s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: كما تعلم، من الجيد أن المستشفى يفعل شيئًا بهذا المكان.
 أنا مستغرب منهم، أعرف أنهم يحاولون تحويله إلى سكن، لكني مستغرب أنك تعلم أن هناك من لم يحاول السير على طريق منخفض الكثافة.
 لكن كما تعلمون، فإن حقيقة أنه بعد بناء محطة معالجة مياه الصرف الصحي الصغيرة هذه، أعادوا جميع الأراضي إلى المساحات الخضراء هي معجزة للاستخدام السابق للموقع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5272.631s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: هل هو على ضفاف نهر مالدون؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5274.872s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لا، إنه موجود على القرص.
 إذا كنت تعرف، يمكنك رؤية برج الراديو عندما تسير في طريق فيلس باتجاه شارع فيلز، على سبيل المثال، حيث يقسم الشرق والغرب.
 انظر، هناك برج هناك.
 قبل أن ترى مستشفى مالدون.
 الآن ليس عليك مشاهدته.
 لذلك لن يروا أي شيء هناك، لأنه تم بناء مبنيين منخفضين فقط هناك.
 في هذا الوقت.
 أنت لم تعيد سفح السماء فحسب، بل أعدت كل شيء، كما تعلم.
 المنطقة بأكملها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5312.021s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: حسنًا، لقد أرسل بيتر البروتوكول.
 من لديه تعليق حول تأييد المجلة فليتفضل بذلك.
 شكرا ريان.</p>
