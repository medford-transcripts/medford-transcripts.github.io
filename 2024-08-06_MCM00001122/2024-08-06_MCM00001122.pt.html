    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1.558s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Desculpe a todos, estou atrasado.
 Pois bem, de acordo com o Capítulo 20 das Leis de 2021, esta reunião da Comissão Histórica da Cidade de Medford será realizada remotamente.
 O público que desejar acessar a reunião poderá fazê-lo através do link Zoom disponibilizado na pauta.
 Não será permitida a presença presencial de membros do público e a participação do público em quaisquer audiências públicas durante esta reunião será apenas por meios remotos.
 Pois bem, a crise foi evitada e todos entraram.
 Ok, vou começar com nossa agenda.
 Peter Hedlund, olá, bem-vindo, vejo que você está aqui.
 Então colocamos você em primeiro lugar, então por que não começamos com você?
 Acho que vamos dar uma volta no Thomas Brooks Park.
 Vou deixar você cuidar daqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=55.843s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Ótimo, obrigado Jen.
 Olá Ryan e todos os outros.
 É bom ver todos vocês.
 Então vamos ver se compartilho minha tela.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=63.104s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ah, espere.
 Preciso torná-lo um anfitrião para poder compartilhar sua tela.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=69.345s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: OK.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=69.865s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Espere.
 Deixe-me adicionar você.
 Posso adicionar você como anfitrião?

 Ótimo co-anfitrião.
 Tudo bem, veja se você consegue continuar.
 Bem, vamos ver.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1516.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Isso é ótimo.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1520.35s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Pode? Sim, isso é perfeito.
 Vá em frente, Jen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1529.697s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: O que vocês acham?
 Eu vou começar.
 Eu amo lilases.
 Eu sou um grande fã.
 Adoro a ideia das flores douradas onde ficava a casa.
 Pessoalmente, gostaria de ver um pouco do mato retirado do terreno da casa, mas entendo que tem que haver um equilíbrio entre não fazer disso um convite apenas para escavações.
 O que me preocupa nas flores douradas é que, por terem tantas folhas, não gostaria que ficassem cobertas.
 Seria muito legal se fosse uma espécie de área delimitada que permanecesse protegida de alguma forma para exibir aquele desabrochar de flores.
 E adoro que possa florescer, você sabe, por um longo período de tempo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1585.317s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bem.
 Então, Jen, você disse que sua preocupação com as samambaias é que elas ficariam muito escondidas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1593.289s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Não, acho que com as flores douradas, fico preocupado que as folhas vão se acumulando com o passar dos anos e não sejam limpas.
 E então plantamos essas lindas explosões de cores, e elas se escondem das folhas que caem a cada ano.
 Porque não seria necessariamente limpo na primavera.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1612.681s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: No, claro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1616.625s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Quanto eles se espalham?
 Quero dizer, se eles deveriam delinear onde ficava a casa, quero dizer, só pensando em daqui a 10 anos, será como, você sabe, a versão dois de Vinca?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1635.254s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: você não poderia mantê-los nesse limite.
 Eles marcavam aquele ponto e depois as bordas, sabe, são coisas selvagens e não temos uma fronteira definida.
 Então você está certo, eles poderiam ir a qualquer lugar, certo?
 E eles se espalharam com suas raízes.
 E é isso que eles fariam, certo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1653.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Existe uma maneira de fazer uma borda natural com as pedras de alguma forma,
 Talvez sejam dois andares e tenha uma borda externa e aí a cor de dentro é uma forma de tentar manter um pouco contido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1668.332s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: E eu tive isso.
 Na verdade, eu tinha uma versão que mostrava bordas tracejadas, mas
 Foi interessante conversar com Suzanne porque depois de conversar com ela, conversei um pouco com Ryan.
 Fui muito sensível a isso, sabe, você só fez uma investigação muito superficial, quer dizer, todos que estão nesta teleconferência no comitê.
 Sim, e tudo bem, Dennis McDougall está na equipe de comissão?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1698.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ele é nosso administrador.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1700.196s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sim, Dennis é o próximo passo.
 Bem.
 Porque talvez eu estivesse sendo muito cuidadoso ou algo assim, mas basicamente, disse Suzanne, você não quer colocar um roteiro aí.
 Você só foi um pouco mais fundo.
 E se você tiver esses
 Em primeiro lugar, não sabemos exatamente onde ficava a casa.
 Bem, isso é uma estimativa de onde eu estava.
 E se você deixar isso realmente óbvio e colocar essas pedras angulares e marcar as linhas de fundação e limpá-las para todos e estiver em uma área escondida que não é tão visível da rua, ela estava realmente preocupada com isso e estava preocupada com Massachusetts.
 O grupo histórico estadual diria, de jeito nenhum.
 Até que este site esteja completamente esgotado, você não poderá fazer isso.
 Mas eu estava pensando a mesma coisa, Jen, e me identifico com o outro exemplo que vimos.
 Há algumas pessoas com as mãos para cima, mas devo ligar para elas?
 Não.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1768.713s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Doug, vá em frente e depois iremos até Eleni.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1772.603s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Vá em frente primeiro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1773.624s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1777.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gosto da forma como esta planta evoluiu para o parque e gosto da utilização de plantas locais para criar espaços diferentes.
 Adoro a parede lilás.
 Eu gosto de samambaias.
 Mas em relação ao comentário de Jen sobre manutenção, esta é uma pergunta mais geral que eu tenho, tipo, você sabe,
 Acho que estamos todos preocupados em deixar tudo crescer nas flores amarelas que ficam cobertas por folhas ou outras plantas locais.
 O departamento de parques da cidade poderia sair uma vez por ano e fazer alguma manutenção?
 Quero dizer, seria um esforço muito grande para eles apenas limpar e
 garantindo que as coisas não fiquem muito grandes ou escondidas ou apenas para que o plantio ainda desempenhe um papel importante na criação desses diferentes espaços dentro do parque.
 Acho que é um recurso importante a ser mantido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1834.285s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Definitivamente acho que poderíamos perguntar ao DPW sobre isso.
 E certamente conversamos com eles.
 Eles vão lá e cortam a grama do campo e tudo mais.
 Então eu definitivamente acho isso, e não somos só nós, certo?
 Houve outros projetos de parques em toda a cidade com dinheiro do CPC.
 E tem esse tipo de manutenção que precisa ser feita e que não pode ser usada com CPC.
 E então eu acho que isso é,
 Precisamos descobrir isso e acho que haverá uma conversa mais ampla sobre o orçamento da cidade e como algumas dessas coisas de manutenção acontecem depois que os projetos do CPC entram em ação, porque o dinheiro do CPC não pode ser usado para manutenção.
 Tivemos a mesma conversa sobre Brooks Estate, por exemplo.
 Então eu sinto que sim, teremos que descobrir isso de alguma forma com esta cidade.
 Sei que a certa altura também se falou de um grupo de amigos com alguns vizinhos.
 E então, se talvez, por exemplo, em Brooks Estates, fazemos limpezas de primavera e de outono.
 Então talvez haja algo a ser dito aqui para alguns vizinhos.
 E você sai e limpa aquela área uma vez por ano ou algo parecido.
 OK.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1925.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ei, essa é minha única pergunta, mas eu realmente gosto da maneira como tudo está funcionando.
 E então, sim, muito bem feito.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1932.39s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sim, quer dizer, eu acho, não sei, vocês me digam o que pensam, mas minha opinião é que não deveríamos, deveríamos tomar nossas decisões.
 E até certo ponto, não quero me preocupar com manutenção enquanto vamos descobrir, mas não devemos deixar que isso atrapalhe nossas decisões, ou talvez devêssemos, não sei, ficaria curioso para ouvir o que outras pessoas têm a dizer.
 Douglas, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1955.86s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Sim.
 Gosto da ideia de que haja algum tipo de interesse no grupo do parque, sabe, para tentar incentivar esse tipo de propriedade e compra, sabe, em todo o parque, eu acho.
 Obviamente não se pode forçar isso, mas seria bom se os vizinhos que se sentem donos deste parque fizessem mais do que realmente fariam, como você disse, fossem lá uma vez por ano e ajudassem um pouco porque, como sabemos, a cidade está sempre lutando com manutenção.
 Acho que isso é um grande avanço.
 Eu realmente gosto do que vejo.
 Gosto da ideia do passeio histórico porque, obviamente,
 em ambas as direções, para frente e para trás, quer você esteja indo de norte a sul ou vice-versa.
 Eu tive uma pergunta rápida.
 Acho que no início tinha uma exposição de fotografia.
 Acho que era a entrada bem ao norte, quase na ponte, que parecia uma brecha na parede.
 Isso é diferente da faixa de pedestres norte, certo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2011.958s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bem, sim.
 Então aquela foto com a parede quebrada está aqui na Ravine Road.
 Sim, e há uma série de pausas conforme você avança.
 Na verdade, há um bem aqui, na metade do caminho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2031.04s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Peter, lembre-me que nem todos os pontos precisam ser acessíveis.
 Estamos tornando-o acessível a partir do estacionamento.
 Bom.
 Bom.
 Mas não é necessário que todas as fissuras da parede sejam acessíveis.
 Isso está correto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2044.128s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bom.
 Você faria isso.
 Quer dizer, o objetivo aqui, que não existe agora, seria fornecer uma rota acessível.
 Então, se há uma parte do parque onde alguém afirma estar em uma cadeira de rodas, sou mais sensível a isso quando estourei meu ligamento cruzado anterior há vários anos e fiquei pulando para cima e para baixo.
 Eu estou tipo, ok, entendi.
 Entendo por que essas regras de acessibilidade são tão importantes.
 Mas sim, então a rota acessível seria aqui.
 Você poderia ter uma vaga de estacionamento acessível, que na verdade é só sinalização porque a estrada já existe, depois a calçada, e depois esse trajeto aqui.
 Sim, não seria necessário que todo o parque fosse acessível.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2091.472s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Acho que não, mas queria dar uma olhada porque obviamente, você sabe, tentamos expandir a acessibilidade onde podemos, obviamente, onde podemos.
 E eu acho que você está certo.
 Definitivamente não passa de 120.
 Já caminhei tantas vezes.
 Acho que não é possível que sejam necessárias muitas qualificações para que isso seja acessível.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2107.038s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: E é definitivamente a área mais plana, como se você estivesse subindo.
 Mais tarde este deslize em direção à ponte ferroviária.
 O caminho serpenteia e desce bastante, por isso esta é definitivamente a zona mais larga e plana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2125.295s">[Doug Carr]</a>: E Pedro, não são necessárias melhorias ou é preciso fazer cortes na calçada desde a calçada acessível até a faixa de pedestres?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2133.12s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sim, essa é uma pergunta interessante.
 Então, se olharmos para isso, é isso... Nós fazemos isso.
 Você estava falando sobre aquela separação lá.
 Então essa seria a conexão norte.
 Acho que é Ravine ou Jackson, estou confuso.
 Então aí vemos nossa calçada.
 Agora existem duas maneiras de fazer isso.
 Você pode, o que normalmente é feito, largar a calçada e deixar seu caminho listrado e largar a calçada do outro lado também, ou pode ter uma prancha de velocidade.
 Conceitualmente, os gráficos de velocidade são ótimos porque fazem duas coisas ao mesmo tempo.
 Eles diminuem a velocidade do trânsito e dos carros, mesmo com aquele solavanco ali embaixo, os carros passam por cima dessa coisa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2180.82s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Esse golpe é inútil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2182.381s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sim.
 Esse golpe é inútil.
 Mas se houver faixas de pedestres listradas, talvez alguma sinalização, isso é feito de uma maneira legal.
 Apenas conceitualmente mantém os pedestres no mesmo nível.
 Não é que você tenha que descer ao reino dos carros e depois retornar ao reino das pessoas.
 Dê preferência aos pedestres, mas provavelmente será útil conversar com seu
 DPW antes de finalizarmos isso, porque se você tem uma tabela de velocidade aqui, um viaduto, aí você tem que cuidar da drenagem.
 E você tem drenagem descendente, tenho certeza que esta estrada é curva, coroada e
 A água corre contra essa curva e depois desce.
 Então, se você criar uma tabela de velocidade e houver uma inclinação descendo até ela, você precisará de um ralo para coletar essa água.
 E às vezes não dá, não dá lucro, mas</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2244.435s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Entendido.
 Tenho certeza de que, assim que passarmos da fase conceitual, uma reunião com o departamento de engenharia do DPW da cidade seria 100% adequada.
 Mais duas perguntas rápidas.
 Isso é mais para Jen e Ryan.
 O nome Pomswall já é oficial ou é assim que todos o chamam porque sabem o que se tornará?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2266.053s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Ainda não é oficial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2268.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ok, sim, definitivamente não é oficial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2270.917s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Fazemos isso por respeito aos 100.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2274.299s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Chamamos isso assim há anos porque sabemos que a administração está totalmente de acordo.
 Vamos ver.
 Então, o marcador de parede escravo.
 Eles vão tirar isso, certo?
 Por tudo o que é atual, propõe-se o novo letreiro que presumivelmente o substituiria.
 Bom?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2291.53s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: John Anderson disse que a Sociedade Histórica está atualmente trabalhando para revisar todas as suas placas e discutir a atualização da sinalização com informações corretas.
 E se assim o desejarmos, disse que podemos certamente tomar a iniciativa neste caso porque este sinal é especialmente incorrecto.
 Eles fizeram muitas suposições e não fizeram nenhuma pesquisa para apoiá-las.
 Hum, então certamente poderíamos remixar a próxima placa e reutilizar a pedra se ainda quiséssemos, mas também poderíamos fazer outra coisa com certeza.
 Você sabe, eu certamente não teria tanto texto naquela pedra.
 Mais uma vez, eu diria apenas “Muro de Pompeia”, e talvez o dedicaria a Pompéia e talvez nomearia os povos escravizados.
 Algo pequeno que talvez possa ser lido na calçada do outro lado da rua, porque esse nível de texto é algo que seria visto em alguma sinalização interpretativa que Peter está propondo para a caminhada histórica, e é onde as pessoas vão realmente ler, se é que vão ler.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2360.117s">[Doug Carr]</a>: E está na direção errada e é perigoso.
 E quero dizer, há um milhão de coisas erradas com esse sinal, obviamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2366.062s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim, não há problema em marcar, você sabe, é bom marcar como está.
 Mas basicamente, deve ser legível de um carro, de uma bicicleta ou de alguém que esteja passando.
 E é isso, então talvez eu apenas diga, você sabe, o muro de Pompéia construído por volta de 1760.
 E é isso, você sabe, em texto maior.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2385.707s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Ok, só mais alguns detalhes e sou um dos outros membros do comitê que se juntou.
 A apenas dois quarteirões de distância fica o Sagamore John Memorial.
 Você acha que há alguma tentativa, talvez quando fazemos a sinalização na parte dos nativos americanos da Caminhada Histórica, de tentar unir um pouco as coisas, ou isso está indo longe demais, Ryan?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2408.11s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sue Anna Crawley me disse que nosso objetivo número um deveria ser convidar tribos nativas e povos indígenas a contarem sua própria história e deixá-los ditar completamente o que querem contar naquele painel interpretativo.
 Acredito 100% que é a coisa certa a fazer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2431.12s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Estou com você aí.
 A última pergunta ou comentário foi que havíamos conversado sobre como parte da história deste local é o transporte, a ferrovia, o canal próximo.
 Isso não faz parte do passeio histórico ou talvez pudesse fazer.
 O que todo mundo pensa disso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2449.449s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Eu só vou intervir.
 Peter, se voltarmos à planta do local, a planta do seu local.
 OK.
 Sim.
 Eu acho que há uma oportunidade de envolver a parte de trás do terreno e fazer um loop, você sabe, para conectar esse caminho de trás ao seu caminho da frente e rota acessível e fazer com que todo o terreno seja algo para que, você sabe, se fizermos plantios que seja limitado àquela área circular dentro de lá, e, você sabe, então você pode colocar um painel interpretativo na parte de trás.
 Poderia haver mais coisas falando sobre o Canal Middlesex, a ferrovia, talvez até,
 mais história da família Brooks porque você está olhando para o Brooks Playstead Park naquele ponto, então há uma ampla oportunidade de adicionar mais sinalização adicional além das três que temos, você poderia adicionar talvez mais três e talvez seja isso, você sabe, talvez façamos a fase frontal na fase um e a segunda fase na fase dois, mas você sabe que pelo menos está lá e você sabe que poderíamos dizer que aqui está toda a história do local e então
 quase força as pessoas, se você quiser aprender toda a história, a dar uma volta e, portanto, tornar todo o parque seguro, porque você tem gente andando pelos fundos.
 Obrigado.
 Esse foi o meu comentário, foi apenas para estender o caminho do histórico por todo o site e fazer um loop.
 Aqui, certo.
 Sim.
 E na parte de trás, se houver um grande problema, há uma tubulação de água ou drenagem de seis polegadas que desce por trás de todo o terreno da casa e desce por aquele caminho que nós, que a cidade nem sabia que encontramos lá durante a escavação arqueológica.
 Então já foi interrompido.
 Então isso não será uma classificação.
 Não haverá um problema.
 OK.
 É bom saber.
 Sim.
 Sim, foi, eles nos perguntaram se ligávamos para Dig Safe e Dig Safe também não tinha ideia de que estava lá.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2568.206s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Então, está tudo bem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2569.888s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2570.628s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: E obrigado por levantar essa questão, Doug, porque achei que houve um ótimo comentário da última vez e imaginei a história do transporte na placa de boas-vindas, mas em certo ponto.
 Você recebe muitas informações para colocar neste sinal de boas-vindas.
 Bem-vindo ao parque, esse tipo de coisa.
 E por que o parque existe?
 E também é ótimo quando você está neste parque.
 Adoro trens e o trem passa rápido e acho que seria interessante ter a oportunidade de poder voltar aqui.
 eu gostaria
 Caminhe novamente para me convencer de que também é plano.
 Eu acho que provavelmente seria, na verdade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2623.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Gosto dessa ideia, Ryan, e também acho que, você sabe, quando ouvimos falar da vizinhança quando tivemos nossas reuniões públicas, você sabe, eles estavam obviamente preocupados em ter muito contato, você sabe, as coisas estão mudando neste parque.
 Mas acho que se nos concentrarmos nesta área, e este é o lugar onde fazemos algumas plantações criativas, talvez alguns desbastes, e realmente fazemos um esforço para tornar este circuito algo especial.
 E é também mais um motivo para deixar o resto do parque quase como está.
 Você sabe, novamente, é uma pequena limpeza de madeira morta e tudo mais.
 Mas é como se estivéssemos focando apenas nesta área aqui.
 Por enquanto não estamos fazendo nada aqui na área verde.
 Não tocaremos no resto das trilhas, nem nos galpões, nem em tudo que as crianças desfrutaram ao longo dos anos.
 E concentre-se neste ciclo histórico.
 Acho que podemos argumentar que os ouvimos, e este é um bom tipo de compromisso para a parte histórica e, você sabe, deixar o bairro e amá-lo como ele é.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2690.567s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.
 Então, só para que Peter saiba, recebemos dinheiro do CPC para fazer todos os cortes de meio-fio, todas as calçadas, o engenheiro municipal e o pessoal do trânsito disseram que certamente não colocariam calçadas em todas as ruas, mas em cruzamentos importantes.
 Eu acho que esses dois são importantes e talvez eles os espaçassem a cada
 outra rua daqui em diante, só para ficar seguro.
 Haveria um corte na calçada em cada entrada, há dinheiro para isso.
 Há dinheiro suficiente para os cartazes.
 Depois, há dinheiro para podar e replantar árvores.
 Especificamente, se houver árvores mais antigas que morreram ao longo do caminho, certamente podemos nos concentrar nesta área e replantá-las imediatamente e fazê-las crescer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2743.615s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Isso é ótimo e havia um cavalheiro na Jackson Road com quem eu estava conversando. Acho que costumo estacionar em frente a esta casa nesta casa.
 Cara legal e esse foi o comentário dele: gostei muito das melhorias aqui, mas.
 Agora essas árvores grandes estão mais visíveis e há trabalho para fazer que muitas vezes não é barato para conseguir alguém que faça e faça bem, mas contando com a comunidade.
 O que você fez já melhorou todos esses valores de propriedades.
 Se eu morasse neste bairro e de repente aparecesse esse grande muro de pedra e esse muro de tijolos restaurados, seriam passos positivos para a comunidade.
 Faça as pessoas entenderem que é isso que vai acontecer porque as pessoas ali são sensíveis.
 Acredito que nossas intervenções devem ser cuidadosas e leves.
 porque as pessoas protegem isso.
 Eles querem que isso melhore, mas eu concordo, Jen, que eles ficam tipo, o que você vai fazer?
 Eles são protetores porque é aqui que deixam seus cães irem e o consideram seu parque.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2822.235s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Uma das coisas que acabamos de discutir como parte do potencial do cemitério para o planejamento diretor são os cães e atualmente não existem regras para cães, mas.
 O cemitério está debatendo quantas pessoas irão passear com os cães lá no futuro.
 E uma das coisas que propus foi que talvez se a cidade dissesse e começasse a aplicar regras para passear com cães, existe a possibilidade de eles pegarem uma parte do Parque Placedead e transformá-lo em um parque para cães neste lado de Medford, para que houvesse um lugar para ir fora das cataratas, talvez fora de
 você sabe, o Thomas Brooks Park à medida que se torna um parque histórico, você sabe, pensamos em todos os usuários desses lugares e damos a eles as comodidades que, se tirarmos alguma coisa, damos em outro lugar para que todos tenham o mesmo acesso.
 Então.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2880.235s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Eu acho também, quer dizer, já que eu andei com meu cachorro aqui e, você sabe, você realmente fica nas trilhas porque se você tentar, quer dizer, eu sei que não deixaria meu cachorro correr solto só porque você não sabe no que eles vão intervir.
 E se eles acertarem um pedaço de pau ou algo assim, você não vai querer ser pego.
 Então eu acho, você sabe, acho que no futuro, se houvesse algum tipo de restrição dentro do loop,
 Você sabe, talvez apenas alguma boa sinalização, como pedimos gentilmente, você sabe, não deixe seus cães descerem algum tipo de rampa aqui para todos, exceto para sair em qualquer outro lugar.
 Mas, novamente, eu realmente não vejo que as vezes que estive lá e houve outras nas trilhas improvisadas, certo, certo, o mais seguro, certo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2924.395s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Peter, tenho uma pergunta e você certamente pode reservar um tempo para pensar a respeito.
 Existe alguma alternativa? Então a cidade, uma das responsabilidades da outra cidade, e talvez agora parcialmente compartilhada com a MBTA, é que devemos manter uma cerca ao longo da MBTA.
 imediatamente.
 A MBTA obviamente consertou sua cerca para mantê-la sempre limpa.
 Existe algo que seja mais atraente ou melhor para vestir e que você queira esconder?
 Quero dizer, existe um elo de corrente coberto de preto que possa ser mais durável e que desapareça no fundo verde do futuro?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2965.794s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: E isso é algo que eu aprendi, ou que todos nós aprendemos sobre o parque, que as duas estipulações na escritura eram que você tinha que manter o muro, o Muro de Pomp, de pé, e você tinha que manter uma cerca na ferrovia, ou então o Brooks Estate pode tecnicamente retirar isso, e tenho certeza que ninguém sabe disso, certo?
 Mas sim, existe
 Porque agora é só Chainlink, certo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2995.863s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2997.044s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bom.
 E a MBTA é dona disso e colocou?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3002.778s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Então acho que havia uma cerca na cidade.
 E aí eu acho que com o tempo, com gente cortando a estrada, com árvores caindo nela, a MBTA fez reparos, mas não é uma cerca muito bem construída.
 E à medida que mais coisas caem sobre ele, ele desmorona.
 Então, você sabe, eu gostaria de ver algo que fosse um substituto mais permanente no futuro, especialmente se vamos investir dinheiro neste plano, você sabe, podemos muito bem tornar toda a área atraente.
 Mesmo que nos concentremos apenas nesta pequena área para começar, acabaremos por executar tudo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3032.888s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sim, posso voltar lá com algumas sugestões, mas sim, definitivamente existem alternativas melhores que fariam isso.
 Só não chame muita atenção, mas seja um bom divisor.
 A cerca é cara.
 Esta é uma parte bastante longa, mas posso voltar com alguns exemplos do que pode ser e talvez apenas um custo geral por pé ou algo assim, pé linear.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3066.362s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim, e eu queria, você sabe, desencorajar as pessoas de cortá-lo. Você sabe, uma das coisas que poderíamos fazer é talvez plantar algumas coisas que não sejam muito invasivas, como, por exemplo, eu tenho uma cerca de arame onde planto campânulas.
 A ipomeia não é o tipo de planta que você gostaria de plantar aqui porque elas enlouquecem, mas cria uma parede verde e uma parede verde de flores.
 Então, você sabe, isso desencoraja as pessoas de tentarem pular a cerca, cortá-la, etc.
 Então, você sabe, talvez possamos pensar sobre isso também.
 Talvez Ivy possa passar por cima dele ou algo assim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3101.182s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bom.
 Sim.
 Algo com espinhos.

 Sim.
 Ou mesmo framboesa, você sabe, plantas nativas como plantas frutíferas como framboesas ou mirtilos.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3113.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ok, eu só quero, Peter, quero respeitar o seu tempo, já que estamos conversando há uma hora aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3121.162s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Alguém mais tem algum comentário?
 Oh,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3127.458s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Acho que só tenho uma pergunta e na verdade é para a comissão: até que ponto você está preocupado em chamar muita atenção para o local da casa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3142.51s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: eu acho
 Acho que se fizéssemos alguma coisa, assim que recebermos as informações aqui, acho que o que eu sugeriria é quase tampar e preencher onde você colocaria algum tipo de barreira protetora que, semelhante a como você trataria isso como um local abandonado, que é um tecido forte e durável, e depois apenas nivelar por cima com, não sei, talvez dez centímetros de solo, solo suficiente para que você possa plantar plantas leves, esse tipo de coisa, e então,
 E isso protege o local de uma escavadeira.
 Se você for cavar, será necessário um esforço significativo.
 Mas, você sabe, eu honestamente acho que à medida que continuamos a melhorar este lugar e a melhorar as estradas e todas as comodidades, eu honestamente não acho que as pessoas sejam o problema.
 Acho que eles vão se policiar.
 Quero dizer, isso acontece ocasionalmente, mas como os parques nacionais e outras coisas, há dezenas de milhares de acres lá e as pessoas não vão cavar.
 Portanto, é apenas uma questão de impor respeito pelo site.
 Quanto mais prestarmos atenção nele, quanto mais compartilharmos sua história, mais as pessoas respeitarão o site e não farão nada com ele.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3223.258s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Quer dizer, se a crença é que já foi escavado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3229.583s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.
 Pois é, ou sabemos o que tem ali e alguém pode imaginar o que tem ali e não precisar cavar no chão, certo?
 A gente tem alguns artefatos, você pode ver o tipo de coisa que saiu do chão, então não precisa, a emoção de ir procurar você mesmo acabou, né?
 Porque sabemos o que você vai encontrar.
 E é muito fácil dizer às pessoas,
 A arqueologia é um recurso finito.
 Depois de colocar a pá no chão e virá-la, pronto.
 Está feito para sempre.
 E acho que as pessoas entendem isso.
 Certamente há pessoas que, mesmo leigos que fazem esse tipo de coisa, entendem.
 Mas você sabe,
 Isso impedirá qualquer tipo de criminoso real?
 Não importa se eles fazem isso ou não.

 Eles estão perto do chão?

 Por que esses cantos da fundação estão aqui?
 Há uma placa aqui para interpretar isso, então talvez você quase descubra esta área.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3560.728s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Eu gosto disso.
 Gosto dessa abordagem como uma espécie de abordagem geral.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3568.531s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bem.
 Algum outro comentário ou opinião?
 Agradeço o tempo aqui e todos os comentários.
 Vocês são boas ideias.
 E vamos ver, pegue isso e acho que teremos mais uma volta.
 entrarei em contato
 Ryan ou outros e depois volte e refine isso um pouco.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3592.382s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Isso parece ótimo.
 Muito obrigado Pedro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3594.844s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bem.
 Muito obrigado pelo seu tempo.
 É bom ver todos vocês.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3597.045s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Tudo bem.

 Você também.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3601.708s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Tudo bem.
 Obrigado a todos por seus comentários.
 Isso foi ótimo!
 Antes de passarmos para o próximo item da agenda, temos um pedido que chegou atrasado.
 Então eu gostaria que aceitássemos isso.
 Ryan, por acaso você enviou um link sobre isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3617.923s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Oops, no.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3618.883s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muito bom então.
 Você quer seguir em frente?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3626.692s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim, se você quiser fazer upload dessas coisas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3629.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sim, ok, eu farei isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3631.016s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Pessoal, já que falamos de orçamento, esta é a época de gastar o resto do orçamento.
 Então, se as pessoas acreditarem, temos o projeto Thomas Brooks Park e estou prestes a solicitar uma despesa de US$ 1.100 para o cemitério de Cross Street.
 Nós.
 o que significa que a comissão e os administradores do cemitério conseguiram garantir US$ 4.800 do projeto de pequenas doações do CPC.
 Também recebi uma doação de US$ 5 mil da Área Histórica Nacional de Freedom's Way para realizar a avaliação das pedras do cemitério.
 Isso deixa um pouco de dinheiro extra necessário para fazer algum
 trabalho de campo antes de realizar a avaliação propriamente dita, pois isso afeta a avaliação.
 Portanto, pedirei à comissão que gaste US$ 1.100 para cobrir o orçamento restante desse projeto, com o entendimento de que o Cemitério começará a orçamentar para abordar o CPC no outono para obter verbas para restauração do Cemitério.
 Então ficamos com, não sei, provavelmente US$ 5.000 ou mais para gastar no formulário MHC B.
 Há alguma área na cidade que você possa imaginar que precisa ser abordada, ou Doug, algum projeto futuro da CBC que você queira analisar, esse tipo de coisa?
 Peter, vi sua mão levantada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3724.039s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Bem, um passarinho me contou que Tufts está procurando ferragens nas encostas.
 Bem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3733.241s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3733.541s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Posso verificar se sei que existe um formulário de área para essa área.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3740.105s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Porque descobri isso, mas sim, posso pedir ao John que prepare um formulário MHC B para aquele prédio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3749.95s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Não sei.
 Você sabe, isso é um boato que ouvi.
 Então eu não sei.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3754.273s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Não, isso é bom.
 Quero dizer, é bom saber o que é um prédio naquela área, você sabe, o que a Tufts está fazendo.
 Então,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3762.743s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Acho que Tufts é o dono agora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3764.825s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sim.
 Não, isso já existe há algum tempo.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3769.47s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Eles já são donos disso há muito tempo, Peter?
 Não sei.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3773.854s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Sim, não me lembro de eles serem donos porque eu conhecia o cara que dirigia aquela loja.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3777.958s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Não tenho certeza se é o dono, mas o pássaro de quem ouvi falar,
 Ele indicou que este era o caso.
 Então, eu não sei.
 Não posso garantir minha fonte, mas não quero lhe causar problemas, em outras palavras, mas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3794.919s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Bem, são os edifícios à esquerda que estão se movendo.
 É isso, você sabe, essencialmente.
 Então.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3803.947s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: em qualquer outro lugar que possamos pensar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3805.948s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Ryan, alguma vez conseguimos, quero dizer, anos atrás, pedimos à Tufts que preparasse algo para eles gastarem seu próprio dinheiro?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3812.089s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Acho que não recebemos nada deles.
 Ah, nós perdemos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3828.513s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Está basicamente no fórum da área.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3833.361s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obviamente, alguém em West Medford está controlando o sistema.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3841.118s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Doug, você congelou no meio da conversa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3844.894s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Desculpe.
 Pedimos à Tufts que criasse um formulário de área essencialmente para o seu campus porque sabemos que sempre há novos projetos, novas adições, tudo.
 Acho que nunca chegamos lá, mas quero que eles gastem o dinheiro deles, não o nosso, nem o da cidade, para obter uma avaliação adequada de seu campus e dos edifícios importantes desse campus, dos quais acho que teríamos muito pouco agora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3875.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Posso perguntar quem é o responsável pelas relações comunitárias e podemos ver o que ele preparou.
 Quero dizer, talvez faça sentido que, embora tenhamos algum dinheiro, talvez façamos parceria com eles para que obtenham mais retorno pelo seu investimento.
 Quer dizer, certamente estou disposto a documentar alguns dos edifícios, de certa forma essa é nossa responsabilidade, mas cada edifício, não, não acho que a cidade deva ser responsável por isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3901.861s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Que tal um formulário de área somente no campus?
 É muito grande?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3907.703s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Quer dizer, há muito para documentar e pode haver áreas diferentes, como a separação do quadrilátero histórico no topo de determinadas áreas do campus.
 Você sabe, isso foi desenvolvido separadamente do Professor's Row, que foi desenvolvido separadamente das áreas periféricas.
 Tufos.
 quadrado por falta de termo melhor no local onde está o marrom e a cerveja, se ainda estiver lá.
 É uma espécie de nó de negócios separado.
 Então posso perguntar sobre essa área em todo o campus e ver o que obtemos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3949.086s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Então a Tufts comprou no ano passado para a Hellaside Hardware.
 Sim.
 Em 2022, todo o site foi vendido.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3976.398s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Bem, é um edifício notável, isso é certo.
 Quero dizer, lugar, digamos.
 Seria ótimo se algo de bom pudesse acontecer lá.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3987.832s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.
 Quero dizer, seria ótimo se vocês gostassem de um projeto de reutilização adaptativa.
 Talvez tenham mantido o edifício original e construído algo novo em cima dele.
 Isso seria muito bom.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3996.915s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sim, eles definitivamente poderiam adicionar um ou dois andares a esse edifício.
 Seria legal, mas não foi esse o boato que ouvi, o boato que ouvi foi uma demo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4008.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Demonstre e comece de novo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4009.939s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4011.32s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bem, eles acabaram de fazer uma demonstração daquelas duas casas no alto da colina.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4510.072s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Eu não sabia, eu não sabia, eu, eu, eu, eu não sabia que eles não tinham colocado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4514.894s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Não, a única coisa que pedimos agora é que o requerente pague pela publicidade legal.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4520.517s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Tudo bem.
 E isso, isso, isso seria presumivelmente incluído porque é uma despesa de licença.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4528.861s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bom, bom.
 Sim.
 Bem, Ryan já avaliou o Cemitério Cross Street, então estamos prontos com uma atualização, certo?
 Bem.
 Alguma atualização sobre o projeto de pesquisa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4546.562s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: O consultor enviou um grande número de formulários para Fulton Heights.
 Processei sua fatura.
 Eles acham que poderão terminar em maio, o que é uma boa notícia para nós.
 Esse projeto estará à frente de onde eu pensei que estaria, então isso é bom.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4565.373s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Excelente.
 Temos Doug para Thomas Brooks Park?
 Você sabe se nossa segunda fase foi aprovada?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4580.196s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Então eles aprovaram a candidatura, aprovaram a candidatura longa porque eu estava lá para a apresentação e discussão, mas estamos à espera que eles vão à Câmara Municipal.
 Está certo, Douglas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4593.243s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Eu acho que isso está correto.
 Há uma reunião amanhã.
 Vou verificar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4598.706s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Houve um segundo lote de inscrições que tiveram que ser aprovadas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4604.397s">[Doug Carr]</a>: No me parece.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4606.178s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Continuo vendo postagens sociais do tipo, todos os projetos estão aqui e o nosso não está lá.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4613.42s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Deixe-me verificar.
 Entrarei em contato com você.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4615.88s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bem obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4616.921s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Mas eles fizeram isso, eles aprovaram.
 Mas eles, eu acho que eles, Ryan, você e eu estávamos trocando mensagens naquela noite, e acho que eles estavam tentando conseguir
 Foi necessário um pequeno corte de cabelo porque queriam que a cidade fizesse alguns trabalhos nas árvores.
 E eu disse, ok, se você fizer isso, é melhor cumprir sua parte no acordo.
 Você está falando em nome do DPW sem perguntar a eles.
 Então eu acho que eles aprovaram, mas não aprovaram, foi menos do que foi solicitado, mas o suficiente para fazer o que Ryan achou crítico.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4645.373s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.
 Sim.
 Quero dizer, há dinheiro lá para escavações, para sinalização, para cortes de ADA.
 E então houve muitas mudanças no trabalho com árvores.
 Certamente não tudo, mas tudo bem.
 E acho que isso também é importante.
 E eu estava bem com isso.
 Quer dizer, acho que dissemos, acho que dissemos, eles nos disseram cerca de 200.000 ou algo assim.
 Mas é claro que está sujeito a alguns pequenos ajustes e, você sabe, se o departamento de árvores disser que não pode fazer isso, talvez eles voltem a fazer tudo e apenas digam, não, faça esta rodada, deixe-os fazer o parque inteiro.
 Outra coisa, o Centro Cultural Islâmico nos procurou para pedir uma carta de apoio para a próxima bolsa.
 E a minha principal preocupação é: entregaram ao CPC algum tipo de estudo daquela edificação ou plano de preservação ou qualquer coisa que fosse exigida?
 Porque eu sei que vi que eles estão trabalhando nas janelas.
 Mas pensei que como condição para financiar esse trabalho, iriam fornecer ao CPC um plano de preservação.
 E eu não vi nada.
 É por isso que, como comissário, hesito em apoiar qualquer tipo de subvenção se não cumprirem as suas obrigações para com o PCC.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4719.346s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Vou perguntar a Tereza.
 A reunião é amanhã à noite.
 Vou falar com ela antes.
 Eu não vi nada, Ryan.
 Mas isso não significa que não tenha acontecido no nível administrativo.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4730.525s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sim, eles nos pediram uma carta e eu disse, se você puder nos enviar informações sobre o projeto, posso colocá-lo na agenda e então poderemos discutir a redação de uma carta.
 Mas não posso simplesmente dizer-lhe para escrever uma carta até sabermos o que está acontecendo com o seu projeto.
 Bom.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4747.531s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Se você não pedisse, eles pediriam.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4751.672s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bom.
 Quer dizer, acho que temos sido bastante inflexíveis, e o PCC tem sido bastante inflexível em garantir que haja planos em vigor antes que o trabalho continue, quer queiramos ou não.
 E, você sabe, quando vi as janelas desaparecerem e serem restauradas, foi bom.
 Mas acho importante saber o que está acontecendo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4769.633s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Quando você viu que eles estavam trabalhando nas janelas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4771.994s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Ah, eles entram e saem do prédio pelo menos desde dezembro.
 Então se você passar verá que alguns deles foram restaurados.
 Portanto, não sei quem faz o trabalho para eles, mas obviamente estão pagando alguém para fazer isso.
 Não sei se solicitaram algum tipo de reembolso ao CPC, mas seria bom saber.
 porque me lembro de estar naquela reunião que estava condicionada ao fato de que para financiar aquele trabalho de preservação eles primeiro fizessem um plano.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4799.844s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Bem.
 Vou verificar amanhã à noite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4803.545s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sim.
 Bom.
 Alguém tem mais alguma coisa antes de aprovarmos a ata da reunião?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4814.208s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bem.
 Apenas uma pergunta rápida.
 Acho que vou mencionar isso novamente.
 O que está acontecendo com Brooks Estate?
 Algo bom?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4822.999s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Você tem uma hora?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4826.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Podemos guardá-lo para a próxima reunião.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4829.665s">[Doug Carr]</a>: A busca pelo presidente continua.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4831.346s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4833.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Por favor, Senhor, pergunte à sua rede.
 É como grilos lá fora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4839.953s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bem, quero dizer, eles podem começar a dizer às pessoas que, ao melhorarem o seu jogo, se não conseguirem um presidente, estarão prestes a ter presidentes inteiros.
 certo, porque todos vocês assumem o trabalho, então.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4853.563s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Sim, esse não é o plano, mas agradeço.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4858.127s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Isso pode constranger algumas pessoas e forçá-las a intensificar o jogo e tentar fazer alguns amigos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4861.89s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Direi apenas o seguinte: um requerimento pedia um salário de seis dígitos para o cargo totalmente voluntário de novo presidente.
 Eu não consegui me acomodar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4873.108s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Sim, há algo escrito sobre o que você está procurando?
 Porque tenho alguns deles no site.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4880.73s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Existe uma publicação completa.
 Eu postei em todos os lugares.
 Talvez não em todos os lugares, se você ainda não viu.
 Mas sim, está no kit em nosso site e me avise.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4889.733s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Olá Ryan, tenho uma pergunta para você.
 Há alguma atualização sobre South Street?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim, então South Street votou para avançar com a apresentação ao Conselho Municipal, e eu rapidamente disse a eles que precisavam conversar com o Conselho de Desenvolvimento Comunitário.
 Não tenho certeza se Dennis ainda está aqui, mas se estiver, seria ótimo saber se eles vieram antes do
 conselho de desenvolvimento comunitário para obter sua opinião e aprovação, porque esse é um passo necessário antes de ir ao conselho municipal.
 Eles deveriam ir à Câmara Municipal amanhã à noite, então não sei se isso vai acontecer, mas não verifiquei a agenda para ver se estava lá.
 Eu sei que Chris Bader está de férias esta semana, então da última vez que verifiquei eles não estavam saindo juntos.
 Portanto, certamente não parece bom para a HTC, mas isso é apenas um passo.
 Talvez nos próximos meses eles melhorem, talvez o foco deles seja levar isso à Câmara Municipal.
 Então, se eles realmente se encontrarem amanhã, talvez seja bom.
 Infelizmente, dada a natureza da ordem do dia, não creio que amanhã à noite seja a melhor noite para abordar o tema.
 Mas conhecendo a natureza particular da discussão que está prestes a ter lugar, penso que haverá muitas pessoas que naturalmente se oporão a algo como isto.
 Portanto, eles quase o mandarão para a sentença de morte amanhã se o abordarem amanhã.
 Prefeitura.
 Então Dennis disse que eles ainda não haviam aparecido diante do painel do CD.
 Então isso terá que acontecer.
 Isso tem que acontecer antes de irem à Câmara Municipal para concluir o processo.
 Basicamente, o Conselho de Desenvolvimento Comunitário é o nosso conselho de planejamento urbano.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Então isso simplesmente não aconteceu.
 Então, essencialmente,
 Não aconteceu muita coisa desde o último.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5016.394s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim, eles querem seguir em frente.
 Eles estão tentando seguir em frente.
 E estou ansioso para ajudá-los a seguir em frente e ter certeza de que estão fazendo tudo certo.
 Bom para eles.
 Então, quero que eles sigam em frente, mas também preciso ajudá-los a construir o tabuleiro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5034.973s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Outra pergunta, porque você distribuiu semana passada, Ryan.
 Certamente não tenho problemas com as antenas do edifício Saltonstall.
 Imagino que não temos nada a dizer, mas só quero garantir que haja consenso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim, quero dizer, eu não tinha nenhum.
 Acho que dissemos o que íamos dizer sobre o edifício em si.
 Acho que os projetos de construção simplesmente avançam.
 Então, não tenho nada a dizer e, se ninguém mais tiver, apenas enviarei nossos comentários.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sim, também não tenho comentários.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: É muito comum receber esse tipo de coisa terrível e de má qualidade para revisar.
 Mas quero dizer, é a natureza da revisão que a desencadeia.
 Quero dizer, às vezes pegamos os bons.
 Como se eles nunca tivessem construído o enorme monopolo na 93ª em Spot Pond por causa da oposição lá.
 Então às vezes funciona.
 Às vezes, a necessidade de uma torre de celular supergrande prevalece sobre a preservação histórica.
 Direi que na vizinha Stoneham podemos estar um pouco preocupados porque estamos preocupados com a natureza da segurança rodoviária.
 A cidade de Stoneham está lutando pela demolição do Hospital Stoneham para um projeto planejado de 40B.
 Não sei se eles conseguirão impedir isso porque
 40 B costuma ser bem forte e sei que eles não atendem aos limites habitacionais devido a outro projeto que começou depois de quase uma década de luta com a cidade.
 Então, hein.
 Eles podem solicitá-lo e podemos receber feedback quando se trata de preservação histórica.
 Quer dizer, o site é meio histórico.
 Não acho que o hospital seja histórico de forma alguma, mas você sabe, eles podem pedir comentários e podemos ter a oportunidade de fazer isso por causa da avenida, da lagoa, etc.
 E se você ainda não viu isso do outro lado da cidade, o Hospital Malden não existe mais, então está prestes a ser substituído por um
 instalações de cuidados de saúde mental de última geração e de densidade muito baixa para esse local.
 E a cidade de Malden está a recuperar cerca de seis ou oito acres de terra que serão permanentemente preservados como parte deste projecto.
 Portanto, é uma situação em que todos ganham para a Hallmark Health e para a cidade de Malden.
 E estamos no limite.
 Na verdade, nos anos 50, não sei se as pessoas se lembram,
 Se você estivesse aqui, então eles mudaram a fronteira de Medford e Malden para acomodar o hospital porque o pronto-socorro e a maternidade estavam originalmente em Medford e eles tiveram que registrar todos os nascimentos em Medford e Malden, mesmo que você estivesse no hospital de Malden.
 Então eles literalmente mudaram a fronteira naquela área específica.
 Portanto, há literalmente um pequeno recorte quando você olha o Google Maps.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5217.229s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Mas isso torna muito difícil para algumas pessoas conseguirem passaportes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5222.312s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim.
 Sim, tenho certeza que sim.
 Tenho certeza que sim.
 Quero dizer... Incrível.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5228.555s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Local de nascimento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5231.336s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Terra de ninguém.
 Existem dragões aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5233.877s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Bom.
 A DMZ entre Menford e Baldwin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5239.2s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sim.
 É por isso que em Dorchester você consegue uma certidão de nascimento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5245.867s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Você sabe, é bom que o hospital finalmente esteja fazendo algo com esse site.
 Fiquei surpreso que eles, eu sei que eles tentaram transformá-lo em moradia, mas estou surpreso que, você sabe, alguém não tenha tentado seguir um caminho de baixa densidade ali.
 Mas, você sabe, o fato de que eles estão reivindicando toda aquela terra como espaço verde depois de construir esta pequena unidade de saúde é uma espécie de belo tributo à finalidade para a qual o local era usado anteriormente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5272.631s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Isso fica no rio Malden?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5274.872s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Não, fica nas terras altas.
 Se você sabe, a torre de rádio de onde você pode ver, digamos, você está subindo Fells Way em direção a Fells Way, onde ela se divide entre oeste e leste.
 Se você olhar para cima, lá está a torre.
 E anteriormente você podia ver o Hospital Malden lá.
 Você não pode ver isso agora.
 Então eles não conseguirão ver nada ali porque apenas um prédio baixo de dois andares será construído ali.
 Então.
 Você não só recupera o horizonte, você recupera tudo, você sabe.
 Toda aquela área.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5312.021s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Então, tudo bem, Peter enviou a ata da reunião.
 Se alguém quiser fazer uma moção para aprovar a ata da reunião, faça-o.
 Obrigado, Ryan.</p>
