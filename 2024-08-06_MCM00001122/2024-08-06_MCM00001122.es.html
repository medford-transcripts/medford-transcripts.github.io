 Peter Hedlund, hola, bienvenido, veo que estás aquí.
 Así que te pusimos a ti primero, así que ¿por qué no empezamos contigo?
 Creo que vamos a dar la vuelta al parque Thomas Brooks.
 Te dejaré tomarlo desde aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=55.843s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Genial, gracias Jen.

 Ahí estás.
 Gran coanfitrión.
 Muy bien, mira si puedes seguir adelante.
 Bien, veamos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1516.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Es genial.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1520.35s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: ¿Puedes? Sí, eso es perfecto.
 Adelante, Jen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1529.697s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ¿Qué piensan todos?
 Empezaré.
 Me encantan las lilas.
 Soy un gran admirador.
 Me encanta la idea de las flores doradas donde estaba la casa.
 Personalmente, me gustaría ver que se eliminen algunos de los matorrales del sitio de la casa, pero entiendo que tiene que haber un equilibrio entre no convertirlo en una invitación solo para excavaciones.
 Lo que me preocupa de las flores doradas es que, como tienen tantas hojas, no me gustaría que se cubrieran.
 Sería realmente genial si fuera una especie de área delimitada que permaneciera protegida de alguna manera para mostrar esa floración de flores.
 Y me encanta que pueda florecer, ya sabes, durante un largo período de tiempo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1585.317s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bueno.
 Entonces, Jen, ¿dijiste que lo que te preocupa de los helechos es que estarían demasiado escondidos?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1593.289s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: No, creo que con las flores doradas, me preocupa que las hojas se acumulen con el paso de los años y no se limpien.
 Y luego plantamos estas hermosas explosiones de color, y luego se ocultan de la caída de las hojas cada año.
 Porque no necesariamente se limpiaría en primavera.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1612.681s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: No, claro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1616.625s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: ¿Cuánto se propagan?
 Quiero decir, si se supone que deben delinear dónde estaba la casa, quiero decir, solo pensando en 10 años, ¿será como, ya sabes, la versión dos de Vinca?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1635.254s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: no podrías mantenerlos justo en ese límite.
 Marcarían ese sitio y luego los bordes, ya sabes, son cosas salvajes y no tenemos una frontera definida.
 Entonces tienes razón, podrían ir a cualquier parte, ¿verdad?
 Y se propagan con sus raíces.
 Y eso es lo que harían, ¿verdad?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1653.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ¿Hay alguna manera de hacer un borde natural con las piedras de alguna manera como,
 Tal vez sean dos plantas y hay un borde exterior y luego el color del interior es una forma de tratar de mantenerlo contenido un poco.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1668.332s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Y tuve eso.
 De hecho, tenía una versión que mostraba los bordes discontinuos, pero
 Fue interesante hablar con Suzanne porque después de hablar con ella, estaba hablando un poco con Ryan.
 Fui muy sensible acerca de ella, ya sabes, solo has hecho una investigación muy superficial, es decir, todos en esta llamada en la comisión.
 Sí, y está bien, ¿Dennis McDougall está en el equipo de la comisión?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1698.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Él es nuestro administrador.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1700.196s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sí, Dennis es el siguiente paso.
 Bueno.
 Porque tal vez estaba siendo demasiado cuidadoso o algo así, pero básicamente, Suzanne dijo, no quieres poner una hoja de ruta ahí.
 Sólo has profundizado un poco.
 Y si tienes estos
 En primer lugar, no sabemos dónde estaba exactamente la casa.
 Bien, eso es una estimación de dónde estaba.
 Y si lo haces realmente obvio y colocas estas piedras angulares y marcas las líneas de los cimientos y lo despejas para todos y está en un área oculta que no es tan visible desde la calle, ella estaba realmente preocupada por eso y le preocupaba que Massachusetts.
 El grupo histórico estatal diría, de ninguna manera.
 Hasta que este sitio no esté completamente agotado, no podrás hacerlo.
 Pero yo estaba pensando lo mismo, Jen, y me relaciono con el otro ejemplo que vimos.
 Hay un par de personas con las manos en alto, pero ¿debería llamarles?
 No.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1768.713s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Doug, adelante y luego iremos con Eleni.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1772.603s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Adelante primero.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1773.624s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bueno.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1777.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Me gusta la forma en que ha progresado esta planta para el parque y me gusta el uso de plantas locales para crear espacios diferentes.
 Me encanta la pared lila.
 Me gustan los helechos.
 Pero respecto al comentario de Jen sobre el mantenimiento, y esto es más bien una pregunta general que tengo, como, ya sabes,
 Creo que a todos nos preocupa dejar que todo crezca sobre las flores amarillas que quedan cubiertas por hojas u otras plantas locales.
 ¿Podría el departamento de parques de la ciudad venir una vez al año y hacer un poco de mantenimiento?
 Quiero decir, ¿sería eso un gran esfuerzo para ellos, simplemente limpiar y
 asegurándose de que las cosas no crezcan demasiado o se oculten o simplemente para que la plantación siga desempeñando un papel importante en la creación de estos diferentes espacios dentro del parque.
 Creo que es una característica importante a mantener.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1834.285s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Definitivamente creo que podríamos preguntarle al DPW sobre eso.
 Y ciertamente hemos hablado con ellos.
 Entran allí y cortan el césped del campo y todo eso.
 Así que definitivamente pienso eso, y no somos solo nosotros, ¿verdad?
 Ha habido otros proyectos de parques en toda la ciudad con dinero del CPC.
 Y luego está este tipo de mantenimiento que debe realizarse y que no se puede utilizar con CPC.
 Y entonces creo que esto es,
 Tenemos que averiguarlo y creo que habrá una conversación más amplia sobre el presupuesto de la ciudad y luego cómo suceden algunas de estas cosas de mantenimiento después de que los proyectos de CPC entren en juego porque el dinero de CPC no se puede usar para mantenimiento.
 Hemos tenido la misma conversación sobre Brooks Estate, por ejemplo.
 Entonces siento que sí, vamos a tener que resolver eso de alguna manera con esta ciudad.
 Sé que en un momento también se habló de un grupo de amigos con algunos vecinos.
 Y luego, si tal vez, por ejemplo, en Brooks Estates, organizamos limpiezas de primavera y limpiezas de otoño.
 Entonces, tal vez haya algo que decir aquí para un puñado de vecinos.
 Y sales y limpias esa área una vez al año o algo así.
 DE ACUERDO.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1925.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oye, esa es mi única pregunta, pero realmente me gusta la forma en que todo esto está funcionando.
 Y luego, sí, muy bien hecho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1932.39s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sí, quiero decir, creo, no sé, ustedes díganme lo que piensan, pero mi opinión es que no deberíamos, deberíamos tomar nuestras decisiones.
 Y hasta cierto punto, no quiero preocuparme por el mantenimiento, ya que lo resolveremos, pero no deberíamos permitir que eso obstaculice nuestras decisiones, o tal vez deberíamos, no lo sé, tendría curiosidad por escuchar lo que otras personas tienen que decir.
 Doug, adelante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1955.86s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Sí.
 Me gusta la idea de que haya algún tipo de interés en el grupo del parque, ya sabes, para tratar de fomentar ese tipo de propiedad y compra, ya sabes, a lo largo de este parque, creo.
 Obviamente no se puede forzar eso, pero sería bueno si los vecinos que se sienten dueños de este parque hicieran más de lo que realmente harían, como usted dijo, ir allí una vez al año y ayudar un poco porque, como sabemos, la ciudad siempre está luchando con el mantenimiento.
 Creo que este es un gran avance.
 Me gusta mucho lo que veo.
 Me gusta la idea del paseo histórico porque obviamente,
 en ambos sentidos, hacia adelante y hacia atrás, ya sea que vayas de norte a sur o viceversa.
 Tenía una pregunta rápida.
 Creo que al principio hubo una exposición de fotografías.
 Creo que era la entrada muy al norte, casi en el puente, que parecía una ruptura en la pared.
 Eso es diferente al cruce peatonal norte, ¿verdad?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2011.958s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bien, sí.
 Entonces esa imagen con la ruptura en la pared está aquí en Ravine Road.
 Sí, y hay una serie de descansos a medida que avanzas.
 De hecho, hay uno justo aquí en el punto medio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2031.04s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Peter, recuérdame que no es necesario que todos los puntos sean accesibles.
 Estamos haciendo accesible desde el parking.
 Bien.
 Bien.
 Pero no es necesario que todas las grietas de la pared sean accesibles.
 ¿Es eso correcto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2044.128s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bien.
 Lo harías.
 Quiero decir, el objetivo aquí, que ahora no existe, sería proporcionar una ruta accesible.
 Entonces, si hay una parte del parque en la que alguien dice estar en silla de ruedas, soy más sensible a esto cuando me exploté el ligamento cruzado anterior hace varios años y luego estaba saltando de un lado a otro.
 Yo digo, está bien, lo entiendo.
 Entiendo por qué estas reglas de accesibilidad son tan importantes.
 Pero sí, entonces la ruta accesible sería aquí.
 Podrías tener un lugar de estacionamiento accesible, que en realidad es solo una señalización porque la carretera ya existe, y luego la acera, y luego esta ruta aquí.
 Sí, no sería necesario que todo el parque fuera accesible.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2091.472s">[Doug Carr]</a>: No lo creo, pero quería comprobarlo porque obviamente, ya sabes, intentamos ampliar la accesibilidad en cualquier lugar que podamos, obviamente, dondequiera que podamos.
 Y creo que tienes razón.
 Definitivamente no son más de 120.
 He caminado tantas veces.
 Creo que no es posible que se necesiten muchas calificaciones para que eso sea accesible.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2107.038s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Y definitivamente es la zona más plana, como si subieras.
 más adelante este tobogán hacia el puente del ferrocarril.
 El camino se entrelaza y desciende mucho, por lo que esta es sin duda la zona más ancha y plana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2125.295s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Y Peter, ¿no se necesitan mejoras o hay que hacer cortes en las aceras desde la acera accesible hasta el cruce de peatones?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2133.12s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sí, esa es una pregunta interesante.
 Entonces, si miramos esto, ese es el... Lo hacemos.
 Estabas hablando justo de esa ruptura allí.
 Entonces esa sería la conexión norte.
 Creo que es Ravine o Jackson, estoy confundido.
 Entonces ahí vemos nuestra acera.
 Ahora hay dos maneras de hacer esto.
 Puedes, lo que normalmente se hace, dejar caer la acera y hacer que tu camino rayado y dejar caer la acera también del otro lado, o puedes tener una tabla de velocidad.
 Conceptualmente, las tablas de velocidad son geniales porque hacen dos cosas a la vez.
 Reducen la velocidad del tráfico y los autos, incluso con ese pequeño bache ahí abajo, los autos vuelan por esta cosa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2180.82s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ese golpe es inútil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2182.381s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sí.
 Ese golpe es inútil.
 Pero si hay cruces peatonales rayados, tal vez alguna señalización, eso se hace de una manera agradable.
 Sólo conceptualmente, mantiene a los peatones al mismo nivel.
 No es que tengas que bajar al reino de los autos y luego regresar al reino de la gente.
 Da preferencia a los peatones, pero probablemente sea útil tener una conversación con su
 DPW antes de finalizar esto, porque si tienes una tabla de velocidad aquí, un cruce elevado, entonces tienes que lidiar con el drenaje.
 Y tienes drenaje inclinado hacia abajo, estoy seguro de que este camino es curvo, está coronado y
 El agua corre contra esa curva y luego corre hacia abajo.
 Entonces, si creas una tabla de velocidad y hay una pendiente que desciende hasta ella, necesitas tener un drenaje para recoger esa agua.
 Y a veces no es posible, no es rentable, pero</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2244.435s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Comprendido.
 Estoy bastante seguro de que una vez que superemos la etapa conceptual, una reunión con el departamento de ingeniería del DPW de la ciudad estaría bien, al 100%.
 Otras dos preguntas rápidas.
 Esto es más para Jen y Ryan.
 El nombre Pomswall, ¿es oficial todavía o es así como lo llaman todos porque saben en qué se convertirá?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2266.053s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Aún no es oficial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2268.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Vale, sí, definitivamente no es oficial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2270.917s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Lo hacemos por respeto a los 100.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2274.299s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Lo hemos estado llamando así durante años porque sabemos que la dirección va totalmente de acuerdo.
 Vamos a ver.
 Entonces, el marcador de pared esclavo.
 ¿Se lo van a quitar, verdad?
 Debido a todo lo actual, se propone el nuevo letrero que presumiblemente lo reemplazaría.
 ¿Bien?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2291.53s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: John Anderson dijo que la Sociedad Histórica está trabajando actualmente para revisar todas sus placas y debatir sobre la actualización de la señalización con información correcta.
 Y si así lo decidimos, dijo que ciertamente podemos tomar la iniciativa en este caso porque este signo es especialmente incorrecto.
 Hicieron muchas suposiciones y no hicieron ninguna investigación para respaldarlas.
 Um, entonces ciertamente podríamos mezclar el siguiente letrero y reutilizar la piedra si aún quisiéramos, pero también podríamos hacer algo más que ciertamente.
 Sabes, ciertamente no tendría tanto texto en esa piedra.
 Nuevamente, simplemente diría "Muro de Pompe", y tal vez lo dedicaría a Pompeya y tal vez nombraría a los pueblos esclavizados.
 Algo pequeño que tal vez se pueda leer desde la acera al otro lado de la calle, porque ese nivel de texto es algo que se vería en una señalización interpretativa que Peter está proponiendo para la caminata histórica, y ahí es donde la gente realmente va a leer, si es que lo hace.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2360.117s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Y está orientado en la dirección equivocada y es peligroso.
 Y quiero decir, hay un millón de cosas mal con ese letrero, obviamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2366.062s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí, está bien marcarlo, ya sabes, es bueno marcarlo como es.
 Pero básicamente, debe poder leerse desde un automóvil, una bicicleta o alguien que pase.
 Y eso es todo, así que tal vez solo diga, ya sabes, el muro de Pompeya construido alrededor de 1760.
 Y eso es todo, ya sabes, en texto más grande.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2385.707s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Bien, solo un par de detalles más y soy uno de los otros miembros de la comisión que se unieron.
 A sólo dos cuadras de distancia, se encuentra el Sagamore John Memorial.
 ¿Crees que hay algún intento, tal vez cuando hacemos la señalización en la parte de los nativos americanos de la Caminata por la Historia, de intentar unir un poco las cosas, o eso es ir demasiado lejos, Ryan?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2408.11s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sue Anna Crawley me dijo que nuestro objetivo número uno debería ser invitar a las tribus nativas y a los pueblos indígenas a contar su propia historia y dejarles dictar completamente lo que quieren contar en ese panel interpretativo.
 Creo al 100% que es lo correcto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2431.12s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Estoy contigo allí.
 La última pregunta o comentario fue que habíamos hablado de que parte de la historia de este sitio es el transporte, el ferrocarril, el canal cercano.
 Eso no es parte del paseo histórico o tal vez pueda serlo.
 ¿Qué piensan todos de eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2449.449s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  I'm just going to chime in.
 Peter, if we go back to that site plan, your site plan.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 I think there's opportunity to engage the backside of the site and make a loop, you know, to connect that back path to your front path and accessible route and make the whole site kind of something so that, you know, if we do plantings that it's limited to that circular area inside of there, and, you know, then you can put an interpretive panel on the backside.
 There could be more that talks about the Middlesex Canal, the railroad, maybe even,
 more brooks family history because you're looking at at brooks playstead park at that point so um there's ample opportunity to add more additional signage more than just the three that we have you could add maybe another three and maybe that's you know maybe we do the front phase in phase one and the second phase in phase two but you know at least it's there and you know we could say here's the whole history of the site and then it
 almost forces people, if you want to learn the whole history, to loop around and therefore make the whole park safe because you've got people going in the back side.
 Thank you.
 That was my comment, was just to extend the history path all the way around the site and make a loop.
 Here, right.
 Yep.
 And for the backside, if there is a great issue, there's a six inch water main or drain main that runs down behind the whole house site and down that way that we, that the city didn't even know was there that we found during the archeological dig.
 So it's been disrupted already.
 So that will not be a grading.
 There will not be an issue.
 Okay.
 That's good to know.
 Yep.
 Yeah, it was, they asked us if we called dig safe and dig safe had no idea it was there either.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2568.206s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Entonces, está bien.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2569.888s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2570.628s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Y gracias por plantear esa pregunta, Doug, porque pensé que había un gran comentario la última vez y había imaginado la historia del transporte en el cartel de bienvenida, pero en cierto punto.
 Obtienes mucha información para poner en este cartel de bienvenida.
 Bienvenido al parque, este tipo de cosas.
 ¿Y por qué existe el parque?
 Y además es genial cuando estás en este parque.
 Me encantan los trenes y el tren pasa velozmente y creo que podría ser interesante tener la oportunidad de poder regresar aquí.
 me gustaria
 Caminar de nuevo para convencerme de que también es plano.
 Creo que probablemente lo sería en realidad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2623.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Me gusta esa idea, Ryan, y también creo que, ya sabes, cuando escuchamos del vecindario cuando tuvimos nuestras reuniones públicas, ya sabes, obviamente estaban preocupados por tener demasiado contacto, ya sabes, las cosas están cambiando en este parque.
 Pero creo que si lo concentramos en esta área, y este es el lugar donde plantamos algo de manera creativa, tal vez algo de raleo de los matorrales, y realmente hacemos un esfuerzo para hacer de este circuito algo especial.
 Y además es una razón más para dejar el resto del parque casi como está.
 Ya sabes, nuevamente, es una limpieza menor de madera muerta y todo eso.
 Pero es como si aquí solo nos estuviéramos centrando en esta área.
 Por ahora no estamos haciendo nada aquí en el espacio verde.
 No tocaremos el resto de los senderos ni los cobertizos ni todo lo que los niños han disfrutado a lo largo de los años.
 Y concéntrate en este bucle histórico.
 Creo que podemos argumentar que los escuchamos, y este es un buen tipo de compromiso para la parte de historia y, ya sabes, dejar el vecindario y amarlo tal como es.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2690.567s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.
 Entonces, para que Peter sepa, obtuvimos dinero del CPC para hacer todos los cortes en las aceras, todas las aceras, el ingeniero de la ciudad y la gente de tránsito dijeron que ciertamente no colocarían aceras en todas las calles, sino en lugares de cruce importantes.
 Creo que estos dos son importantes y entonces tal vez los espaciarían cada
 otra calle de aquí en adelante, sólo para que sea seguro.
 Habría un corte de acera en cada entrada, para eso hay suficiente dinero.
 Hay suficiente dinero para los carteles.
 Luego hay dinero para podar y replantar árboles.
 Específicamente, si hay árboles más viejos que han muerto a lo largo del camino, ciertamente podemos concentrarnos en esta área y replantarlos de inmediato y hacer que crezcan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2743.615s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Eso es genial y había un caballero en Jackson Road con el que estaba hablando. Creo que en esta casa suelo estacionar frente a esta casa.
 Buen tipo y ese fue su comentario: Realmente me gustan las mejoras aquí, pero.
 Ahora estos grandes árboles son más visibles y hay trabajo por hacer que a menudo no es barato para poder conseguir que alguien lo haga y lo haga bien, pero contando con la comunidad.
 Lo que ha hecho ya ha mejorado todos estos valores de propiedad.
 Si yo viviera en este vecindario y de repente aparece este gran muro de piedra y este muro de ladrillo restaurado, serían pasos positivos para la comunidad.
 Hacer que la gente entienda que eso es lo que va a pasar porque la gente allí es sensible.
 Creo que nuestras intervenciones deben ser cuidadosas y ligeras.
 porque la gente es protectora con esto.
 Quieren verlo mejorado, pero estoy de acuerdo, Jen, en que dicen: ¿qué vas a hacer?
 Son protectores porque aquí es donde dejan ir a sus perros y lo ven como su parque.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2822.235s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Una de las cosas que acabamos de discutir como parte del potencial del cementerio para la planificación maestra son los perros y actualmente no hay reglas para los perros, pero.
 En el cementerio se debate cuál será el número de personas que paseen perros allí en el futuro.
 Y una de las cosas que propuse fue que tal vez si la ciudad va a decir y comenzar a hacer cumplir las reglas para pasear perros, existe la posibilidad de que tomen una parte de Placedead Park y lo conviertan en un parque para perros para este lado de Medford, de modo que haya un lugar para ir fuera de las cataratas, tal vez fuera de
 ya sabes, Thomas Brooks Park a medida que se convierte en un parque histórico, ya sabes, pensamos en todos los usuarios de estos lugares y les brindamos las comodidades que, si quitamos algo, se lo damos en otro lugar para que todos tengan el mismo acceso.
 Entonces.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2880.235s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Yo también creo, quiero decir, ya que he paseado a mi perro aquí y, ya sabes, realmente te quedas en los senderos porque si lo intentas, quiero decir, sé que no dejaría que mi perro corriera desenfrenado solo porque no sabes lo que van a intervenir.
 Y si golpean un palo o algo así, no querrás que los atrapen.
 Así que creo, ya sabes, creo que en el futuro, si hubiera algún tipo de restricción en el interior del bucle,
 ya sabes, tal vez solo una buena señalización, como te pedimos amablemente, ya sabes, no dejes que tus perros corran por una especie de rampa aquí para todos, excepto para salir a cualquier otro lugar.
 Pero, de nuevo, realmente no veo que las veces que he estado allí y ha habido otros en los senderos improvisados, cierto, cierto, el más seguro, cierto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2924.395s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Peter, tengo una pregunta y ciertamente puedes tomarte un tiempo para pensar en ella.
 ¿Existe alguna alternativa? Entonces la ciudad, una de las responsabilidades de la otra ciudad, y tal vez ahora esté parcialmente compartida con la MBTA, es que se supone que debemos mantener una cerca a lo largo de la MBTA.
 de inmediato.
 MBTA obviamente ha reparado su cerca para mantenerla limpia en todo momento.
 ¿Hay algo que sea más atractivo o mejor para poner y que quiera disimularlo?
 Quiero decir, ¿hay un eslabón de cadena cubierto de negro que podría ser más duradero y que desaparece en el fondo verde del futuro?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2965.794s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Y eso es algo que aprendí, o que todos aprendimos sobre el parque, que las dos estipulaciones en la escritura eran que debías mantener el muro, Pomp's Wall, en pie y en pie, y debías mantener una cerca en el ferrocarril, o de lo contrario, Brooks Estate técnicamente puede recuperar esto, y estoy seguro de que nadie sabe sobre eso, ¿verdad?
 Pero sí, hay
 Porque ahora es solo Chainlink, ¿verdad?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2995.863s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2997.044s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bien.
 ¿Y la MBTA es dueña de eso y lo puso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3002.778s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Entonces creo que había una valla en la ciudad.
 Y luego pienso que con el tiempo, con la gente cortando el camino, con los árboles cayendo sobre él, la MBTA ha hecho reparaciones, pero no es una cerca muy bien construida.
 Y a medida que caen más cosas sobre él, se desmorona.
 Entonces, ya sabes, me gustaría ver algo que sea un reemplazo más permanente en el futuro, especialmente si vamos a invertir dinero en este plan, ya sabes, también podríamos hacer que toda el área sea atractiva.
 Incluso si solo nos concentramos en esta pequeña área para comenzar, eventualmente lo ejecutaremos todo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3032.888s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sí, ahí puedo volver con algunas sugerencias, pero sí, definitivamente hay mejores alternativas que lo harían.
 simplemente no llame mucho la atención, sino que sea un buen divisor.
 El vallado es caro.
 Esta es una parte bastante larga, pero puedo volver con algunos ejemplos de lo que podría ser y tal vez solo un costo general por pie o lo que sea, pie lineal.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3066.362s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí, y yo era, ya sabes, para disuadir a la gente de cortarlo. Sabes, una de las cosas que podríamos hacer es tal vez plantar algunas cosas que no sean muy invasivas, como por ejemplo, tengo una cerca de tela metálica en la que planto campanillas.
 La campanilla no es el tipo de planta que querrías plantar aquí porque se vuelven locos, pero crea una pared verde y una pared verde de flores.
 Entonces, ya sabes, en cierto modo disuade a la gente de intentar saltar la cerca, cortarla, etcétera.
 Entonces, ya sabes, tal vez podamos pensar en eso también.
 Tal vez Ivy pueda trepar por encima o algo así.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3101.182s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bien.
 Sí.
 Algo con espinas.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3104.886s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Rosas.
 Sí.
 O incluso frambuesa, ya sabes, plantas nativas como plantas frutales como frambuesas o arándanos.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3113.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Vale, solo quiero, Peter, quiero ser respetuoso con tu tiempo ya que hemos estado charlando durante una hora aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3119.62s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Así que sí, está bien.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3121.162s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ¿Alguien más tiene algún comentario?
 Oh,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3127.458s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Supongo que solo tengo una pregunta y en realidad es para la comisión: ¿qué tan preocupado está usted por llamar demasiado la atención sobre el sitio de la casa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3142.51s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: creo que
 Creo que si tuviéramos que hacer algo, una vez que recuperemos la información aquí, creo que lo que sugeriría es casi tapar y rellenar donde se colocaría algún tipo de barrera protectora que, similar a cómo se trataría como un sitio abandonado, que es una tela resistente y duradera, y luego simplemente nivelar por encima con, no sé, tal vez cuatro pulgadas de tierra, suficiente tierra para que se puedan plantar plantas livianas, ese tipo de cosas, y luego,
 Y luego eso protege el sitio de una excavadora.
 Si vas a cavar, alguien necesitará un esfuerzo significativo.
 Pero, ya sabes, honestamente creo que a medida que continuamos mejorando este sitio y mejorando los caminos y todas las comodidades, honestamente no creo que la gente sea el problema.
 Creo que se autovigilarán.
 Quiero decir, sucede ocasionalmente, pero al igual que los parques nacionales y esas cosas, hay decenas de miles de acres allí y la gente no va a cavar.
 Así que es sólo una cuestión de imponer respeto por el sitio.
 Cuanto más le prestemos atención, cuanto más compartamos su historia, más gente respetará el sitio y no le hará nada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3223.258s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Quiero decir, si la creencia es que ya ha sido excavado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3229.583s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.
 Sí, o que sabemos lo que hay allí y alguien puede imaginar lo que hay allí y no tener que cavar en el suelo, ¿verdad?
 Tenemos algunos de los artefactos, puedes ver el tipo de cosas que han surgido del suelo, así que no tienes que hacerlo, la emoción de ir a buscarlo tú mismo se ha ido, ¿verdad?
 Porque sabemos lo que te vas a encontrar.
 Y es muy fácil decirle a la gente,
 La arqueología es un recurso finito.
 Una vez que pones tu pala en el suelo y le das la vuelta, eso es todo.
 Está hecho para siempre.
 Y creo que la gente lo entiende.
 Ciertamente hay gente que, incluso los legos que hacen este tipo de cosas, lo entienden.
 Pero ya sabes,
 ¿Detendrá a algún tipo de criminal real?
 No importa si lo hacen o no.
 Alguien que realmente quiera trabajar aquí investigaría el sitio y lo encontraría de todos modos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3291.215s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Una pregunta para ti, Pedro.
 Para esos pilares, ¿mostraste algún tipo de imagen?
 Conceptualmente, yo
 Me pregunto: ¿son altos?
 ¿Están cerca del suelo?
 ¿Qué opinas sobre eso?
 Bien.
 Creo que mostraste algo, pero.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3311.672s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Sí, no mostré nada específico, pero estaba pensando en algo como esto.

 Además, estos son

 Pero si vamos a darle vueltas a esto, tal vez no todos tengan que estar atados en este camino lineal.
 Tal vez pueda ser por aquí, ¿verdad?</p>

 Creo que da un poquito más
 Quiero decir, también entiendo que la gente del vecindario simplemente quiere que sea casi salvaje.
 Parecen apreciarlo mucho.
 Creo que hay observadores de aves que entran allí y esas cosas.
 Creo que eso es lo bueno del enfoque sutil porque en realidad no necesariamente
 Um, bueno, no creo que el sitio deba ser, entre comillas, desinfectado, ya sabes, y convertido en, uh, sólo para ir al otro extremo, ya sabes, convertirse en una versión de dibujos animados de Disneyland de sí mismo.
 Ya sabes, creo que hay algo, hay algo agradable en el hecho de que es casi una especie de desierto.

 Creo que lo sutil es el mejor enfoque aquí.
 Es casi como si te encontraras con esta zona.
 Bueno, ¿por qué se despeja esta zona?
 ¿Por qué está esta plantación aquí?
 Siempre pienso en algo de C.S.
 Lewis o lo que sea.
 ¿Por qué están aquí estos rincones de los cimientos?
 Aquí hay una señal para interpretar esto, por lo que tal vez casi descubras esta área.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3560.728s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Me gusta eso.
 Me gusta ese enfoque como una especie de enfoque general.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3568.531s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bueno.
 ¿Algún otro comentario o pensamiento?
 Agradezco el tiempo aquí y todos los comentarios.
 Ustedes son buenas ideas.
 Y veamos, toma estos y creo que tendremos una vuelta más.
 Me comunicaré con
 Ryan u otros y luego regresar y refinar esto un poco.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3592.382s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Eso suena genial.
 Muchas gracias Pedro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3594.844s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bueno.
 Muchas gracias por tu tiempo.
 Es bueno verlos a todos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3597.045s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Está bien.
 Qué tengas buenas noches.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3598.806s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Bueno.
 Tú también.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3601.708s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Está bien.
 Gracias a todos por sus comentarios.
 Eso fue genial.
 Antes de pasar al siguiente punto de la agenda, tenemos una solicitud que llegó tarde.
 Así que me gustaría que lo aceptáramos.
 Ryan, ¿enviaste un enlace por casualidad sobre eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3617.923s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Oops, no.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3618.883s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muy bien entonces.
 ¿Quieres seguir adelante?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3626.692s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí, si quieres subir esas cosas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3629.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sí, está bien, lo haré.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3631.016s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Todos, mientras hablamos de presupuesto, esa es la temporada para gastar el resto del presupuesto.
 Entonces, si la gente así lo cree, tenemos el proyecto del parque Thomas Brooks y estoy a punto de solicitar un gasto de $1100 para el cementerio de Cross Street.
 Nosotros.
 lo que significa que la comisión y los administradores del cementerio lograron obtener $4,800 del proyecto de pequeña subvención del CPC.
 También recibí una subvención de $5,000 del Área Histórica Nacional Freedom's Way para realizar la evaluación de las piedras del cementerio.
 Eso deja un poco de dinero extra necesario para hacer algunas
 un trabajo de campo antes de realizar la evaluación real porque afecta la evaluación.
 Así que le pediré a la comisión que gaste $1,100 para cubrir el presupuesto restante de ese proyecto con el entendimiento de que el Cementerio comenzará a presupuestar para acercarse al CPC en el otoño para obtener los dólares de restauración del Cementerio.
 Así que nos quedan, no sé, probablemente unos 5.000 dólares aproximadamente para gastar en el formulario B del MHC.
 ¿Hay algún área en la ciudad que se les ocurra que deba abordarse, o Doug, algún proyecto próximo de CBC que desee analizar, ese tipo de cosas?
 Peter, vi tu mano levantada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3724.039s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Bueno, un pajarito me dijo que Tufts está mirando el hardware de la ladera.
 Bueno.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3733.241s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3733.541s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Puedo comprobar y ver si sé que hay un formulario de área para esa área.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3740.105s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Porque encontré eso, pero, sí, puedo pedirle a John que prepare un formulario B de MHC para ese edificio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3749.95s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: No sé.
 Sabes, esto es un rumor que escuché.
 Entonces no lo sé.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3754.273s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: No, eso es bueno.
 Quiero decir, es bueno saber qué, ya sabes, ese es un edificio en esa zona, ya sabes, qué está haciendo Tufts.
 Entonces,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3762.743s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Creo que Tufts es el propietario ahora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3764.825s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí.
 No, eso ha existido por un tiempo.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3769.47s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ¿Hace tiempo que lo poseen, Peter?
 No sé.
 No sé.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3772.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Se acaba de vender.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3773.854s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Sí, no recuerdo que fueran dueños porque solía conocer al tipo que dirigía esa tienda.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3777.958s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: No estoy seguro de que sea el propietario, pero el pájaro del que lo escuché,
 indicó que así era.
 Entonces, no lo sé.
 No puedo responder por mi fuente, pero no quiero causarles problemas, en otras palabras, pero.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3794.919s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Bueno, son los edificios de la izquierda los que se mueven.
 Eso es todo, ya sabes, esencialmente.
 Entonces.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3803.947s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: en cualquier otro lugar que se nos ocurra.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3805.948s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Ryan, ¿alguna vez conseguimos, quiero decir, hace años, le pedimos a Tufts que preparara algo para que gastaran su propio dinero?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3812.089s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: No creo que hayamos obtenido nada de ellos.
 Oh, lo perdimos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3828.513s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Básicamente está en el foro del área.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3833.361s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obviamente alguien en West Medford está trabajando con el sistema.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3841.118s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Doug, te quedaste paralizado en mitad de la conversación.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3844.894s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Lo siento.
 Le pedimos a Tufts que creara un formulario de área esencialmente para su campus porque sabemos que siempre hay nuevos proyectos, nuevas incorporaciones, todo.
 No creo que lo hayamos conseguido nunca, pero quiero que gasten su dinero, no el nuestro, no el de la ciudad, para obtener una evaluación adecuada de su campus y de los edificios importantes de ese campus, de los cuales, creo, tendríamos muy poco en este momento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3875.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Puedo preguntar quién es la persona de relaciones comunitarias y podemos ver qué prepararon.
 Quiero decir, tal vez tenga sentido que, si bien tenemos algo de dinero, tal vez nos asociemos con ellos para que obtengan más beneficios por su inversión.
 Quiero decir, ciertamente estoy dispuesto a documentar algunos de los edificios, esa es nuestra responsabilidad en cierto modo, pero cada edificio, no, no creo que la ciudad deba ser responsable de ello.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3901.861s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ¿Qué tal un formulario de área solo para el campus?
 ¿Es demasiado grande?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3907.703s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Quiero decir, hay mucho que documentar y puede haber diferentes áreas, como por ejemplo separar el cuadrilátero histórico en la parte superior de ciertas áreas del campus.
 Ya sabes, eso se desarrolló por separado de Professor's Row, que se desarrolló por separado de las áreas periféricas.
 Mechones.
 cuadrado a falta de un término mejor en el lugar donde está el marrón y la cerveza, si todavía está allí.
 Es una especie de nodo comercial separado.
 Entonces puedo preguntar sobre esa área de forma para todo el campus y ver qué obtenemos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3949.086s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Así que Tufts lo compró el año pasado para Hellaside Hardware.
 Sí.
 En 2022, se vendió todo el sitio.
 Walnut Hill Properties, esa es la oficina de bienes raíces de Tufts.
 Pagó 1,7 millones.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3976.398s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Bueno, es un edificio destacado, eso es seguro.
 Quiero decir, sitio, digamos.
 Sería fantástico si eventualmente pudiera suceder algo bueno allí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3987.832s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.
 Quiero decir, sería genial si les gustara un proyecto de reutilización adaptativa.
 Quizás conservaron el edificio original y construyeron algo nuevo encima.
 Eso sería bastante bueno.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3996.915s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Sí, definitivamente podrían agregar uno o dos pisos a ese edificio.
 Eso estaría bien, pero ese no es el rumor que escuché, el rumor que escuché era una demostración.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4008.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Haz una demostración y empieza de nuevo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4009.939s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4011.32s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bueno, acaban de hacer una demostración de esas dos casas colina arriba.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4014.161s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí, sí, eso es, sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4015.602s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Los que pidieron, los tuvimos que revisar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4018.063s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4018.564s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Pon las casas prefabricadas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4020.245s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí, para viviendas con un diseño supuestamente respetuoso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4027.088s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4033.412s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Oh, ya tenemos, está bien, ya tenemos el formulario para la solicitud de esta noche, pero lo veremos el próximo mes.

 Ese fue el grande.
 Entonces, sí.

 Voy a intentar que venga a nuestra próxima reunión o iré a reunirme con él sólo para decirle que quería presentarnos, saludarlo y forjar una nueva relación.
 Envié un correo electrónico, para que sepan, envié un correo electrónico al equipo del departamento de construcción hoy porque obtuvimos un permiso para la propiedad 82 Greenleaf.
 Entonces les envié un correo electrónico y les dije, oye, ya sabes, pídeles que completen la documentación de demostración.
 para que podamos avanzar lo más rápido posible.
 Dije, así que cada vez que haya una propiedad en la que haya habido un incendio, simplemente avise a los propietarios que nos presenten la denuncia de inmediato para que podamos comenzar a trasladarlos lo más rápido posible para que puedan comenzar con su reconstrucción.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4510.072s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: No sabía, no sabía, yo, yo, yo, no sabía que no lo habían puesto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4514.894s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: No, lo único que pedimos ahora es que el solicitante pague el anuncio legal.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4520.517s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Está bien.
 Y eso, eso, eso se obtendría, eso, eso presumiblemente se incluiría porque eso es un gasto de permisos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4528.861s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bien, bien.
 Sí.
 Bien, Ryan ya repasó el cementerio de Cross Street, así que estamos listos con una actualización, ¿verdad?
 Bueno.
 ¿Alguna actualización del proyecto de encuesta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4546.562s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: El consultor envió una gran cantidad de formularios para Fulton Heights.
 Procesé su factura.
 Creen que podrían estar terminados en mayo, por lo que son buenas noticias para nosotros.
 Ese proyecto estará por delante de donde pensé que estaría, así que eso es bueno.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4565.373s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Excelente.
 ¿Tenemos a Doug para el parque Thomas Brooks?
 ¿Sabes si nuestra segunda fase fue aprobada?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4580.196s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Entonces aprobaron la solicitud, aprobaron la solicitud larga porque yo estuve allí para la presentación y discusión, pero estamos esperando que vayan ante el concejo municipal.
 ¿Es así, Doug?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4593.243s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Creo que eso es correcto.
 Hay una reunión mañana.
 Lo comprobaré.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4598.706s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ¿Hubo como un segundo lote de solicitudes que tuvieron que ser aprobadas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4604.397s">[Doug Carr]</a>: No me parece.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4606.178s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sigo viendo publicaciones sociales de like, aquí están todos los proyectos y el nuestro no está.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4613.42s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Déjame comprobarlo.
 Me comunicaré con ustedes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4615.88s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bien, gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4616.921s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Pero lo hicieron, lo aprobaron.
 Pero ellos, creo que ellos, Ryan, tú y yo estábamos enviándonos mensajes de texto esa noche, y creo que estaban tratando de conseguir
 Fue necesario un pequeño corte de pelo porque querían que la ciudad hiciera algunos trabajos en los árboles.
 Y dije, está bien, si haces eso, será mejor que cumplas tu parte del trato.
 Estás hablando en nombre del DPW sin preguntarles.
 Entonces, creo que lo aprobaron, pero no fue así, fue menos de lo que se solicitó, pero suficiente para hacer lo que Ryan pensó que era crítico.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4645.373s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.
 Sí.
 Quiero decir, hay dinero ahí para la excavación, para la señalización, para los recortes de la ADA.
 Y luego hubo una gran cantidad de cambios para el trabajo con árboles.
 Ciertamente no todo, pero está bien.
 Y creo que eso también es importante.
 Y estaba bien con eso.
 Quiero decir, creo que dijimos, creo que dijimos, nos dijeron como 200.000 o algo así.
 Pero, por supuesto, está sujeto a algunos pequeños ajustes y, ya sabes, si el departamento de árboles dice que no pueden hacerlo, tal vez vuelvan a todo y simplemente digan, no, háganlo esta ronda, déjenlos hacer todo el parque.
 Otra cosa, el Centro Cultural Islámico se acercó a nosotros para pedirnos una carta de apoyo para la próxima subvención.
 Y mi principal preocupación es: ¿han proporcionado al CPC algún tipo de estudio de ese edificio o plan de preservación o cualquier cosa que se requiriera?
 Porque sé que vi que están trabajando en las ventanas.
 Pero pensé que como condición para financiar ese trabajo, iban a proporcionarle al CPC un plan de preservación.
 Y no he visto nada.
 Por eso, como comisionado, dudo en apoyar cualquier tipo de subvención si no cumplen con sus obligaciones con el PCC.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4719.346s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Le preguntaré a Teresa.
 La reunión es mañana por la noche.
 Hablaré con ella de antemano.
 No he visto nada, Ryan.
 Pero eso no significa que no haya ocurrido a nivel administrativo.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4730.525s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sí, nos pidieron una carta y les dije, si pueden enviarnos información sobre el proyecto, puedo incluirlos en la agenda y luego podemos discutir la redacción de una carta.
 Pero no puedo simplemente mandarte a escribir una carta hasta que sepamos qué está pasando con tu proyecto.
 Bien.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4747.531s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Si no lo pidieras, lo harían.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4751.672s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bien.
 Quiero decir, creo que hemos sido bastante inflexibles, y el CPC ha sido bastante inflexible en cuanto a asegurarse de que haya planes en marcha antes de que el trabajo continúe, quiera o no.
 Y, ya sabes, cuando vi las ventanas desaparecer y ser restauradas, estuvo bien.
 Pero creo que es importante saber qué está pasando.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4769.633s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ¿Cuándo viste que estaban trabajando en las ventanas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4771.994s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Oh, han estado entrando y saliendo del edificio desde al menos diciembre.
 Así que si pasas por allí podrás ver que algunos de ellos han sido restaurados.
 Así que no sé quién hace el trabajo por ellos, pero obviamente le están pagando a alguien para que lo haga.
 No sé si han solicitado algún tipo de reembolso al CPC, pero sería bueno saberlo.
 porque recuerdo estar en esa reunión que estaba condicionado a que para financiar ese trabajo de preservación primero hicieran un plan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4799.844s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Bueno.
 Lo comprobaré mañana por la noche.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4803.545s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sí.
 Bueno.
 ¿Alguien tiene algo más antes de que aprobemos las actas de la reunión?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4814.208s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bueno.
 Sólo una pregunta rápida.
 Supongo que lo mencionaré de nuevo.
 ¿Qué está pasando con Brooks Estate?
 ¿Algo bueno?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4822.999s">[Doug Carr]</a>: ¿Tienes una hora?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4826.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Podemos guardarlo para la próxima reunión.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4829.665s">[Doug Carr]</a>: La búsqueda del presidente continúa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4831.346s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4833.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Por favor, Señor, pregúntale a tu red.
 Es como grillos ahí fuera.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4839.953s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bueno, quiero decir, pueden empezar a decirle a la gente que, al mejorar su juego, si no consiguen un presidente, estarán a punto de tener presidentes enteros.
 cierto, porque todos ustedes asumen el trabajo, entonces.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4853.563s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Sí, ese no es el plan, pero lo aprecio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4858.127s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Eso podría avergonzar a algunas personas y obligarlas a intensificar su juego e intentar conseguir algunos amigos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4861.89s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Solo diré esto: una solicitud solicitaba un salario de seis cifras para el puesto totalmente voluntario de presidente entrante.
 No pude acomodarme.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4873.108s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Sí, ¿hay algo escrito sobre lo que estás buscando?
 Porque tengo un par de ellos en el sitio web.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4880.73s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Hay una publicación completa.
 Lo he publicado en todas partes.
 Quizás no en todas partes si no lo has visto.
 Pero sí, está en el kit de nuestro sitio web y házmelo saber.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4889.733s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Hola, Ryan, tengo una pregunta para ti.
 ¿Hay alguna actualización sobre South Street?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí, entonces South Street votó a favor de seguir adelante con la presentación ante el Concejo Municipal, y rápidamente les dije que necesitaban hablar con la Junta de Desarrollo Comunitario.
 No estoy seguro de si Dennis todavía está aquí, pero si lo está, sería genial saber si vinieron antes del
 junta de desarrollo comunitario para obtener su opinión y aprobación porque ese es un paso necesario antes de ir al concejo municipal.
 Se suponía que irían al concejo municipal mañana por la noche, así que no sé si eso sucederá, pero no revisé la agenda para ver si estaba ahí.
 Sé que Chris Bader está de vacaciones esta semana, así que la última vez que verifiqué que no se estaban reuniendo.
 Así que ciertamente no pinta bien para el HTC, pero eso es sólo un paso.
 Tal vez en los próximos meses mejoren, tal vez su enfoque sea llevar esto ante el concejo municipal.
 Entonces, si realmente se reúnen mañana, tal vez sea bueno.
 Lamentablemente, dada la naturaleza del orden del día, no creo que mañana por la noche sea la mejor noche para abordar el tema.
 Pero conociendo la naturaleza particular de la discusión que está por tenerse, creo que habrá mucha gente que naturalmente se opondría a algo así.
 Así que casi lo enviarán a sentencia de muerte mañana si se acercan a él mañana.
 Ayuntamiento.
 Entonces Dennis dijo que no habían comparecido ante la junta directiva del CD todavía.
 Entonces eso tendrá que suceder.
 Eso tiene que suceder antes de que vayan al Concejo Municipal para poder completar el proceso.
 Básicamente, la Junta de Desarrollo Comunitario es nuestra junta de planificación urbana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Entonces simplemente eso no ha sucedido.
 Entonces esencialmente,
 Realmente no ha sucedido mucho desde eso último.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5016.394s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí, quieren seguir adelante.
 Están tratando de seguir adelante.
 Y estoy ansioso por ayudarlos a seguir adelante y asegurarme de que lo estén haciendo bien.
 Bien por ellos.
 Por eso quiero que sigan adelante, pero también necesito ayudarlos a construir el tablero.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5034.973s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Otra pregunta, porque la distribuiste la semana pasada, Ryan.
 Ciertamente no tengo ningún problema con las antenas del edificio Saltonstall.
 Me imagino que no tenemos nada que decir, pero sólo quiero asegurarme de que haya consenso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí, quiero decir, no tenía ninguno.
 Creo que dijimos lo que íbamos a decir sobre el edificio en sí.
 Creo que los proyectos de construcción simplemente avanzan.
 Entonces, no tengo nada que decir, y si nadie más lo tiene, simplemente les enviaré nuestros comentarios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sí, tampoco tengo comentarios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Es muy común recibir ese tipo de cosas terribles y de mala calidad para revisar.
 Pero quiero decir, es la naturaleza de la revisión lo que la desencadena.
 Quiero decir, a veces atrapamos a los buenos.
 Como si nunca construyeran el enorme monopolo junto a la 93 en Spot Pond debido a la oposición allí.
 Entonces a veces funciona.
 A veces prevalece la necesidad de una torre de telefonía móvil súper grande frente a la preservación histórica.
 Diré que en el vecino Stoneham, tal vez nos preocupe un poco porque nos preocupa la naturaleza de la seguridad vial.
 La ciudad de Stoneham está luchando por la demolición del Hospital Stoneham para un proyecto 40B planificado.
 No sé si van a poder detenerlo porque
 40 B suele ser bastante fuerte y sé que no alcanzan los umbrales de vivienda debido a otro proyecto que acaba de comenzar después de casi una década de peleas con la ciudad.
 Entonces, eh.
 Es posible que lo soliciten y es posible que recibamos comentarios cuando se trata de preservación histórica.
 Quiero decir, el sitio es algo histórico.
 No creo que el hospital sea histórico de ninguna manera, pero ya sabes, es posible que soliciten comentarios y es posible que tengamos la oportunidad de hacerlo debido a la avenida, el estanque, etc.
 Y si no lo has visto al otro lado de la ciudad, el Hospital Malden ya no existe, por lo que está a punto de ser reemplazado por un
 centro de atención de salud mental de última generación y de muy baja densidad para ese sitio.
 Y la ciudad de Malden está recuperando algo así como seis u ocho acres de tierra que se preservarán permanentemente como parte de este proyecto.
 Así que todos ganan con Hallmark Health y la ciudad de Malden.
 Y estamos justo en el límite.
 De hecho, en los años 50, no sé si la gente lo recuerda,
 Si estuviera aquí, entonces cambiaron la frontera de Medford y Malden para acomodar el hospital porque la sala de emergencias y el ala de maternidad estaban originalmente en Medford y tenían que registrar todos los nacimientos tanto en Medford como en Malden, a pesar de que usted estaba en el hospital de Malden.
 Así que literalmente cambiaron la frontera en esa zona en particular.
 Así que, literalmente, hay un pequeño recorte cuando miras Google Maps.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5217.229s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Pero eso hace que a algunas personas les resulte muy difícil conseguir pasaportes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5222.312s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí.
 Sí, estoy seguro de que sí.
 Estoy seguro de que sí.
 Quiero decir... Increíble.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5228.555s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Lugar de nacimiento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5231.336s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Tierra de nadie.
 Aquí hay dragones.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5233.877s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Bien.
 La DMZ entre Menford y Baldwin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5239.2s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí.
 Por eso en Dorchester se obtiene un certificado de nacimiento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5245.867s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sabes, es bueno que el hospital finalmente esté haciendo algo con ese sitio.
 Me sorprendió que ellos, sé que intentaron convertirlo en viviendas, pero me sorprende que, ya sabes, alguien no haya intentado seguir una ruta de baja densidad allí.
 Pero, ya sabes, el hecho de que estén recuperando todo ese terreno como espacio verde después de construir este pequeño y agradable centro de atención médica es una especie de tributo agradable a para qué se usaba anteriormente el sitio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5272.631s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: ¿Está eso en el río Malden?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5274.872s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: No, está muy arriba en las tierras altas.
 Si usted, ya sabe, la torre de radio que puede ver desde, digamos, está subiendo por Fells Way en dirección a Fells Way, donde se divide entre el oeste y el este.
 Si miras hacia arriba, ahí está la torre.
 Y anteriormente se podía ver el Hospital Malden allí.
 No puedes verlo ahora.
 Entonces no podrán ver nada allí porque solo se construirá allí un edificio bajo de dos pisos.
 Entonces.
 No sólo recuperas el horizonte, sino que también recuperas todo, ya sabes.
 Toda esa zona.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5312.021s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Entonces, está bien, Peter envió las actas de la reunión.
 Si alguien quiere hacer una moción para aprobar el acta de la reunión, que así lo haga.
 Gracias, Ryan.</p>
