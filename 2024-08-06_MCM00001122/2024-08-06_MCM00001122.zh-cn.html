 那么根据2021年法律第20章的规定,这次梅德福市历史委员会会议将远程举行。
 希望参加会议的公众可以通过议程上提供的 Zoom 链接进行。
 不允许公众亲自出席，并且公众只能通过远程方式参与本次会议期间的任何公开听证会。
 好了，危机解除了，大家都进去了。
 好的，我将从我们的议程开始。
 Peter Hedlund，你好，欢迎，我看到你在这里。
 所以我们把你放在第一位，那我们为什么不从你开始呢？
 我想我们会步行去托马斯布鲁克斯公园。
 我会让你从这里处理它。</p>

 好吧，让我们看看。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1516.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 那太好了。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1520.35s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 他可以吗？是的，那就完美了。
 继续吧，珍。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1529.697s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 你怎么认为？
 我开始吧。
 我喜欢丁香花。
 我是它的忠实粉丝。
 我喜欢房子所在的地方开满金色花朵的想法。
 就我个人而言，我希望看到房子土地上的一些杂草被清除，但我明白，在不让这仅仅成为挖掘的邀请之间必须保持平衡。
 金花让我担心的是，因为它们有很多叶子，我不希望它们被覆盖。
 如果它是一种以某种方式受到保护以展示花朵盛开的划定区域，那真是太酷了。
 我喜欢它能在很长一段时间内开花。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1585.317s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 出色地。
 那么，Jen，你说你对蕨类植物的担忧是它们太隐蔽了？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1593.289s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 不，我想有了金黄的花朵，我担心叶子会长年累月地堆积起来，不清理掉。
 然后我们种植这些美丽的色彩爆发，它们隐藏在每年掉落的叶子中。
 因为春天不一定是干净的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1612.681s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 不清楚。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1616.625s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: 它们传播了多少？
 我的意思是，如果他们要描绘出房子在哪里，我的意思是，想想 10 年后，它会像 Vinca 的第二版吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1635.254s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 你不能把它们限制在这个限度。
 他们会标记那个点，然后标记边缘，你知道，这些都是野生的东西，我们没有明确的边界。
 所以你是对的，他们可以去任何地方，对吗？
 他们用自己的根传播。
 这就是他们会做的，对吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1653.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 有没有办法以某种方式与石头形成自然边界，
 也许它有两层楼，有一个外边框，然后内部的颜色是试图让它保持一点封闭的一种方式。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1668.332s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 我拥有了。
 我实际上有一个显示虚线边框的版本，但是
 与苏珊娜交谈很有趣，因为在与她交谈后，我与瑞安聊了一会儿。
 我对此非常敏感，你知道，你只做了非常粗略的调查，我的意思是，委员会电话会议上的每个人。
 是的，好吧，丹尼斯·麦克杜格尔是委员会成员之一？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1698.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 他是我们的管理员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1700.196s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的，丹尼斯是下一步。
 出色地。
 因为也许我太小心了或者什么的，但基本上，苏珊说，你不想把脚本放在那里。
 你只是走得更深了一点。
 如果你有这些
 首先，我们不知道房子到底在哪里。
 嗯，这是对我所在位置的估计。
 如果你把它做得非常明显，你把这些基石放进去，你标记了地基线，你为每个人清理了它们，而且它位于一个从街上看不到的隐藏区域，她真的很担心这一点，她担心马萨诸塞州。
 国家历史小组会说，不可能。
 在该网站完全售完之前，您将无法执行此操作。
 但我也在想同样的事情，Jen，我认同我们看到的另一个例子。
 有些人举手了，但我应该打电话给他们吗？
 不。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1768.713s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 道格，继续吧，然后我们就去找埃莱妮。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1772.603s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 先说吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1773.624s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1777.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 我喜欢这个计划演变为公园的方式，我喜欢使用当地植物来创造不同的空间。
 我喜欢淡紫色的墙。
 我喜欢蕨类植物。
 但是关于 Jen 关于维护的评论，这是我的一个更普遍的问题，就像，你知道，
 我想我们都担心让一切都生长在被叶子或其他当地植物覆盖的黄色花朵上。
 城市公园部门每年可以出来做一些维护吗？
 我的意思是，他们需要付出很大的努力来清理和清理
 确保东西不会太大或隐藏，或者只是让植物在公园内创造这些不同的空间中仍然发挥重要作用。
 我认为这是一个需要维护的重要功能。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1834.285s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 我绝对认为我们可以向 DPW 询问此事。
 我们当然也和他们谈过了。
 他们去那里割草等等。
 所以我绝对这么认为，而且不仅仅是我们，对吧？
 全市还有其他一些由中国共产党资助的公园项目。
 有一种类型的维护需要完成，但不能与 CPC 一起使用。
 所以我认为这是，
 我们需要弄清楚这一点，我认为将会就城市预算以及 CPC 项目发挥作用后如何发生一些维护工作进行更广泛的讨论，因为 CPC 资金不能用于维护。
 例如，我们对布鲁克斯庄园进行了同样的谈话。
 所以我觉得是的，我们必须以某种方式解决这个城市的问题。
 我知道，有一次，还有一群朋友和一些邻居在谈论。
 因此，例如，在布鲁克斯庄园，我们会进行春季清洁和秋季清洁。
 也许这里有一些话要对一些邻居说。
 然后你每年出去清洁一次该区域或类似的事情。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1925.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 嘿，这是我唯一的问题，但我真的很喜欢一切的运作方式。
 所以，是的，做得非常好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1932.39s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我想，我不知道，你们告诉我你们的想法，但我的意见是我们不应该，我们应该做出自己的决定。
 在某种程度上，我不想在我们弄清楚的时候担心维护问题，但我们不应该让它妨碍我们的决定，或者也许我们应该，我不知道，我很想听听其他人怎么说。
 道格拉斯，继续吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1955.86s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 是的。
 我喜欢这个想法，即公园团体有某种兴趣，你知道，试图鼓励整个公园的这种所有权和购买，我想。
 显然你不能强迫这样做，但如果那些觉得自己拥有这个公园的邻居能比他们实际上做的更多，就像你说的那样，每年去那里一次并提供一点帮助，那就太好了，因为正如我们所知，这座城市总是在维护方面苦苦挣扎。
 我认为这是向前迈出的一大步。
 我真的很喜欢我所看到的。
 我喜欢历史之旅的想法，因为显然，
 在两个方向上，向前和向后，无论您是从北到南还是反之亦然。
 我有一个简短的问题。
 我想一开始有一个摄影展。
 我认为这是最北面的入口，几乎在桥上，看起来就像墙上的一个缺口。
 这和北边的人行横道不一样吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2011.958s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 嗯，是的。
 那张断墙的照片就在峡谷路。
 是的，在你进行的过程中会有一系列的停顿。
 事实上，这里有一个，就在半山腰上。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2031.04s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 彼得，提醒我，并非所有地点都需要无障碍。
 我们正在使其可以从停车场进入。
 好的。
 好的。
 但墙壁上的所有裂缝并不一定都是可触及的。
 这是正确的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2044.128s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 好的。
 你会这么做的。
 我的意思是，这里的目标（现在还不存在）是提供一条无障碍路线。
 因此，如果公园的某个地方有人声称坐在轮椅上，我对此会更加敏感，因为几年前我的前十字韧带撕裂，当时我正在上蹿下跳。
 我想，好吧，我明白了。
 我理解为什么这些可访问性规则如此重要。
 但是是的，所以无障碍路线就在这里。
 你可以有一个无障碍停车位，这实际上只是标牌，因为道路已经存在，然后是人行道，然后是这里的这条路线。
 是的，整个公园没有必要无障碍。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2091.472s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 我不这么认为，但我想看一下，因为显然，你知道，我们试图在我们可以的地方扩展可访问性，显然，无论我们在哪里。
 我认为你是对的。
 绝对不会超过120。
 我已经走过很多次了
 我认为不可能需要很多资格才能实现这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2107.038s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 这绝对是最平坦的区域，就像你要上坡一样。
 后来这条滑向铁路桥。
 这条路蜿蜒曲折，落差很大，所以这里绝对是最宽、最平坦的地方。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2125.295s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 佩德罗，是否需要改进或需要在人行道上从无障碍人行道到人行横道进行切割？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2133.12s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的，这是一个有趣的问题。
 所以如果我们看一下，就是这样……我们就这么做了。
 你在那里谈论分手的事。
 这就是北方的联系。
 我觉得是拉文还是杰克逊，我很困惑。
 在那里我们看到了我们的人行道。
 现在有两种方法可以做到这一点。
 你可以按照通常的做法，放下人行道，让你的道路有条纹，然后在另一边也放下人行道，或者你可以有一个速度板。
 从概念上讲，速度图很棒，因为它们可以同时做两件事。
 它们会减慢交通和汽车的速度，即使那里有颠簸，汽车也会碾过那个东西。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2180.82s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 这个骗局是没有用的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2182.381s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的。
 这个骗局是没有用的。
 但如果有条纹人行横道，也许还有一些标牌，那就很好了。
 它只是在概念上使行人保持在同一水平面上。
 并不是说你必须下降到汽车的领域，然后再回到人的领域。
 让路给行人，但与您的人交谈可能会有所帮助
 DPW 在我们最终确定之前，因为如果这里有速度表、立交桥，那么你必须注意排水。
 而且你有向下的排水系统，我确信这条路是弯曲的，有拱形的
 水沿着这条曲线流动，然后下降。
 因此，如果您创建一个速度表并且有一个斜坡向下延伸，您将需要一个排水管来收集水。
 有时它不起作用，它不赚钱，但是</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2244.435s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 明白了。
 我确信，一旦我们度过了概念阶段，与该市 DPW 工程部门召开会议将是 100% 合适的。
 还有两个简单的问题。
 这对 Jen 和 Ryan 来说更重要。
 Pomswall 这个名字已经是官方的了，还是每个人都这样称呼它，因为他们知道它会变成什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2266.053s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 这还不是正式的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2268.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 好吧，是的，这绝对不是官方的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2270.917s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 我们这样做是出于对这 100 人的尊重。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2274.299s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 多年来我们一直这么称呼它，因为我们知道管理层完全同意。
 让我们来看看。
 所以，奴隶墙标记。
 他们会把它拿走，对吗？
 由于当前的一切，提议了可能取代它的新标志。
 好的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2291.53s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 约翰·安德森表示，历史学会目前正在审查其所有标志，并讨论用正确的信息更新标志。
 如果我们愿意的话，他说我们当然可以在这种情况下采取主动，因为这个信号特别不正确。
 他们做了很多假设，但没有做任何研究来支持它们。
 嗯，所以如果我们仍然愿意，我们当然可以重新混合下一个盘子并重复使用石头，但我们也可以肯定做其他事情。
 你知道，我当然不会在那块岩石上写那么多文字。
 再说一次，我只想说“庞贝城墙”，也许将其献给庞贝城，也许会说出被奴役人民的名字。
 一些小东西也许可以在街对面的人行道上阅读，因为这种程度的文字可以在彼得为历史步行道提议的一些解释性标牌上看到，而这就是人们实际上会阅读它的地方，如果他们真的读过的话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2360.117s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 而且方向错误，很危险。
 我的意思是，显然，这个标志有一百万个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2366.062s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的，标记它就可以了，你知道，按原样标记就可以了。
 但基本上，它必须可以从汽车、自行车或路过的人身上读取。
 就是这样，所以也许我会说，你知道，庞贝城墙建于 1760 年左右。
 你知道，就是这样，用较大的文字。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2385.707s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 好的，请提供更多细节，我是加入的其他委员会成员之一。
 距离萨加莫尔·约翰纪念馆仅两个街区。
 你认为，也许当我们在历史步道的美洲原住民部分制作标牌时，是否有任何尝试将事物联系在一起，或者这太过分了，瑞安？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2408.11s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 苏·安娜·克劳利告诉我，我们的首要目标应该是邀请土著部落和土著人民讲述他们自己的故事，并让他们在解说小组上完全决定他们想要讲述的内容。
 我百分百相信这是正确的做法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2431.12s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 我和你在一起。
 最后一个问题或评论是，我们已经讨论过这个地方的历史的一部分是交通、铁路、附近的运河。
 这不是历史之旅的一部分，或者可能是。
 对此大家有何看法呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2449.449s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 我只是要介入。
 彼得，如果我们回到场地规划，你的场地规划。
 好的。
 是的。
 我认为有机会环绕土地的后面并形成一个循环，你知道，将后面的路径连接到你前面的路径和可访问的路线，并使整个土地变得某种东西，这样，你知道，如果我们种植它，它仅限于那里的圆形区域，而且，你知道，然后你可以在后面放置一个解释面板。
 可能会有更多关于米德尔塞克斯运河、铁路的讨论，甚至可能，
 布鲁克斯家族的更多历史，因为你正在看布鲁克斯游乐场公园，所以有足够的机会在我们拥有的三个之外添加更多额外的标牌，你可能可以添加三个，也许就是这样，你知道，也许我们会在第一阶段做前面的阶段，在第二阶段做第二阶段，但你知道至少它在那里，你知道我们可以说这是该网站的整个历史，然后
 如果你想了解整个故事，它几乎迫使人们四处走动，从而确保整个公园的安全，因为有人在后面走来走去。
 谢谢。
 这是我的评论，只是将历史路径扩展到整个站点并循环它。
 在这里，对了。
 是的。
 在后面，如果有一个大问题，有一个六英寸长的水管或排水管，从整个房子后面延伸到我们，整个城市甚至不知道我们在考古挖掘期间发现在那里的那条路。
 所以早就被打断了。
 所以这不会是一个分类。
 不会有问题的。
 好的。
 很高兴知道。
 是的。
 是的，他们问我们是否给 Dig Safe 打电话，而 Dig Safe 也不知道它在那里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2568.206s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 所以，一切都很好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2569.888s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2570.628s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 感谢您提出这个问题，道格，因为我认为上次有一个很好的评论，并且我想象了欢迎标志上的交通故事，但在某一时刻。
 您可以在这个欢迎标牌上获得很多信息。
 欢迎来到公园之类的。
 公园为何存在？
 当你在这个公园里的时候也很棒。
 我喜欢火车，火车开得很快，我想有机会回到这里会很有趣。
 我想要
 再走一遍，让我相信它也是平坦的。
 我认为实际上可能会是这样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2623.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 我喜欢这个想法，瑞安，我也认为，你知道，当我们在举行公开会议时收到邻居的来信时，你知道，他们显然担心接触太多，你知道，这个公园的情况正在发生变化。
 但我认为，如果我们专注于这个领域，我们就在这里进行一些创造性的种植，也许进行一些间伐，并真正努力让这条赛道变得特别。
 这也是让公园其他部分保持原样的另一个原因。
 你知道，这又是对枯木和所有东西的一些清理。
 但好像我们只是专注于这个领域。
 目前我们在绿地里没有做任何事情。
 我们不会碰其余的步道、棚屋或孩子们多年来喜欢的任何东西。
 并关注这个历史周期。
 我想我们可以说我们听到了他们的声音，这是对历史部分的一种很好的妥协，你知道，离开社区并喜欢它本来的样子。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2690.567s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的。
 所以，正如彼得所知，我们从 CPC 那里得到了资金来进行所有的路边切割、所有的人行道，城市工程师和交通人员说他们当然不会在每条街道上都设置人行道，但他们会在主要十字路口设置人行道。
 我认为这两个很重要，也许他们会把它们隔开
 为了安全起见，从这里开始是另一条街。
 每个入口处都会有一个路边切口，这是有钱的。
 有足够的钱买海报。
 然后就有钱修剪和重新种植树木。
 具体来说，如果沿途有老树死掉了，我们当然可以集中精力在那片区域，立即重新种植它们，让它们生长。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2743.615s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 太好了，杰克逊路上有一位绅士正在和我说话。我想我通常把车停在这所房子的这所房子前面。
 好人，这是他的评论：我真的很喜欢这里的改进，但是。
 现在，这些大树变得更加明显，而且有一些工作要做，而让某人去做并做好它通常并不便宜，但要依赖社区。
 您所做的一切已经提高了所有这些财产的价值。
 如果我住在这个社区，突然出现了这堵大石墙和这堵经过修复的砖墙，那对社区来说将是积极的一步。
 让人们明白这就是将会发生的事情，因为那里的人们很敏感。
 我认为我们的干预必须谨慎而轻松。
 因为人们保护它。
 他们希望情况变得更好，但我同意，Jen，他们会问，你打算做什么？
 他们很保护自己，因为这是他们放狗的地方，他们认为这是他们的公园。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2822.235s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 我们刚刚讨论的墓地总体规划潜力的一部分是狗，但目前没有针对狗的规则。
 墓地正在讨论未来有多少人会在那里遛狗。
 我提议的一件事是，也许如果市政府说并开始执行遛狗规则，他们就有可能将 Placedead 公园的一部分变成梅德福这边的狗公园，这样在瀑布之外就有一个地方可以去，也许在
 你知道，托马斯布鲁克斯公园成为一个历史公园，你知道，我们考虑这些地方的所有用户，我们为他们提供便利设施，如果我们拿走一些东西，我们会把它放在其他地方，这样每个人都有相同的访问权限。
 然后。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2880.235s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 我也这么认为，我的意思是，因为我在这里遛过我的狗，你知道，你真的会留在小路上，因为如果你尝试，我的意思是，我知道我不会让我的狗跑掉，只是因为你不知道他们会干预什么。
 如果他们撞到棍子或其他东西，你不想被抓住。
 所以我认为，你知道，我认为在未来，如果循环中有某种约束，
 你知道，也许只是一些好的标牌，正如我们恳请的那样，你知道，不要让你的狗走下这里的某种坡道，除非从其他地方出去。
 但话又说回来，我并没有真正看到我去过那里的时候，还有其他人在临时小路上，对，对，最安全，对。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2924.395s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 彼得，我有一个问题，你当然可以花一些时间考虑一下。
 还有其他选择吗？因此，该城市（另一个城市的责任之一，也许现在与 MBTA 部分共同承担）是，我们应该在 MBTA 沿线维护围栏。
 立即地。
 MBTA 显然已经修复了您的栅栏以保持其清洁。
 有没有什么更有吸引力或更好穿但你想隐藏的东西？
 我的意思是，是否有一个黑色的链节可以更耐用并消失在未来的绿色背景中？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2965.794s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 这是我了解到的，或者我们都了解的关于公园的事情，契约中的两项规定是你必须保持墙，威严墙，站立，并且你必须在铁路上保留栅栏，否则布鲁克斯庄园可以在技术上将其拆除，我确信没有人知道，对吗？
 但是，是的，有
 因为现在只有 Chainlink，对吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2995.863s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2997.044s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 好的。
 MBTA 拥有它并把它放进去？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3002.778s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 所以我认为城市里有栅栏。
 然后我认为，随着时间的推移，随着人们砍伐道路，树木倒在上面，MBTA 进行了修复，但它并不是一个建造得很好的围栏。
 随着越来越多的事情落在他身上，他崩溃了。
 所以，你知道，我希望看到一些东西在未来成为更永久的替代品，特别是如果我们要在这个计划上投资的话，你知道，我们不妨让整个地区变得有吸引力。
 即使我们只是从这个小领域开始，我们最终也会把它全部完成。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3032.888s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的，我可能会带着一些建议回到那里，但是，是的，肯定有更好的替代方案可以做到这一点。
 只是不要引起太多注意，但要成为一个很好的分隔者。
 围栏很贵。
 这是一个相当长的部分，但我可以举一些例子来说明它可能是什么，也许只是每英尺的一般成本或类似的东西，线性英尺。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3066.362s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的，我想阻止人们削减它。你知道，我们可以做的一件事就是种植一些不太具有侵入性的东西，例如，我有一个铁丝网，我在那里种植风铃草。
 牵牛花不是你想要在这里种植的植物类型，因为它们会疯狂，但它创造了一面绿色的墙和一面绿色的花朵墙。
 所以，你知道，它会阻止人们试图跳过栅栏、砍断栅栏等。
 所以，你知道，也许我们也可以考虑一下。
 也许艾薇可以克服他什么的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3101.182s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 好的。
 是的。

 是的。
 甚至覆盆子，你知道，本地植物，如覆盆子或蓝莓等果树。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3113.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 好吧，我只是想，彼得，我想尊重你的时间，因为我们已经在这里聊了一个小时了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3119.62s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 所以是的，好吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3121.162s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 还有人有什么意见吗？
 哦，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3127.458s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Acho que só tenho uma pergunta e na verdade é para a comissão: até que ponto você está preocupado em chamar muita atenção para o local da casa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3142.51s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 我认为
 我想，如果我们做了一些事情，一旦我们得到了这里的信息，我想我建议的几乎是盖住并填充你会放置某种保护屏障的地方，类似于你将其视为棕地的方式，这是一种坚固耐用的织物，然后在顶部平整，我不知道，也许是四英寸厚的土壤，足够的土壤，以便你可以种植轻型植物之类的东西，然后，
 这可以保护现场免受挖掘机的侵害。
 如果你要挖掘，那将需要付出巨大的努力。
 但是，你知道，我真的认为，随着我们继续改善这个地方，改善道路和所有便利设施，我真的不认为人是问题所在。
 我认为他们会自我监管。
 我的意思是，这种情况偶尔会发生，但就像国家公园之类的地方一样，那里有数万英亩的土地，人们不会去挖掘。
 所以这只是一个尊重该网站的问题。
 我们越关注它，越多地分享它的故事，就会有越多的人尊重这个网站，而不会对它做任何事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3223.258s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: 也就是说，如果相信它已经被挖掘出来。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3229.583s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的。
 好吧，要么我们知道那里有什么，有人可以想象那里有什么，而不必在地下挖，对吗？
 我们有一些文物，你可以看到那种从地里钻出来的东西，所以没有必要，自己去找的兴奋已经结束了，对吧？
 因为我们知道您会发现什么。
 而且很容易告诉人们，
 考古学是一种有限的资源。
 将铲子放在地上并将其翻转后，就完成了。
 它已经永远完成了。
 我认为人们理解这一点。
 肯定有人会理解，即使是做这种事的外行。
 但你知道，
 这会阻止任何真正的犯罪分子吗？
 他们做或不做并不重要。
 真正想在这里工作的人会搜索该网站并找到它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3291.215s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: 有个问题问你，佩德罗。
 对于这些支柱你有表现出某种形象吗？
 从概念上讲，我
 我想知道：他们高吗？
 它们靠近地面吗？
 您对此有何看法？
 好的。
 我认为你表现出了一些东西，但是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3311.672s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的，我没有表现出任何具体的东西，但我正在思考类似的事情。

 此外，这些是

 因此，如果人们相信的话，我们就有了托马斯·布鲁克斯公园项目，我将要求为十字街公墓支出 1,100 美元。
 我们。
 这意味着公墓委员会和管理人员能够从 CPC 小额赠款项目中获得 4,800 美元。
 我还从自由之路国家历史区获得了 5,000 美元的资助，用于对墓地的石头进行评估。
 这留下了一些额外的钱来做一些事情
 在进行评估本身之前进行实地考察，因为这会影响评估。
 因此，我将要求委员会花费 1,100 美元来支付该项目的剩余预算，并了解公墓将在秋季开始预算，以向 CPC 寻求公墓修复的资金。
 所以我不知道，我们可能还剩下 5,000 美元或更多的钱用于 MHC B 表格。
 您认为城市中是否有任何需要解决的区域，或者道格，您想要关注未来的 CBC 项目，诸如此类的事情？
 彼得，我看到你举手了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3844.894s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 对不起。
 我们要求塔夫茨大学为他们的校园创建一个区域形式，因为我们知道总是有新项目、新增加的一切。
 我认为我们还没有到达那里，但我希望他们花他们的钱，而不是我们的钱，而不是城市的钱，对他们的校园和校园里的重要建筑进行适当的评估，我认为我们现在对此的了解很少。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3875.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 我可以问谁负责社区关系，我们可以看看他准备了什么。
 我的意思是，也许这是有道理的，即使我们有一些钱，也许我们与他们合作，这样他们就能得到更多的钱。
 我的意思是，我当然愿意记录一些建筑物，在某些方面这是我们的责任，但每座建筑物，不，我认为城市不应该为此负责。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3901.861s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 仅限校园的区域形式怎么样？
 是不是太大了？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3907.703s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 我的意思是，有很多东西需要记录，并且可能有不同的区域，例如校园某些区域顶部历史四合院的分隔。
 要知道，这里是和Professor's Row分开开发的，Professor's Row是和边远地区分开开发的。
 塔夫茨。
 方形，因为在棕色和啤酒所在的地方缺乏更好的术语（如果它还在那里）。
 它是一种独立的业务节点。
 然后我可以询问校园内的那个区域，看看我们能得到什么。</p>

 稍微修剪一下是必要的，因为他们希望市政府对树木做一些工作。
 我说，好吧，如果你这样做，你最好遵守诺言。
 你是在没有询问他们的情况下代表 DPW 发言的。
 所以我认为他们批准了它，但他们没有批准它，它比要求的要少，但足以做瑞安认为至关重要的事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4645.373s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的。
 是的。
 我的意思是，那里有钱用于挖掘、标牌、ADA 削减。
 然后，树木的处理发生了很多变化。
 当然不是全部，但没关系。
 我认为这也很重要。
 我对此很满意。
 我的意思是，我想我们说过，我想我们说过，他们告诉我们大约 200,000 或类似的东西。
 但当然，它可能会进行一些细微的调整，而且，你知道，如果树木部门说他们做不到，也许他们会回去说，不，做这一轮，让他们做整个公园。
 另一件事是，伊斯兰文化中心联系我们，要求我们提供下一笔资助的支持信。
 我主要关心的是：他们是否向 CPC 提供了对该建筑或保护计划的任何类型的研究或任何所需的内容？
 因为我知道我看到他们正在窗户上工作。
 但我认为，作为资助这项工作的条件，他们会向中共提供一份保存计划。
 而我什么也没看到。
 这就是为什么，作为一名专员，如果他们不履行对 PCC 的义务，我会犹豫是否支持任何类型的赠款。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4719.346s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 我去问问特蕾莎。
 会议是在明天晚上。
 我先跟她谈谈。
 我什么也没看到，瑞安。
 但这并不意味着它没有发生在行政层面。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4730.525s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 是的，他们要求我们写一封信，我说，如果你可以向我们发送有关该项目的信息，我可以将其列入议程，然后我们可以讨论写一封信。
 但在我们知道您的项目进展情况之前，我不能只是告诉您写一封信。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4747.531s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 如果你不问，他们就会问。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4751.672s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 好的。
 我的意思是，我认为我们一直非常坚定，PCC 也非常坚定地确保在继续工作之前制定计划，无论我们是否愿意。
 而且，你知道，当我看到窗户消失又恢复时，感觉很好。
 但我认为了解正在发生的事情很重要。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4769.633s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 你什么时候看到他们在窗户上工作？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4771.994s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 哦，他们至少从 12 月起就进出大楼了。
 因此，如果您仔细查看，您会发现其中一些已被修复。
 所以我不知道谁为他们做这些工作，但他们显然花钱请人来做这件事。
 我不知道他们是否向 CPC 要求任何形式的退款，但如果知道的话那就太好了。
 因为我记得在那次会议上，为了资助保护工作，他们首先制定了一个计划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4799.844s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 出色地。
 明天晚上我会检查一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4803.545s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 是的。
 好的。
 在我们批准会议纪要之前，还有其他人要说的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4814.208s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 出色地。
 只是一个简单的问题。
 我想我会再次提到这一点。
 布鲁克斯庄园发生了什么？
 有什么好东西吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4822.999s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 你有一个小时吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4826.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 我们可以将其保存到下次会议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4829.665s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 寻找总统的工作仍在继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4831.346s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4833.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 请主，询问您的网络。
 就像外面的蟋蟀一样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4839.953s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 嗯，我的意思是，他们可能会开始告诉人们，通过提高他们的水平，如果他们没有得到总统，他们就会得到整个总统。
 是的，因为那么你们都承担了这项工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4853.563s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 是的，这不是计划，但我很感激。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4858.127s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 这可能会让一些人感到尴尬，并迫使他们加大力度并尝试结交一些朋友。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4861.89s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 我只想说：一份申请要求为新总统的全志愿者角色提供六位数的薪水。
 我无法适应自己。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4873.108s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: 是的，有关于您要寻找的东西的文字吗？
 因为我在网站上有一些。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4880.73s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 有完整的出版物。
 我到处张贴。
 如果您还没有看到的话，也许不是到处都有。
 但是，是的，它位于我们网站上的工具包中，请告诉我。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4889.733s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: 嗨瑞安，我有一个问题要问你。
 南大街有更新吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的，所以南街投票决定继续向市议会进行演示，我很快告诉他们他们需要与社区发展委员会交谈。
 我不确定丹尼斯是否还在这里，但如果他还在，很高兴知道他们是否在
 社区发展委员会获得他们的意见和批准，因为这是进入市议会之前的必要步骤。
 他们明天晚上应该去市政厅，所以我不知道这是否会发生，但我没有检查议程，看看是否有。
 我知道克里斯·巴德这周正在度假，所以上次我查了一下他们没有出去玩。
 所以这对 HTC 来说肯定不太好，但这只是第一步。
 也许在接下来的几个月里他们会有所改善，也许他们的重点是将此事提交给市议会。
 所以如果他们明天真的见面的话，或许就很好了。
 不幸的是，鉴于议程的性质，我认为明晚不是讨论该主题的最佳夜晚。
 但知道即将进行的讨论的特殊性质，我想会有很多人自然会反对这样的事情。
 所以，如果明天他们接近他，他们明天几乎就会把他送去死刑。
 市政府。
 然后丹尼斯说他们还没有出现在CD面板前。
 所以这必须发生。
 这必须在他们去市议会完成该过程之前进行。
 基本上，社区发展委员会是我们的城市规划委员会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: 所以它就没有发生。
 所以本质上，
 自上次以来并没有发生太多事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5016.394s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的，他们想继续前进。
 他们正在努力继续前进。
 我期待着帮助他们前进并确保他们做的一切都是正确的。
 对他们有好处。
 所以我希望他们继续前进，但我也需要帮助他们建立董事会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5034.973s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 另一个问题，因为你上周分发了它，瑞安。
 我对索尔顿斯托大楼的天线当然没有任何问题。
 我想我们没什么可说的，但我只是想确保达成共识。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我没有。
 我想我们已经说了关于建筑本身的内容。
 我认为建设项目正在向前推进。
 所以我无话可说，如果没有人说，我就发表我们的评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 是的，我也没有意见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 收到这些糟糕的、劣质的东西进行审查是很常见的。
 但我的意思是，触发它的是审查的性质。
 我的意思是，有时我们会得到好的结果。
 就像他们从未在 Spot Pond 的 93 号建造巨大的单极子一样，因为那里的反对。
 所以有时它会起作用。
 有时，对超大型信号塔的需求优先于历史保护。
 我想说的是，在附近的斯托纳姆，我们可能有点担心，因为我们担心道路安全的本质。
 斯托纳姆镇正在为一项计划中的 40B 项目而反对拆除斯托纳姆医院。
 我不知道他们是否能够阻止这一切，因为
 40 B 通常相当强大，我知道他们不符合住房限制，因为另一个项目是在与城市斗争了近十年后开始的。
 所以，呵呵。
 他们可以提出要求，我们可以在历史保护方面获得反馈。
 我的意思是，这个网站很有历史意义。
 我不认为这家医院具有任何历史意义，但你知道，他们可以征求意见，而且由于林荫大道、泻湖等原因，我们可能有机会这样做。
 如果您还没有在城镇的另一边看到它，马尔登医院已经不存在了，所以它即将被一家医院取代
 该地区拥有密度极低、最先进的精神卫生保健设施。
 马尔登市正在开垦大约六到八英亩的土地，作为该项目的一部分，这些土地将被永久保留。
 因此，这对于 Hallmark Health 和马尔登市来说是双赢的局面。
 我们已经到了极限。
 其实在50年代，不知道人们还记不记得，
 如果你在这里，那么他们会移动梅德福和马尔登的边界以容纳医院，因为急诊室和产房原来在梅德福，即使你在马尔登医院，他们也必须登记梅德福和马尔登的所有出生。
 所以他们确实改变了该特定区域的边界。
 因此，当您查看 Google 地图时，实际上会出现一些裁剪。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5217.229s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: 但这使得一些人很难获得护照。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5222.312s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的。
 是的，我确信是这样。
 我确信是的。
 我的意思是……太棒了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5228.555s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: 出生地。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5231.336s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 无人之地。
 这里有龙。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5233.877s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 好的。
 门福德和鲍德温之间的非军事区。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5239.2s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的。
 这就是为什么在多切斯特您可以获得出生证明。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5245.867s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 你知道，医院终于在这个网站上做点什么了，这很好。
 我很惊讶他们，我知道他们试图把它变成住房，但我很惊讶，你知道，有人没有尝试在那里走低密度路线。
 但是，你知道，他们在建造这个小型医疗设施后将所有土地开垦为绿地，这一事实是对该地点以前的用途的很好的致敬。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5272.631s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: 这是在马尔登河吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5274.872s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 不，这是在高原。
 如果你知道，你可以从无线电塔看到，比方说，你正沿着菲尔斯路朝菲尔斯路走，在那里它分为东西两部分。
 抬头一看，就是塔。
 以前你可以在那里看到马尔登医院。
 你现在看不到了。
 所以他们在那里看不到任何东西，因为那里只会建造一栋低矮的两层楼房。
 然后。
 你不仅恢复了地平线，还恢复了一切，你知道。
 整个区域。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5312.021s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 那么，好吧，彼得发送了会议记录。
