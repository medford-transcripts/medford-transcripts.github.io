 Sau đó, theo quy định tại Chương 20 của Đạo luật năm 2021, cuộc họp của Ủy ban Lịch sử Thành phố Medford này sẽ được tổ chức từ xa.
 Các thành viên của công chúng muốn tham dự cuộc họp có thể thực hiện điều đó thông qua liên kết Zoom được cung cấp trong chương trình nghị sự.
 Công chúng sẽ không được phép tham gia trực tiếp và công chúng sẽ chỉ có thể tham gia từ xa vào bất kỳ phiên điều trần công khai nào trong cuộc họp này.
 Vâng, cuộc khủng hoảng đã được giải quyết và mọi người đều tham gia.
 Được rồi, tôi sẽ bắt đầu với chương trình nghị sự của chúng ta.
 Peter Hedlund, xin chào và chào mừng, tôi gặp bạn ở đó.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi đặt bạn lên hàng đầu, vậy tại sao không bắt đầu với bạn?
 Tôi nghĩ chúng ta sẽ đi bộ đến Công viên Thomas Brooks.
 Tôi sẽ để bạn xử lý nó từ đây.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1516.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Điều đó thật tuyệt.
 Cảm ơn</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1520.35s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Có thể được không? Vâng, điều đó sẽ hoàn hảo.
 Tiếp tục đi, Jen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1529.697s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: bạn nghĩ gì
 Hãy để tôi bắt đầu.
 Tôi yêu hoa tử đinh hương.
 Tôi là một fan hâm mộ lớn của nó.
 Tôi thích ý tưởng có những bông hoa vàng ở nơi ở trong nhà.
 Cá nhân tôi muốn thấy một số cỏ dại được loại bỏ khỏi khu đất, nhưng tôi hiểu rằng phải có sự cân bằng giữa việc không coi đây chỉ là một lời mời đào bới.
 Điều khiến tôi lo lắng về Goldenrod là vì chúng có nhiều lá nên tôi không muốn chúng bị che phủ.
 Sẽ thật tuyệt nếu đó là một khu vực được phân định ranh giới và được bảo vệ theo cách nào đó để có thể ngắm hoa nở.
 Tôi thích nó nở hoa trong một thời gian dài.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1585.317s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Xuất sắc.
 Vậy Jen, bạn nói mối quan tâm của bạn với dương xỉ là chúng bị che giấu quá nhiều phải không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1593.289s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Không, tôi nghĩ đến hoa vàng, tôi lo lá sẽ tích tụ theo năm tháng không được dọn sạch.
 Sau đó, chúng tôi trồng những chùm màu sắc tuyệt đẹp ẩn giấu sau những chiếc lá rụng hàng năm.
 Vì xuân chưa chắc đã sạch.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1612.681s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Không chắc chắn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1616.625s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Chúng lây lan bao nhiêu?
 Ý tôi là, nếu họ lập bản đồ vị trí của ngôi nhà, ý tôi là, hãy nghĩ khoảng 10 năm nữa, liệu nó có giống phiên bản thứ hai của Vinca không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1635.254s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Ou pa ka limite yo nan limit sa a.
 Họ sẽ đánh dấu điểm và sau đó đánh dấu cạnh, bạn biết đấy, đây là những thứ hoang dã và chúng ta không có ranh giới rõ ràng.
 Vậy bạn nói đúng, họ có thể đi bất cứ đâu, phải không?
 Yo gaye lè l sevi avèk rasin yo.
 Se sa yo ta fè, pa vre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1653.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Có cách nào để tạo ra một đường viền tự nhiên với đá,
 Có thể đó là hai tầng, có viền bên ngoài, rồi màu sắc bên trong là một cách để cố gắng giữ nó khép kín một chút.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1668.332s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Tôi có nó.
 Tuy nhiên, tôi thực sự có một phiên bản hiển thị đường viền gạch ngang
 Thật thú vị khi nói chuyện với Suzanne vì sau khi nói chuyện với cô ấy, tôi đã trò chuyện với Ryan một lúc.
 Tôi rất nhạy cảm với điều này, bạn biết đấy, bạn chỉ thực hiện một cuộc điều tra rất sơ sài về tất cả mọi người trong ủy ban kháng cáo.
 Vâng, Dennis McDougall là một trong những thành viên ủy ban?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1698.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Anh ấy là quản trị viên của chúng tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1700.196s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Vâng, Dennis là bước tiếp theo.
 Xuất sắc.
 Bởi vì có lẽ tôi đã quá cẩn thận hay gì đó, nhưng về cơ bản, Susan nói, bạn không muốn đặt kịch bản vào đó.
 Bạn chỉ cần đi sâu hơn một chút.
 nếu bạn có những thứ này
 Đầu tiên, chúng tôi không biết ngôi nhà thực sự ở đâu.
 Vâng, đây là ước tính từ nơi tôi đang ở.
 Nếu bạn làm cho nó rất rõ ràng, và bạn đặt những viên đá góc này, và bạn đánh dấu các đường nền, và bạn làm rõ chúng cho mọi người, và nó ở một khu vực khuất mà không thể nhìn thấy từ đường phố, anh ấy thực sự lo lắng về điều đó, anh ấy lo lắng về bang Massachusetts.
 Hội đồng Lịch sử Quốc gia sẽ nói, không thể nào.
 Bạn sẽ không thể làm điều này cho đến khi trang web được bán hết.
 Nhưng tôi cũng nghĩ như vậy, Jen, và tôi đồng cảm với một ví dụ khác mà chúng ta đã thấy.
 Một số người đã giơ tay, nhưng tôi có nên gọi cho họ không?
 KHÔNG.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1768.713s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Doug, đi tìm Eleni.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1772.603s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Ann của cung điện đầu tiên.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1773.624s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1777.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tôi thích cách kế hoạch phát triển thành một công viên và tôi thích sử dụng các loại cây bản địa để tạo ra những không gian khác nhau.
 Tôi yêu những bức tường hoa oải hương.
 Tôi thích dương xỉ.
 Nhưng liên quan đến nhận xét của Jen về việc bảo trì, đây là một câu hỏi tổng quát hơn mà tôi có, như bạn biết đấy,
 Tôi nghĩ tất cả chúng ta đều lo lắng về mọi thứ mọc trên những bông hoa màu vàng phủ đầy lá hoặc các loại cây bản địa khác.
 Sở công viên thành phố có thể ra ngoài và thực hiện bảo trì hàng năm không?
 Ý tôi là, phải mất rất nhiều công sức để dọn dẹp và làm sạch
 Đảm bảo mọi thứ không quá lớn hoặc bị che khuất, hoặc chỉ để cây cối vẫn đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc tạo ra những không gian khác nhau trong công viên.
 Tôi nghĩ đây là một tính năng quan trọng cần giữ lại.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1834.285s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Tôi chắc chắn nghĩ rằng chúng ta có thể hỏi DPW về điều đó.
 Tất nhiên chúng tôi cũng đã nói chuyện với họ.
 Họ đến đó để cắt cỏ, v.v.
 Vì vậy, tôi chắc chắn nghĩ như vậy, và không chỉ có chúng ta, phải không?
 Có những dự án công viên khác do ĐCSTQ tài trợ trên toàn thành phố.
 Có một loại bảo trì cần được thực hiện mà CPC không thể sử dụng được.
 Vì thế tôi nghĩ là như vậy,
 Chúng ta cần tìm ra điều đó và tôi nghĩ sẽ có một cuộc thảo luận rộng hơn về ngân sách thành phố và cách thức thực hiện một số công việc bảo trì sau khi chương trình CPC có hiệu lực vì quỹ CPC không thể được sử dụng để bảo trì.
 Ví dụ, chúng tôi đã có cuộc trò chuyện tương tự về Trang viên Brooks.
 Vì vậy, tôi cảm thấy như vậy, chúng ta phải giải quyết vấn đề ở thành phố này bằng cách nào đó.
 Tôi biết, có lúc có một nhóm bạn và vài người hàng xóm đang nói chuyện.
 Vì vậy, ví dụ, tại Brooks Manor, chúng tôi thực hiện dọn dẹp vào mùa xuân và mùa thu.
 Có lẽ ở đây có điều gì đó muốn nói với một số người hàng xóm.
 Sau đó, bạn ra ngoài và dọn dẹp khu vực đó mỗi năm một lần hoặc tương tự.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1925.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Này, đó là vấn đề duy nhất của tôi, nhưng tôi thực sự thích cách mọi thứ hoạt động.
 Vì vậy, vâng, làm rất tốt.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1932.39s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Vâng, ý tôi là, tôi nghĩ, tôi không biết, các bạn hãy cho tôi biết bạn nghĩ gì, nhưng ý kiến ​​của tôi là chúng ta không nên, chúng ta nên tự đưa ra quyết định.
 Theo một cách nào đó, tôi không muốn lo lắng về việc bảo trì trong khi chúng tôi tìm hiểu, nhưng chúng ta không nên để nó cản trở quyết định của mình, hoặc có lẽ chúng ta nên làm vậy, tôi không biết, tôi muốn nghe những gì người khác nói.
 Douglas, tiếp tục đi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1955.86s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Đúng.
 Tôi thích ý tưởng rằng cộng đồng công viên có mối quan tâm nào đó, bạn biết đấy, cố gắng thúc đẩy quyền sở hữu và mua vào khắp công viên, tôi đoán vậy.
 Rõ ràng là bạn không thể ép buộc, nhưng sẽ thật tuyệt nếu những người hàng xóm cảm thấy như họ sở hữu công viên có thể làm nhiều hơn những gì họ thực sự làm, như bạn đã nói, đến đó mỗi năm một lần và giúp đỡ một chút, vì như chúng tôi biết, thành phố vẫn đang gặp khó khăn trong việc bảo trì.
 Tôi nghĩ đây là một bước tiến lớn.
 Tôi thực sự thích những gì tôi nhìn thấy.
 Tôi thích ý tưởng về một chuyến tham quan lịch sử vì rõ ràng,
 Theo cả hai hướng, tiến và lùi, cho dù bạn đang đi từ Bắc vào Nam hay ngược lại.
 Tôi có một câu hỏi nhanh.
 Lúc đầu tôi muốn có một cuộc triển lãm nhiếp ảnh.
 Tôi nghĩ đây là lối vào cực bắc, gần như vượt qua cầu và trông giống như một khoảng trống trên tường.
 Chẳng phải nó khác với lối qua đường ở phía bắc sao?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2011.958s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Vâng, vâng.
 Bức ảnh bức tường bị vỡ này nằm trên đường Canyon.
 Có, sẽ có một loạt các khoảng dừng khi bạn bước đi.
 Trên thực tế, có một cái ở đây, ở lưng chừng núi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2031.04s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Peter, hãy nhắc tôi rằng không phải nơi nào cũng có thể tiếp cận được.
 Chúng tôi đang làm cho nó có thể truy cập được trong bãi đậu xe.
 được rồi
 được rồi
 Nhưng không phải tất cả các vết nứt trên tường đều có thể tiếp cận được.
 Điều đó có đúng không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2044.128s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: được rồi
 Bạn sẽ làm điều đó.
 Ý tôi là, mục tiêu ở đây, vẫn chưa tồn tại, là cung cấp một tuyến đường dễ tiếp cận.
 Vì vậy, nếu ai đó tuyên bố ngồi xe lăn ở đâu đó trong công viên, tôi sẽ nhạy cảm hơn với điều đó vì tôi đã bị rách ACL của mình vài năm trước khi nhảy lên nhảy xuống.
 Tôi nghĩ, được rồi, tôi hiểu rồi.
 Tôi hiểu tại sao những quy tắc truy cập này lại quan trọng đến vậy.
 Nhưng vâng, đó là cách dễ dàng tiếp cận con đường ở đây.
 Bạn có thể có một chỗ đỗ xe dễ tiếp cận, thực chất chỉ là biển báo vì đường đã có sẵn ở đó, rồi có vỉa hè, rồi có con đường này ở đây.
 Có, không cần phải truy cập toàn bộ công viên.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2091.472s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Tôi không tin điều đó, nhưng tôi muốn thấy nó bởi vì rõ ràng, bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi cố gắng mở rộng quyền truy cập ở những nơi chúng tôi có thể, rõ ràng là chúng tôi đang ở đâu.
 Tôi nghĩ bạn đúng.
 Chắc chắn không quá 120.
 Tôi đã trải qua nó nhiều lần
 Tôi không nghĩ có thể cần nhiều bằng cấp để đạt được điều này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2107.038s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Đây chắc chắn là khu vực bằng phẳng nhất, giống như bạn đang đi lên dốc.
 Sau đó nó trượt về phía cầu đường sắt.
 Đường quanh co và có những đoạn dốc lớn nên đây chắc chắn là nơi rộng và bằng phẳng nhất.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2125.295s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Pedro, có cần cải thiện gì hay cắt vỉa hè từ vỉa hè dành cho người khuyết tật sang lối dành cho người đi bộ qua đường không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2133.12s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Vâng, đó là một câu hỏi thú vị.
 Vì vậy, nếu chúng ta nhìn vào nó, đó là... đó là những gì chúng tôi đã làm.
 Bạn đã ở đó để nói về sự chia ly.
 Đây là kết nối phía bắc.
 Tôi nghĩ đó là LaVine hoặc Jackson, tôi bối rối.
 Ở đó chúng tôi nhìn thấy vỉa hè của chúng tôi.
 Bây giờ có hai cách để làm điều này.
 Bạn có thể làm những gì bạn thường làm và đặt máy trải đường cho tuyến đường đã vẽ của mình, sau đó đặt máy lát đường ở phía bên kia hoặc bạn có thể có biểu đồ tốc độ.
 Về mặt khái niệm, bảng tốc độ rất tuyệt vời vì chúng có thể làm hai việc cùng một lúc.
 Chúng làm chậm giao thông và ô tô, thậm chí nếu có va chạm, ô tô sẽ cán qua thứ này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2180.82s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Trò lừa đảo này không hoạt động.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2182.381s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Đúng.
 Trò lừa đảo này không hoạt động.
 Nhưng sẽ tốt hơn nếu có những đoạn được đánh dấu và có thể có một số biển báo.
 Về mặt khái niệm, nó chỉ giữ cho người đi bộ ở cùng đẳng cấp.
 Không phải là bạn phải đi xuống cõi máy móc và quay trở lại cõi người.
 Đưa cho người đi bộ, nhưng có thể hữu ích khi nói chuyện với bạn
 DPW trước khi chúng tôi hoàn thiện nó vì nếu ở đây có đồng hồ tốc độ, cầu vượt thì bạn phải xử lý việc thoát nước.
 Và bạn có hệ thống thoát nước bên dưới và tôi chắc chắn rằng con đường quanh co và có mái vòm
 Nước chảy dọc theo đường cong này và rơi xuống.
 Vì vậy, nếu bạn tạo một đồng hồ tốc độ và bạn có một con dốc đi xuống, bạn sẽ cần một ống thoát nước để thu nước.
 Đôi khi nó không hiệu quả, không kiếm được tiền, nhưng</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2244.435s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Hiểu.
 Tôi chắc chắn rằng cuộc họp với bộ phận kỹ thuật DPW của thành phố sẽ phù hợp 100% sau khi chúng tôi vượt qua giai đoạn lên ý tưởng.
 Hai câu hỏi đơn giản hơn.
 Điều này quan trọng hơn đối với Jen và Ryan.
 Tên của Pomswall đã chính thức chưa, hay mọi người chỉ gọi anh ấy như vậy vì họ biết anh ấy sẽ trở thành ai?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2266.053s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Nó vẫn chưa chính thức.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2268.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Vâng, vâng, nó chắc chắn không phải là chính thức.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2270.917s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Chúng tôi làm điều này vì sự tôn trọng đối với 100 người này.</p>

 Vì vậy, bút đánh dấu tường nô lệ.
 Họ sẽ mang nó đi phải không?
 Vì mọi thứ đang diễn ra hiện nay, một logo mới đã được đề xuất có thể thay thế nó.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2291.53s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: John Anderson cho biết xã hội lịch sử hiện đang xem xét tất cả các dấu hiệu của mình và thảo luận về việc cập nhật chúng với thông tin chính xác.
 Ông nói rằng chúng tôi chắc chắn có thể chủ động trong tình huống này nếu muốn, vì tín hiệu đặc biệt chính xác.
 Họ đưa ra rất nhiều giả định nhưng không có nghiên cứu nào chứng minh chúng.
 Ừm, vì vậy chúng tôi chắc chắn có thể phối lại bài hát tiếp theo và sử dụng lại nhạc rock nếu chúng tôi vẫn muốn, nhưng chúng tôi chắc chắn cũng có thể làm những việc khác.
 Bạn biết đấy, tôi chắc chắn sẽ không viết nhiều lời về hòn đá này.
 Một lần nữa, tôi chỉ định nói "Những bức tường của Pompeii", có thể dành riêng cho Pompeii, có thể đặt tên cho những người nô lệ.
 Một điều gì đó nhỏ nhặt có thể được đọc trên vỉa hè bên kia đường, vì mức độ viết này có thể được nhìn thấy trên một số biển báo diễn giải mà Peter đề xuất cho chuyến đi bộ lịch sử, và đó là nơi mọi người thực sự sẽ đọc nó, nếu họ có đọc nó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2360.117s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Và nó đi sai hướng, rất nguy hiểm.
 Ý tôi là, rõ ràng là có hàng triệu vấn đề với logo này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2366.062s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Vâng, chỉ cần dán nhãn cho nó, bạn biết đấy, dán nhãn cho nó như vậy.
 Nhưng về cơ bản, nó phải dễ đọc đối với ô tô, xe đạp hoặc người qua đường.
 Điều này, có lẽ tôi sẽ nói, bạn biết đấy, những bức tường của Pompeii được xây dựng vào khoảng năm 1760.
 Bạn biết đấy, chỉ vậy thôi, với văn bản lớn hơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2385.707s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Vâng, xin vui lòng biết thêm chi tiết, tôi là một trong những thành viên khác của ủy ban tham gia.
 Chỉ cách Đài tưởng niệm Sagamore John hai dãy nhà.
 Bạn có nghĩ rằng có thể khi chúng tôi làm biển báo trên phần đường mòn lịch sử của người Mỹ bản địa, có nỗ lực nào để gắn kết mọi thứ lại với nhau không, hay là quá đáng, Ryan?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2408.11s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sue Anna Crowley nói với tôi rằng mục tiêu đầu tiên của chúng tôi là mời các bộ lạc bản địa và người dân bản địa kể câu chuyện của riêng họ và để họ hoàn toàn quyết định những gì họ muốn nói trên bảng diễn giải.
 Tôi tin chắc 100% rằng đây là điều đúng đắn nên làm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2431.12s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Tôi ở bên bạn.
 Câu hỏi hoặc nhận xét cuối cùng là, chúng ta đã nói về một phần lịch sử của nơi này là giao thông, đường sắt, con kênh gần đó.
 Đây không phải là một phần của chuyến tham quan lịch sử, hoặc có thể đúng như vậy.
 Bạn nghĩ gì về điều này?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2449.449s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Tôi chỉ định đi vào thôi.
 Peter, nếu chúng ta quay lại phần quy hoạch địa điểm, thì sơ đồ địa điểm của bạn.
 được rồi
 Vâng.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng có một cơ hội để đi ra phía sau khu đất và tạo ra một đường vòng, bạn biết đấy, kết nối lối đi phía sau với con đường phía trước và con đường có thể tiếp cận của bạn và biến toàn bộ khu đất thành một thứ gì đó để, bạn biết đấy, nếu chúng ta trồng nó, nó sẽ được giới hạn trong một khu vực hình tròn ở đó và bạn biết đấy, sau đó bạn có thể đặt một bảng thông dịch ở phía sau.
 Có thể người ta sẽ nói nhiều hơn về Kênh Middlesex, đường sắt và thậm chí,
 Thêm lịch sử gia đình Brooks vì bạn đang xem Công viên Sân chơi Brooks nên có rất nhiều cơ hội để bổ sung thêm nhiều bảng hiệu hơn ngoài ba bảng mà chúng tôi có, bạn có thể thêm ba và có lẽ chỉ vậy thôi, bạn biết đấy, có thể chúng tôi sẽ làm bảng hiệu phía trước trên bảng đầu tiên và bảng thứ hai trên bảng thứ hai, nhưng bạn biết ít nhất nó ở đó và bạn biết chúng tôi có thể nói đó là toàn bộ câu chuyện của trang web.
 Nếu muốn biết toàn bộ câu chuyện, anh ta gần như buộc mọi người phải di chuyển, khiến cả công viên được an toàn vì có người đi bộ phía sau.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Đây là nhận xét của tôi, chỉ cần mở rộng đường dẫn câu chuyện đến toàn bộ trang web và lặp lại nó.
 Đây rồi, đúng rồi.
 Đúng.
 Ở phía sau, nếu có vấn đề lớn thì có một ống nước hoặc ống thoát nước dài 6 inch chạy từ sau nhà tới chỗ chúng tôi, và cả thị trấn thậm chí còn không biết về con đường mà chúng tôi tìm thấy ở đó trong quá trình khai quật khảo cổ.
 Vậy là nó đã bị cắt từ lâu rồi.
 Vì vậy đây sẽ không phải là một sự phân loại.
 Sẽ không có vấn đề gì.
 được rồi
 Thật tốt khi biết.
 Đúng.
 Vâng, họ hỏi chúng tôi có gọi Dig Safe không và Dig Safe cũng không biết nó ở đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2568.206s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Vậy là mọi thứ đều ổn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2570.628s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Cảm ơn câu hỏi, Doug, vì lần trước tôi nghĩ có một bình luận hay và tôi tưởng tượng ra câu chuyện giao thông trên biển chào mừng, nhưng ở một mức độ nào đó.
 Bạn có thể tìm thấy rất nhiều thông tin về dấu hiệu chào mừng này.
 Chào mừng đến công viên hay gì đó.
 Tại sao công viên tồn tại?
 Nó cũng tốt khi bạn ở trong công viên này.
 Tôi yêu những chuyến tàu, chúng đi rất nhanh và tôi nghĩ sẽ rất vui nếu có cơ hội quay lại đây.
 tôi muốn
 Việc đi lại một lần nữa đã thuyết phục tôi rằng nó bằng phẳng.
 Tôi nghĩ thực tế có thể là như vậy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2623.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Tôi thích ý tưởng này, Ryan, và tôi cũng nghĩ rằng, bạn biết đấy, khi chúng tôi nghe từ hàng xóm khi chúng tôi tổ chức các cuộc họp công cộng, bạn biết đấy, họ rõ ràng lo ngại về việc tiếp xúc quá nhiều, bạn biết đấy, mọi thứ đang thay đổi trong công viên này.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ rằng nếu chúng ta tập trung vào khu vực này, chúng ta sẽ thực hiện một số hoạt động trồng trọt sáng tạo ở đây, có thể tỉa thưa một chút và thực sự cố gắng làm cho con đường này trở nên đặc biệt.
 Đây là một lý do khác để giữ nguyên phần còn lại của công viên.
 Bạn biết đấy, lại là việc dọn sạch gỗ chết và mọi thứ.
 Nhưng có vẻ như chúng ta chỉ tập trung vào lĩnh vực này.
 Hiện tại chúng tôi không làm bất cứ điều gì trong không gian xanh.
 Chúng tôi sẽ không chạm vào phần còn lại của những con đường mòn, nơi trú ẩn hoặc bất cứ thứ gì mà bọn trẻ yêu thích trong nhiều năm.
 Và hãy chú ý đến chu kỳ lịch sử này.
 Tôi nghĩ chúng tôi có thể nói rằng chúng tôi đã nghe thấy tiếng nói của họ và đó là một sự thỏa hiệp tốt đẹp về mặt lịch sử, bạn biết đấy, việc rời bỏ cộng đồng và yêu thích nó như những gì nó vốn có.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2690.567s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Đúng.
 Vì vậy, như Peter biết, chúng tôi đã nhận được tài trợ từ CPC để thực hiện tất cả việc cắt lề đường, tất cả vỉa hè, và kỹ sư thành phố cũng như người tham gia giao thông nói rằng họ chắc chắn sẽ không đặt vỉa hè trên mọi con phố, nhưng họ sẽ đặt vỉa hè ở những giao lộ chính.
 Tôi nghĩ hai cái này quan trọng, có lẽ họ sẽ tách chúng ra
 Từ đây là một con đường khác vì lý do an toàn.
 Sẽ có một lối đi vỉa hè ở mỗi lối vào, đó là nơi lấy tiền.
 Có đủ tiền để mua áp phích.
 Sau đó có tiền để chặt và trồng lại cây.
 Đặc biệt, nếu trên đường có cây già chết, chúng ta chắc chắn có thể tập trung vào khu vực này và trồng lại ngay và để chúng phát triển.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2743.615s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: À, có một người đàn ông trên đường Jackson đang nói chuyện với tôi. Tôi nghĩ tôi thường đậu xe trước cửa ngôi nhà này.
 Anh chàng tuyệt vời, đây là đánh giá của anh ấy: Tuy nhiên, tôi thực sự thích những cải tiến ở đây.
 Giờ đây, những cái cây to lớn này ngày càng lộ rõ, có nhiều việc phải làm, và thường thì thuê người làm và làm tốt việc đó không hề rẻ mà còn phụ thuộc vào cộng đồng.
 Những gì bạn đã làm là tăng giá trị của tất cả các tài sản này.
 Nếu tôi sống ở khu phố này và đột nhiên bức tường đá lớn và bức tường gạch được phục hồi này xuất hiện, đó sẽ là một bước đi tích cực cho cộng đồng.
 Hãy để mọi người hiểu rằng đây là điều sẽ xảy ra bởi vì mọi người ngoài kia rất nhạy cảm.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng sự can thiệp của chúng ta phải cẩn thận và nhẹ nhàng.
 Bởi vì người ta bảo vệ nó.
 Họ muốn mọi thứ trở nên tốt hơn, nhưng tôi đồng ý, Jen, họ hỏi, bạn định làm gì?
 Họ rất bảo vệ vì đây là nơi họ nuôi chó và họ nghĩ đây là công viên của họ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2822.235s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Một phần trong kế hoạch tổng thể tiềm năng cho nghĩa trang mà chúng ta vừa thảo luận là dành cho chó, nhưng hiện tại không có quy định nào về chó.
 Nghĩa trang đang tranh luận về việc có bao nhiêu người sẽ dắt chó đi dạo ở đó trong tương lai.
 Một điều tôi đề nghị là có lẽ nếu thành phố nói và bắt đầu thực thi các quy định về dắt chó đi dạo, họ có thể biến một phần của Công viên Placedead thành một công viên dành cho chó ở Medford để có một nơi để đi ra ngoài thác, có thể là vào trong.
 Bạn biết đấy, Công viên Thomas Brooks trở thành một công viên lịch sử, bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi nghĩ đến tất cả những người sử dụng những nơi này, chúng tôi cung cấp thiết bị cho họ và nếu chúng tôi lấy đi thứ gì đó, chúng tôi sẽ đặt nó ở nơi khác để mọi người đều có quyền truy cập như nhau.
 Vào thời điểm đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2880.235s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Tôi cũng nghĩ vậy, ý tôi là, vì tôi đã dắt con chó của mình đến đây, bạn biết đấy, bạn thực sự đi đúng đường vì nếu bạn cố gắng, ý tôi là, tôi biết tôi sẽ không để con chó của mình bỏ chạy chỉ vì bạn không biết chúng sẽ cản trở điều gì.
 Bạn không muốn bị đánh bởi một cây gậy hay thứ gì đó.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ, bạn biết đấy, tôi nghĩ rằng trong tương lai, nếu có một hạn chế nào đó trong làng,
 Bạn biết đấy, có thể chỉ là một số biển báo tốt và khi chúng tôi nhẹ nhàng yêu cầu, bạn biết đấy, đừng để con chó của bạn xuống một đoạn đường dốc nào đó ở đây trừ khi đi nơi khác.
 Nhưng một lần nữa, tôi thực sự không nhìn thấy ai khác trên con đường ngẫu hứng khi tôi ở đó, và vâng, nó an toàn hơn, vâng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2924.395s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Peter, tôi có một câu hỏi mà bạn chắc chắn có thể dành chút thời gian để suy nghĩ.
 Có những lựa chọn khác? Vì vậy, một trong những trách nhiệm của thành phố (một thành phố khác, có lẽ hiện được chia sẻ một phần với MBTA) là chúng ta nên duy trì hàng rào trên MBTA.
 Cùng một lúc.
 MBTA rõ ràng đã sửa chữa hàng rào của bạn để giữ cho nó sạch sẽ.
 Có thứ gì hấp dẫn hơn hoặc đẹp hơn để mặc mà bạn muốn giấu đi không?
 Ý tôi là, có liên kết đen nào bền hơn và biến mất vào nền xanh trong tương lai không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2965.794s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Đây là điều mà tôi đã học được, hoặc tất cả chúng ta đã học, về công viên, hai trong số những quy định trong khế ước là bạn phải giữ bức tường, bức tường Majestic đứng vững và bạn phải giữ hàng rào trên đường sắt, nếu không thì Brooks Estate về mặt kỹ thuật có thể phá vỡ nó, điều mà tôi chắc chắn không ai biết, phải không?
 Nhưng vâng, có
 Vì hiện tại chỉ có Chainlink thôi phải không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2995.863s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2997.044s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: được rồi
 Nó có được sở hữu và vận hành bởi MBTA không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3002.778s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Vì vậy tôi nghĩ có hàng rào trong thành phố.
 Sau đó, tôi nghĩ rằng theo thời gian, khi người ta cắt đường và cây đổ đè lên, MBTA đã tiến hành sửa chữa, nhưng hàng rào được xây dựng không tốt lắm.
 Khi càng có nhiều thứ rơi vào nó, nó sẽ vỡ.
 Vì vậy, bạn biết đấy, tôi muốn thấy thứ gì đó trở thành sự thay thế lâu dài hơn trong tương lai, đặc biệt nếu chúng ta đầu tư vào chương trình này, bạn biết đấy, chúng ta cũng có thể làm cho toàn bộ khu vực trở nên hấp dẫn.
 Ngay cả khi chúng ta chỉ bắt đầu với lĩnh vực nhỏ này, cuối cùng chúng ta cũng sẽ hoàn thành được mọi việc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3032.888s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Có, tôi có thể sẽ quay lại với một số gợi ý, nhưng vâng, chắc chắn có những lựa chọn thay thế tốt hơn để thực hiện việc này.
 Chỉ là không thu hút quá nhiều sự chú ý, nhưng đó là một sự phân chia tốt.
 Hàng rào đắt tiền.
 Đây là một phần rất dài, nhưng tôi có thể đưa ra một số ví dụ về nó có thể là gì, có thể chỉ là chi phí chung cho mỗi foot hoặc đại loại như thế, foot tuyến tính.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3066.362s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Vâng, tôi muốn ngăn chặn mọi người cắt nó. Bạn biết đấy, một điều chúng ta có thể làm là trồng thứ gì đó ít xâm lấn hơn, chẳng hạn như tôi có hàng rào lưới thép để trồng cây chuông xanh.
 Rau muống không phải là loại cây bạn muốn trồng ở đây vì chúng sẽ phát điên nhưng nó tạo ra một bức tường xanh và một bức tường hoa xanh.
 Vì vậy, bạn biết đấy, nó ngăn mọi người cố gắng nhảy qua hàng rào, cắt hàng rào, v.v.
 Vì vậy, bạn biết đấy, có lẽ chúng ta cũng có thể nghĩ về điều đó.
 Có lẽ Ivy có thể tìm hiểu được chuyện đó hay gì đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3101.182s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: được rồi
 Vâng.
 Thứ gì đó có gai.

 Vâng.
 Ngay cả quả mâm xôi, bạn biết đấy, cây bản địa, cây ăn quả như quả mâm xôi hoặc quả việt quất.
 Đúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3113.174s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Chà, tôi chỉ nghĩ, Peter, tôi muốn tôn trọng thời gian của bạn vì chúng ta đã ở đây nói chuyện được một tiếng rồi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3119.62s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: Vì vậy, được rồi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3121.162s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Có ai có ý kiến ​​​​gì khác không?
 Ồ</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3127.458s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Tôi đoán là tôi có một câu hỏi và thực ra nó dành cho ủy ban: bạn lo lắng đến mức nào khi thu hút quá nhiều sự chú ý đến vị trí của ngôi nhà?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3142.51s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: tôi nghĩ
 Tôi nghĩ rằng nếu chúng ta làm điều gì đó, khi chúng ta có được thông tin ở đây, tôi nghĩ điều tôi đề xuất là che phủ và lấp đầy nơi bạn sẽ đặt một loại hàng rào bảo vệ, tương tự như cách bạn nghĩ về nó như một cánh đồng nâu, là một loại vải chắc chắn, bền và sau đó trải phẳng trên cùng với, tôi không biết, có thể là 4 inch đất, đủ đất để bạn có thể trồng cây dưới ánh sáng này, và sau đó, hoặc thứ gì đó tương tự.
 Điều này bảo vệ trang web khỏi máy xúc.
 Nếu bạn muốn đào, nó sẽ đòi hỏi rất nhiều nỗ lực.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy, tôi thực sự nghĩ rằng khi chúng ta tiếp tục cải thiện nơi này, cải thiện đường sá và tất cả các tiện nghi, tôi thực sự không nghĩ con người là vấn đề.
 Tôi nghĩ họ sẽ tự cảnh sát.
 Ý tôi là, điều đó thỉnh thoảng xảy ra, nhưng nó giống như một nơi giống như một công viên quốc gia, nơi có hàng chục nghìn mẫu đất chưa được khám phá.
 Vì vậy, vấn đề chỉ là tôn trọng trang web.
 Chúng ta càng chú ý đến nó và chia sẻ những câu chuyện của nó thì mọi người sẽ càng tôn trọng trang web hơn và không làm gì với nó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3223.258s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Đó là, nếu họ tin rằng nó đã được khai quật.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3229.583s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Đúng.
 Chà, hoặc là chúng ta biết những gì ở đó và người ta có thể tưởng tượng ra những gì ở đó mà không cần đào dưới lòng đất, phải không?
 Chúng tôi có một số hiện vật mà bạn có thể nhìn thấy từ mặt đất nên không cần thiết, cảm giác phấn khích khi tự mình tìm thấy nó cũng kết thúc rồi phải không?
 Bởi vì chúng tôi biết bạn đang nhận được gì.
 Và thật dễ dàng để nói với mọi người,
 Khảo cổ học là một nguồn tài nguyên hữu hạn.
 Khi bạn đặt xẻng xuống đất và lật nó lại, bạn đã hoàn tất.
 Nó được thực hiện mãi mãi.
 Tôi nghĩ mọi người hiểu điều đó.
 Chắc chắn sẽ có người hiểu được, ngay cả một người thường làm những việc như thế.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy,
 Điều này sẽ ngăn chặn bất kỳ tội phạm thực sự?
 Không quan trọng họ có làm điều đó hay không.
 Những người thực sự muốn làm việc ở đây sẽ tìm kiếm trang web và tìm thấy nó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3291.215s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Tôi có một câu hỏi dành cho bạn, Pedro.

 Tôi nghĩ có những người quan sát chim đến đó và vân vân.
 Tôi nghĩ đó là vẻ đẹp của cách tiếp cận tinh tế, bởi vì thực ra bạn không nhất thiết phải

 Tôi nghĩ Ben Franklin đã trích dẫn một cách khác để tưởng tượng ngôi nhà sẽ trông như thế nào.

 Điều này có nghĩa là hội đồng nghĩa trang và những người được quản trị có thể nhận được 4.800 USD từ chương trình tài trợ nhỏ của CPC.

 Vì vậy, tôi không biết, có lẽ chúng tôi còn lại 5.000 đô la trở lên cho MHC Mẫu B.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3844.894s">[Doug Carr]</a>: xin lỗi
 Chúng tôi đã yêu cầu Đại học Tufts tạo ra một khuôn khổ khu vực cho khuôn viên trường của họ vì chúng tôi biết rằng luôn có những dự án mới, những bổ sung mới cho mọi thứ.
 Tôi không nghĩ chúng ta đã đạt được mục tiêu đó, nhưng tôi hy vọng họ chi tiền của mình, không phải tiền của chúng tôi, không phải tiền của thành phố, để đánh giá tốt về khuôn viên trường của họ và các tòa nhà quan trọng trong khuôn viên trường của họ, điều mà tôi nghĩ hiện tại chúng ta biết rất ít về chúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3875.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Tôi có thể hỏi ai chịu trách nhiệm về quan hệ cộng đồng và chúng ta có thể xem anh ấy đã chuẩn bị những gì.
 Ý tôi là, có lẽ điều đó hợp lý, ngay cả khi chúng tôi có một số tiền, có thể chúng tôi hợp tác với họ để họ có thể kiếm được nhiều tiền hơn.
 Ý tôi là, tôi chắc chắn muốn ghi lại một số tòa nhà, và ở một khía cạnh nào đó, đây là trách nhiệm của chúng tôi, nhưng mọi tòa nhà, không, tôi không nghĩ thành phố phải chịu trách nhiệm về việc đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3901.861s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Thế còn một định dạng khu vực chỉ dành cho khuôn viên trường thì sao?
 Nó có quá lớn không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=3907.703s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Ý tôi là, có rất nhiều thứ để ghi lại, và có thể có nhiều khu vực khác nhau, như sự tách biệt của tứ giác lịch sử ở phía trên cùng của một số khu vực nhất định trong khuôn viên trường.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4303.064s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sim, Peter, Sim, Ryan, Sim, Ed Greenlight.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4308.646s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Vâng, Kit, vâng.
 Chà, Peter, tỷ số là 6-0.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4316.768s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Chúng ta có hình chữ B cho rặng núi hoặc sân hiên không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4323.288s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Có một cái bàn khu vực nhưng nó rất cũ.
 Đó là một khu vực đẹp, chặt chẽ, nhỏ gọn.
 Các nhà tư vấn đã xây dựng khu bất động sản Bradley Hall ở xa hơn, vì vậy nếu họ quan tâm, chúng tôi chắc chắn có thể hỏi họ xem họ có muốn xây dựng một cộng đồng tốt đẹp trên một con phố hay không.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4341.174s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Việc xây dựng vẫn đang diễn ra và từ góc nhìn này, tôi có thể dự đoán ai đó sẽ đưa ra quyết định,
 Phá bỏ một số ngôi nhà gỗ nhỏ và xây dựng một cái gì đó lớn hơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4360.786s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Đúng, đó là ý kiến ​​hay, Kit.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4362.827s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Chắc hẳn phải rất sốc khi câu lạc bộ nam ở cuối con đường này bị cháy rụi vào những năm 1980.
 Bạn chắc chắn có thể nhìn thấy nó từ xa hàng dặm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4384.185s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Được rồi, tuyệt vời.
 Có ai có công việc kinh doanh mới không?
 Được rồi, hãy quay lại công việc như thường lệ.
 Tôi không nghĩ chúng tôi sẽ nhận được bất kỳ cập nhật nào trong thời gian trì hoãn bản demo.
 Tôi không nghe thấy nó.
 Chà, không có hướng Nam từ Phố Wareham và Winchester.
 Anh ta không liên quan gì đến người phụ nữ này.
 Không có sự cho phép thực sự để cập nhật.
 Tôi đã liên hệ với chuyên gia xây dựng mới.
 Chúng tôi đã trao đổi một vài email.
 Tôi sẽ cố gắng thuyết phục bạn đến cuộc gặp tiếp theo của chúng ta, hoặc tôi sẽ gặp bạn chỉ để nói rằng tôi muốn giới thiệu bản thân, chào hỏi và xây dựng một mối quan hệ mới.
 Tôi đã gửi email, bạn biết đấy, hôm nay tôi đã gửi email cho nhóm của Bộ Xây dựng khi chúng tôi nhận được giấy phép cho khu đất 82 Greenleaf.
 Vì vậy, tôi đã gửi email cho họ và nói, này, bạn biết đấy, hãy yêu cầu họ điền vào tài liệu demo.
 Để chúng ta có thể tiến về phía trước nhanh nhất có thể.
 Vì vậy, tôi nói rằng, bất cứ khi nào có hỏa hoạn ở một khu nhà nào đó, vui lòng thông báo cho chủ sở hữu để báo cáo ngay để chúng tôi có thể bắt đầu di chuyển càng sớm càng tốt để họ bắt đầu xây dựng lại.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4465.097s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Đặt một câu hỏi hoàn toàn ngu ngốc vì nó được hỏi trong một bối cảnh khác,
 Nếu bạn không may sở hữu một tài sản được bảo hiểm phù hợp và dường như đã phải chịu một số loại thiệt hại do hỏa hoạn, liệu phí của chúng tôi có được tính vào khoản thanh toán bảo hiểm của bạn không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4490.858s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Chúng tôi không tính bất kỳ khoản phí nào.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4492.1s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Có, chúng tôi không tính bất kỳ khoản phí nào.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4493.463s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sở xây dựng thu phí cấp phép nhưng chúng tôi không có giấy phép.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4497.369s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Tất cả đều ổn.
 Tất cả đều ổn.
 Tất cả đều ổn.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng sẽ phải trả khoản phí 500 USD nếu yêu cầu trì hoãn bản demo.
 Hay tôi sai?
 Không, họ chưa bao giờ mặc chúng.
 Tất cả đều ổn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4504.221s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Không.
 Không, chúng tôi, không, không, chúng tôi muốn đi lối này, nhưng tôi không biết.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4510.072s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Tôi không biết, tôi không biết, tôi, tôi, tôi không biết họ không cho nó vào.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4514.894s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Không, điều duy nhất chúng tôi yêu cầu bây giờ là người nộp đơn phải trả chi phí quảng cáo hợp pháp.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4520.517s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Tất cả đều ổn.
 Cái này, cái này, cái này có thể được bao gồm vì nó là phí giấy phép.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4528.861s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ừm
 Vâng.
 Chà, Ryan đã xem xét Nghĩa trang Cross Street nên chúng tôi đã sẵn sàng cập nhật, phải không?
 Xuất sắc.
 Có thông tin cập nhật nào về dự án nghiên cứu này không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4546.562s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Các chuyên gia tư vấn đã gửi rất nhiều hồ sơ đến Fulton Heights.
 Tôi đã xử lý hóa đơn của bạn.
 Họ nghĩ rằng họ sẽ có thể làm được điều đó vào tháng 5, đó là một tin tốt cho chúng tôi.
 Dự án này sẽ vượt quá mong đợi của tôi, vì vậy điều đó là tốt.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4565.373s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Đặc biệt.
 Có Doug ở Công viên Thomas Brooks không?
 Bạn có biết rằng giai đoạn thứ hai của dự án của chúng tôi đã được phê duyệt?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4580.196s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Vì vậy, họ đã chấp thuận đơn đăng ký, họ chấp thuận đơn đăng ký dài vì tôi đến đó để thuyết trình và thảo luận, nhưng chúng tôi đang chờ nó lên hội đồng thành phố.
 Bạn có đúng không Douglas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4593.243s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Tôi nghĩ điều này đúng.
 Có một cuộc họp vào ngày mai.
 Tôi sẽ kiểm tra nó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4598.706s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Có đợt đơn đăng ký thứ hai nào cần được phê duyệt không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4604.397s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Tôi không nghĩ vậy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4606.178s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Tôi liên tục thấy những bài đăng trên mạng xã hội như thế này: Tất cả các dự án đều ở đó, nhưng chúng tôi thì không.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4613.42s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Hãy để tôi kiểm tra.
 Tôi sẽ liên lạc với bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4615.88s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Được rồi, cảm ơn bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4616.921s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Nhưng họ đã làm được, họ đã chấp thuận nó.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ họ, Ryan, anh và tôi đã nhắn tin tối hôm đó và tôi nghĩ họ đang cố gắng để có được
 Cần phải cắt bớt một chút vì họ muốn thành phố thực hiện một số công việc chăm sóc cây cối.
 Tôi nói, nếu vậy thì tốt nhất cậu nên giữ lời.
 Bạn đang phát biểu thay mặt cho DPW mà không được yêu cầu.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ họ đã chấp thuận nó, nhưng họ không chấp thuận nó, nó ít hơn mức yêu cầu, nhưng cũng đủ để làm những gì Ryan cảm thấy quan trọng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4645.373s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Đúng.
 Đúng.
 Ý tôi là, có tiền để đào, biển báo, cắt giảm ADA.
 Sau đó có rất nhiều thay đổi trong cách đối xử với cây cối.
 Tất nhiên không phải tất cả, nhưng không sao cả.
 Tôi nghĩ điều đó cũng quan trọng.
 Tôi hạnh phúc với nó.
 Ý tôi là, tôi nghĩ chúng tôi đã nói, tôi nghĩ chúng tôi đã nói, họ nói với chúng tôi khoảng 200.000 hoặc tương tự như vậy.
 Nhưng chắc chắn, có thể cần một số điều chỉnh nhỏ và, bạn biết đấy, nếu bộ phận trồng cây nói rằng họ không thể làm được, có thể họ sẽ quay lại và nói, không, thực hiện vòng này và để họ thực hiện toàn bộ công viên.
 Một điều nữa là Trung tâm Văn hóa Hồi giáo đã liên hệ với chúng tôi để yêu cầu thư hỗ trợ cho khoản trợ cấp tiếp theo của họ.
 Mối quan tâm chính của tôi là: CPC có được tiến hành bất kỳ loại nghiên cứu nào hoặc bất kỳ điều gì cần thiết trong kế hoạch xây dựng hoặc bảo tồn không?
 Bởi vì tôi biết tôi đã thấy họ làm việc trên cửa sổ.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ rằng để có điều kiện tài trợ cho công việc này, họ sẽ cung cấp cho Đảng Cộng sản Trung Quốc một kế hoạch bảo tồn.
 Và tôi không thấy gì cả.
 Vì vậy, với tư cách là ủy viên, tôi sẽ miễn cưỡng hỗ trợ bất kỳ loại trợ cấp nào nếu chúng không đáp ứng các nghĩa vụ của PCC.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4719.346s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Tôi sẽ hỏi Teresa.
 Cuộc họp diễn ra vào tối mai.
 Tôi sẽ nói chuyện với anh ấy trước.
 Tôi không thấy gì cả, Ryan.
 Nhưng điều đó không có nghĩa là nó không đạt đến cấp điều hành.
 Đúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4730.525s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Vâng, họ yêu cầu chúng tôi viết một lá thư, và tôi nói, nếu bạn có thể gửi cho chúng tôi thông tin về dự án, tôi có thể đưa nó vào chương trình nghị sự và sau đó chúng ta có thể bàn về việc viết một lá thư.
 Nhưng tôi không thể bảo bạn viết một lá thư cho đến khi chúng tôi biết dự án của bạn đang tiến triển như thế nào.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4747.531s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Nếu bạn không hỏi, họ sẽ làm.
 Đúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4751.672s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: được rồi
 Ý tôi là, tôi nghĩ chúng tôi đã rất kiên quyết và PCC cũng rất kiên quyết trong việc đảm bảo rằng chúng tôi có sẵn kế hoạch trước khi tiếp tục làm việc, dù chúng tôi có muốn hay không.
 Và bạn biết đấy, tôi cảm thấy thật dễ chịu khi nhìn thấy những cánh cửa sổ biến mất và quay trở lại.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ điều quan trọng là phải hiểu điều gì đang xảy ra.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4769.633s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Khi nào bạn thấy họ làm việc trên cửa sổ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4771.994s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Ồ, và họ đã ra vào tòa nhà ít nhất là từ tháng 12.
 Vì vậy, nếu bạn nhìn kỹ, bạn sẽ thấy rằng một số trong số chúng đã được sửa.
 Vì vậy, tôi không biết ai làm việc cho họ, nhưng rõ ràng là họ trả tiền cho người khác để làm việc đó.
 Tôi không biết liệu họ có yêu cầu bất kỳ hình thức hoàn tiền nào từ CPC hay không, nhưng thật vui nếu được biết.
 Bởi vì tôi nhớ trong cuộc họp này, lần đầu tiên họ đã phát triển một kế hoạch nhằm tài trợ cho các nỗ lực bảo tồn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4799.844s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Xuất sắc.
 Tôi sẽ kiểm tra nó vào tối mai.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4803.545s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Đúng.
 được rồi
 Có điều gì khác mà mọi người muốn nói trước khi chúng tôi phê duyệt biên bản không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4814.208s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Xuất sắc.
 Chỉ là một câu hỏi đơn giản.
 Tôi nghĩ tôi sẽ đề cập đến điều đó một lần nữa.
 Chuyện gì đã xảy ra ở trang viên Brooks?
 Có cái gì tốt không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4822.999s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Bạn có một giờ không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4826.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Chúng ta có thể lưu nó cho cuộc họp tiếp theo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4829.665s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Cuộc tìm kiếm tổng thống vẫn tiếp tục.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4831.346s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4833.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Xin Chúa, hãy hỏi mạng của bạn.
 Giống như lũ dế ngoài kia.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4839.953s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Ý tôi là, họ có thể bắt đầu nói với mọi người rằng khi họ nâng cao trình độ, nếu họ không có được tổng thống, họ sẽ có được toàn bộ tổng thống.
 Vâng, bởi vì sau đó tất cả các bạn sẽ phải làm việc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4853.563s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Vâng, đó không phải là kế hoạch, nhưng tôi rất biết ơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4858.127s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Điều này có thể khiến một số người bối rối và buộc họ phải nỗ lực hết mình và cố gắng kết bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4861.89s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Chỉ cần nói rằng: Một đơn xin việc yêu cầu mức lương sáu con số cho vai trò tình nguyện viên của tân tổng thống.
 Tôi không thể thích nghi với chính mình.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4873.108s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Có, có văn bản nào về thứ bạn đang tìm kiếm không?
 Bởi vì tôi có một số trên trang web.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4880.73s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Có ấn phẩm đầy đủ.
 Tôi đăng nó ở khắp mọi nơi.
 Nếu bạn chưa nhìn thấy nó, có thể nó không có sẵn ở mọi nơi.
 Nhưng vâng, nó có trong bộ sản phẩm trên trang web của chúng tôi, vui lòng cho tôi biết.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4889.733s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Xin chào Ryan, tôi có một câu hỏi dành cho bạn.
 Có thông tin cập nhật nào về South Street không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Đúng vậy, vì vậy South Street đã bỏ phiếu đồng ý tiếp tục thuyết trình trước Hội đồng Thành phố và tôi nhanh chóng nói với họ rằng họ cần nói chuyện với Ủy ban Phát triển Cộng đồng.
 Tôi không chắc Dennis có còn ở đó không nhưng nếu có thì thật vui nếu biết họ có ở đó hay không
 Lấy ý kiến và phê duyệt của Ủy ban Phát triển Cộng đồng vì đây là bước cần thiết trước khi trình lên Hội đồng Thành phố.
 Họ dự kiến ​​sẽ đến Tòa thị chính vào tối mai, vì vậy tôi không biết liệu điều đó có xảy ra hay không, nhưng tôi đã không kiểm tra chương trình nghị sự để xem liệu điều đó có xảy ra hay không.
 Tôi biết tuần này Chris Bader đang đi nghỉ nên lần trước tôi đã kiểm tra xem họ có đi chơi không.
 Như vậy chắc chắn là không tốt cho HTC nhưng mới chỉ là bước đầu.
 Có thể trong những tháng tới họ sẽ cải thiện, có thể trọng tâm của họ là đưa vấn đề lên hội đồng thành phố.
 Vì vậy có lẽ sẽ thật tuyệt nếu họ thực sự gặp nhau vào ngày mai.
 Thật không may, do tính chất của chương trình nghị sự, tôi không nghĩ tối mai là đêm thích hợp nhất để thảo luận về chủ đề này.
 Nhưng biết tính chất cụ thể của cuộc thảo luận sẽ diễn ra, tôi nghĩ sẽ có nhiều người đương nhiên phản đối những điều như thế này.
 Vì vậy, nếu ngày mai họ tiếp cận anh ấy, họ gần như sẽ đưa anh ấy vào chỗ chết vào ngày mai.
 Tòa thị chính.
 Sau đó Dennis nói rằng chúng không còn xuất hiện trên bảng CD nữa.
 Vì vậy điều này phải xảy ra.
 Việc này phải được thực hiện trước khi đến hội đồng thành phố để hoàn tất thủ tục.
 Về cơ bản, Ban Phát triển Cộng đồng là ban quy hoạch của thành phố chúng ta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Vì vậy nó đã không xảy ra.
 Vì vậy về cơ bản,
 Không có nhiều chuyện xảy ra kể từ lần trước.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5016.394s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Vâng, họ muốn tiến về phía trước.
 Họ đang cố gắng đi tiếp.
 Tôi mong muốn được giúp họ tiến về phía trước và đảm bảo rằng họ đang làm mọi việc đúng đắn.
 Tốt cho họ.
 Vì vậy, tôi muốn bạn tiến về phía trước, nhưng tôi cũng cần giúp bạn xây dựng tấm ván của mình.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5034.973s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Còn một câu hỏi nữa vì tuần trước cậu đã đưa nó rồi, Ryan.
 Tôi chắc chắn không gặp vấn đề gì với ăng-ten ở Tòa nhà Saltonstall.
 Tôi không nghĩ chúng ta có điều gì để nói, nhưng tôi chỉ muốn đảm bảo rằng chúng ta có cùng quan điểm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Vâng, ý tôi là, tôi đã không làm thế.
 Tôi nghĩ chúng ta đã nói điều đó về chính kiến ​​trúc.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng dự án xây dựng đang tiến triển.
 Vì vậy, tôi không có gì để nói, và nếu không có ai nói điều đó, tôi sẽ đăng bình luận của bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vâng, tôi cũng không có vấn đề gì với điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Việc nhận được những điều tồi tệ, tồi tệ như vậy để xem xét là điều rất bình thường.
 Nhưng ý tôi là, nguyên nhân gây ra nó là bản chất của việc kiểm duyệt.
 Ý tôi là, đôi khi chúng tôi đạt được kết quả tốt.
 Giống như họ chưa bao giờ chế tạo chiếc cột đơn khổng lồ vào năm 93 tại Spot Pond vì sự phản đối ở đó.
 Vì vậy, đôi khi nó hoạt động.
 Đôi khi nhu cầu về các tháp di động rất lớn được ưu tiên hơn việc bảo tồn lịch sử.
 Tôi có thể nói rằng ở Stoneham gần đó, chúng tôi có lẽ hơi lo ngại vì chúng tôi lo lắng về tính chất an toàn đường bộ.
 Thành phố Stoneham đang đấu tranh phá bỏ Bệnh viện Stoneham để phục vụ dự án 40B đã được quy hoạch.
 Tôi không biết liệu họ có thể ngăn chặn điều đó bởi vì
 40 B thường rất mạnh, tôi biết họ không đáp ứng được các hạn chế về nhà ở vì họ đã bắt đầu một dự án khác sau gần một thập kỷ chiến đấu với thành phố.
 Vậy hehe.
 Yêu cầu có thể được thực hiện và chúng tôi có thể nhận được phản hồi về việc bảo tồn lịch sử.
 Ý tôi là, trang web này rất lịch sử.
 Tôi không nghĩ bệnh viện có ý nghĩa lịch sử nào, nhưng bạn biết đấy, họ có thể xin lời khuyên và chúng ta có thể có cơ hội làm điều đó vì có đại lộ, đầm phá, v.v.
 Nếu bạn chưa nhìn thấy nó ở phía bên kia thị trấn thì bệnh viện Maldon không còn tồn tại nên sẽ có bệnh viện thay thế nó.
 Khu vực này có mật độ cơ sở chăm sóc sức khỏe tâm thần rất thấp.
 Thành phố Malden sẽ thu hồi khoảng sáu đến tám mẫu đất sẽ được bảo tồn vĩnh viễn như một phần của dự án.
 Vì vậy, đây là tình huống đôi bên cùng có lợi cho Hallmark Health và thành phố Malden.
 Chúng tôi đã đạt đến giới hạn của mình.
 Thực ra, vào những năm 1950, tôi không biết mọi người có còn nhớ không,
 Nếu bạn ở đó, thì họ đã chuyển biên giới giữa Medford và Malden để bố trí bệnh viện vì phòng cấp cứu và phòng sinh ban đầu là Medford, và ngay cả khi bạn ở Bệnh viện Malden, tất cả các ca sinh đều phải được đăng ký ở Medford và Malden.
 Vì vậy họ đã thay đổi ranh giới của khu vực này.
 Vì vậy, khi bạn nhìn vào Google Maps, thực tế có một số loại cây trồng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5217.229s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: Nhưng điều này gây khó khăn cho một số người trong việc lấy hộ chiếu.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5222.312s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Đúng.
 Vâng, tôi chắc chắn là như vậy.
 Tôi chắc chắn là như vậy.
 Ý tôi là... nó thật tuyệt vời.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5228.555s">[MCM00001614_SPEAKER_01]</a>: nơi sinh</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5231.336s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Không có đất của con người.
 Ở đây có rồng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5233.877s">[Doug Carr]</a>: được rồi
 Khu phi quân sự giữa Menford và Baldwin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5239.2s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Đúng.
 Đây là lý do tại sao bạn có thể tìm thấy giấy khai sinh ở Dorchester.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5245.867s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bạn biết đấy, thật tốt là bệnh viện cuối cùng cũng đã làm gì đó với địa điểm này.
 Tôi ngạc nhiên rằng họ, tôi biết họ đã cố gắng biến nó thành nhà ở, nhưng tôi ngạc nhiên rằng, bạn biết đấy, có người đã không cố gắng đi theo con đường mật độ thấp.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy, việc họ khai hoang toàn bộ khu đất làm không gian xanh sau khi xây dựng cơ sở y tế nhỏ này là một sự đồng thuận tốt đẹp cho việc sử dụng địa điểm trước đây.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5272.631s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: Đây có phải là trên sông Maldon không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5274.872s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Không, cái này ở trên khay.
 Nếu bạn biết, bạn có thể nhìn thấy từ tháp radio chẳng hạn như bạn đang đi bộ dọc theo Đường Fells về phía Đường Fells, nơi nó chia đôi theo hướng đông và tây.
 Nhìn lên, có tòa tháp.
 Trước khi bạn có thể nhìn thấy bệnh viện Maldon.
 Bây giờ bạn không thể nhìn thấy nó.
 Vì vậy, họ sẽ không nhìn thấy bất cứ thứ gì ở đó vì chỉ có một tòa nhà hai tầng thấp được xây dựng ở đó.
 Vào thời điểm đó.
 Bạn không chỉ khôi phục lại chân trời, bạn còn khôi phục mọi thứ, bạn biết đấy.
 toàn bộ khu vực.</p>
