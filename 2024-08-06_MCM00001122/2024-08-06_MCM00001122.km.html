    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

 ការបោកប្រាស់នេះមិនដំណើរការទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែវានឹងប្រសើរជាងប្រសិនបើមានផ្នែកដែលបានសម្គាល់ ហើយប្រហែលជាមានសញ្ញាមួយចំនួន។
 តាមគំនិត វាគ្រាន់តែរក្សាអ្នកថ្មើរជើងនៅកម្រិតដូចគ្នា។
 វាមិនមែនថាអ្នកត្រូវតែចុះចូលទៅក្នុងអាណាចក្រមេកានិចហើយត្រឡប់ទៅអាណាចក្រមនុស្សវិញ។

 ទឹកហូរតាមខ្សែកោងនេះហើយធ្លាក់។

 តើមានព័ត៌មានថ្មីៗនៅ South Street ទេ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: ត្រូវហើយ ដូច្នេះ South Street បានបោះឆ្នោតដើម្បីបន្តធ្វើបទបង្ហាញទៅកាន់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាក្រុង ហើយខ្ញុំបានប្រាប់ពួកគេភ្លាមៗថា ពួកគេចាំបាច់ត្រូវនិយាយទៅកាន់គណៈកម្មាធិការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍សហគមន៍។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ប្រាកដ​ថា តើ Dennis នៅ​ទីនោះ​ឬ​អត់​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​ប្រសិន​បើ​ដូច្នេះ វា​ជា​ការ​ល្អ​ដើម្បី​ដឹង​ថា​តើ​ពួកគេ​នៅ​ឬ​អត់
 ទទួលបានមតិយោបល់ និងការយល់ព្រមពីគណៈកម្មាធិការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍សហគមន៍ ព្រោះនេះជាជំហានចាំបាច់មុននឹងដាក់ជូនក្រុមប្រឹក្សាក្រុង។
 ពួកគេគ្រោងនឹងមកសាលាក្រុងនៅយប់ស្អែក ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថានឹងកើតឡើងឬយ៉ាងណាទេ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំមិនបានពិនិត្យមើលរបៀបវារៈដើម្បីមើលថាតើវានឹងកើតឡើងឬអត់។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថា Chris Bader កំពុងវិស្សមកាលនៅសប្តាហ៍នេះ ដូច្នេះលើកចុងក្រោយដែលខ្ញុំបានពិនិត្យដើម្បីមើលថាតើពួកគេកំពុងដើរលេងឬអត់។
 នោះពិតជាមិនល្អសម្រាប់ HTC ទេ ប៉ុន្តែវាគ្រាន់តែជាការចាប់ផ្តើមប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ប្រហែលជានៅប៉ុន្មានខែខាងមុខ ពួកគេនឹងប្រសើរឡើង ប្រហែលជាការផ្តោតអារម្មណ៍របស់ពួកគេនឹងផ្តោតលើការនាំយកបញ្ហាទៅក្រុមប្រឹក្សាក្រុង។
 ដូច្នេះ​ប្រហែល​ជា​ល្អ​ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួក​គេ​ពិត​ជា​បាន​ជួប​គ្នា​នៅ​ថ្ងៃ​ស្អែក។
 ជាអកុសល ដោយសារលក្ខណៈនៃរបៀបវារៈ ខ្ញុំមិនគិតថាយប់ថ្ងៃស្អែកជាយប់ដែលសមរម្យបំផុតដើម្បីពិភាក្សាប្រធានបទនេះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែការដឹងពីលក្ខណៈជាក់លាក់នៃការពិភាក្សាដែលនឹងប្រព្រឹត្តទៅ ខ្ញុំគិតថានឹងមានមនុស្សជាច្រើនដែលនឹងជំទាស់ដោយធម្មជាតិចំពោះអ្វីមួយដូចនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួកគេ​ចូល​ទៅ​ជិត​គាត់​នៅ​ថ្ងៃ​ស្អែក ពួកគេ​ស្ទើរតែ​នឹង​សម្លាប់​គាត់​នៅ​ថ្ងៃ​ស្អែក។
 សាលាក្រុង។
 បន្ទាប់មក ដេនីស បាននិយាយថា ពួកគេលែងបង្ហាញខ្លួននៅលើបន្ទះស៊ីឌីទៀតហើយ។
 ដូច្នេះរឿងនេះត្រូវតែកើតឡើង។
 នេះត្រូវធ្វើមុននឹងទៅក្រុមប្រឹក្សាក្រុងដើម្បីបញ្ចប់នីតិវិធី។
 សំខាន់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាអភិវឌ្ឍន៍សហគមន៍ គឺជាក្រុមប្រឹក្សារៀបចំផែនការទីក្រុងរបស់យើង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: ដូច្នេះវាមិនបានកើតឡើងទេ។
 ដូច្នេះជាមូលដ្ឋាន,
 មិន​មាន​អ្វី​ច្រើន​កើត​ឡើង​តាំង​ពី​លើក​មុន​មក។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5016.394s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: បាទ ពួកគេចង់ឆ្ពោះទៅមុខ។

 ខ្ញុំទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំជួយពួកគេឆ្ពោះទៅមុខ និងធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាពួកគេកំពុងធ្វើរឿងត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ល្អសម្រាប់ពួកគេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ឱ្យ​អ្នក​ឈាន​ទៅ​មុខ ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​ត្រូវ​ជួយ​អ្នក​ក្នុង​ការ​កសាង​ក្តារ​របស់​អ្នក​ផង​ដែរ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5034.973s">[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>: សំណួរមួយទៀតព្រោះអ្នកបានផ្តល់វាកាលពីសប្តាហ៍មុន Ryan ។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនមានបញ្ហាជាមួយអង់តែននៅអាគារ Saltonstall ទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​យើង​មាន​អ្វី​ត្រូវ​និយាយ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រាកដ​ថា​យើង​នៅ​លើ​ទំព័រ​តែ​មួយ​។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: បាទ ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ខ្ញុំមិនបានធ្វើទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងនិយាយអំពីស្ថាបត្យកម្មខ្លួនឯង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​គម្រោង​សាង​សង់​មាន​ការ​រីក​ចម្រើន។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គ្មាន​អ្វី​ត្រូវ​និយាយ​ទេ ហើយ​បើ​គ្មាន​អ្នក​ណា​និយាយ​ទេ ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​បញ្ចេញ​មតិ​របស់​អ្នក។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: បាទ ខ្ញុំក៏មិនមានបញ្ហាជាមួយវាដែរ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: វាជារឿងធម្មតាណាស់ដែលទទួលរឿងអាក្រក់ និងអាក្រក់បែបនេះដើម្បីមើល។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ន័យ​ថា អ្វី​ដែល​បណ្ដាល​ឲ្យ​វា​ជា​លក្ខណៈ​នៃ​ការ​ចាប់​ពិរុទ្ធ។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ពេលខ្លះយើងទទួលបានលទ្ធផលល្អ។
 ដូច​ជា​ពួក​គេ​មិន​ដែល​បាន​សាង​សង់​ឯកតោភាគី​យក្ស​ក្នុង​ឆ្នាំ ៩៣ នៅ Spot Pond ដោយ​សារ​តែ​ការ​ប្រឆាំង​នៅ​ទី​នោះ។
 ដូច្នេះពេលខ្លះវាដំណើរការ។
 ពេលខ្លះតម្រូវការសម្រាប់ប៉មកោសិកាធំ ៗ យកអាទិភាពលើការអភិរក្សជាប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថានៅជិត Stoneham យើងប្រហែលជាមានការព្រួយបារម្ភបន្តិច ដោយសារយើងព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីធម្មជាតិនៃសុវត្ថិភាពផ្លូវ។
 ទីក្រុង Stoneham កំពុងប្រយុទ្ធដើម្បីកម្ទេចមន្ទីរពេទ្យ Stoneham ដើម្បីសម្រួលដល់គម្រោង 40B ដែលបានគ្រោងទុក។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាតើពួកគេអាចបញ្ឈប់វាបានទេព្រោះ
 40 B ជាធម្មតាមានកម្លាំងខ្លាំង ខ្ញុំដឹងថាពួកគេមិនបានជួបនឹងការរឹតបន្តឹងលំនៅដ្ឋានទេ ពីព្រោះពួកគេបានចាប់ផ្តើមគម្រោងមួយផ្សេងទៀតបន្ទាប់ពីជិតមួយទសវត្សរ៍នៃការប្រយុទ្ធជាមួយទីក្រុង។
 ដូច្នេះ ហេហេ។
 សំណើអាចត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើង ហើយយើងអាចទទួលបានមតិកែលម្អទាក់ទងនឹងការអភិរក្សប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា គេហទំព័រនេះមានលក្ខណៈប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​មន្ទីរពេទ្យ​មិន​មាន​សារៈសំខាន់​ជា​ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​អ្នក​ដឹង​ទេ​ថា​គេ​អាច​សុំ​យោបល់ ហើយ​យើង​ប្រហែល​ជា​មាន​ឱកាស​ធ្វើ​បែប​នោះ​ដោយសារ​មហាវិថី បឹង​ជាដើម។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនបានឃើញវានៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃទីក្រុងនោះ មន្ទីរពេទ្យ Maldon លែងមានទៀតហើយ ដូច្នេះមានមន្ទីរពេទ្យដើម្បីជំនួសវា។
 តំបន់នេះមានដង់ស៊ីតេទាបបំផុតនៃកន្លែងថែទាំសុខភាពផ្លូវចិត្ត។
 ទីក្រុង Malden នឹងទទួលបានដីប្រហែលពី 6 ទៅ 8 ហិចតា ដែលនឹងត្រូវរក្សាទុកជាអចិន្ត្រៃយ៍ជាផ្នែកនៃគម្រោង។
 ដូច្នេះ នេះជាស្ថានភាពឈ្នះ-ឈ្នះសម្រាប់ Hallmark Health និងទីក្រុង Malden។
 យើងបានឈានដល់ដែនកំណត់របស់យើង។
 តាមពិតនៅទសវត្សរ៍ឆ្នាំ 1950 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាតើអ្នកនៅចាំទេ?
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកនៅទីនោះ ពួកគេបានផ្លាស់ប្តូរព្រំដែនរវាង Medford និង Malden ដើម្បីផ្ទុកមន្ទីរពេទ្យ ព្រោះបន្ទប់សង្គ្រោះបន្ទាន់ និងបន្ទប់សម្រាលដំបូងគឺ Medford ហើយទោះបីជាអ្នកនៅមន្ទីរពេទ្យ Malden ក៏ដោយ កំណើតទាំងអស់ត្រូវតែចុះឈ្មោះនៅ Medford និង Malden ។
 ដូច្នេះពួកគេបានផ្លាស់ប្តូរព្រំដែននៃតំបន់នេះ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលអ្នកក្រឡេកមើល Google Maps វាពិតជាមានដំណាំជាច្រើនប្រភេទ។</p>
