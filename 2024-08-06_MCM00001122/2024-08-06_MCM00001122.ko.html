 그 때에는 2021년 20장에 명시된 바와 같이 메드퍼드시 역사위원회 회의가 원격으로 개최됩니다.
 회의에 참석하기를 원하는 일반 대중은 의제에 제공된 Zoom 링크를 통해 참석할 수 있습니다.
 일반인은 직접 참석할 수 없으며 회의 중 공청회에는 원격으로만 참석할 수 있습니다.
 예, 위기는 해결되었으며 이미 모두가 동참하고 있습니다.
 음, 우리의 의제부터 시작하겠습니다.
 Peter Hedlund 안녕하세요. 환영합니다. 여기서 다시 뵙겠습니다.
 그래서 우리는 당신을 최우선으로 생각합니다. 당신부터 시작해 보는 것은 어떨까요?
 내 생각엔 토마스 브룩스 공원까지 걸어가야 할 것 같아.
 여기서부터 이 문제를 해결하는 것은 여러분에게 맡기겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=55.843s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 응, 고마워요, 제인.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=96.33s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Yeah.
 OK, is that working?
 Yes.
 Great.
 OK.
 Yep.
 So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.
 So let's get rolling here.
 Okay.
 So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?
 Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.
 We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.
 Here they are in picture form.
 You've checked off these first three boxes.
 Nicely done.
 You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.
 You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.
 It doesn't look like this anymore.
 I've been out to the site a number of times.
 We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.
 It's interesting.
 People are very protective about this park.
 They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.
 And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.
 They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.
 The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.
 This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.
 And then there were
 six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.
 This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.
 These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,
 1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after
 settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.
 This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.
 It's a pretty successful day.
 So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.
 It's a long document.
 It's very interesting to read.
 PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.
 Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.
 In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.
 and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.
 Okay, so this is the approximate house location.
 This is looking south on the existing footpath.
 You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.
 This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.
 So there's not a lot there.
 You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.
 Vinca has taken over.
 Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.
 And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.
 There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.
 Some more site photos.
 This is the north entrance.
 You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.
 So this would be the north entrance.
 And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.
 There are openings as well.
 So this is the draft concept.
 This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.
 And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.
 The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.
 Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.
 I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.
 Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.
 Right now the parks not accessible at all.
 There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.
 People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.
 Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.
 Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.
 The history walk would
 The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.
 There would be a number of historic markers 3.
 One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.
 Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.
 So this kind of a palimpsest of history.
 And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.
 So one here at this entrance and one to the north.
 at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.
 We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this
 location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.
 This proposal would have two new crosswalks.
 Right now there aren't any.
 These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.
 Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.
 This would really
 just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.
 For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.
 The footpath already exists.
 It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.
 The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.
 We don't have a field survey there, but I think,
 we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.
 The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.
 Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.
 That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.
 So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.
 The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.
 This is a good opportunity.
 This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.
 It was part of a larger estate.
 It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.
 It would also identify this as town property.
 I think it's a useful thing to do.
 Then a series of historic markers.
 One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.
 and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.
 So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.
 This upper left map
 is the overall estate.
 The estate dates back to 1660.
 This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.
 Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,
 piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.
 On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.
 Walling plan.
 Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.
 You can see this is our site right here.
 This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.
 And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.
 Nothing much happened on it.
 It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation
 a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.
 And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.
 A lot to discuss there, but important.
 So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?
 Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.
 The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.
 In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.
 Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.
 This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.
 These are great images.
 The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.
 Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more
 overgrowth taking over the wall there.
 And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.
 This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.
 So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.
 But the wall was constructed about 1760.
 The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.
 And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.
 Well, that's the reason why right there.
 It's in the in the.
 Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.
 Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.
 And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.
 That's also important.
 And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.
 The sign could interpret the history of this site.
 This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.
 In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.
 This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.
 There were three big black walnuts in front.
 There are still a couple walnuts on site.
 We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.
 is a black walnut.
 House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.
 Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.
 How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?
 Also, interpretation we can think of.
 How do we do that?
 The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.
 I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.
 We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.
 Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.
 Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.
 This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.
 It's a different site.
 It's up on a hill.
 It's grassy.
 It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat
 a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.
 They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.
 Then this is an example Ryan suggested.
 It's a great one.
 It's a great house site.
 The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.
 As I understand it,
 related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.
 And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.
 These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.
 And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.
 Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.
 We're not going to build this tomorrow.
 We're thinking perhaps longer term.
 But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.
 There are still important artifacts underground there.
 You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.
 I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,
 And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?
 And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.
 But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.
 So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.
 And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,
 her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.
 So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.
 There's a lot left to find here.
 So having said that,
 If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?
 You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.
 Just leave it as it is.
 Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.
 You could also plant something there.
 plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.
 If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's
 naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.
 Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.
 It's really a great deciduous fern.
 also acts as a ground cover.
 In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.
 I think it would work pretty well.
 It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.
 So that's an idea.
 One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.
 This is also a native plant, Gold Star.
 It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were
 thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.
 But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.
 For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.
 So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 been around for hundreds of years.
 This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.
 They have a big Mother's Day.
 Has anybody been to that?
 It's really cool.
 You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.
 But why lilacs?
 Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts
 Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.
 And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,
 They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 That'd be neat.
 Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.
 They peek out over the wall.
 Lilacs are tough as nails.
 Now, here's what that might look like.
 This is the existing wall after the renovation from
 Grove Street and what that might look like.
 A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.
 I think they do pretty well there.
 They're tough plants.
 This is South and Western exposure.
 It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.
 This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.
 A sense of what this would look like.
 I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.
 I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.
 Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.
 That's it.
 I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1516.451s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 놀라운.
 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1520.35s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 이것이 가능합니까? 네, 이거면 완벽할 것 같아요.
 계속 힘내세요, 제인</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1529.697s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 어떻게 생각하나요?
 시작하겠습니다.
 나는 백합을 좋아합니다.
 나는 이것의 열렬한 팬이다.
 나는 안에 노란색 꽃이 들어 있다는 아이디어를 좋아합니다.
 개인적으로 저는 사이트에서 잡초 중 일부가 제거되는 것을 보고 싶지만 보지 못하는 것 사이에 균형이 있어야 한다는 것을 이해합니다. 이는 단지 파헤쳐 보라는 초대일 뿐입니다.
 금박에 대해 나를 괴롭히는 것은 덮고 싶지 않은 나뭇잎이 많다는 것입니다.
 이곳이 꽃을 볼 수 있는 보호구역으로 지정되어 있다면 참 좋겠습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1585.317s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 이상적인.
 그럼 제인, 양치류에 대한 걱정은 숨겨져 있다고 했죠?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1593.289s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 아니요, 노란 꽃을 생각하면 잎이 여러 해 동안 쌓여서 깨끗하지 않을 까봐 두렵습니다.
 그리고 매년 우리는 단풍 뒤에 숨겨진 아름답고 다채로운 꽃을 심습니다.
 봄이 꼭 예쁘기만 할 필요는 없으니까.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1612.681s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 확신하지 못했습니다.</p>

 그들은 점을 표시한 다음 가장자리를 그립니다. 아시다시피 이곳은 거친 곳이고 명확한 경계가 없습니다.
 그럼 당신 말이 맞아요. 그들은 어디든 갈 수 있죠, 그렇죠?
 나를 보고 싶다면 당신은 행복합니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1653.168s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 돌로 자연적인 경계를 만드는 방법이 있나요?
 아마도 두 가지에는 외부 경계가 있고 내부의 색상은 이를 약간 닫으려고 하는 방법일 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1668.332s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 나는 이것을 가지고 있습니다.
 하지만 국경 너머에 사본이 나타납니다.
 Susan과 이야기를 나눈 후 잠시 동안 Ryan과 이야기를 나누었기 때문에 Susan과 이야기를 나누는 것은 흥미로웠습니다.
 나는 이것에 매우 민감합니다. 당신은 방금 항소위원회의 모든 구성원과 함께 지저분한 조사를 진행했습니다.
 네, Denis McDougall이 위원회 위원 중 한 명인가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1698.975s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 그 사람이 우리 매니저예요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1700.196s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 음, 다음은 데니스입니다.
 이상적인.
 제가 너무 조심스러워서 그랬을 수도 있겠지만 기본적으로 Susan은 시나리오를 공개하고 싶지 않다고 말했습니다.
 당신이 해야 할 일은 조금 더 깊이 파고드는 것뿐입니다.
 이것들이 있다면
 우선 우리는 집이 어디에 있는지 모릅니다.
 글쎄, 그것은 내가 어디에 있는지에 대한 대략적인 추정치입니다.
 그걸 지적하면 그 기둥을 제자리에 놓고 기준선을 그어 모든 사람에게 보여주면 보이지 않는 도로 덮개에 있는데, 그 사람은 그걸 정말 걱정하고 있고, 매사추세츠를 걱정하고 있어요.
 국립역사위원회(National Historical Board)는 그렇지 않다고 말할 것입니다.
 사이트가 판매될 때까지는 이 작업을 수행할 수 없습니다.
 하지만 나 또한 그렇게 생각하며, 제인과 나는 우리가 보고 있는 또 다른 예를 동일시합니다.
 많은 분들이 손을 들고 계시는데, 불러야 할까요?
 절대.</p>

 나는 라벤더 벽을 좋아합니다.
 나는 양치류를 좋아합니다.
 하지만 떠나는 것에 대한 Jane의 의견에 관해서는 제가 흔히 받는 질문이 있습니다.
 나는 우리 모두가 노란 꽃, 덮개 잎 또는 기타 자생 식물에서 자라는 모든 것에 대해 우려하고 있다고 생각합니다.
 도시 공원 부서에서 연간 유지 관리를 수행할 수 있나요?
 내 말은 청소와 소독에는 많은 노력이 필요하다는 것입니다.
 물건이 너무 크거나 숨겨져 있지 않은지 확인하거나 정원에서 다양한 공간을 만드는 데 나무가 계속해서 중요한 역할을 하도록 하세요.
 지원하는데 있어서 중요한 기능이라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1834.285s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 실제로 이에 대해 DPW에 물어볼 수 있을 것 같습니다.
 물론 우리도 그들과 이야기를 나누었습니다.
 그들은 잔디를 깎으러 그곳으로 갑니다.
 그래서 그런 것 같아요. 우리뿐만이 아니죠?
 도시 주변에는 중국 공산당이 자금을 지원하는 다른 공원 프로젝트도 있습니다.
 CPC에서 요구하지 않지만 수행해야 하는 유지 관리 유형이 있습니다.
 그래서 내 생각엔
 우리는 신중하게 생각해야 하며, 중국 공산당 자금은 개조에 사용될 수 없기 때문에 중국 공산당 프로그램이 시행되면 도시 예산과 일부 개조 작업이 어떻게 이루어질 것인지에 대해 더 폭넓은 논의가 있을 것이라고 생각합니다.
 예를 들어, 우리는 Brooks의 소유권에 관해 비슷한 대화를 나누고 있습니다.
 그래서 저는 우리가 이 도시를 다루어야 한다고 생각합니다.
 어느 날 친구들과 이웃 몇 명이 그곳에서 이야기를 나누고 있었다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 예를 들어, Brooks Manor에서는 봄과 가을에 청소를 합니다.
 아마도 이웃님들께 드릴 말씀이 있을 것 같습니다.
 그런 다음 1년에 한 번 이상 해당 지역을 청소하러 나가십시오.
 괜찮은</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1925.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 아, 그게 내 유일한 문제인데 모든 것이 작동하는 방식이 정말 맘에 들어요.
 네, 잘했어요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1932.39s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 그래, 내 말은, 내 생각엔 모르겠어. 어떻게 생각하는지 말해줘. 하지만 내 생각은 우리가 그렇게 해서는 안 되고 우리가 스스로 결정해야 한다는 거야.
 어쨌든, 나는 우리가 배울 때 조심하는 것에 대해 걱정하고 싶지 않지만 그것이 우리의 결정을 방해하도록 놔두어서는 안 됩니다. 아니면 어쩌면 그래야 할지도 모르겠습니다. 다른 사람들이 말하는 것을 듣고 싶습니다.
 더글러스, 부탁해요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=1955.86s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 나는 공원 커뮤니티가 공원 전반에 걸쳐 소유권과 소유권을 장려하는 데 어느 정도 관심을 갖고 있다는 생각을 좋아합니다.
 물론 그것을 강요할 수는 없지만, 자신이 공원을 소유하고 있다고 생각하는 이웃이 자신보다 더 많은 일을 할 수 있다면 좋을 것이라고 그녀는 말합니다. 우리가 알고 있듯이 도시에는 여전히 유지 관리 문제가 있기 때문에 1년에 한 번 그곳에 가서 조금씩 도움을 주어야 합니다.
 나는 이것이 큰 진전이라고 생각합니다.
 나는 내가 보는 것을 정말 좋아합니다.
 나는 역사 여행이라는 아이디어를 좋아합니다. 왜냐하면 분명히...
 북쪽에서 남쪽으로 또는 그 반대로 가거나 앞뒤 방향 모두에서.
 빠른 질문이 있습니다.
 처음에는 사진전을 기획하고 싶었어요.
 내 생각엔 이곳이 북쪽 입구인 것 같은데, 다리를 거의 건너편에 있는 벽에 구멍이 난 것 같다.
 북쪽 복도와 다르지 않습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2011.958s">[MCM00001628_SPEAKER_14]</a>: 응, 응.
 파괴된 벽의 이 사진은 Canyon Street에 있습니다.

 사실 여기에는 거의 산이 많은 곳이 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2031.04s">[Doug Carr]</a>: Peter는 그것이 모든 곳에서 가능한 것은 아니라는 점을 나에게 상기시켜 줍니다.

 아직 달성되지 않은 목표는 액세스를 제공하는 것입니다.
 그래서 누군가가 공원 어딘가에서 휠체어를 타고 있다고 주장하면 나는 그것에 더 민감합니다. 왜냐하면 몇 년 전에 나는 ACL이 뛰다가 아래로 펄쩍 뛰다가 찢어졌기 때문입니다.
 나는 모든 것이 괜찮다고 생각했습니다. 이해합니다.
 나는 이러한 접근 규칙이 왜 중요한지 이해합니다.
 하지만 네, 도로로 쉽게 접근할 수 있습니다.
 접근 가능한 주차 공간이 있을 수 있습니다. 도로가 이미 거기에 있고 보도도 있으므로 그것이 단지 표시일 뿐입니다.
 네, 공원 전체를 방문할 필요는 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=2091.472s">[Doug Carr]</a>: 믿기지 않지만 보고 싶습니다. 왜냐하면 분명히, 알다시피, 우리는 지금 있는 곳에서 가능한 한 범위를 넓히려고 노력하고 있기 때문입니다.
 나는 당신이 옳다고 생각합니다.
 물론 120을 넘지 않습니다.
 나는 이것을 여러 번 겪었습니다.
 나는 그것이 많은 학위를 필요로 할 것이라고 생각하지 않습니다.</p>

 이것이 북쪽 연결이다.
 라빈인지 잭슨인지 헷갈리네요.
 여기 부두가 보입니다.
 이제 이 작업을 수행하는 방법에는 두 가지가 있습니다.
 평소와 같이 계획된 경로에 포장재를 놓은 다음 반대쪽에 포장재를 놓거나 속도 차트를 사용할 수 있습니다.
 기본적으로 스피드보드의 좋은 점은 두 가지 일을 동시에 할 수 있다는 점이다.
 그들은 교통과 자동차의 속도를 늦추고 충돌이 발생하더라도 자동차가 그들을 덮칠 것입니다.</p>

 이상적으로 이는 단순히 보행자를 동일한 수준으로 유지합니다.
 그렇다고 해서 기계의 세계로 내려갔다가 다시 인간의 세계로 돌아가야 한다는 뜻은 아니다.
 이 보행자를 생각해 보세요. 하지만 이야기해 볼 가치가 있을 수도 있습니다.
 DPW, 아직 끝내지 않겠습니다. 속도계나 육교가 있으면 하수 시스템을 처리해야 하기 때문입니다.
 그리고 그 밑에 배수구가 있어서 길이 바람이 많이 불고 구불구불할 거라고 확신합니다.
 물은 이 곡선을 따라 흐르며 떨어진다.
 따라서 타키미터를 제작하고 경사가 경사진 경우 물을 모으기 위한 배수구가 필요합니다.
 때로는 잘 안되고 돈도 못 벌지만...</p>

 하지만 내 생각에 우리가 이 분야에 초점을 맞춘다면 우리는 여기서 좀 더 섬세하고 창의적인 식물을 심고 이 도로를 특별하게 만들려고 노력할 것입니다.
 이것이 공원의 나머지 부분이 그대로 유지되는 또 다른 이유입니다.
 다시 말하지만 죽은 나무와 그 모든 것을 제거하는 것입니다.

 제가 제안하고 싶은 한 가지는 시가 입장을 취하고 개 법을 시행하기 시작하면 Placedead 공원의 일부를 Medford의 개 공원으로 전환하여 폭포 뒤, 아마도 실내 공간을 확보할 수 있다는 것입니다.
 아시다시피, 토마스 브룩스 공원은 역사적인 공원이 되었습니다. 아시다시피 우리는 이 장소를 사용하는 모든 사람들을 생각하고 그들에게 장비를 제공하며, 무언가를 가져가면 다른 곳에 두어 모든 사람이 동등하게 접근할 수 있도록 합니다.
 이때.</p>

 당신은 막대기 나 다른 것에 맞고 싶지 않습니다.
 그래서 제 생각에는 앞으로 마을에 제한이 있을 것 같아요.
 아시다시피 그것은 아마도 좋은 징조일 뿐이며 우리가 정중하게 물어보면 다른 곳으로 가지 않는 한 개가 여기 경사면에서 떨어지지 않도록 하십시오.

 점점 더 많은 것들이 무너지면서.
 그래서 저는 미래에 좀 더 영구적인 옵션이 되는 것을 보고 싶습니다. 특히 우리가 이 프로그램에 투자하면 전체 지역을 매력적으로 만들 수도 있습니다.
 비록 이 작은 영역에서 시작하더라도 시간이 지나면 모든 것을 성취하게 될 것입니다.</p>

 이른 아침은 미쳐버릴 것 같아 여기에 심고 싶은 식물이 아니라 녹색 벽과 녹색 꽃의 벽을 만들어낸다.
 그래서 사람들이 울타리를 뛰어넘거나 울타리를 건너는 등의 행위를 하지 못하게 합니다.
 그러니까 아마도 우리도 그것에 대해 생각해봐야 할 것 같아요.
 어쩌면 아이비가 알아낼 수도 있을 것 같아요.</p>

 이는 묘지위원회와 관리위원회가 CTC의 소액 보조금 프로그램으로부터 $4,800를 받을 수 있음을 의미합니다.
 또한 저는 묘지석을 평가하기 위해 Freedom Trail 국립역사지구로부터 5,000달러의 보조금을 받았습니다.
 이렇게 하면 작업을 할 때 추가 비용을 절약할 수 있습니다.
 평가에 영향을 미칠 수 있으므로 평가를 하기 전에 해당 부동산을 방문하시기 바랍니다.
 따라서 저는 묘지가 묘지를 개조하기 위해 CTC로부터 자금을 확보하기 위해 가을부터 자금 준비를 시작할 것이라는 점을 이해하면서 남은 예산 중 1,100달러를 이 프로젝트에 지출하도록 시의회에 요청하고 싶습니다.

 사우스 스트리트에 대한 소식은 없나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=4900.598s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 예, South Street는 시의회 앞에서 쇼를 계속하기로 투표했고 즉시 지역사회 개발 위원회와 대화해야 한다고 말했습니다.
 Dennis가 거기에 있었는지는 잘 모르겠지만, 그렇다면 그들이 있었다면 알아두는 것이 좋습니다.
 이는 시의회에 신청서를 제출하기 전에 필요한 단계이므로 지역사회 개발 위원회로부터 피드백과 승인을 받으십시오.
 내일 저녁 시청에 오실 예정이라 그렇게 될지는 모르겠지만, 그런 일이 일어날지 안건은 확인하지 못했습니다.
 Chris Bader가 이번 주에 휴가 중이라는 것을 알고 있어서 지난번에 확인했을 때 그들이 놀고 있었습니다.
 이는 HTC에게는 안타까운 일이지만 이는 시작에 불과합니다.
 아마도 상황은 앞으로 몇 달 안에 개선될 것이며 아마도 그들은 문제를 시의회에 가져오는 데 초점을 맞출 것입니다.
 그러니 내일 만나면 좋을 것 같아요.
 불행하게도, 그 의제의 성격을 고려할 때, 저는 내일 저녁이 이 주제를 논의하기에 적절한 저녁이 될 것이라고 믿지 않습니다.
 하지만 논의의 내용을 알면 당연히 이런 것에 반대하는 분들도 많을 것이라고 생각합니다.
 그러므로 내일 그에게 접근하면 내일 반드시 그를 죽일 것입니다.
 시청.
 그런 다음 Dennis는 더 이상 CD에 나타나지 않는다고 말했습니다.
 그래서 이런 일이 일어나야 합니다.
 이 절차는 시의회에 가서 절차를 완료하기 전에 이루어져야 합니다.
 지역사회 개발 위원회가 우리 시의 계획 위원회라는 점을 기억하는 것이 중요합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5008.495s">[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>: 그래서 이런 일은 결코 일어나지 않았습니다.

 나는 Saltonstall 건물의 안테나에 아무런 문제가 없습니다.
 우리가 할 말이 없다고 생각하지만, 우리가 같은 입장인지 확인하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5050.043s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 응, 내 말은, 난 그런 짓을 하지 않았다는 거야.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5063.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 네, 그것도 문제 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001122&t=5068.927s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 그런 나쁘고 추악한 것들을 지켜봐야 할 때가 많습니다.
 하지만 그건 비극 때문이었다는 뜻이에요.
 내 말은, 가끔은 좋은 결과가 나올 때도 있다는 거야.
 그것은 마치 그곳의 저항 때문에 1993년에 Spot Pond에 거대한 일방통행 프로젝트를 건설하지 못한 것과 같습니다.
 그래서 때로는 효과가 있습니다.
 때로는 대형 기지국의 필요성이 역사 보존보다 우선시되기도 합니다.
 내 말은, Stoneham 근처에서는 도로 안전의 본질에 대해 우려하기 때문에 우리는 약간 걱정할 수도 있습니다.
 Stoneham시는 계획된 40B 프로젝트를 수용하기 위해 Stoneham 병원을 철거하기 위해 싸우고 있습니다.
 그들이 그걸 막을 수 있을지 모르겠어 왜냐하면
 40B는 일반적으로 꽤 강하고, 약 10년 동안 도시와 싸운 후 다른 프로젝트를 시작했기 때문에 주택 제한을 부과하지 않은 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 그럼 헤헤.
 역사 보존 문제에 대한 제안과 의견을 제시할 수 있습니다.
 내 말은 이곳이 매우 역사적이라는 뜻이다.
 저는 병원이 역사적으로 중요하다고 생각하지 않습니다. 하지만 병원에서 조언을 구할 수 있고 Lake Boulevard 덕분에 우리가 그런 기회를 얻을 수도 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 마을 반대편에서 본 적이 없다면 Maldon 병원은 더 이상 존재하지 않으므로 그 자리를 대신할 병원이 있습니다.
 이 지역은 정신 건강 시설의 밀도가 가장 낮습니다.
 Malden은 프로젝트의 일부로 영구적으로 예약될 6~8에이커의 토지를 받게 됩니다.
 따라서 이는 Hallmark Health와 Malden이 모두 윈윈할 수 있는 상황입니다.
 우리는 한계에 도달했습니다.
 사실 1950년대에는 잘 모르겠어요. 기억하시나요?
 그곳에 있었다면 병원을 수용하기 위해 메드포드와 몰든 사이의 경계를 옮겼습니다. 왜냐하면 응급실과 첫 번째 출산실이 메드포드에 있었기 때문이고, 몰든 병원에 있었다고 해도 메드포드와 몰든에서의 모든 출산은 등록을 해야 했습니다.
 그래서 그들은 지역의 경계를 변경했습니다.
 그래서 구글 지도를 보면 실제로 그곳에서 많은 농작물을 발견할 수 있습니다.</p>
