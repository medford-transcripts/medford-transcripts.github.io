1
00:00:01,558 --> 00:00:02,598
Sorry, everybody, I was late.

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:11,722
Okay, pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

3
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:17,744
Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

4
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:26,947
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

5
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:32,959
Okay, crisis averted, everybody got in.

6
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:38,862
Okay, I'll start with our agenda.

7
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:43,604
Peter Hedlund, hi, welcome, I see you're here.

8
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:47,926
So we had you up first, so why don't we start with you?

9
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:52,308
I think we're going to circle back on the Thomas Brooks Park.

10
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:55,489
I'll let you take it from here.

11
00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:56,723
Great, thanks, Jen.

12
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:58,523
Hi, Ryan, and everybody else.

13
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:00,064
Good to see everybody.

14
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:03,084
So let's see if I share my screen.

15
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,404
Oh, hold on.

16
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:08,765
I need to make you a host in order to share your screen.

17
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:09,645
OK.

18
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:10,165
Hold on.

19
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:10,906
Let me add you.

20
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,646
Can I add you as a host?

21
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:18,067
Oh, Ryan, only Ryan can do it because I'm not on as a host.

22
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:19,787
Yeah, I'll get there.

23
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:20,227
Hold on.

24
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:21,067
OK, sorry.

25
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:23,028
Where are you?

26
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,428
There you are.

27
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:26,687
Big co-host.

28
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:28,828
All right, see if you can go forth.

29
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:30,188
OK, let's see.

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:36,610
Yeah.

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,691
OK, is that working?

32
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:39,191
Yes.

33
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:39,791
Great.

34
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:40,131
OK.

35
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:47,944
Yep.

36
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:56,530
So thanks for having me back again, been thinking about this and happy to present the next round of ideas.

37
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,513
So let's get rolling here.

38
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:01,334
Okay.

39
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:13,182
So just a quick recap, not as in-depth as last time, but was everybody on this call at the last meeting a month or two ago?

40
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:13,623
Yeah.

41
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:17,609
Okay, great.

42
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:24,353
So the 2020 master plan, I was fortunate enough to lead that process.

43
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:34,338
We came up with these nine different focus areas and areas to implement out of that plan.

44
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:38,745
Here they are in picture form.

45
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,547
You've checked off these first three boxes.

46
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:42,568
Nicely done.

47
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:46,572
You restored the wall, now called Pomp's Wall.

48
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:54,839
You oversaw the archaeological dig at the estate, number 2, and repaired the Grove Street edge.

49
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,782
It doesn't look like this anymore.

50
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,345
I've been out to the site a number of times.

51
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:05,075
We'll meet some neighbors when I'm out there.

52
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:05,936
It's interesting.

53
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,937
People are very protective about this park.

54
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:13,021
They want to know what I'm doing out there with a camera and clipboard maybe.

55
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:20,886
And then when I tell them I was involved with the master plan and we're not putting in something crazy here, but this is what we're doing.

56
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:23,528
They fixed up the brick wall and the edge.

57
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,137
The few people I've seen out there are really positive about the changes.

58
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:38,649
This one woman, her husband, participated in the archaeological dig, so the people I've met are happy with the improvements.

59
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:39,610
And then there were

60
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:54,882
six more improvements out of the master plan, and numbers 4, 5, and 6, we have ideas for all three of those, crosswalks, accessibility, trail improvements, and signage, and we'll talk about those in a little bit here.

61
00:03:55,463 --> 00:04:03,305
This was the 2022 archaeological survey that resulted in the 2023 technical report.

62
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:08,246
These are pictures, thanks to Ryan for sending those, of the dig itself, 23 test pits,

63
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:17,455
1635 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.

64
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:28,426
In the process of the master plan, I was educated in the definition of those two terms, post-contact being after

65
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:37,753
settlers arrived and pre-contact, meaning before settlers arrived.

66
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:49,842
This pretty spectacular finding there of this large pottery shard, they weren't all spectacular like that.

67
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:53,708
It's a pretty successful day.

68
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:59,473
So these were the recommendations from the 2023 survey technical report.

69
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,594
It's a long document.

70
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:01,715
It's very interesting to read.

71
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:12,399
PAL, the archeologists involved with that recommended that the commission proposed site protection and preservation measures.

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:22,226
Those measures were specifically recommended for the high sensitivity area in and around the house site.

73
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:26,710
In these areas, below-ground disturbances should be avoided and are kept at a minimum.

74
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,041
and it's a pretty neat park because it's been preserved for so long.

75
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:36,782
Okay, so this is the approximate house location.

76
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:39,942
This is looking south on the existing footpath.

77
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:43,723
You can see on the right side, the brick wall there.

78
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:50,685
This is next to the site looking to the south and looking to the north.

79
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:52,705
So there's not a lot there.

80
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:59,046
You can see a couple of the pink flags left over from the test pits to the south.

81
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:01,347
Vinca has taken over.

82
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:12,494
Perhaps a remnant from, it's an old naturalized plant, and maybe it's left over from 150 years ago from the estate.

83
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:17,598
And looking to the north, mostly second growth trees.

84
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:22,662
There is a larger tree here, but it's probably not long for this world.

85
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:25,003
Some more site photos.

86
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,705
This is the north entrance.

87
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:34,590
You see the nice job they did on this field stone wall and leaving, as per the master plan, leaving these breaks.

88
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,951
So this would be the north entrance.

89
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:43,177
And this is this approach from the south and from the field and on the wall in that area.

90
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,375
There are openings as well.

91
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:48,858
So this is the draft concept.

92
00:06:48,878 --> 00:06:52,702
This is evolved a bit from our last meeting and I'll walk you through that.

93
00:06:53,143 --> 00:07:00,891
And then we have a number of images and reference images and some visual visualizations to talk about.

94
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:14,384
The concept centers on this history walk, and that's in this larger, thicker orange line here, which would be a primary path.

95
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:19,029
Purpose of this path is to make the site accessible.

96
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,414
I like projects, and this is a great project because you can do a number of things at the same time.

97
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:33,744
Talked about them down here at the bottom, you can improve accessibility, you can identify the park and you can make history visible.

98
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,948
Right now the parks not accessible at all.

99
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:45,076
There's a curb, the entire length of Grove Street and no curb cuts in the parks not identified.

100
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:56,670
People know more so that it's a park with the work you've been doing, but there's no sign that says, welcome to Thomas Brooks Park.

101
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:04,013
Fascinating history that we've been learning about for the past couple of years, some of the neighbors know about, but most people probably don't.

102
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:11,595
Although some people are more aware of the wall now called Pomp's Wall with the recent work that was done there.

103
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:15,117
The history walk would

104
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:28,011
The proposals to enter here across from Jackson road and curve up following that existing path, and then exit here across from ravine road on that walk.

105
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:30,534
There would be a number of historic markers 3.

106
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:37,096
One, just talking about Native American uses on this site.

107
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:43,418
Also, the African American history on the site and the colonial American history on the site.

108
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:46,078
So this kind of a palimpsest of history.

109
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:50,199
And then this proposal has two new welcome signs, two welcome signs.

110
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:54,000
So one here at this entrance and one to the north.

111
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,826
at this entrance so you're able to access the park you understand what it is and then you can learn about this history.

112
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:09,394
We'll also talk about some different ideas for the estate house site stabilization which is up in this

113
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:13,577
location and we talked a little bit about the crosswalks.

114
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,359
This proposal would have two new crosswalks.

115
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,439
Right now there aren't any.

116
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:26,164
These could either be at grade or they could be raised and also serve the function of a speed table.

117
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:36,610
Right now there is one existing speed table or speed bump just asphalt down here and then two new as per the master plan accessible parking spaces.

118
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,251
This would really

119
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:46,015
just be paint on the existing road there and sidewalks to access the crosswalks.

120
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:50,538
For the history walk on the upper right here, here's a view of where it'd be.

121
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,819
The footpath already exists.

122
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:57,942
It's just a dirt path, so taking advantage of what's there.

123
00:09:58,342 --> 00:10:03,064
The concept here would be an accessible path for slope and surfacing.

124
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:07,047
We don't have a field survey there, but I think,

125
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:12,070
we should be able to make this an accessible walkway.

126
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:19,614
The max slip you can have is one in 20, so for every 20 feet you go out, you can go a maximum of one feet up.

127
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:24,698
Just being out there and taking a look at this, I think that that's possible here.

128
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:39,585
That walk would be connected to these 2 new crosswalks that we talked about here and new park welcome signage at the beginning and end or at each access point for this for for the walk here.

129
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,826
So, this has changed a little bit from the last meeting, but.

130
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:52,192
The two welcome signs, which we just talked about here, welcome to Thomas Brook Park.

131
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:54,093
This is a good opportunity.

132
00:10:54,133 --> 00:11:01,738
This comment came up in the last meeting about it would be nice to educate people on how this park got here.

133
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,860
It was part of a larger estate.

134
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:13,066
It was given to the city with certain stipulations required that the city do.

135
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:19,058
It would also identify this as town property.

136
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:20,559
I think it's a useful thing to do.

137
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,041
Then a series of historic markers.

138
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:41,376
One interpreting and describing the Native American history in the site, also the African-American history on the site, and a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall, which would be pedestrian-oriented and face the path.

139
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:53,029
and a marker to interpret or discuss the colonial American history of the site closer to the estate house site.

140
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,276
So the Thomas Brooke Park welcome signs, there's a lot of material out there.

141
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,640
This upper left map

142
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,982
is the overall estate.

143
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,143
The estate dates back to 1660.

144
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:18,070
This is hand-drawn, and you can see in green here the outlines of the estate in 1860 at this Brooks Estate plant and all the different parcels.

145
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,414
Now, our parcel is right here, this triangular, very sharp,

146
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:30,699
piece of land here next to the railroad, which was in place at that time.

147
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,421
On the upper right, this is the 1855 H.F.

148
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:34,982
Walling plan.

149
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:42,228
Thanks to the city and the historical commission for providing these for the master plan and informing the project here.

150
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:44,189
You can see this is our site right here.

151
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,315
This is identified Gorham Brooks, and this is the estate that in 1855 was taken down approximately five years later.

152
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:59,102
And then the park was essentially preserved, frozen in time.

153
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:01,345
Nothing much happened on it.

154
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:11,656
It's also adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, constructed in 1835, one of the oldest railroad and an important transportation

155
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:24,330
a corridor continually operating in Medford, and that Thomas Brooke Park welcome sign could discuss that aspect.

156
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:29,415
And in 1924, this six-acre park was conveyed to the city.

157
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,123
A lot to discuss there, but important.

158
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:38,724
So for the Native American historic marker, why is that important?

159
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:43,325
Well, it's important because it's a pretty sensitive site that's been frozen in time.

160
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:51,747
The pre-contact Native American archeological site, it was deemed as high sensitivity.

161
00:13:52,408 --> 00:14:00,350
In the 2022 dig, which only went down a certain depth, 64 pre-contact artifacts were collected.

162
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:09,301
Examples being chipping debris, pottery shards, and dating back to the middle to late woodlands period, so 2,000 to 450 years ago.

163
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:20,158
This is also a great opportunity for a new marker for what's now called Pomp's Wall.

164
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:21,359
These are great images.

165
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:29,166
The upper left, the date's unknown, but you see the image of the wall from the road.

166
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:34,931
Looks like the wall was whitewashed at that point, and then in 1899, a little bit more

167
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,995
overgrowth taking over the wall there.

168
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:47,356
And pretty cool, the wall is still standing and was just restored.

169
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:52,158
This is the existing marker, what was then called the slave wall, facing the road.

170
00:14:52,558 --> 00:15:01,541
So kind of hard to see as a pedestrian, unless you're on that path and know it's there and you sneak around and read it and look at it.

171
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:03,722
But the wall was constructed about 1760.

172
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:10,146
The city is required to preserve and forever maintain this wall.

173
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:18,952
And if anyone would ever give you a hard time about why you spent time fixing up and money fixing up the brick wall.

174
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,433
Well, that's the reason why right there.

175
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,854
It's in the in the.

176
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:38,865
Plan that deeded this land over to the city that if the wall was ever taken down or not maintained the state technically has the right to take back the whole park and also perhaps.

177
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:44,846
Talking about the important restoration that just happened and why it happened and renaming of the wall.

178
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:55,209
And there's other aspects of history that could be discussed that Medford has a substantial African American history.

179
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,070
That's also important.

180
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:05,475
And then a third layer, so we have Native American, African American, and now colonial American with the Thomas Brooks house.

181
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,258
The sign could interpret the history of this site.

182
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:21,648
This is this great image of the house that shows the wall and shows the road, shows people on horseback, shows the big trees out in front and what the estate might have looked like then.

183
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,532
In terms of the historic writings that were done, we know that there was the brick wall between the street and the driveway.

184
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:36,236
This is the driveway for the house, which is essentially where this proposed historic walk would go.

185
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,897
There were three big black walnuts in front.

186
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,999
There are still a couple walnuts on site.

187
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:51,704
We don't think any of these three original ones, but there's one, the older tree that I pointed out in the earlier image that I can show you on a plan.

188
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:54,397
is a black walnut.

189
00:16:54,737 --> 00:17:03,279
House was taken down in 1860, and we talked about the artifacts.

190
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:09,680
Over 1,600 post-contact artifacts were recovered from the recent dig.

191
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,942
How do we have the charge to protection and preservation for this site?

192
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:18,602
Also, interpretation we can think of.

193
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,863
How do we do that?

194
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:27,885
The concept here is to use cornerstones to mark the site.

195
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:38,710
I had a good conversation with Suzanne Shuro, who is the lead for PAL, who did the archeological dig and was involved during the master plan.

196
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,732
We talked about this and she's spoken with Ryan about it a little bit.

197
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:48,275
Using cornerstones to mark the site and different options for stabilizing the surface.

198
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:59,212
Okay, so at the last meeting we talked about a couple ideas, local ideas.

199
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:01,834
This is at Robbins Farm Park in Arlington.

200
00:18:02,295 --> 00:18:03,255
It's a different site.

201
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,276
It's up on a hill.

202
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,177
It's grassy.

203
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:12,543
It's not as historic of a house, but they marked the corners and it's a sort of a neat

204
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:20,705
a place that also serves as a seat and is able to give people a sense of what was formerly there.

205
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:26,386
They used to have a dog statue when the farmhouse was there and they recreated that.

206
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,867
Then this is an example Ryan suggested.

207
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:32,988
It's a great one.

208
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,428
It's a great house site.

209
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:37,969
The Governor went through a house in Charlestown.

210
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:38,729
As I understand it,

211
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:47,693
related to big dig work was heavily excavated and is in a very public area.

212
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:55,577
And the house was interpreted, was marked, were the outlines of the house.

213
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:59,359
These are foundation stones that were recovered in that dig.

214
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:07,663
And there's a pretty extensive sign here that allows people to understand the history of the site here.

215
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:17,329
Suzanne made the point that, well, first of all, we're in a concept design phase here.

216
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:19,570
We're not going to build this tomorrow.

217
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,371
We're thinking perhaps longer term.

218
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:26,555
But she did make the point that you don't want to make a treasure map to this site.

219
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:31,858
There are still important artifacts underground there.

220
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:45,008
You have to be careful, and this is not in the middle of Medford, this is not in a grassy area on the top of a hill that's very visible, this is kind of a hidden area.

221
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:51,334
I remember when I first started working in the Metro plan and was investigating the site with Jen and Ryan and others,

222
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:55,661
And I was on my own, you know, you're like, okay, do I feel safe in here?

223
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:59,484
And gradually coming back to the site more and more, I certainly do.

224
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,368
But it's more hidden, there are less eyes on this site.

225
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:09,253
So I think we have to be careful about how we mark and interpret this.

226
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:14,338
And as Suzanne pointed out at the last image we saw, this one,

227
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:27,497
her understanding, this was probably done after this archaeological site was thoroughly excavated, so taken to like a phase three excavation.

228
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:30,417
So basically, not a lot left to find, if anything.

229
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:32,938
There's a lot left to find here.

230
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,999
So having said that,

231
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:40,726
If we mark the corners, what do we do to stabilize the surface?

232
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,668
You could make a really good argument to do absolutely nothing.

233
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:44,888
Just leave it as it is.

234
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:56,433
Leave these small trees, leave this ground cover, leave the vinca, and that's certainly a valid way to go.

235
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:58,193
You could also plant something there.

236
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:12,025
plant a natural ground cover, we talked about that a little bit at our last meeting, or you could put a different type of surfacing in there, maybe stone dust or something like that, that would be sort of surface level.

237
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:18,951
If we wanted to plant something in there, it'd be great to have something native, the vinca, although it's

238
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:28,979
naturalized, has been around for a couple hundred years at least, is not native, but a fern like this would be pretty neat.

239
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:34,564
Eastern hay-scented fern, one to two feet tall.

240
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:36,866
It's really a great deciduous fern.

241
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,880
also acts as a ground cover.

242
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:49,304
In this picture here, it thrives well in forests, which is in our wooded area.

243
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,466
I think it would work pretty well.

244
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:56,829
It spreads by rhizome, so it spreads by its roots, and it would kind of take over this area.

245
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:58,230
So that's an idea.

246
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,613
One to two feet tall, we could plant something lower.

247
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,940
This is also a native plant, Gold Star.

248
00:22:05,061 --> 00:22:09,991
It's native, shade tolerant, gets a little bit of that floral component that we were

249
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:19,489
thinking about at our last meeting, that also spreads with its roots, blooms for quite a long time late spring to the fall.

250
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:34,997
But it would just be a little subtle hint of a floral component ground cover in here with these stones that could be sitting in the landscape and give a sense of where this estate was.

251
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:44,181
For a more visible floral display, I think this would be kind of a cool idea.

252
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:51,585
So lilacs are really part of New England's horticultural heritage.

253
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,801
been around for hundreds of years.

254
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:57,763
This picture on the upper right was taken at the Arnold Arboretum.

255
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:00,585
They have a big Mother's Day.

256
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,485
Has anybody been to that?

257
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:02,185
It's really cool.

258
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:07,969
You got to go, or maybe go the day after because it tends to be really crowded.

259
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:09,630
But why lilacs?

260
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,653
Okay, if you look at the Massachusetts MHC, Massachusetts

261
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:24,623
Historical Commission, Form C. One of those was done for the wall and one was done for the park, and that was kind of a lead-in to the master plan.

262
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:34,013
And a quote from that is, and they researched the history of the wall, and in the wall Form C,

263
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:48,521
They found this historic quote describing the site that said, beside the street and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed, Pops wall, and bordered with a row of lilacs.

264
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:49,501
That'd be neat.

265
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:53,723
Bring back the lilacs if we wanted to have something that was a little bit more colorful.

266
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:55,524
They peek out over the wall.

267
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,425
Lilacs are tough as nails.

268
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:00,246
Now, here's what that might look like.

269
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:03,268
This is the existing wall after the renovation from

270
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:07,829
Grove Street and what that might look like.

271
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:11,230
A subtle intervention, peeking out over the edge there.

272
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,531
I think they do pretty well there.

273
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:14,571
They're tough plants.

274
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:17,432
This is South and Western exposure.

275
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:26,575
It would also be nice to plant a low ground cover right here at the base of the wall just to hold the soil in place there.

276
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:40,519
This is a second image, existing conditions of Pompe's Wall from, well, that shouldn't be from Grocery, this is from that existing path.

277
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,140
A sense of what this would look like.

278
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:52,025
I don't think the path would look exactly like this, but just to have a six or eight foot wide path there, we could think of a lot of different types of material for that.

279
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:56,606
I think it would want to look pretty natural and there's some nice ways to do that.

280
00:24:56,906 --> 00:25:02,708
Then you'd be able to experience the lilacs from the path side as well.

281
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:05,368
That's it.

282
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:09,709
I'm happy to go back and look at anything or answer any questions.

283
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:17,271
It's so great.

284
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,392
Thank you.

285
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,031
Can you, yeah, that's perfect.

286
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:25,193
Go ahead, Jen.

287
00:25:29,697 --> 00:25:30,617
What does everybody think?

288
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:36,922
I'll start.

289
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:38,583
I love the lilacs.

290
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:40,224
I'm a huge fan.

291
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:47,209
I love the idea of the gold flowers where the house site was.

292
00:25:50,608 --> 00:26:02,409
I personally would like to see some of the scrub trees cleaned out from the house site, but I understand there has to be a balance of not making it invitation only for digs.

293
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:11,710
The thing that concerns me about the gold flowers is that, because there's so many leaves in there, I wouldn't want them to get covered.

294
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:21,375
It would be really great if it was kind of this like bordered area that stayed protected somehow to show off that bloom of flowers.

295
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:25,297
And I love that it could bloom, you know, for a long period of time.

296
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,878
Okay.

297
00:26:26,978 --> 00:26:32,481
So, and then Jen, were you saying the thing that concerns you about the ferns is that it would be too hidden?

298
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:42,075
No, I think that with the gold flowers, I'm concerned about leaves piling over it over the years and it not being cleaned.

299
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:48,779
And then we planted these beautiful bursts of color, and then they get hidden from leaf drop every year.

300
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,341
Because it wouldn't necessarily be cleaned in the spring.

301
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,482
No, right.

302
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,726
How much do they spread?

303
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:08,036
I mean, if they're supposed to delineate where the house was, I mean, just thinking in 10 years, will it be like, you know, Vinca version two?

304
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:18,837
you wouldn't be able to keep them right in that boundary.

305
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:26,683
They would sort of kind of mark that site and then the edges, you know, they're wild things and we don't have a defined border.

306
00:27:26,723 --> 00:27:29,125
So you're right, they could go anywhere, right?

307
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:30,466
And they do spread with their roots.

308
00:27:30,546 --> 00:27:32,748
And so that's what they would do, right?

309
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:38,293
Is there a way to do a natural border with the stones somehow like,

310
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:48,131
Maybe it's two plants and there's an outer border and then the color on the inside is a way to try to keep it contained a little bit.

311
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,194
And I had that.

312
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:55,579
I actually had a version that showed that dashed around the edges, but

313
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,467
It was interesting talking to Suzanne because I was after talking to her, I was in talking to Ryan a little bit.

314
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:11,999
I was very sensitive about she's like, you know, you've only done a very superficial dig is is everybody on this call on the commission is.

315
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:18,775
Yeah, and okay, is Dennis McDougall on the commission team?

316
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:19,936
He's our admin.

317
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:21,896
Yeah, Dennis is the next step.

318
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:22,857
Okay.

319
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:30,239
Because maybe I was being overly careful or whatever, but basically, Suzanne was like, you don't want to put a roadmap out there.

320
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:31,920
You've only dug down a little bit.

321
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,540
And if you've got these

322
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,564
First of all, we don't know where the house exactly was.

323
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,506
OK, that's this is an estimation of where it was.

324
00:28:44,046 --> 00:29:00,116
And if you make it really obvious and put these corner stones down and mark out the foundation lines and clear it out for everybody and it's in a hidden area that's not that visible from the street, she was really worried about it and worried that the Massachusetts.

325
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:05,780
state historical group would be like, no way.

326
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,562
Until this site is thoroughly exhausted, you wouldn't be able to do that.

327
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:19,968
But I was thinking the same thing, Jen, and related to the other example that we saw.

328
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,613
There's a couple of people with their hands up, but should I call them?

329
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:28,213
No.

330
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:31,175
Doug, go ahead and then we'll go to Eleni.

331
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:33,244
Go ahead first.

332
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:33,844
Okay.

333
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:47,632
I do like the way this plant for the park has progressed, and I like the use of sort of local plants to kind of create different spaces.

334
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:49,072
Like, I love the lilac wall.

335
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:49,953
I like the ferns.

336
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:58,538
But to Jen's comment about maintenance, and this is more just a general question that I have, like, you know,

337
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:08,755
I think we're all concerned about just kind of letting everything grow over the yellow flowers getting covered up by leaves or other local plants.

338
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:15,399
Could the city parks department, you know, just come in once a year and do some light maintenance?

339
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:20,061
I mean, would that be a big stretch for them, just kind of cleaning up and

340
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:30,833
making sure things don't get overgrown or hidden or just so the planting still kind of play a big role in sort of creating these different spaces within the park.

341
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:32,716
I think that's an important feature to maintain.

342
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:37,886
I definitely think we could ask the DPW about that.

343
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:40,967
And certainly we've talked to them.

344
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:45,448
They go in there and they cut the grass in the field and whatnot.

345
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:49,309
So I definitely think that, and this is not just us, right?

346
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:54,690
There's been other parks projects throughout the city with the CPC money.

347
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:01,411
And then there's this kind of, there's this piece of maintenance that has to happen that can't be used with CPC.

348
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:03,612
And so I think this is,

349
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:21,447
We have to find out and I think there's going to be a bigger conversation about just the city budget and then how do some of these maintenance things happen after CPC projects come into play because the CPC money cannot be used for maintenance.

350
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:27,412
We've had the same conversation about the Brooks Estate, for example.

351
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,916
So I feel like, yeah, we're gonna have to figure that out somehow with this city.

352
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:40,789
I know there was also talk at one point, too, about a friends group with some neighbors.

353
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:48,313
And then if maybe, for example, at Brooks Estates, we host spring cleanups, fall cleanups.

354
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:53,915
So maybe there's something here to be said for a handful of neighbors.

355
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:58,498
And you come out, and you clear out that area once a year or something like that.

356
00:31:58,718 --> 00:31:58,818
OK.

357
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:10,249
Hey, that's my only question, but I'm really liking the way that this is coming together.

358
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:12,370
And then, yeah, so well done.

359
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:19,273
Yeah, I mean, I think, I don't know, you guys let me know what you think, but my thought is that we shouldn't, we should make our decisions.

360
00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:31,578
And to some degree, I don't wanna worry about the maintenance, like we'll figure it out, but we shouldn't let that hinder our decisions, or maybe we should, I don't know, I'd be curious to hear what other people have to say.

361
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:35,299
Doug, go ahead.

362
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,141
I do.

363
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:48,261
I do like the idea if the interest is there of kind of friends of the park group, you know, to try to encourage that kind of ownership and buy in, you know, along this park, I think.

364
00:32:49,643 --> 00:33:04,929
You can't force that obviously, but it'd be nice if the neighbors who feel ownership of this park would do more than would actually, like you said, go in there once a year and just help out a little bit because the city's always struggling with maintenance as we know.

365
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:09,070
I think this is great development.

366
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,451
I like a lot of what I see.

367
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,732
I like the history walk idea because obviously,

368
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,952
both ways, forward and backwards, whether you go from north to south or vice versa.

369
00:33:17,972 --> 00:33:20,273
I did have a quick question.

370
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:22,774
I think there was a photo show in the beginning.

371
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:27,916
I think it was the very north entrance, almost at the bridge, that it looked like it was a break in the wall.

372
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:31,378
That's different than the north crosswalk, right?

373
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:32,659
Right, yeah.

374
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:39,642
So that image with the break in the wall is right here at Ravine Road.

375
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:46,125
Yeah, and there are a number of breaks as you move your way up.

376
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:48,506
There's one actually right here at the midpoint.

377
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,283
So, Peter, remind me, we don't need to make every single point accessible.

378
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:57,744
We're making accessible from the parking.

379
00:33:59,105 --> 00:33:59,305
Right.

380
00:33:59,325 --> 00:33:59,545
Right.

381
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,187
But every single break in the wall does not need to be accessible.

382
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:02,947
Is that correct?

383
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:04,348
Right.

384
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:05,168
You would.

385
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:10,492
I mean, the goal here, which doesn't exist now, would be to provide an accessible route.

386
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:26,712
So if, you know, is there a portion of the park that somebody say in a wheelchair, and I'm more sensitive to this when I blew out my ACL a number of years ago, and then was hopping around.

387
00:34:27,252 --> 00:34:28,473
I'm like, okay, I get it.

388
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:35,379
I get why these accessibility rules are so important.

389
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,682
But yeah, so the accessible route would be here.

390
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:48,110
You could have accessible parking place, which is really just a signage because the road already exists, and then the sidewalk, and then this route here.

391
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,812
Yeah, the whole park would not need to be accessible.

392
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:58,415
I didn't think so, but I wanted to check because it's obviously, you know, we try to expand accessibility anywhere we can, obviously, wherever we can.

393
00:34:58,835 --> 00:34:59,495
And I think you're right.

394
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,696
This is definitely not more than 120.

395
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:02,296
I've walked that many times.

396
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:06,718
There's just no way a lot of grading is going to be needed to make that accessible, I think.

397
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:10,900
And it's definitely the flattest area, like if you go up.

398
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:17,122
further off this slide towards the railroad bridge.

399
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:23,465
The path weaves in, it dips a lot, so this is the widest and flattest area for sure.

400
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:32,539
And Peter, there's no upgrades needed or are there to do curb cuts along from the accessible sidewalk to the crosswalk?

401
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,062
Yeah, so that's an interesting question.

402
00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:40,544
So say if we look at this, so that's the- We do.

403
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,466
You were just talking about that break there.

404
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:47,749
So that would be the northern connection.

405
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:50,771
I think that's Ravine or Jackson, I'm confused.

406
00:35:50,811 --> 00:35:52,512
So there we see our curb.

407
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:53,873
Now there's two ways to do this.

408
00:35:55,273 --> 00:36:09,017
You can, what's typically done, drop the curb and have your striped walk and drop the curb on the other side as well, or you can have a speed table.

409
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:14,378
Conceptually, speed tables are great because they do two things at once.

410
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:20,120
They slow traffic down and cars, even with that little bump down there, cars fly down this thing.

411
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,181
That bump is useless.

412
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,341
Yeah.

413
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,222
That bump is useless.

414
00:36:24,302 --> 00:36:29,764
But if there are striped pedestrian crosswalks, maybe some signage, that's done in a nice way.

415
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:35,707
Just conceptually, it keeps pedestrians at the same grade.

416
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:40,509
It's not like you have to go down to the realm of the cars and then back to the realm of the people.

417
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:48,093
It gives preference to pedestrians, but it's probably helpful to have a conversation with your

418
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:59,286
DPW before we finalize this, because if you have a speed table here, a raised crossing, then you have to deal with drainage.

419
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:05,453
And you have drainage sloping down, I'm sure this road is curved, it's crowned, and

420
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:10,639
The water runs against that curve and then it runs down this way.

421
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:18,189
So if you create a speed table and there's a slope coming down to it, you need to have a drain to pick up that water.

422
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,635
And sometimes it's not possible, it's not cost effective, but

423
00:37:24,435 --> 00:37:24,855
Understood.

424
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:33,483
I'm pretty sure once we get beyond the conceptual stage, a meeting with the city DPW engineering would be in order, 100%.

425
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,325
Two other quick questions.

426
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:37,806
This is more for Jen and Ryan.

427
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:46,033
The Pomswall name, is that official yet or is that just what everyone's calling it because they know what it's going to become?

428
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:48,155
It's not official yet.

429
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,596
Okay, yeah, definitely not official.

430
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,838
We're doing it out of respect for the 100.

431
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:57,982
We've been calling it that for years because we know that's direction is going totally agree.

432
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:01,164
Let's see.

433
00:38:02,165 --> 00:38:03,526
So, the slave wall marker.

434
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:07,069
Is it's going to be removed, right?

435
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:10,852
Because all the current, the new sign is proposed would replace it presumably.

436
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:11,072
Right?

437
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:24,778
John Anderson said that the Historical Society is currently working on going through all of their plaques and debating on updating the signage with correct information.

438
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:32,882
And if we so choose, he said that we can certainly take the lead on this one because this sign is especially wrong.

439
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:36,644
They made a lot of assumptions and they didn't do any research to actually back it up.

440
00:38:37,846 --> 00:38:49,085
Um, so we could certainly mix the next that sign and reuse the reuse the stone if we still wanted to, but we could also do something else that certainly.

441
00:38:51,552 --> 00:38:55,473
You know, certainly I would not have as much text on that stone.

442
00:38:55,573 --> 00:39:03,934
Again, I would simply just have it say, Pomp's Wall, and maybe dedicate it to Pompeii and name maybe the enslaved people.

443
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:18,937
Something small that can maybe be read from the sidewalk across the street, because that level of text is something that you'd see on an interpretive signage that Peter is proposing for the history walk, and that's where people are really going to do their reading if they do it at all.

444
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:22,579
And it's facing the wrong way, and it's dangerous.

445
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,762
And I mean, it's there's a million things wrong with that sign, obviously.

446
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:30,786
Yeah, it's okay to mark the the, you know, it's nice to mark it as what it is.

447
00:39:31,187 --> 00:39:35,831
But basically, it needs to be able to be read from a car or bike or somebody passing by.

448
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:41,616
And that's it, you know, so maybe it only says, you know, Pompeii's wall built circa 1760.

449
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:44,739
And that's it, you know, in bigger text.

450
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:50,451
Okay, just a couple more quick details, and I'm one of the other commission members that joined.

451
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:56,617
Just two blocks away, there's the Sagamore John Memorial.

452
00:39:56,877 --> 00:40:07,166
Is there any attempt, you think, maybe when we do the signage on the Native American portion of the History Walk, that we try to link things together a little bit, or is that going a bridge too far, Ryan?

453
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:25,822
I have been told by Sue Anna Crawley that our number one goal should be to invite the native tribes and indigenous people to tell their own story and let them completely dictate what they want to tell on that interpretive panel.

454
00:40:27,102 --> 00:40:29,484
I 100% think that's the right thing to do.

455
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,680
I'm with you there.

456
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:43,106
Last question or comment was that we had talked about part of the story of this site is the transportation, the railroad, the nearby canal.

457
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,987
That's not part of the history walk or maybe it can be.

458
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:48,048
What does everyone think of that?

459
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:52,590
I'm just going to chime in.

460
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:57,152
Peter, if we go back to that site plan, your site plan.

461
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:57,972
Okay.

462
00:40:58,013 --> 00:40:58,193
Yeah.

463
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:27,090
I think there's opportunity to engage the backside of the site and make a loop, you know, to connect that back path to your front path and accessible route and make the whole site kind of something so that, you know, if we do plantings that it's limited to that circular area inside of there, and, you know, then you can put an interpretive panel on the backside.

464
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,713
There could be more that talks about the Middlesex Canal, the railroad, maybe even,

465
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:56,200
more brooks family history because you're looking at at brooks playstead park at that point so um there's ample opportunity to add more additional signage more than just the three that we have you could add maybe another three and maybe that's you know maybe we do the front phase in phase one and the second phase in phase two but you know at least it's there and you know we could say here's the whole history of the site and then it

466
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:05,495
almost forces people, if you want to learn the whole history, to loop around and therefore make the whole park safe because you've got people going in the back side.

467
00:42:05,515 --> 00:42:09,177
Thank you.

468
00:42:09,497 --> 00:42:14,879
That was my comment, was just to extend the history path all the way around the site and make a loop.

469
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:17,100
Here, right.

470
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:18,410
Yep.

471
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:34,417
And for the backside, if there is a great issue, there's a six inch water main or drain main that runs down behind the whole house site and down that way that we, that the city didn't even know was there that we found during the archeological dig.

472
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,038
So it's been disrupted already.

473
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:37,919
So that will not be a grading.

474
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,080
There will not be an issue.

475
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,500
Okay.

476
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,321
That's good to know.

477
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:41,881
Yep.

478
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:48,146
Yeah, it was, they asked us if we called dig safe and dig safe had no idea it was there either.

479
00:42:48,206 --> 00:42:49,608
So, okay.

480
00:42:49,888 --> 00:42:50,068
Yeah.

481
00:42:50,628 --> 00:43:03,598
And that the thanks for bringing that question up Doug because I thought there was a great comment last time and I had envisioned the transportation story on the welcome sign, but at a certain point.

482
00:43:04,514 --> 00:43:07,895
You get a lot of information to put on this welcome sign.

483
00:43:08,196 --> 00:43:11,717
Welcome to the park, these kinds of things.

484
00:43:11,877 --> 00:43:13,478
And why does the park exist?

485
00:43:13,538 --> 00:43:18,600
And then it is kind of neat when you're in this park.

486
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:28,444
I love trains and the train zooms by and to have an opportunity to be able to go back here, I think might be interesting.

487
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:29,565
I would like to

488
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:37,653
walk that again to convince myself that that's also flat.

489
00:43:39,194 --> 00:43:40,775
I think it probably would be actually.

490
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:58,123
I like that idea, Ryan, and I think too that, you know, when we heard from the neighborhood when we had our public meetings, you know, they're obviously, they're concerned about having too much touch, you know, stuff kind of changing in this park.

491
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:10,974
But I think if we concentrate it in this area, and this is the spot where we do some creative planting, maybe some thinning of the scrub trees, and really make an effort to make this loop something special.

492
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:16,537
And then it's all the more reason to leave the rest of the park almost as it is.

493
00:44:16,577 --> 00:44:21,441
You know, again, it's a minor cleanup of dead wood and whatnot.

494
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:24,082
But it's like, here, we're just focusing on this area.

495
00:44:24,102 --> 00:44:28,105
We're not, for now, we're not doing anything down here in the green space.

496
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:33,529
We're not touching the rest of the trails and the lean-to's and all that that the kids have enjoyed over the years.

497
00:44:34,189 --> 00:44:35,930
And just focus on this history loop.

498
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:47,909
I think we can make a good argument that we heard them, and this is a nice kind of compromise for the history part and, you know, leaving the neighborhood and loving it the way it is.

499
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:50,847
Yeah.

500
00:44:51,367 --> 00:45:11,993
So just so Peter knows, we did get money from CPC to do all of the curb cuts, all of the some sidewalks, the city engineer and traffic people said they certainly wouldn't put the sidewalks at every street but at important crossing locations.

501
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:15,094
I think these two are important and then they would maybe space them out every

502
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:18,797
other street from here on out, just to make it safe.

503
00:45:18,837 --> 00:45:25,061
There would be a curb cut at every entrance, that there's enough money for that.

504
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:26,843
There's enough money for the signage.

505
00:45:27,984 --> 00:45:31,706
Then there's money in there for tree trimming and tree replanting.

506
00:45:31,806 --> 00:45:43,375
Specifically, if there are older trees that have died along the roadside, we can certainly focus on this area and replant those right away and get those growing.

507
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:51,938
That's, that's great and there was a gentleman on Jackson road I was talking to I think in this house I tend to park in front of this house.

508
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:58,700
Nice guy and that was his his comment to is like, I really like the improvements here but.

509
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:13,453
Now these big trees are more visible right and and there is some work that needs to be done that's often not cheap to be able to get somebody to do that and do it well but having the community.

510
00:46:15,414 --> 00:46:20,515
already what you've done has improved all these property values.

511
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:31,638
If I lived in this neighborhood and all of a sudden you get this great field stone wall and this restored brick wall, it's positive steps for the community.

512
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:38,179
To make people understand that that's what's going to happen because people are sensitive there.

513
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,741
I think our interventions need to be careful and light touches.

514
00:46:46,182 --> 00:46:49,184
because people are protective about this.

515
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:54,348
They want to see it improved, but I agree, Jen, that they're like, what are you going to do?

516
00:46:54,868 --> 00:46:59,852
They're protective because this is where they let their dogs go and they see it as their park.

517
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:16,795
Right 1 of the 1 of the things that we just discussed as part of the cemetery potential for master planning is is dogs and currently there are no rules for dogs, but.

518
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:24,140
the cemetery is debating on what the level of people walking dogs in there will be in the future.

519
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:43,653
And one of the things that I proposed was perhaps if the city is going to say and start to enforce the dog walking rules that there's a possibility that they take a portion of Placedead Park and turn it into a dog park for this side of Medford so that there's a place to go outside of the fells outside of maybe

520
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:57,357
you know, Thomas Brooks Park as it becomes a history park, you know, so that we're thinking of all the users of these locations and so that we're giving them the amenities that if we take away something, we're giving it somewhere else so that everybody gets equal access.

521
00:47:58,258 --> 00:47:58,418
So.

522
00:48:00,235 --> 00:48:13,080
I think too, I mean, as I've walked my dog in here and, you know, it's, you're really staying on the trails because if you try to, I mean, I know like, I wouldn't let my dog kind of run rampant just because you don't know what they're going to step in.

523
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,322
And if they hit a stick or something, you don't want them to get caught.

524
00:48:17,842 --> 00:48:24,085
So I think, you know, I think in the future, if there were any sort of restriction on the inside of the loop,

525
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:33,717
you know, maybe just some nice signage as we kindly request, you know, don't let your dogs kind of ramp run in here for all but out anywhere else.

526
00:48:34,237 --> 00:48:42,446
But again, I don't really see that the times I've been there and there've been other everyone's on the on the makeshift trails, right, right, the safest, right.

527
00:48:44,395 --> 00:48:48,319
Peter, I have a question and you can certainly take some time to think about it.

528
00:48:48,739 --> 00:49:03,233
Is there any alternative to, so the city, one of the other city's responsibilities is, and maybe it's now partially shared with the MBTA, is that we're supposed to keep a fence along the MBTA.

529
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,134
right away.

530
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:09,019
MBTA has obviously repaired their fence to kind of keep their right away clean.

531
00:49:09,399 --> 00:49:14,384
Is there anything that's more attractive or better to put in that would like disguise it.

532
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:23,053
I mean is there a black covered chain link that might be more durable that kind of disappears into the green background of the future.

533
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:49,419
And that's something that I learned, or we all learned about the park, that the two stipulations in the deed were you gotta keep the wall, Pomp's Wall, up and standing, and you have to maintain a fence on the railroad, or else the Brooks Estate is allowed to technically take this back over, and I'm sure nobody knows about that, right?

534
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,180
But yeah, there are,

535
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:55,543
Because it's just Chainlink now, right?

536
00:49:55,863 --> 00:49:56,143
Yeah.

537
00:49:57,044 --> 00:49:57,284
Right.

538
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:02,028
And the MBTA owns that and put that in?

539
00:50:02,778 --> 00:50:04,959
So I think that there was a city fence.

540
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:15,562
And then I think over time with people cutting through, with trees falling down on it, the MBTA has made repairs, but it's not a great well-built fence.

541
00:50:15,622 --> 00:50:18,003
And as more stuff falls on it, it's falling apart.

542
00:50:18,043 --> 00:50:27,766
So, you know, I would like to see something be a more permanent replacement in the future, especially if we're gonna pour money into this plan, you know, we might as well make the whole area attractive.

543
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:32,428
Even if we just focus on this little area to start, we'll just eventually run the whole thing.

544
00:50:32,888 --> 00:50:42,863
Yeah, there and I can come back with some suggestions, but yeah, there are definitely better alternatives that would.

545
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:52,568
just not draw a lot of attention to itself, but be a nice divider.

546
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:53,990
Fencing is expensive.

547
00:50:54,030 --> 00:51:05,902
This is a pretty long part, but I can come back with some examples of what that might be and maybe just a general cost per foot or whatever, linear foot.

548
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:21,140
Yeah and I was you know to deter people from like cutting through it you know one of the things that we could do is maybe plant some things that are not crazy invasive like for example I have a chain link fence that I plant morning glories on

549
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:28,625
Morning glory is not the type of plant that you would want to plant here because they go crazy, but it creates a green wall and a green wall of flowers.

550
00:51:28,765 --> 00:51:34,429
So, you know, it kind of dissuades people from trying to climb over the fence, cut through the fence, et cetera.

551
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:36,710
So, you know, maybe we can think about that too.

552
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,152
Like, maybe Ivy can climb up and over it or something.

553
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:41,462
Right.

554
00:51:41,562 --> 00:51:42,664
Yeah.

555
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:43,825
Something with thorns.

556
00:51:44,345 --> 00:51:44,686
Yeah.

557
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:45,426
Roses.

558
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:45,707
Yeah.

559
00:51:45,827 --> 00:51:50,892
Or even raspberry, you know, native plants like fruit plants like raspberries or blueberries.

560
00:51:51,232 --> 00:51:51,492
Yep.

561
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:59,540
Okay, I just want to Peter, I want to be respectful of your time since we've been chatting for an hour here.

562
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,842
So yeah, that's fine.

563
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:03,144
Anybody else has any comments?

564
00:52:04,906 --> 00:52:04,986
Oh,

565
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:18,927
I guess I just have a question and it's really for the commission, which is how concerned are you about drawing too much attention to the house site?

566
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,111
I think

567
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:52,798
I think if we were to do anything, once we recover the information on here, I think what I would suggest is almost cap and fill where you would put down some sort of protective barrier that, similar to how you would treat like a brownfield site, that it's tough and durable fabric, and then just grade over the top of it with, I don't know, maybe four inches of dirt, enough dirt that you can plant light plantings, that sort of thing, and then,

568
00:52:54,658 --> 00:52:58,960
And then that protects the site from a digger.

569
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,081
If you're going to be digging, it's going to take somebody some significant effort.

570
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:15,565
But I, you know, I honestly think as we continue to improve this site and improve the paths and all the amenities, I think, I honestly don't think the people will be the problem.

571
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,226
I think they'll self-police.

572
00:53:22,423 --> 00:53:33,431
I mean, it does happen occasionally, but like the national parks and stuff, there's tens of thousands of acres there, and people don't go digging.

573
00:53:33,771 --> 00:53:38,055
So it's just a matter of commanding respect for the site.

574
00:53:38,075 --> 00:53:43,238
The more we pay attention to it, the more we share its history, the more people are going to respect the site and not do anything to it.

575
00:53:43,258 --> 00:53:49,563
So I mean, if the belief is that it's already been excavated.

576
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:52,105
Yeah.

577
00:53:52,730 --> 00:54:00,937
Yeah, or that we know what's there and somebody can imagine what's there and not have to dig into the ground, right?

578
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:11,446
So we have some of the artifacts, you can see the type of things that have come out of the ground, so you don't have to, the thrill of going to get it there yourself is kind of gone, right?

579
00:54:11,506 --> 00:54:13,527
Because we know what you're gonna encounter.

580
00:54:14,108 --> 00:54:16,390
And it's very easy to tell people,

581
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,873
Archaeology is a finite resource.

582
00:54:18,953 --> 00:54:21,636
Once you put your shovel in the ground and turn that soil over, that's it.

583
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:22,477
It's done forever.

584
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:24,880
And I think people get that.

585
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:33,330
There's certainly the people who, even the laymen who are doing this sort of thing, understand that.

586
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,771
But, you know,

587
00:54:35,332 --> 00:54:37,352
will it stop any sort of real criminal?

588
00:54:37,392 --> 00:54:39,953
It doesn't matter whether they do or don't.

589
00:54:41,673 --> 00:54:45,674
Somebody who really wants to get on the ground here would research the site and find it anyways.

590
00:54:51,215 --> 00:54:52,536
Question for you, Peter.

591
00:54:53,636 --> 00:54:57,416
For those cornerstones, did you show any kind of image?

592
00:54:58,597 --> 00:54:59,597
Conceptually, I

593
00:55:02,243 --> 00:55:04,105
I'm wondering, like, are they tall?

594
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,127
Are they near the ground?

595
00:55:06,227 --> 00:55:07,168
What's your thought on those?

596
00:55:07,228 --> 00:55:07,588
Right.

597
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:11,511
I think you showed something, but.

598
00:55:11,672 --> 00:55:17,637
Yeah, I didn't show anything specific, but I was thinking something like this.

599
00:55:19,218 --> 00:55:23,863
So it could serve as a general border marker.

600
00:55:25,484 --> 00:55:26,285
Also, these are

601
00:55:28,595 --> 00:55:32,639
rough on the edges and smooth on the top, about 18 inches tall.

602
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:41,386
So if somebody was out there and wanted to stop and reflect or something, it could be a seat.

603
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:47,631
So this was kind of the height and size that I was thinking.

604
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:54,597
Yeah, I like the subtlety of your approach.

605
00:55:59,175 --> 00:55:59,455
I don't know.

606
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:20,366
I don't know why I don't think this is good, but I was envisioning them as sort of like these vertical elements like yeah, but which I don't I don't I don't know if that's great or not, but I think it would require like the sign explanatory sign to to something, you know, so that

607
00:56:21,801 --> 00:56:24,183
people just see these stones on the ground.

608
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:31,249
I think that's what there's a great opportunity to explain about the estate house and what this is.

609
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:38,655
I mean, I think that you almost have to have the two components for it to be understood.

610
00:56:39,215 --> 00:56:40,356
Yeah, right.

611
00:56:40,376 --> 00:56:46,661
And my thought was that that sign could be there.

612
00:56:46,681 --> 00:56:50,084
I was trying to connect the

613
00:56:52,500 --> 00:57:04,378
But before this concept of the loop came about, which is a pretty neat idea, so that might change this right here was my idea for the bird location for the.

614
00:57:07,865 --> 00:57:12,148
interpretive sign about the house site here.

615
00:57:12,848 --> 00:57:22,374
But if we're going to loop this around, maybe they don't all have to be tied on this linear walk.

616
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:24,095
Maybe it can be over in here, right?

617
00:57:24,115 --> 00:57:29,939
Yeah, I like the loop idea too.

618
00:57:29,959 --> 00:57:34,342
I think it gives a little bit more

619
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:44,983
I mean, I also get the point about the people in the neighborhood just wanting it to be almost wild.

620
00:57:46,645 --> 00:57:48,346
They seem to appreciate that a lot.

621
00:57:49,267 --> 00:57:57,593
I think there's birders who go in there and stuff.

622
00:57:59,555 --> 00:58:04,219
I think that's what's good about the subtle approach because it doesn't really necessarily

623
00:58:06,523 --> 00:58:25,275
Um, well, I don't think that the site should be like quote unquote sanitized, you know, and turned into a, uh, just to, to go to the other extreme to, you know, turn into a Disneyland cartoon version of itself.

624
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:31,339
You know, it, I think there's something, there is something kind of nice about the fact that it's kind of wilderness almost.

625
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,060
Right.

626
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:45,958
Yeah, I, the more I've been out there meeting you're running into some neighbors and looking at it that I mean, there were some interesting ideas at the last meeting about other that in Philadelphia.

627
00:58:45,978 --> 00:58:50,524
I think that Ben Franklin cited different ways to visualize how this house might be.

628
00:58:50,584 --> 00:58:51,104
But I think.

629
00:58:52,515 --> 00:58:55,017
I think subtle is the best approach here.

630
00:58:55,237 --> 00:58:58,780
It's almost like you come across this area.

631
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,542
Well, why is this area cleared out?

632
00:59:01,062 --> 00:59:02,283
Why is this planting here?

633
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:05,906
I always think about something from C.S.

634
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:06,687
Lewis or whatever.

635
00:59:07,067 --> 00:59:10,169
Why are these foundation corners here?

636
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:14,513
Here's a sign to interpret this, so you almost discover this area maybe.

637
00:59:20,728 --> 00:59:21,148
I like that.

638
00:59:21,188 --> 00:59:25,270
I like that approach as a kind of a general approach.

639
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,030
Yeah.

640
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:28,971
Okay.

641
00:59:29,051 --> 00:59:30,892
Any other comments or thoughts?

642
00:59:30,912 --> 00:59:34,634
I appreciate the time here and all the feedback.

643
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:38,835
You guys are good ideas.

644
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:44,577
And let's see, take these and I think we get one more go around.

645
00:59:44,597 --> 00:59:45,558
I'll check in with

646
00:59:47,118 --> 00:59:51,661
Ryan or others and then come back and refine this a bit.

647
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:53,142
That sounds great.

648
00:59:53,202 --> 00:59:54,283
Thank you so much, Peter.

649
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:55,164
Okay.

650
00:59:55,344 --> 00:59:56,265
Thanks so much for your time.

651
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:57,025
Good to see everybody.

652
00:59:57,045 --> 00:59:57,305
All right.

653
00:59:57,525 --> 00:59:58,246
Have a good night.

654
00:59:58,286 --> 00:59:58,646
Thanks.

655
00:59:58,806 --> 00:59:59,167
Okay.

656
00:59:59,307 --> 00:59:59,707
You too.

657
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:01,908
All right.

658
01:00:01,928 --> 01:00:03,169
Thanks everybody for your comments.

659
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:03,770
That was great.

660
01:00:05,615 --> 01:00:13,120
Before we move on to our next agenda item, we do have an application that came in late.

661
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,321
So I would just like for us to accept that.

662
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:17,643
Ryan, did you send out a link by any chance on that?

663
01:00:17,923 --> 01:00:18,863
Oops, no.

664
01:00:18,883 --> 01:00:20,364
All right, then.

665
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:24,507
You want to move on?

666
01:00:26,692 --> 01:00:28,774
Yeah, if you want to upload that stuff.

667
01:00:29,174 --> 01:00:30,976
Yeah, OK, I'll do that.

668
01:00:31,016 --> 01:00:38,441
Everybody while we talk about budget that is the season to expend the rest of the budget.

669
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:49,209
So if folks think so, we have the Thomas Brooks Park project and I'm about to ask for a $1100 expenditure on Cross Street Cemetery.

670
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:49,330
We.

671
01:00:53,953 --> 01:01:05,782
meaning the commission and the cemetery trustees were successful in getting $4,800 from the CPC small grant project.

672
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:15,950
I was also awarded a $5,000 grant from Freedom's Way National Historic Area to conduct the cemetery stone assessment.

673
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:21,575
That leaves a little bit of extra money needed to do some

674
01:01:21,995 --> 01:01:26,477
a field work in advance of doing the actual assessment because it impacts the assessment.

675
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:43,986
So I'll be asking the commission to spend $1,100 to cover the remaining budget on that project with the understanding that Cemetery will start to budget to approach the CPC in the fall for the restoration dollars for the Cemetery.

676
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:51,411
So we have, I don't know, probably $5,000 or so dollars left to spend on MHC Form Bs.

677
01:01:52,291 --> 01:02:01,437
Is there any area in the city that you guys can think of that needs to be addressed, or Doug, any upcoming CBC projects that might want to be looked at, that sort of thing?

678
01:02:01,637 --> 01:02:02,818
Peter, I saw your hand up.

679
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:10,163
Well, a little bird told me that Tufts is looking at the hillside hardware.

680
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,560
Okay.

681
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:13,441
Yeah.

682
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:19,324
I can check and see if, um, I know there's an area form for, for that area.

683
01:02:20,105 --> 01:02:29,010
Cause I found that, but, um, yeah, I can just ask, uh, John to prepare an MHC form B for that building.

684
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:30,410
I don't know.

685
01:02:30,611 --> 01:02:32,071
You know, this, this is a rumor I heard.

686
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:33,452
So I don't know.

687
01:02:34,273 --> 01:02:34,893
No, that's good.

688
01:02:34,953 --> 01:02:40,556
I mean, that's, uh, it's good to know what, um, you know, that's a building in that area, you know, what Tufts is doing.

689
01:02:40,576 --> 01:02:40,616
So,

690
01:02:42,743 --> 01:02:43,944
I think Tufts owns it now.

691
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:45,045
Yeah.

692
01:02:46,547 --> 01:02:48,148
No, that's been around for a while.

693
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:48,449
Yeah.

694
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:50,811
Have they owned it for a while, Peter?

695
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:51,572
I don't know.

696
01:02:51,592 --> 01:02:52,412
I don't know.

697
01:02:52,432 --> 01:02:52,933
It just sold.

698
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:57,778
Yeah, I don't remember them owning it because I used to know the guy who ran that shop.

699
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:01,982
I don't know for sure that they own it, but the bird I heard it from,

700
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:06,912
indicated that it was that way.

701
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:08,773
So, I don't know.

702
01:03:09,694 --> 01:03:14,558
I can't vouch for my source, but I don't want to get them in trouble, in other words, but.

703
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:16,940
Well, it's the buildings on left to rock.

704
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,462
That's that, you know, essentially.

705
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:19,723
So.

706
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:25,387
anywhere else that we can think of.

707
01:03:25,948 --> 01:03:32,069
Ryan, did we ever get, I mean, years ago, we asked Tufts to put together something for them to spend their own money.

708
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:41,412
I don't think we got anything from them.

709
01:03:41,432 --> 01:03:47,793
Oh, we lost him.

710
01:03:48,513 --> 01:03:50,434
He's essentially on the area forum.

711
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:58,512
Obviously somebody in West Medford is working with the system.

712
01:04:01,118 --> 01:04:03,183
Doug, you froze up mid-conversation.

713
01:04:04,894 --> 01:04:06,715
Sorry.

714
01:04:07,255 --> 01:04:18,979
We'd asked Tufts to put together an area form essentially for their campus because we know there's always new projects, new additions, everything.

715
01:04:18,999 --> 01:04:34,224
I don't think we ever got it, but I want them to spend their money to, not ours, not the city's, to get a proper assessment of their campus and the important buildings on that campus, which we'd have very little about, I believe right now.

716
01:04:35,927 --> 01:04:43,129
I can ask whoever the community relations person is and we can see what they prepared.

717
01:04:43,149 --> 01:04:50,432
I mean, maybe it just makes sense that while we have some money that maybe we partner with them so they get more bang for their buck.

718
01:04:50,532 --> 01:05:00,955
I mean, I'm certainly willing to document some of the buildings, that is our responsibility of sorts, but every building, no, I don't think the city should be responsible for it.

719
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,822
What about an area form just for the campus?

720
01:05:03,922 --> 01:05:05,602
Is that just too big?

721
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:16,145
I mean, there's a lot to document and there might be different areas, like you might separate the historic quadrangle up at the top from the certain areas of the campus.

722
01:05:17,005 --> 01:05:22,166
You know, that developed separately from Professor's Row, which developed separately from the outlying areas.

723
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:23,647
Tufts.

724
01:05:24,627 --> 01:05:30,332
square for lack of a better term up at the where the brown and brew is if it's still there.

725
01:05:30,872 --> 01:05:32,914
That's kind of a separate commercial node.

726
01:05:33,814 --> 01:05:44,062
So I can I can certainly ask about that area of form for that whole for the whole campus and see what we get.

727
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:54,270
So Tufts did buy it last year for Hellaside Hardware.

728
01:05:56,523 --> 01:05:57,183
Yeah.

729
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,086
2022, the whole site got sold.

730
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:10,714
Walnut Hill Properties, that's Tufts real estate office.

731
01:06:10,774 --> 01:06:11,814
Paid 1.7 million.

732
01:06:16,398 --> 01:06:18,800
Well, it's a prominent building, that's for sure.

733
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,650
I mean, site, let's say.

734
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:25,631
It'd be great if something nice could happen there, eventually.

735
01:06:27,832 --> 01:06:28,192
Yeah.

736
01:06:28,392 --> 01:06:31,993
I mean, that would be, it'd be kind of cool if they did like an adaptive reuse project.

737
01:06:32,013 --> 01:06:35,575
They maybe kept the original building and built something new on top of it.

738
01:06:35,615 --> 01:06:36,415
That'd be kind of neat.

739
01:06:36,915 --> 01:06:39,016
Yeah, they could definitely add a floor or two on that building.

740
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:48,079
That would be neat, but that's not the rumor I heard that was, the rumor I heard was demo.

741
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,400
Demo and start over.

742
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:50,319
Yeah.

743
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,801
Well, they just demoed those two houses up the hill.

744
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:55,562
Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah.

745
01:06:55,602 --> 01:06:57,383
The ones that they asked, we had to review.

746
01:06:58,063 --> 01:06:58,544
Yeah.

747
01:06:58,564 --> 01:06:59,624
Put the prefabs on.

748
01:07:00,245 --> 01:07:04,807
Yeah, for housing with purportedly respectful design.

749
01:07:07,088 --> 01:07:10,710
Yeah.

750
01:07:13,412 --> 01:07:18,295
Oh, we already have, okay, so we already have the form for tonight's application, but we'll look at that next month.

751
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:23,021
Okay, anything else on the budget?

752
01:07:25,262 --> 01:07:26,663
No, not that I can think of.

753
01:07:26,783 --> 01:07:28,284
That was the big one.

754
01:07:29,085 --> 01:07:31,486
So, yeah.

755
01:07:32,387 --> 01:07:35,409
So we're just gonna ask, I think we're level budgeted.

756
01:07:35,769 --> 01:07:38,410
So we're just gonna ask to spend the same budget next year.

757
01:07:40,011 --> 01:07:40,812
So, okay.

758
01:07:42,973 --> 01:07:45,395
I did just email around guys the application.

759
01:07:45,415 --> 01:07:46,575
It's for 27 all month.

760
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:54,114
they want to do a full demo of the property.

761
01:07:54,134 --> 01:08:00,915
Taking a look now.

762
01:08:03,536 --> 01:08:03,716
Yeah.

763
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:07,617
The house, they claim it's going to fall down tomorrow.

764
01:08:10,257 --> 01:08:11,317
Famous last word.

765
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:13,978
There's a plan B, there's already a B on it.

766
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:22,047
Yeah, we already have it for this one, but because the application came in late, we'll do significance next month.

767
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:24,827
So I just want to accept the application tonight.

768
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:27,408
I want to look at the application.

769
01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:35,730
Is it that blue one?

770
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:36,350
Yep.

771
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:36,650
Yep.

772
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,841
They didn't say much, but they didn't plan to say much.

773
01:08:52,143 --> 01:08:54,384
Got enough of a site plan.

774
01:08:54,424 --> 01:08:57,105
Do we want to do a motion as to form?

775
01:08:58,345 --> 01:08:59,826
Yeah, are you making a motion, Ed?

776
01:09:00,606 --> 01:09:01,626
Yes, as to form.

777
01:09:02,027 --> 01:09:02,487
Thank you.

778
01:09:02,787 --> 01:09:03,487
Is there a second?

779
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:04,328
Second.

780
01:09:04,908 --> 01:09:05,628
Thank you, Peter.

781
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:11,531
Okay, motion on the table to accept the application for demolition review for 27 Almont.

782
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:11,631
Doug?

783
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:11,831
Yes.

784
01:09:15,293 --> 01:09:15,693
Eleni.

785
01:09:16,594 --> 01:09:16,874
Yes.

786
01:09:17,594 --> 01:09:17,994
Peter.

787
01:09:18,535 --> 01:09:18,775
Yes.

788
01:09:19,415 --> 01:09:19,835
Ryan.

789
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:20,435
Yes.

790
01:09:21,136 --> 01:09:21,316
Ed.

791
01:09:22,236 --> 01:09:24,577
Yes, this is the form of the application, not the house.

792
01:09:25,298 --> 01:09:25,778
And Kit.

793
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:26,438
Yes.

794
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:28,139
Okay, thanks, everybody.

795
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,941
So we'll do significance next month for that.

796
01:09:33,662 --> 01:09:34,722
That was approved 6-0.

797
01:09:34,742 --> 01:09:35,102
6-0.

798
01:09:35,623 --> 01:09:35,883
Okay.

799
01:09:42,872 --> 01:09:44,754
Okay, Ryan, Cross Street Cemetery?

800
01:09:44,774 --> 01:09:58,301
Yeah, so as I explained, we need $1,100 to do some field work testing the foundations of the headstones to see what sort of way that they were anchored into the ground.

801
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:04,185
So I need an $1,100 appropriation to complete that so that we can get that done.

802
01:10:04,205 --> 01:10:05,626
So moved.

803
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:08,327
Is there a second?

804
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:09,648
Second.

805
01:10:11,497 --> 01:10:16,421
Okay, motion to approve $1,100 for Cross Seats Street Cemetery.

806
01:10:17,642 --> 01:10:18,602
That has been seconded.

807
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:19,143
Doug?

808
01:10:20,043 --> 01:10:20,304
Yes.

809
01:10:20,964 --> 01:10:21,364
Eleni?

810
01:10:22,225 --> 01:10:22,505
Yes.

811
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:23,506
Peter?

812
01:10:24,207 --> 01:10:24,487
Yes.

813
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:25,508
Ryan?

814
01:10:25,748 --> 01:10:26,008
Yes.

815
01:10:26,608 --> 01:10:26,789
Ed?

816
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:27,809
Yep.

817
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:28,870
And Kit?

818
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:29,591
Yes.

819
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,152
Okay, thank you guys.

820
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:37,316
Ryan, what does that leave us when we're at the end, you know, if we're getting close here on the budget?

821
01:10:37,677 --> 01:10:38,437
Like 4,000 or so.

822
01:10:41,814 --> 01:10:43,615
enough, there could be extra money.

823
01:10:45,896 --> 01:10:48,338
Well, are there any other forms like any?

824
01:10:48,358 --> 01:10:53,700
Yeah, there's time take the next 30 days, look around your neighborhoods, look around the community.

825
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:59,784
If you're driving on the bus, or taking the train and see a derelict looking building, bring it up to my attention.

826
01:11:02,242 --> 01:11:04,623
Oh, well, we're going to have one for Greenleaf.

827
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:18,872
Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, yeah, we have that building, so I make a motion to appropriate $500 for 82 Greenleaf, which is a fire damaged building that's going to come down, but we should.

828
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:23,234
We still have to review a significance similar to what we looked at in.

829
01:11:24,955 --> 01:11:27,357
The building on Auburn Auburn.

830
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,158
So moved.

831
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:32,521
Was that a second?

832
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:33,622
That was that was a second.

833
01:11:33,662 --> 01:11:39,603
OK, OK, motion to spend $500 on form B for 82 Greenleaf.

834
01:11:39,783 --> 01:11:41,964
Doug, yes, Eleni.

835
01:11:43,064 --> 01:11:48,606
Yes, Peter, yes, Ryan, yes, Ed Greenlight.

836
01:11:48,646 --> 01:11:50,446
Yes, Kit, yes.

837
01:11:51,287 --> 01:11:53,387
OK Peter, so that passes 6-0.

838
01:11:56,768 --> 01:11:59,849
Do we have form B's for like summit or terrace?

839
01:12:03,288 --> 01:12:05,009
There's an area form, but it's old.

840
01:12:06,109 --> 01:12:08,070
That's a nice tight and compact area.

841
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:20,194
The consultants did the Hall Bradley estates down below, so we can certainly ask them if they want to do the nice compact one street neighborhood there if they are interested.

842
01:12:21,174 --> 01:12:31,117
There is always construction up there and with the views, I could foresee somebody deciding,

843
01:12:32,923 --> 01:12:36,745
to take down some of those little bungalows, make something much bigger.

844
01:12:40,786 --> 01:12:42,007
Yeah, that's a great idea, Kit.

845
01:12:42,827 --> 01:12:48,869
It must have been impressive when the men's club that was at the end of that road burned down in the 80s.

846
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,510
You must have been able to see it for miles.

847
01:13:01,374 --> 01:13:01,474
OK.

848
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:05,886
OK, awesome.

849
01:13:05,906 --> 01:13:07,547
Does anybody else have any new business?

850
01:13:10,329 --> 01:13:12,190
OK, moving on to old business.

851
01:13:13,331 --> 01:13:16,112
I don't think we have any update on anything under demo delay.

852
01:13:16,132 --> 01:13:17,733
I haven't heard.

853
01:13:17,753 --> 01:13:22,276
OK, nothing from Sid on Wareham Street and Winchester.

854
01:13:23,957 --> 01:13:24,998
Nothing from that woman.

855
01:13:27,488 --> 01:13:30,549
No real updates on the permits.

856
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:32,870
I did reach out to the new building commissioner.

857
01:13:34,071 --> 01:13:35,452
We traded a couple of emails.

858
01:13:35,472 --> 01:13:46,998
I'm going to try to either get him to come to our next meeting or I will go meet with him just to say I wanted to introduce ourselves and say hi and forge a new relationship.

859
01:13:49,102 --> 01:13:58,515
I did email, just so you guys know, I emailed the team at the building department today because we did get, there was a permit for the 82 Greenleaf property.

860
01:13:58,596 --> 01:14:03,102
And so I emailed them and I said, hey, you know, please have them fill out the demo paperwork.

861
01:14:03,703 --> 01:14:07,525
so that we can just move that along as fast as possible.

862
01:14:07,545 --> 01:14:22,295
I said, so anytime that there's a property that there's been a fire, please just advise the homeowners to file with us immediately so that we can get going to move them along as quickly as possible so that they can get going on their rebuild.

863
01:14:25,097 --> 01:14:31,281
To ask an absolutely silly question, because it's been raised in a different context,

864
01:14:34,172 --> 01:14:46,775
If I had the misfortune to be a well-insured owner of a property which looks like it's suffering that sort of fire damage, does our fee get folded into the insurance payout?

865
01:14:50,858 --> 01:14:51,820
We don't charge a fee.

866
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,242
Yeah, we don't charge a fee.

867
01:14:53,463 --> 01:14:57,329
The building department charges a fee for the permit, but we don't have it.

868
01:14:57,369 --> 01:14:57,670
All right.

869
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:58,191
All right.

870
01:14:58,271 --> 01:14:58,591
All right.

871
01:14:58,652 --> 01:15:01,617
I thought there was a $500 fee for the demo delay application.

872
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:02,378
Or am I wrong?

873
01:15:02,438 --> 01:15:03,640
No, they never got put in.

874
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,121
Okay.

875
01:15:04,221 --> 01:15:04,482
No.

876
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:09,952
No, that we, no, not, we would like to go down that road, but I don't know.

877
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:10,052
Okay.

878
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:14,174
I didn't know, I didn't know, I, I, I, I didn't know that it had not been put in.

879
01:15:14,894 --> 01:15:20,497
No, the only thing we're asking for now is for the applicant to pay for the legal ad.

880
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:22,298
All right.

881
01:15:23,058 --> 01:15:28,181
And that, that, that would get, that, that presumably would get folded in because that's, that is a permitting expense.

882
01:15:28,861 --> 01:15:29,682
Right, right.

883
01:15:29,822 --> 01:15:30,022
Yeah.

884
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:41,087
Okay, so Ryan already went over Cross Street Cemetery, so we're good there with an update, right?

885
01:15:42,148 --> 01:15:43,569
Okay.

886
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:45,191
Any survey project updates?

887
01:15:46,562 --> 01:15:51,125
The consultant submitted a whole bunch of forms for Fulton Heights.

888
01:15:51,265 --> 01:15:52,526
I processed their invoice.

889
01:15:53,346 --> 01:15:57,989
They believe that they might be done by May, so that's good news for us.

890
01:15:58,049 --> 01:16:04,333
That project will be ahead of where I thought it was going to be, so that's good.

891
01:16:05,373 --> 01:16:08,215
Great.

892
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:12,518
Do we have Doug for Thomas Brooks Park?

893
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:18,855
Do you know, did our second phase get approved?

894
01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:31,162
So they approved the application for the, they approved the long application because I was there for the presentation and discussion, but we're waiting for them to go before city council.

895
01:16:31,182 --> 01:16:32,403
Is that right, Doug?

896
01:16:33,243 --> 01:16:34,044
I think that's correct.

897
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:37,066
There's a meeting tomorrow.

898
01:16:38,046 --> 01:16:38,686
I'll check in on that.

899
01:16:38,706 --> 01:16:42,349
Was there like a second batch of applications that had to go for approval?

900
01:16:44,397 --> 01:16:45,937
I don't think so.

901
01:16:46,178 --> 01:16:50,859
I keep seeing social posts of like, here's all the projects and ours is not there.

902
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:54,340
Let me check on that.

903
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,480
I'll get back to you guys.

904
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,340
Okay, thanks.

905
01:16:56,921 --> 01:16:59,121
But they did, they did approve it.

906
01:16:59,141 --> 01:17:04,923
But they, I think they, Ryan, you and I were texting that night, and I think they were trying to get

907
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:09,216
It took a small haircut because they wanted the city to do some tree work.

908
01:17:09,737 --> 01:17:13,600
And I said, okay, if you do that, you better hold up your end of the bargain.

909
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:16,183
You're speaking for the DPW without asking them.

910
01:17:16,963 --> 01:17:24,731
So like, I think that's, they approved it, but it wasn't, it was less than what was requested, but enough to do what Ryan thought was critical.

911
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:25,673
Yeah.

912
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:25,953
Yeah.

913
01:17:25,993 --> 01:17:30,074
I mean, there's money in there for the dig, for the signage, for the ADA cuts.

914
01:17:30,114 --> 01:17:32,655
And then there was a significant chunk of change in there for tree work.

915
01:17:33,535 --> 01:17:35,055
Certainly not all of it, but that's fine.

916
01:17:35,415 --> 01:17:38,076
And I think that that's important too.

917
01:17:38,756 --> 01:17:39,756
And I was fine with that.

918
01:17:39,836 --> 01:17:44,878
I mean, I think we said, I think that we told, we're told like 200,000 or something like that.

919
01:17:45,278 --> 01:17:54,940
But of course, you know, it's subject to a little adjustments and, you know, if the tree department says that they can't do it, maybe they'll go back to the full thing and just say, no, do it this round, let them do the whole park.

920
01:17:58,343 --> 01:18:08,071
One other thing, we were approached by the Islamic Cultural Center for a letter of support for upcoming grant.

921
01:18:08,672 --> 01:18:19,501
And my chief concern is, have they provided the CPC with any sort of study of that building or preservation plan or anything that was being required?

922
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:21,643
Because I know that I saw the windows are being worked on.

923
01:18:22,023 --> 01:18:28,044
But I thought as a condition of funding that work, that they were going to provide CPC with a preservation plan.

924
01:18:28,544 --> 01:18:30,145
And I have not seen anything.

925
01:18:30,225 --> 01:18:37,966
So I'm hesitant as a commissioner to support any sort of grant if they're not fulfilling their obligations to the CPC.

926
01:18:39,346 --> 01:18:40,086
I'll ask Teresa.

927
01:18:40,126 --> 01:18:41,147
The meeting is tomorrow night.

928
01:18:41,187 --> 01:18:42,347
I'll talk to her beforehand.

929
01:18:42,447 --> 01:18:43,687
I have not seen anything, Ryan.

930
01:18:43,747 --> 01:18:46,908
But that doesn't mean that it didn't happen at an administrative level.

931
01:18:47,768 --> 01:18:47,908
Yeah.

932
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:59,508
Yeah, and they asked us for a letter, and I said, if you can send us information on the project, I can put you on the agenda, and then we can discuss doing a letter.

933
01:18:59,548 --> 01:19:04,930
But I can't just blanket you write a letter until we know what's going on with your project.

934
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:07,511
Right.

935
01:19:07,531 --> 01:19:08,951
If you didn't ask for it, they would.

936
01:19:08,971 --> 01:19:09,051
Yeah.

937
01:19:11,672 --> 01:19:11,912
Right.

938
01:19:11,932 --> 01:19:21,243
I mean, you know, we have been pretty adamant, I think, and CPC has been pretty adamant about making sure that there's plans in place before work just continues on willy-nilly.

939
01:19:21,283 --> 01:19:24,727
And, you know, when I saw the windows disappearing and being restored, that's fine.

940
01:19:24,787 --> 01:19:28,952
But, you know, I think it's important to know, you know, what's going on.

941
01:19:29,633 --> 01:19:31,834
When did you see the windows being worked on?

942
01:19:31,994 --> 01:19:36,776
Oh, they've been in and out of the building now for since at least December.

943
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:41,158
So if you walk by there, you can see some of them have been restored.

944
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:46,320
So I don't know who's doing their work for them, but they're obviously paying somebody to do it.

945
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:50,662
I don't know if they've requested any sort of reimbursement from CPC, but it would be good to know

946
01:19:51,622 --> 01:19:59,824
because I remember being at that meeting that it was conditional that for funding that preservation work that they first do a plan.

947
01:19:59,844 --> 01:20:02,005
Okay.

948
01:20:02,225 --> 01:20:03,005
I'll check tomorrow night.

949
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:07,106
Yeah.

950
01:20:07,586 --> 01:20:07,826
Okay.

951
01:20:08,506 --> 01:20:11,287
Does anybody have anything else before we approve meeting minutes?

952
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:15,768
Okay.

953
01:20:16,008 --> 01:20:16,748
Just a quick question.

954
01:20:16,788 --> 01:20:17,808
I guess I'll bring it up again.

955
01:20:18,329 --> 01:20:19,889
What's going on with the Brooks Estate?

956
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:22,979
Anything good?

957
01:20:22,999 --> 01:20:24,801
Do you have an hour?

958
01:20:26,742 --> 01:20:27,963
We can save it for next meeting.

959
01:20:29,665 --> 01:20:31,006
President search is ongoing.

960
01:20:31,346 --> 01:20:31,586
Yep.

961
01:20:33,168 --> 01:20:36,390
Please, Lord, ask your network.

962
01:20:38,012 --> 01:20:39,613
It is like crickets out there.

963
01:20:39,953 --> 01:20:48,541
Well, I mean, you can start telling people that by stepping up your game, if you guys don't get one president, you're about to have an entire presidents.

964
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,543
right, because you all take on the work, so.

965
01:20:53,563 --> 01:20:57,906
Yeah, that's not the plan, but I appreciate the plan.

966
01:20:58,127 --> 01:21:01,590
That might shame some people into stepping up their game and to try to get some friends.

967
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:09,576
I'll just say this, one application requested a six-figure salary to go with the all-volunteer position of inbound president.

968
01:21:10,577 --> 01:21:11,498
I could not accommodate.

969
01:21:13,108 --> 01:21:16,429
Yeah, is there any anything written about what you're looking for?

970
01:21:16,469 --> 01:21:20,130
Because I have a couple of it's on the website.

971
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:21,631
There's a whole post.

972
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,231
It's been I've posted it everywhere.

973
01:21:24,711 --> 01:21:26,352
Maybe not everywhere if you haven't seen it.

974
01:21:26,372 --> 01:21:29,713
But yeah, it's on our website kit and let me know.

975
01:21:29,733 --> 01:21:32,674
Hey, Ryan, I got one question for you.

976
01:21:32,874 --> 01:21:36,195
Is there any update on the South Street?

977
01:21:40,598 --> 01:21:56,106
Yes, so South Street voted to move forward with going before City Council, and I promptly told them that they needed to speak with the Community Development Board.

978
01:21:56,126 --> 01:22:02,629
I'm not sure if Dennis is here still, but if he is, it would be great to know if they did come before the

979
01:22:02,989 --> 01:22:09,275
community development board to get their input and approval because that's a necessary step before they go to city council.

980
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:19,783
They were supposed to go to city council tomorrow night, so I don't know if that's going to happen, but I haven't checked the agenda to see if it was on there.

981
01:22:21,105 --> 01:22:26,609
I do know that Chris Bader is on vacation this week, so last I checked they were not meeting.

982
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:36,677
So it is certainly not looking good for the HTC, but that's just one step.

983
01:22:36,717 --> 01:22:43,823
Maybe over the next couple of months they'll improve, maybe with their focus is to get this before city council.

984
01:22:43,883 --> 01:22:46,305
So if they really are meeting tomorrow, maybe it'll be good.

985
01:22:46,645 --> 01:22:53,250
I unfortunately, given the nature of the agenda, do not think tomorrow night will be the best night to bring it up.

986
01:22:54,591 --> 01:23:04,603
But knowing the particular nature of the discussion that's about to be had, I think there'll be a lot of people that would be naturally opposed to something like that.

987
01:23:04,843 --> 01:23:10,550
So they're almost sending it for a death knell tomorrow if they approach it tomorrow.

988
01:23:14,961 --> 01:23:15,582
City Council.

989
01:23:15,902 --> 01:23:18,525
So Dennis said they didn't go before the CD board yet.

990
01:23:18,585 --> 01:23:19,726
So that will have to happen.

991
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:25,272
That has to happen before they go to City Council in order to to completely get the process.

992
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,275
Basically, the Community Development Board is our city planning board.

993
01:23:28,495 --> 01:23:31,758
So it's just that hasn't happened.

994
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:32,819
So essentially,

995
01:23:33,772 --> 01:23:36,374
Not really much has happened since that last.

996
01:23:36,394 --> 01:23:38,395
Yeah, they want to move forward.

997
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:39,576
They're trying to move forward.

998
01:23:39,616 --> 01:23:46,400
And I'm eager to help them keep going and just make sure that they're doing it right.

999
01:23:46,601 --> 01:23:47,081
Good for them.

1000
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:52,264
So I want them to keep going, but I also need to help them build the board.

1001
01:23:54,973 --> 01:23:57,794
Another question, because you circulated it last week, Ryan.

1002
01:23:58,635 --> 01:24:03,679
I certainly have no issue on the antennas on the Saltonstall building.

1003
01:24:04,519 --> 01:24:09,162
I imagine, I don't think we have anything to say, but I just want to make sure whether that's a consensus.

1004
01:24:10,043 --> 01:24:11,144
Yeah, I mean, I didn't have any.

1005
01:24:11,184 --> 01:24:13,966
I think we said what we were going to say for the building itself.

1006
01:24:14,206 --> 01:24:17,168
I think the construction projects just kind of move right along.

1007
01:24:17,848 --> 01:24:22,832
So, I don't have anything to say, and if nobody else does, I'll just send them back our comments.

1008
01:24:23,904 --> 01:24:25,342
Yeah, I don't have any comments either.

1009
01:24:28,927 --> 01:24:33,591
It's very common to get those type of crappy, terrible things to review.

1010
01:24:33,691 --> 01:24:36,754
But I mean, it's the nature of the review that triggers it.

1011
01:24:37,255 --> 01:24:38,956
So I mean, sometimes we catch good ones.

1012
01:24:39,017 --> 01:24:44,642
Like they never built the ginormous monopole next to 93 in Spot Pond because of opposition there.

1013
01:24:44,762 --> 01:24:46,183
So sometimes it works.

1014
01:24:46,944 --> 01:24:52,789
Sometimes the need for a super big cell tower versus historic preservation wins out.

1015
01:24:58,817 --> 01:25:05,759
I will say in neighboring Stoneham, maybe it does concern us a little bit because it concerns us for traffic safety nature.

1016
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:15,622
The city of Stoneham is kind of putting up a fight for the demolition of the Stoneham Hospital for a planned 40B project.

1017
01:25:16,303 --> 01:25:19,464
I don't know if they're going to be able to stop it because

1018
01:25:20,925 --> 01:25:30,939
40 B is usually pretty strong and I know that they don't meet their housing thresholds because of another project that's just started after nearly a decade of fighting with the town.

1019
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:31,700
So, uh.

1020
01:25:33,706 --> 01:25:39,248
They may ask for, and we may be looped into comments when it concerns historic preservation.

1021
01:25:39,268 --> 01:25:41,289
I mean, the site is kind of historic.

1022
01:25:41,309 --> 01:25:51,513
I don't think the hospital is historic by any means, but you know, they may ask for comments and we may get the chance to because of the parkway, spot pond, etc.

1023
01:25:52,313 --> 01:26:00,036
And if you haven't seen it on the other side of the city, the Malden Hospital is gone, so it's about to be replaced by a

1024
01:26:01,997 --> 01:26:08,502
state-of-the-art mental health care facility and very low density for that site.

1025
01:26:08,642 --> 01:26:16,929
And the city of Malden is getting back something like six or eight acres of land that will be permanently preserved as part of this project.

1026
01:26:17,009 --> 01:26:21,692
So that's a win-win with Hallmark Health and the city of Malden.

1027
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:23,514
And we're right on the border of it.

1028
01:26:23,594 --> 01:26:26,976
In fact, in the 50s, I don't know if people remember,

1029
01:26:28,293 --> 01:26:46,079
If you were here then they changed the border of Medford and Malden to accommodate the hospital because the ER and maternity wing was originally in Medford and they had to record all the births in both Medford and Malden, even though you were in the Malden hospital.

1030
01:26:46,599 --> 01:26:50,461
So they literally changed the border in that particular area.

1031
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:54,482
So there's quite literally a little cutout when you look at Google Maps.

1032
01:26:57,229 --> 01:27:00,170
But that makes it really hard for some people to get passports.

1033
01:27:02,312 --> 01:27:02,672
Yeah.

1034
01:27:02,772 --> 01:27:03,812
Yeah, I'm sure it does.

1035
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:05,213
I'm sure it does.

1036
01:27:05,233 --> 01:27:08,174
I mean... Unbelievable.

1037
01:27:08,555 --> 01:27:09,235
Birthplace.

1038
01:27:11,336 --> 01:27:12,156
No man's land.

1039
01:27:12,196 --> 01:27:13,057
Here be dragons.

1040
01:27:13,877 --> 01:27:14,157
Right.

1041
01:27:14,357 --> 01:27:19,160
The DMZ between Menford and Baldwin.

1042
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:19,480
Yeah.

1043
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,642
That's why you get a birth certificate down in Dorchester.

1044
01:27:25,867 --> 01:27:30,249
You know, it's kind of nice that the hospital is finally doing something with that site.

1045
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:38,314
I was surprised that they, I know they tried to develop it into housing, but I'm surprised that, you know, somebody didn't try to go like a low density route there.

1046
01:27:38,334 --> 01:27:49,040
But it's, you know, the fact that they're getting all that land as green space back after they build this nice little healthcare facility is kind of a nice tribute to what the site was previously used for.

1047
01:27:52,631 --> 01:27:54,031
Is that on the Malden River there?

1048
01:27:54,872 --> 01:27:56,712
No, it's way high up in the highlands.

1049
01:27:57,232 --> 01:28:08,055
If you, you know, the radio tower that you can see from, say, you're going up the Fells Way heading towards Fells Way, where it breaks from West and East.

1050
01:28:08,115 --> 01:28:10,975
If you look up straight up there, there's the tower.

1051
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:13,896
And you could previously see the the Malden Hospital there.

1052
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:14,976
You can't see it now.

1053
01:28:15,076 --> 01:28:21,758
So and you won't be able to see anything there because it's only going to be a low two story building that's being built there.

1054
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:22,018
So.

1055
01:28:23,258 --> 01:28:26,599
Not only do you get the skyline back, but you get all the, you know.

1056
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:28,720
All that area.

1057
01:28:32,021 --> 01:28:35,282
So, okay, uh, Peter sent around the meeting minutes.

1058
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:40,224
If somebody wants to make a motion to approve the meeting minutes, so moved.

1059
01:28:41,377 --> 01:28:41,997
Thank you, Ryan.

1060
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:43,518
Second.

1061
01:28:43,558 --> 01:28:44,198
Second.

1062
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:45,978
I'll take you, Doug.

1063
01:28:46,038 --> 01:28:46,738
I heard you first.

1064
01:28:47,379 --> 01:28:50,419
OK, motion to approve the meeting minutes from February 2024.

1065
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:52,100
Doug.

1066
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:52,940
Yes.

1067
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:54,300
Eleni.

1068
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,381
Yes.

1069
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:56,381
Peter.

1070
01:28:56,841 --> 01:28:57,081
Yes.

1071
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:57,901
Ryan.

1072
01:28:58,261 --> 01:28:58,521
Yes.

1073
01:28:59,001 --> 01:28:59,182
Ed.

1074
01:29:00,062 --> 01:29:00,282
Yep.

1075
01:29:00,742 --> 01:29:00,942
Hit.

1076
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:01,722
Yes.

1077
01:29:02,882 --> 01:29:03,863
OK, thank you, guys.

1078
01:29:04,963 --> 01:29:05,763
Motion to adjourn.

1079
01:29:05,783 --> 01:29:06,703
So moved.

1080
01:29:06,723 --> 01:29:08,744
Second.

1081
01:29:10,252 --> 01:29:12,934
Okay, motion to adjourn, 8.36 p.m.

1082
01:29:13,034 --> 01:29:13,374
Doug?

1083
01:29:13,394 --> 01:29:14,574
Yes, ma'am.

1084
01:29:15,295 --> 01:29:15,715
Elainey?

1085
01:29:16,215 --> 01:29:16,575
Yes.

1086
01:29:17,136 --> 01:29:17,476
Peter?

1087
01:29:18,156 --> 01:29:18,456
Yes.

1088
01:29:18,777 --> 01:29:19,177
Ryan?

1089
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:19,737
Yes.

1090
01:29:20,297 --> 01:29:20,478
Ed?

1091
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:21,618
Yes.

1092
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:22,719
And Kitts?

1093
01:29:22,879 --> 01:29:23,259
Yes.

1094
01:29:23,919 --> 01:29:24,720
Thank you all.

1095
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,561
See you next time.

1096
01:29:26,621 --> 01:29:27,781
Bye, everyone.

1097
01:29:27,982 --> 01:29:28,382
Good night.
