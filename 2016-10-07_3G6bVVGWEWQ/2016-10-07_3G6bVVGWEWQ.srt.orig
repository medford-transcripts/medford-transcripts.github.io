1
00:03:58,441 --> 00:03:58,501
you

2
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

3
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,010
[SPEAKER_10]: The secretary will call the roll.

4
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Present, seven present, none absent.

5
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,252
[SPEAKER_10]: All please rise and salute our flag.

6
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:50,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

7
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Approval of the minutes of September 12, 2016.

8
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:55,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

9
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:56,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Van de Kloot.

10
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:57,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval.

11
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Ms.

[SPEAKER_10]: Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

13
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:03,106
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

14
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:03,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

15
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:04,626

00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Minutes are approved.

[SPEAKER_00]: Motion for approval.

19
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

20
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:13,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Cuno.

21
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,190
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

22
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

23
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,770
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

24
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:18,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Approval is granted.

25
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Approval of payrolls.

26
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:23,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

27
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:24,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Cuno.

28
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:24,850
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor?

29
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

30
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,371
[SPEAKER_10]: All opposed?

31
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:27,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Approval is granted.

32
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Report of the secretary.

33
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,174
[SPEAKER_10]: None?

34
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:33,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Report of committees.

35
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:34,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Committee of the Whole Minutes, September 12, 2016.

36
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:42,022
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion for approval of the Committee of the Whole Minutes from September 12.

37
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

38
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:47,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Ms.

39
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:47,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Koretz.

40
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

41
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:57,772
[SPEAKER_09]: So at that time, we visited the McGlynn School, and I was wondering if we had any dates set to visit any of the other schools.

42
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,974
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be setting some dates next week.

43
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be in touch with each of you to try and coordinate an evening.

44
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:04,536
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, thank you.

45
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:05,196
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

46
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Community participation.

47
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheryl Rodriguez, Roberts School.

48
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:16,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address, please.

49
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:18,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

50
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:20,085
[SPEAKER_06]: My address is 281 Park Street.

51
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:27,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I prepared a statement because I want to make sure that I get everything that I want to say.

52
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:30,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So my daughter is a third grade student at the Roberts Elementary.

53
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an active parent at that school.

54
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:36,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I appeared before this body in the spring to request funds for our mosaic mural.

55
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:42,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I helped run some of the enrichment nights at the school and the after school enrichment program for the PTO.

56
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very invested in the school.

57
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:50,200
[SPEAKER_06]: At the last school committee meeting, there were questions about the classes at the Roberts.

58
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:58,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And a comment was made that Mr. Johnson distributed his special needs students differently than other schools and no one knew why.

59
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:04,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to explain a little bit and ask for some help from this group.

60
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:08,513
[SPEAKER_06]: The Roberts Elementary has the highest enrollment of all the elementary schools in our city.

61
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:15,497
[SPEAKER_06]: It also houses the welcome program for the English language learners, meaning those with no English skills, and our autism program.

62
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:23,466
[SPEAKER_06]: These are two very large programs, 92 and 75 respectively as of September 16th, but these numbers are constantly changing.

63
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:27,108
[SPEAKER_06]: To put that into perspective, it is divided equally by grade.

64
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:30,009
[SPEAKER_06]: We would have 15.3 ELL students per grade and 12.5 autistic children per grade.

65
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:30,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So 17% ELL and 14% autistic.

66
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,970
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have 51% low income.

67
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:49,585
[SPEAKER_06]: On September 9th, our total population was reported at 547, but as of September 16th, it had already climbed to 555 and is perhaps even higher now.

68
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:52,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Conversely, the Brooks Elementary has 449.

69
00:08:53,766 --> 00:09:03,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It was noted at the last meeting that the two middle schools, the one that housed the ELL population was deliberately kept smaller as new students enter the program constantly.

70
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:08,570
[SPEAKER_06]: The same is true at the Roberts, but we do not have the buffer of being the smallest elementary school or the largest.

71
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:17,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Our ELL students are taken out of class to receive specialized services to help them to learn English, so they are grouped in the same class in order to accommodate scheduling.

72
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine trying to keep five third grade classes on identical schedules to pull ELL students out of each one.

73
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:30,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Our higher needs autism students are also placed together because some of them share an aid.

74
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:36,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It was made pretty clear at budget time that there's no appetite on this committee to have an aid in each class.

75
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:39,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think that this process needs a deeper look.

76
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:44,056
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter has found herself in the autism inclusion class this year.

77
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:49,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that there are some in the other classes, but there are higher needs students in her class.

78
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,202
[SPEAKER_06]: The children at the Roberts are the most empathetic children that you will ever meet.

79
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:59,631
[SPEAKER_06]: But the things my daughter has been exposed to since school started at this class has given me pause.

80
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Something must be done for these children.

81
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:11,803
[SPEAKER_06]: The teacher and aide in this class have been hit, furniture has been thrown, the classroom has been evacuated, and children have been physically restrained on almost a daily basis.

82
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:13,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is benefiting from this?

83
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:18,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the special needs children forced into a mainstream setting that is clearly overwhelming,

84
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,088
[SPEAKER_06]: not the, quote, standard students who are witnessing these events.

85
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:28,089
[SPEAKER_06]: None of them are receiving an appropriate education, as all learning must cease when one of these episodes begin.

86
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,491
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I tried to discuss the wild stories that my child was coming home with, I hit a wall of privacy issues.

87
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:42,413
[SPEAKER_06]: If my child, any child, is being exposed to incidences that are traumatic and are violent in nature, the parents need to be notified.

88
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:48,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Parents should not hear these stories from their children and hear nothing from the school.

89
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,712
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to help our children to process what is happening.

90
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:53,693
[SPEAKER_06]: We are empathetic to all of the children.

91
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:56,174
[SPEAKER_06]: All the children in this situation need help.

92
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this unique to my child's class?

93
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:00,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I think no.

94
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this an appropriate setting for any of these children?

95
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely no.

96
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:10,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It is time that we stop acting as if the population of the Roberts as the same as at the other schools.

97
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:15,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Our school houses two high needs groups and the largest child population in the city.

98
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:19,903
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these programs should be shifted to a school with a lower population.

99
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:29,377
[SPEAKER_06]: If our class sizes were closer to the 15 to 16 mark that some of the elementary schools have, we would be able to have smaller classes for our autistic population.

100
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:35,641
[SPEAKER_06]: We could easily bring their class size down to eight to 10 with no negative impact on any other classes.

101
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:47,829
[SPEAKER_06]: But as it stands, in order to try and bring a second grade class total down from the 22 average for the autism emerging class, we were forced to have one class have a total of 24 students.

102
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:52,716
[SPEAKER_06]: As a comparison, the second grade class at the Brooks has an average of 17.25.

103
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:59,820
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter is in grade three, which has five classrooms and an average class size of 19.8.

104
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:07,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Across town, the Brooks has four third grade classes with an average class size of 17.5.

105
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:17,871
[SPEAKER_06]: This population difference will only intensify when some of the 800 plus units permanent or under construction for the Roberts and McGlynn Elementary School begin to hold residents.

106
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,111
[SPEAKER_06]: The needs of all the children need to be considered.

107
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:22,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I care about all of them.

108
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:30,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I work with them, so I'm floored by the natural and easy way that they take care of each other, and I'm asking the school department to step in and help them.

109
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:38,595
[SPEAKER_06]: My own daughter is suffering greatly as a result of her exposure in these classes, and I'm still finding out what she's witnessed in small pieces.

110
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:46,097
[SPEAKER_06]: She's confided in my parents, in the parents of some of her friends, and some in my husband and I. The first thing she told me

111
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:49,237
[SPEAKER_06]: was that she was worried for the children that were having the incidents.

112
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,759
[SPEAKER_06]: The second thing she told me was that she was afraid.

113
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,320
[SPEAKER_06]: No child should be afraid to go to school.

114
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:01,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Upon hearing that, I started a crusade to help my child and the other children in her class or classes like hers.

115
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:03,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke to the teacher who directed me to the principal.

116
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:14,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke to the principal, and other than the incident that required a student to leave by ambulance, he had heard of no other incidences, nor had the school department, nor the special needs department.

117
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:15,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

118
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:22,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I suspect it is because nothing will come of reporting it, but despite my reporting it, nothing has come of it yet.

119
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:29,092
[SPEAKER_06]: The adjustment counselor at the school has not even spoken to the children about the incident that was reported and happened a week ago.

120
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:33,508
[SPEAKER_06]: An incident that required an ambulance to remove a student from the school.

121
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,268
[SPEAKER_06]: The parents have not been notified.

122
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:36,928
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the protocol?

123
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:41,649
[SPEAKER_06]: What measures are in place to help these autistic children who are suffering or the other students?

124
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,090
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter is refusing to go back into that classroom.

125
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,110
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been attempting to help her cope with what she has witnessed almost daily.

126
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,511
[SPEAKER_06]: She has been having migraine headaches.

127
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:52,951
[SPEAKER_06]: She's extremely anxious.

128
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:57,052
[SPEAKER_06]: This weekend, she had a panic attack thinking about having to go back to class.

129
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:07,453
[SPEAKER_06]: She reports that her teachers have assured her that they will keep the children safe and they neither need to worry nor be afraid because they will worry and be afraid for them.

130
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:15,577
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter's takeaway from that statement is that the incidents will continue, that there will still be danger and that she's just supposed to ignore it.

131
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:17,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So please help us.

132
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:21,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that there's privacy issues, but something has to be done.

133
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:26,617
[SPEAKER_06]: The teachers and Mr. Johnson are doing the best that they can with the tools available to them.

134
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:28,097
[SPEAKER_06]: They need more tools.

135
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:33,580
[SPEAKER_06]: They need a smaller population so they can adjust class sizes to accommodate the high needs of our children.

136
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,043
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't only worry about my one child, but I am worried about my child.

137
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,084
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to worry about all of the children.

138
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:43,445
[SPEAKER_06]: The needs of all the children are not identical.

139
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:47,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

140
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:47,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

141
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:50,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent.

142
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:55,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So we met with Mrs. Rodriguez this morning.

143
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:57,319
[SPEAKER_03]: We went over all these things.

144
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:06,145
[SPEAKER_03]: We've prepared some materials for you and we call upon our special needs director and our assistance room for elementary education to speak to the issues.

145
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:07,806
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot going on.

146
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:10,708
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot going on of response.

147
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:14,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Occasionally in a given classroom, there's going to be some disruption.

148
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:15,472
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,

149
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:19,857
[SPEAKER_03]: A year starts, some youngsters express themselves, and then we respond to it.

150
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:29,139
[SPEAKER_03]: When information comes to us, that classroom's been visited multiple times by both Diane and by Kathy, and there's some plans in place.

151
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:31,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't believe it's undoable.

152
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the Roberts does have some population issues, but so don't the other schools.

153
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:38,722
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're at the Columbus, you have the therapeutic learning program.

154
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: At other schools, you have other programs that are there.

155
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:44,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Some years, the Brooks has had more people than

156
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:45,635
[SPEAKER_03]: The Roberts.

157
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,957
[SPEAKER_03]: In some years, the McGlynn has had more people than the Roberts.

158
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:51,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Population shifts are by geography to some degree.

159
00:15:51,940 --> 00:16:00,506
[SPEAKER_03]: But having said that, let me ask Diane and Kathy to come up and talk a little bit about the specifics that Mrs. Rodriguez has raised.

160
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:04,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to make it very clear, we're very concerned when things happen.

161
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:06,170
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not unconcerned.

162
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,832
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a fair assessment of what goes on.

163
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:10,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But let them speak.

164
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:12,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

165
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:24,862
[SPEAKER_01]: So I prepared a quick report for you to read just to let you know about the incidences that did happen at the Roberts Elementary School in that particular third grade classroom.

166
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:30,284
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some children who are special needs children and some ELL students in that classroom.

167
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:42,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Two students that we are aware of exhibited loud and aggressive behaviors that required interventions through the safety care support team.

168
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:51,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither of the students that we are discussing who have these incidences are special education students, and I think I need to make that clear.

169
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:59,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to the start of school, staff were not aware of any factors that would have helped them anticipate the behaviors of these students.

170
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:08,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them are linked to community supports, and staff is working to obtain information to expedite an educational evaluation.

171
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,222
[SPEAKER_01]: The third grade teacher has been working very closely

172
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,972
[SPEAKER_01]: with the safety care team to address the needs of these children.

173
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:26,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Johnson reviewed the school year mandates during the first weeks of school, such as he discussed de-escalation strategies and staying calm.

174
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:39,308
[SPEAKER_01]: When the high-intensity behaviors occurred in this classroom, students were evacuated to the safety care team so that the safety care team could triage the situation.

175
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:47,832
[SPEAKER_01]: The evacuation is framed as academic movement opportunities for the children in the building, in that classroom.

176
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:53,634
[SPEAKER_01]: More intensive incidences were not witnessed by the children, to my knowledge.

177
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:58,556
[SPEAKER_01]: The Roberts School does have a lot of support in their building.

178
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:02,377
[SPEAKER_01]: They have 19 safety care trained staff.

179
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:04,678
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a full-time BCBA.

180
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:11,399
[SPEAKER_01]: a .5 school psychologist, and there's a full-time school adjustment counselor as well in the building.

181
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,440
[SPEAKER_01]: We do need to respect the privacy of the students.

182
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:23,123
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that this can be disruptive to the class, and we know that it can lead to disrupting the learning process.

183
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:43,644
[SPEAKER_01]: After speaking with the teacher, and I have been down to the Roberts School three times since the very first incident, she has assured me that she is on par with whatever she's teaching in English, literacy, math, and reading, and she does give her children homework.

184
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:48,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We are organizing the following procedures for these children.

185
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:51,944
[SPEAKER_01]: We're conducting risk threat assessments.

186
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:55,786
[SPEAKER_01]: We will perform full evaluations of the students.

187
00:18:56,747 --> 00:19:01,209
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at creating an abbreviated schedules when the students return.

188
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:05,571
[SPEAKER_01]: We will discuss and meet with community organizations.

189
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:13,515
[SPEAKER_01]: We will meet with the parents and we will provide additional support in that classroom if need be.

190
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:23,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Mrs. Rodriguez knows me especially well enough to know that we will get things in place as soon as possible.

191
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:36,448
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers, the support staff, the assistant principal and the principal along with Kathy and I have been working diligently since we found out the information.

192
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:42,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Safety is something that we definitely is first and foremost.

193
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:46,516
[SPEAKER_01]: because children can't learn unless they feel safe in a classroom.

194
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I've discussed this with Ms.

195
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:53,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Rodriguez, and she knows now that the plan is in place to move forward.

196
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:55,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy?

197
00:19:56,222 --> 00:19:56,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that?

198
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:07,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I'd just like to mention around the enrollment of special education students at the Roberts is consistent with other buildings, and in fact, a couple of the other buildings are a little bit higher.

199
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:12,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the McGlynn has a few more students than over at the Roberts.

200
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:16,468
[SPEAKER_07]: but it is consistent across all of the schools all of the elementary schools.

201
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:20,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

202
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:21,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

203
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:22,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

204
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

205
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:26,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Rodriguez, to inform us of this situation.

206
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:43,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess one of the questions I have is that I appreciate everybody doing this diligently the minute you found out about it, but I guess what goes back to me is the fact of if we have children, whether or not they were in the vicinity or not, rumors start.

207
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,222
[SPEAKER_08]: One story, you know, is a domino effect and becomes a larger story.

208
00:20:47,702 --> 00:21:15,940
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess for me is why weren't parents informed of not necessarily giving out the information because of confidentiality and things like that, but if the students were talking about this incident that occurred and then they went home and they were telling their parents, why wasn't something like at least sent out saying, you know, we understand what happened, this is what happened, it's not this story, it's not that story, it didn't get into

209
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:29,050
[SPEAKER_08]: a larger scenario, and I think maybe parents would have been a little bit more confident in the fact that they say, okay, the administration knows about it, the kids are talking about it, but let's see what the story is.

210
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,531
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess that's my biggest concern.

211
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:41,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know in the past when things have happened, and even though everybody's been really diligent about putting a plan together, it's at that moment that at least we hope that

212
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:45,152
[SPEAKER_08]: something goes out from the school saying we're very much aware what happened.

213
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:55,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe even in that letter saying if there's a child who's having a hard time really understanding what's happening, send them and we'll speak to them.

214
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:05,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Have one of the counselors speak to them on a one-to-one or something like that just to know that there's the help out there while everything is being placed in a process.

215
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,788
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess that's really my concern.

216
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:16,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody who knows us is always talking about the most important thing, whether it's bad, good, or indifferent, is to make sure that we're all on the same page.

217
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And that has to come from the top all the way to the bottom, including parents and students.

218
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:27,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And students, especially if they're afraid and they hear something, even though they weren't there, are going to go home.

219
00:22:27,783 --> 00:22:30,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And the story is going to change.

220
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:31,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying that the child

221
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:37,438
[SPEAKER_08]: by any means is lying or anything like that, but they're in their panic mode and their emotions are high.

222
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,583
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that is my concern.

223
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:42,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the other concern is that, again,

224
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:44,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate Ms.

225
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:58,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Rodriguez coming and giving us the breakdown, but as a school committee member, I would like to have Mr. Johnson come and speak to us and let us know what's going on in the school with the numbers, what he, you know, what he has planned.

226
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:02,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, this has nothing in reflection to Mr. Johnson.

227
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:06,491
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that he is the principal and we need to get the information from him.

228
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:11,835
[SPEAKER_01]: We can certainly invite Mr. Johnson to the next school committee meeting if you would like that.

229
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:15,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And to answer your question, um, I agree with you.

230
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that maybe something should have gone out to parents so that they were aware.

231
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had this discussion with Ms.

232
00:23:22,294 --> 00:23:35,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Rodriguez, um, this evening, uh, or even to have someone go into the classroom to talk to the children who, um, are clearly, uh, upset by something that might've happened and wondering themselves what's going on.

233
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:35,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

234
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:37,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

235
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Van de Kloot.

236
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:45,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I share my colleague's concern about the lack of notification to the parents to let them know what had occurred at school that day.

237
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:48,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to tell you that I still feel like I'm a little bit in the dark.

238
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:53,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand we very much want to protect the privacy of the students, but just a clarifying question.

239
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:58,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I to understand were these two students fighting with each other?

240
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,331
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

241
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:08,217
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a situation where there were two different students who experienced significant dysregulation

242
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:13,490
[SPEAKER_07]: during class time, which resulted in a call to the safety care team.

243
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So on different days.

244
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:16,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And they both happened to be in the same classroom.

245
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:24,018
[SPEAKER_07]: They both just happened to be in the same room, just random placement, and it happened multiple times.

246
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:26,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So it felt magnified.

247
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do want to also just mention just a slight correction.

248
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:37,728
[SPEAKER_07]: When we spoke with the teacher and we spoke with Mr. Johnson and all the other staff at the school, they said none of the students have been restrained.

249
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know there was a mention earlier about restraint.

250
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:49,908
[SPEAKER_07]: So the level of disruption didn't call for that level of intervention.

251
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:56,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was settling things down, counseling, providing whatever support needed to be provided.

252
00:24:58,135 --> 00:24:58,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

253
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:07,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the students on these occasions hit either their classmates or was there any physical?

254
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,520
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I do believe there was a situation where she was thrown.

255
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:18,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm afraid to give too much information, I guess.

256
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:18,884
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

257
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:28,331
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also heard a mention of, and I know we had gotten a call about a student being taken out to the hospital.

258
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:37,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that one of these students who was taken out because this is what was deemed to be needed to, were they physically?

259
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:48,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So typically when, um, if a student becomes very upset and it's become obvious that the teacher or the classroom staff will have, are having difficulty settling,

260
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:51,660
[SPEAKER_07]: a situation they call for, it's called the safety care team.

261
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So each of our buildings has a team whose job it is.

262
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:58,204
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have other responsibilities within the building.

263
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:06,689
[SPEAKER_07]: But when something like this occurs, they come to the aid of their colleagues and they provide additional support to students.

264
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:17,877
[SPEAKER_07]: In many of those occasions, the school nurse is also involved in the triage of what the student's medical presentation and status is.

265
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:22,595
[SPEAKER_07]: So occasionally, I suppose it could result in a transport.

266
00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:25,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but in this case there was a transport.

267
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:38,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I had a child in this class, I would have to say that I'd be very concerned because now they've witnessed two different kids have multiple incidents and would probably be concerned that my child would be thinking, what's next?

268
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:45,375
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering, again, I realize how dicey it is around confidentiality, but

269
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:48,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Have people gone in and talked to the kids?

270
00:26:48,693 --> 00:26:50,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Have there been any small groups talking to the kids?

271
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:54,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded like these kids are going to return to the classroom.

272
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:59,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as a parent, I can certainly understand why Ms.

273
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:03,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Rodriguez would be concerned about what the plan going forth is.

274
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:13,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, it was suggested that somebody go in and speak to the children probably tomorrow, the adjustment counselor.

275
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:14,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

276
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:17,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to happen.

277
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:24,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And are both have both kids been out or are they both going to be returning at the same time or do we have any.

278
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:30,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Both children are out right now but we expect that they will be returning at some point this week.

279
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:34,253
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

280
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:56,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the communication issue is key, and I think that the obviously, and I hear you not being particularly definitive, and I understand why, but understanding how this is going to be resolved so that the kids aren't so fearful.

281
00:27:56,806 --> 00:27:56,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

282
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:03,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Rodriguez speaks about her own daughter, but I can flash back and understand

283
00:28:04,108 --> 00:28:11,291
[SPEAKER_04]: what it was like to be a parent when something happened in a classroom, and know that kids do carry it with them sometimes.

284
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:14,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And some kids carry it a lot more than others, and we have to worry about them.

285
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am a little concerned.

286
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:17,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm a lot concerned.

287
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand that, and I agree.

288
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:31,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that also adults, in their effort to protect confidentiality and other just privacy needs, sometimes

289
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:37,231
[SPEAKER_07]: leave children with an incomplete story, so they fill in the blanks, too.

290
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:41,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So I agree that that's something that needs to be done.

291
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:45,497
[SPEAKER_01]: The teacher has been extremely supportive in talking.

292
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:57,765
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talked to the teacher today, she told me how she supported the children and talked to them and how she would keep them safe and that type of thing.

293
00:28:57,805 --> 00:29:00,688
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's a very empathetic, compassionate woman.

294
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:05,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she'll work with the kids as long, as well as the school adjustment counselor.

295
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:10,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

296
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:10,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

297
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:12,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

298
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:17,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'm actually a safety care trainer as well because, um, at my school.

299
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:24,676
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know a lot of it is deescalation in removing the audience or the other children.

300
00:29:25,336 --> 00:29:29,058
[SPEAKER_09]: So that way they aren't traumatized as well as the person who was acting out.

301
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:45,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I know that Memphis Public Schools uses that, and I'm sure that they had the children move, but I'm sure, as you stated, that your child probably witnessed stuff that made them nervous and anxious and a little afraid to go back to school.

302
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:54,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I know that in this report it says more intensive incidences were not witnessed, but

303
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:58,505
[SPEAKER_09]: That's out of an adult's view of what happened.

304
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:03,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And each individual adult will deal with different situations.

305
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:06,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will affect them differently.

306
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:07,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And the same thing happens to children.

307
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:15,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're hearing from parents that their child was affected by situations happening in their classroom.

308
00:30:16,036 --> 00:30:18,097
[SPEAKER_09]: So those parents, one, have to be notified.

309
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:23,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, have to have counseling services to make sure that they feel safe coming back to school.

310
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,791
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm glad that both those things are happening.

311
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:33,637
[SPEAKER_09]: The main issue I have, and I had this issue before this incident arose, was the number of students in the classes at the Brooks School.

312
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:35,998
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about this when we got the graph.

313
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:42,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not about the type of children, it's a high number for elementary school.

314
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:43,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And I felt, I mean, I'm sorry.

315
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:47,287
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts School, sorry I misspoke.

316
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:54,667
[SPEAKER_09]: but the Robert schools numbers were much, well not, they were higher than any other elementary school when I looked at this and I brought it up.

317
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:58,888
[SPEAKER_09]: At that point, it was the only school that had 24 students in any class.

318
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:09,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand that some had 21 because of how Mr. Johnson, which I know why and how he does his class allocations.

319
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with how he does it.

320
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:13,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Our job here,

321
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:21,371
[SPEAKER_09]: is really to make sure we're prepared to meet the needs of all the children in our care.

322
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:30,495
[SPEAKER_09]: That means all the children, children with disabilities, any child that walks through any classroom door, it's our responsibility that they are safe.

323
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:33,516
[SPEAKER_09]: That's first, that's last, that's always.

324
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:36,298
[SPEAKER_09]: We're here to educate them, but we have to do that in a safe manner.

325
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:41,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that a lower class size might help to ensure that.

326
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:53,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm gonna ask the superintendent to look at that again, not at this moment, but I want him to go back with his team and really look at what's happening in this school and the population of the needs of the children within this school.

327
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:02,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And just look at it with clear eyes and observation and really see if this, the,

328
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:08,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the programming specific for the special education students at that school?

329
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:13,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I know at different schools they have different populations of students.

330
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:17,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a specific population of students directed towards the Roberts?

331
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,772
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the ELL students are there.

332
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:25,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, each of our elementary schools house a strand of special education services.

333
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:27,276
[SPEAKER_07]: So the answer to that is yes.

334
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:30,618
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I just want to emphasize that this

335
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:35,659
[SPEAKER_07]: situation, none of the students involved were special education students.

336
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:36,460
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good to know.

337
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And the class, this particular classroom has 20 students enrolled in the classroom.

338
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:42,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have an additional teacher.

339
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,367
[SPEAKER_01]: We made sure we had five classes.

340
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:48,971
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is only 20 students in each of the classes.

341
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And the classroom is staffed with a full-time paraprofessional.

342
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:53,595
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was an unusual

343
00:32:55,502 --> 00:33:01,907
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of situation that no one anticipated, that everyone has responded to, will continue to respond to this situation.

344
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:16,959
[SPEAKER_07]: We will add additional staff if needed, and we will address the concern regarding notification of parents and ensuring that parents know that counseling is available to their children should their children require such a support.

345
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:17,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

346
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:25,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's great, but I would really rather be proactive than reactive, especially in this situation.

347
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:38,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, even a meeting a night with the superintendent to the school or to the children affected or whoever needs to be there may be warranted just to, to come and tell them what our plans are.

348
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:46,129
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure that everybody is on the same page and that they're notified face to face and parents have a chance to voice any and all concerns.

349
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:53,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I think hearing them might help us to develop what's best going to work because they're the ones who are dropping off their children and not care every day.

350
00:33:55,272 --> 00:34:06,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so, um, are there a greater number of calls for safety care team at one school more so than another?

351
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:07,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have those stats?

352
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:11,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there is, but not this school.

353
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,540
Okay.

354
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:22,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, just the information so we can decide whether we need to put more funding, more staff, what we need to do that.

355
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to, you know,

356
00:34:25,682 --> 00:34:30,847
[SPEAKER_09]: know specifics about students, but we need to know specifics about programs.

357
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:46,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we're allocating enough staff and money to a situation and really don't want to go away from here and then something else happened, if that's even more involved or any, you know, situation, because we didn't act.

358
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:58,016
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that in mind, I'm asking the superintendent at this point to look at the class sizes again at the Brooks and the staffing and I mean the Columbus, the Roberts.

359
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:14,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm having one of those nights at the Roberts and really look at it with an objective eye and keeping in mind the needs of the students in the population of the students, not only their, their, um, all their needs, you know, 51%, um,

360
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:25,977
[SPEAKER_09]: low income, how many ELL students and, you know, special needs are in each room.

361
00:35:26,297 --> 00:35:30,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to see that information looked at, you know, with an objective eye.

362
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure you've looked at it once, but I'm asking you to look at it again.

363
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:36,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to ensure the safety of all the students.

364
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:41,166
[SPEAKER_09]: And if things need to be shifted, let's not do it because that's where we've always done it.

365
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:48,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do what's right and move things or fix things or add another class or decrease the size for this year.

366
00:35:48,572 --> 00:36:03,615
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're seeing, you know, there are trends, just like with PARC or MCAS, you see one class does a little bit below one year, you look in the next year and see if they're doing a little bit below the next year, well maybe that class needs a little more academic.

367
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:07,296
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe this class needs a little bit more hands-on.

368
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:15,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to look at trends and see if it will happen last year, if it's happening again this year, and look for those patterns so we can meet the needs of these students

369
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:16,836
[SPEAKER_09]: in the parents.

370
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:17,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

371
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:19,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skerry.

372
00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:33,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, I'd just like to say I echo the concerns of my colleagues and knowing that the Roberts is a tight-knit community, I'm somewhat dismayed that the parents weren't contacted, you know, so that this incident could have been explained to them.

373
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:43,652
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always worked on the premise of the home and school work in unison and we're not fulfilling our part of the bargain if we don't contact people in a timely manner towards what's happening.

374
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:45,413
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that the

375
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:55,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So through you to the superintendent, if possible, we could possibly have a meeting with the parents, meet with Mr. Johnson and the team to, you know, allay the fears of the children.

376
00:36:55,216 --> 00:37:01,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any child going to school, you know, under a cloud of the not knowing what's going to happen next.

377
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:04,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think it would behoove us to, you know, work on this situation.

378
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:06,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it's an isolated incident,

379
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:11,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should repair it as quickly as possible.

380
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:19,416
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, I would strongly suggest that the administration do alert the parents in that class, you know, in general, as to what happened.

381
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:23,877
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they or their children have any questions, they should have a person they could contact.

382
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:35,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could have an evening where the parents that are concerned, that have fears for their children, could come in and they could be dismayed because, once again, the Robertsons are a tight-knit community.

383
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the weekend, we've heard two or three versions of the story.

384
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:43,733
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would rather see one concrete piece go out to the parents to allay their fears.

385
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:50,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So just if I can comment on that for a minute.

386
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,236
[SPEAKER_03]: A situation happens.

387
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:55,477
[SPEAKER_03]: People are responding to it.

388
00:37:56,337 --> 00:38:01,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not escalate it up and get more people feeling like there's something tragic going on.

389
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,019
[SPEAKER_03]: There isn't.

390
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Some years,

391
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:07,666
[SPEAKER_03]: A place like the Columbus had the therapeutic learning program.

392
00:38:08,106 --> 00:38:10,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people used to call it the behavior management program.

393
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those youngsters had some serious issues, and they were making noise.

394
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:18,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people said, well, gee, we're going to move those people.

395
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:19,693
[SPEAKER_03]: We deal with it.

396
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:20,694
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with it.

397
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:22,455
[SPEAKER_03]: We will contact parents.

398
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,016
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll meet with people.

399
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:27,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do what we have to do to allay the fears of students.

400
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:29,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's not escalate it at this point in time.

401
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's deal with it.

402
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,283
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a situation that occurred in a single classroom

403
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:41,968
[SPEAKER_03]: at a point in time at the beginning of the year, the two students who weren't on the radar, who aren't IEP students.

404
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:50,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's find out, we'll do the diligence, we'll look at the makeup of the classes and make some recommendations.

405
00:38:50,595 --> 00:39:00,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's keep it calm and let's be surgical about it rather than try to raise and elevate concerns where they may not exist.

406
00:39:01,664 --> 00:39:03,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people may be more anxious than others.

407
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:05,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's let, we'll talk to people about it.

408
00:39:05,907 --> 00:39:06,867
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk to people about it.

409
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:10,410
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did meet with Mrs. Rodriguez as she's coming to the mic again.

410
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We did meet with her today.

411
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:12,692
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked with her today.

412
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:16,215
[SPEAKER_03]: We will talk to other people, but let's do it surgically.

413
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:23,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it, you know, directly that way rather than try to expand it.

414
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:23,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

415
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Stone is next in queue.

416
00:39:26,643 --> 00:39:30,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I want to thank Cheryl for being here and for bringing those numbers.

417
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:44,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other part that we haven't even begun to address is the EL students, which I know my four year old takes speech therapy at the Roberts and his class that he was in last year was downsized because they needed that for EL students.

418
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:51,624
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I don't have the education on special ed law, so I don't feel comfortable talking about that piece.

419
00:39:52,164 --> 00:39:56,185
[SPEAKER_05]: But for EL students, I think at one point in our,

420
00:39:56,746 --> 00:40:04,209
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-budget meetings, the director of EL had said possibly moving the older grades of EL students from the Roberts to another school.

421
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:09,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that, Cheryl, you know the numbers better than I. What was the number of EL students at the Roberts?

422
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:09,991
92.

423
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:12,692
[SPEAKER_06]: The last number I heard was 92.

424
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:14,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

425
00:40:14,152 --> 00:40:22,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's something that I feel more comfortable that's something that we could work on to have the older grades of EL.

426
00:40:23,895 --> 00:40:28,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I just am very uncomfortable talking about the special ed kids in their own lives, so.

427
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

428
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:30,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

429
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Van de Kloot.

430
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:43,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to reply to that, the only problem with doing that is that we have ELL students then who have been at the Roberts for the younger grades who have friendships, who are comfortable there, and now we're, you know,

431
00:40:44,203 --> 00:40:46,925
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because then they're pulled into regular ed, so they're not in the EL.

432
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:49,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they came in, correct me if I'm wrong.

433
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:50,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Ms.

434
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:50,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone.

435
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:50,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

436
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

437
00:40:51,307 --> 00:40:52,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Develson, correct me if I'm wrong.

438
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:59,251
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're in EL in first and second grade, then they, I mean, Teagan's best friend was in EL first and second grade, and then she was in a regular ed class.

439
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:00,772
[SPEAKER_05]: She wasn't in the EL program.

440
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:03,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So then she was in the class with them third, fourth, and fifth.

441
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they would be moved out of that comfort.

442
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,518
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, it's almost secondary.

443
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:15,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Superintendent, I just have to say I disagree respectfully with you a little bit.

444
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:18,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that the urge here is to up it.

445
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think that all the school committee members heard

446
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:25,546
[SPEAKER_04]: that events happened last week and parents weren't notified.

447
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:37,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We're into a new week and we're looking back and parent notification when there were incidents in the classroom that were of this serious, I believe should have happened in a much more timely manner.

448
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So because it didn't, it's harder to

449
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:47,939
[SPEAKER_04]: feel great faith that everything will go forward in the best possible way.

450
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:51,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for many of us, that's a stumbling block that we're hearing.

451
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to make a motion.

452
00:41:55,364 --> 00:41:56,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard you saying you made a motion.

453
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:57,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hear it.

454
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I have three motions right now.

455
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Three motions.

456
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I could read them right now.

457
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:01,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

458
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:06,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto, motion review the allocation of all of the students in this third grade class.

459
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:07,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

460
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:12,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Cuneo, that Mr. Johnson appear at the next school committee meeting to address us on this topic.

461
00:42:12,776 --> 00:42:16,479
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mr. Scarry, that Mr. Johnson and the team meet with parents ASAP.

462
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:17,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

463
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my motion must be slightly different.

464
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:22,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure that this isn't falling through the cracks for us.

465
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:34,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to make a motion to make sure that we receive a report at our next school committee meeting and at our meeting after that, so that we have some ongoing understanding of what's going on.

466
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:35,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

467
00:42:35,935 --> 00:42:36,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

468
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:36,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuneo?

469
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:41,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'd like to basically reiterate what my colleague Paula just said.

470
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:48,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think, with all due respect, it's not the fact that we're trying to hype it or make it into a different story.

471
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:58,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just the fact, again, of something happening a week ago, or I don't know at this point if it was a week ago or two weeks ago, and putting myself in those shoes.

472
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:04,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's something that we all have to think of, too, is that as we speak, we're always saying,

473
00:43:05,852 --> 00:43:09,754
[SPEAKER_08]: special needs, and they have their confidentiality.

474
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:28,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though we do have confidentiality for all students that come to our district, I think parents need to understand that when we're talking about confidentiality, we're talking about all students and not just the students that are in a particular group, because I think that is, again, extremely important.

475
00:43:29,003 --> 00:43:33,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, it's just basically the fact of I get

476
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:41,710
[SPEAKER_08]: everything that's happened, but I think it was just the fear of listening to your child come home with different, you know, it happens to everyone.

477
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,833
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens to whether you're young or even adults.

478
00:43:45,073 --> 00:43:48,376
[SPEAKER_08]: One person says one thing, and then another one adds on, and another one adds on.

479
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:55,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a parent, you're home, you really don't know what's going on in the school itself because you weren't there, and now you have all these different stories.

480
00:43:55,929 --> 00:44:11,456
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I mean, something should have come out from the school saying what had happened and I guess my other thing too is that this is a very isolated situation with two students that happen to be in the same classroom.

481
00:44:12,356 --> 00:44:19,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Since it's already happened, is it possible or is it something to think about maybe trying to separate these two students?

482
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,239
[SPEAKER_08]: That's in the works.

483
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so thank you.

484
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:23,661
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I needed to know.

485
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:23,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

486
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Final comments, Mr Benedetto.

487
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:27,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

488
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:32,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to second all the motions except for mine and move forward to put them on record.

489
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,910
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a second.

490
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like me to reread them or we all were on the same page with them?

491
00:44:37,371 --> 00:44:43,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval on all of the emotions made, including a report update, be added to our school committee agenda.

492
00:44:43,772 --> 00:44:44,592
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

493
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:44,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

494
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:46,193
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed.

495
00:44:46,993 --> 00:44:47,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

496
00:44:48,303 --> 00:44:49,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

497
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:53,287
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I just wanted to clarify something about the incidences.

498
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:56,350
[SPEAKER_06]: The latest and largest incident was last Monday.

499
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It occurred in the cafeteria.

500
00:44:58,131 --> 00:45:04,716
[SPEAKER_06]: There were several incidences before and after, and we never got notified of any of them.

501
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:10,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So the reason that I came forward and started speaking to people was because of the larger incident that had happened in the cafeteria.

502
00:45:11,162 --> 00:45:17,487
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I went through and spoke to the principal, and I spoke to Diane Caldwell, and I spoke to someone in the special needs department,

503
00:45:17,827 --> 00:45:24,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spoke to Mr. Belson and no one had heard of any of the incidents other than the one that had happened in the cafeteria.

504
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:35,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's really concerning to me that these issues, maybe they don't know how to report them, who to report them, because these issues hadn't gone beyond the classroom or the safety team.

505
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:42,438
[SPEAKER_06]: No one else was aware of these instances, which is why I'm saying we really need to look at what's going on for the protocol and what we should do.

506
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:43,158
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be dealt with.

507
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:44,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

508
00:45:44,399 --> 00:45:44,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

509
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:58,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, tonight, really quick on that, Mr. Johnson is going to appear before us in the next meeting.

510
00:45:58,575 --> 00:46:03,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also like for him to have heads up on all the situations that Ms.

511
00:46:03,038 --> 00:46:10,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Rodriguez brought here, only because I don't want him to come here next week or two weeks, whatever, and say, gee, I'm not aware of it, I'll come back to you.

512
00:46:10,363 --> 00:46:13,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make it very fruitful.

513
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:13,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

514
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:17,027
[SPEAKER_03]: No question in my mind they don't know about it.

515
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:25,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if I could, from the chair, I want to give some accolades out to Cache, who ran a fabulous event this past Saturday.

516
00:46:25,155 --> 00:46:26,796
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the Mystic River Celebration.

517
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:28,997
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a family-friendly event.

518
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:36,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Many of the parents and children I saw were there all afternoon with great music, great dance, great activities for the kids.

519
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:38,184
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was just a really beautiful event.

520
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:44,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to congratulate Laurel Siegel, Laura Beratin, the Medford Arts Council, Allie Fisk,

521
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:50,470
[SPEAKER_10]: and their major donor, Brookline Bank, for pulling off an amazing event that I hope everybody got to come to.

522
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,971
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you didn't, make sure to put it on your calendar for next year.

523
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:54,251
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fabulous day.

524
00:46:54,371 --> 00:46:56,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So kudos to Caché for pulling that off.

525
00:46:58,473 --> 00:46:58,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

526
00:46:58,633 --> 00:46:59,413
[SPEAKER_04]: VanderKloot.

527
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:11,637
[SPEAKER_04]: To mention that, I think that it's appropriate also to mention the wonderful celebration for the dedication of the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden and to thank everybody in your office who was responsible

528
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:24,338
[SPEAKER_04]: to make it such a wonderful event, because it truly was great, and I know how much the people enjoyed it and appreciated it, and I felt very blessed to have been able to attend.

529
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:26,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Paula.

530
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,479
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a beautiful afternoon.

531
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:41,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if we all heard one common theme, it was peace, and it was faith, and it was what gets you through the day, basically, and the things that these people endured is just horrendous, but there is a place now for people to reflect,

532
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:44,868
[SPEAKER_10]: and meet, and talk, and look to the future.

533
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:47,369
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was a very proud day for the city of Medford.

534
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:53,291
[SPEAKER_10]: My staff did an amazing job, as did others in City Hall, DPW, the state.

535
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:55,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, all hands were on deck for this event.

536
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:57,852
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was quite a nice afternoon.

537
00:47:59,093 --> 00:47:59,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

538
00:48:04,536 --> 00:48:12,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have a special commendation for a lovely lady that is leaving our school district, so I'd like to ask Ms.

539
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:13,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Padviglia to step forward.

540
00:48:32,274 --> 00:48:42,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to say that we have had this woman in our school system for the last 35 years, but it's only been two years, three months, four days, and she has accomplished so much in such a little amount of time.

541
00:48:42,982 --> 00:48:44,483
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just an amazing woman.

542
00:48:44,943 --> 00:48:51,388
[SPEAKER_10]: You've brought some ingenious ideas to our school system, and you've certainly automated and made us a more productive system.

543
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:55,272
[SPEAKER_10]: This doesn't even reflect how we all feel about you.

544
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:56,232
[SPEAKER_10]: You know we adore you.

545
00:48:56,312 --> 00:49:05,240
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's congratulations that Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Patricia Bailey for outstanding service as the director of administration and finance, signed by all of us.

546
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,063
[SPEAKER_10]: So we wish you the best in Minnesota?

547
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:10,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Michigan.

548
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:11,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Michigan.

549
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:15,109
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know that you all make another

550
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:17,122
[SPEAKER_10]: very proud.

551
00:49:19,763 --> 00:49:26,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So that she doesn't forget what's really important in life.

552
00:49:27,026 --> 00:49:30,447
[SPEAKER_03]: While you're watching those pitiful lions fight.

553
00:49:32,048 --> 00:49:32,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay in touch.

554
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:33,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

555
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:39,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we've been trying.

556
00:49:39,991 --> 00:49:43,273
[SPEAKER_03]: We bought a bracelet so that she will find whoever she is.

557
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:45,455
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been trying really, really hard.

558
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:50,598
[SPEAKER_10]: And just one other item, if you don't mind me taking it out of order.

559
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:52,699
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give up.

560
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Would someone make a motion that we take item?

561
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:36,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

562
00:50:36,689 --> 00:50:41,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to suspend the rules to take paper number eight of the reports out of order.

563
00:50:42,313 --> 00:50:43,995
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a report on complete streets.

564
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:51,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that the community is aware that the city of Medford was awarded $400,000 for complete streets projects within our community.

565
00:50:52,721 --> 00:51:03,870
[SPEAKER_10]: This was part of a community compact that we signed with the governor's office and the lieutenant governor, which allowed us to basically get $90,000 worth of grant money in order to do studies of our streets.

566
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:16,321
[SPEAKER_10]: With that money, MAPC coordinated a team of traffic engineers and traffic advisors to come out and look at a lot of the issues that we are aware of and then to rank them based upon need.

567
00:51:17,182 --> 00:51:20,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Once we accomplished that, we had to put together a policy to submit to the state.

568
00:51:20,946 --> 00:51:24,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Once they approved, we were eligible for some extra points on our application.

569
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:28,093
[SPEAKER_10]: We were awarded the full amount that you could for this process, which was $400,000.

570
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:35,935
[SPEAKER_10]: The number one item on our list was the traffic walk in front of the Brooks School.

571
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:43,042
[SPEAKER_10]: We realized that the width of that area is just a tremendous amount of space and it's a safety hazard.

572
00:51:43,462 --> 00:51:45,645
[SPEAKER_10]: And as recent as, I think, a week or so ago,

573
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:50,250
[SPEAKER_10]: A child was grazed, but it could have been much worse.

574
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:55,695
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't because of the width, it was a glare issue, but in any event, it's a very wide crosswalk.

575
00:51:56,335 --> 00:52:10,108
[SPEAKER_10]: So the people at the tool design, which was our traffic consultants, they went through and they looked at it and they made a host of recommendations for this project, including rapid flash beacons, which is basically if you were going to cross, you press the button

576
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:21,250
[SPEAKER_10]: blinks go off on both sides, curb bump outs so that you're basically tightening the street, and a host of other signage and striping.

577
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:29,411
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the interim, we're also going to be painting High Street because it is a very wide street going all the way down with cars being allowed to park in certain segments of it.

578
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:36,833
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be doing some immediate changes to the street to try and tighten it up a little bit and slow down the cars.

579
00:52:37,093 --> 00:52:38,033
[SPEAKER_10]: We know cars are an issue.

580
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:44,386
[SPEAKER_10]: The chief has guaranteed that he's going to have more enforcement on that street, and he will be addressing it.

581
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:47,549
[SPEAKER_10]: But we had six items that were approved, one including Salem Street.

582
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:50,752
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing a traffic study in the Salem Street, Haines Square area.

583
00:52:51,412 --> 00:52:57,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford Square, we're tightening up the area in front of River Street.

584
00:52:57,478 --> 00:52:59,860
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to make that a tighter walkway as well.

585
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,722
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a host of others in South Madrid in front of Tufts Pool.

586
00:53:02,803 --> 00:53:05,925
[SPEAKER_10]: We know we have a very dangerous crossing section there as well.

587
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:10,489
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you look up in the website, you can see the list of items that we're doing along with some analysis.

588
00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:12,631
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're just really proud to announce this.

589
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:19,637
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're also going to be looking at lowering the speed limits, which the state passed in August that the cities now have the authority to lower.

590
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:25,498
[SPEAKER_10]: the street mileage on roads before we couldn't touch state roads like Route 60, 16, 38.

591
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they have passed that.

592
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:28,642
[SPEAKER_10]: We are able to.

593
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:30,265
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're very pleased about that.

594
00:53:30,305 --> 00:53:32,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We've tried it in the past and they've come down and taken down our signs.

595
00:53:32,928 --> 00:53:36,733
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be intensifying this process.

596
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:45,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm particularly happy to hear about the part which deals with the Brooks School.

597
00:53:45,496 --> 00:53:53,683
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a group of parents from the Brooks who have met with former Mayor Mike McGlynn, brought their concerns.

598
00:53:53,723 --> 00:53:58,667
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been an ongoing issue for some time, and it's very good to see that there is a resolution.

599
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:00,973
[SPEAKER_10]: This intensifies this complete street.

600
00:54:01,014 --> 00:54:04,616
[SPEAKER_10]: This funding source really does exemplify.

601
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:08,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a time line to be spent by June 30th?

602
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:16,145
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have an engineer looking at the, when you do curb cuts, you have to have the proper radius and all of that.

603
00:54:16,205 --> 00:54:19,047
[SPEAKER_10]: So someone actually has to spec out the plans that have to go on the street.

604
00:54:19,087 --> 00:54:21,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll be specking that out over the next month.

605
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:22,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Money's in hand right now.

606
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:29,743
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll be putting it out to bid to start as soon as winter's over, as soon as we're able to get in the ground, and then it'll be done probably by April, May.

607
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:30,483
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

608
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:31,864
[SPEAKER_10]: The long-term plan.

609
00:54:31,884 --> 00:54:34,666
[SPEAKER_10]: The short-term striping, we're gonna be getting on that very shortly.

610
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:45,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And while we are under suspension, could I ask that we also address the addendum that we received this evening regarding the recommendation to accept a gift from Urban Sheds of Medford?

611
00:54:45,714 --> 00:54:46,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, certainly.

612
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:49,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

613
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Mister Benedetto.

614
00:54:52,191 --> 00:54:53,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

615
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:54,993
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm really glad that this is in place.

616
00:54:55,033 --> 00:55:10,344
[SPEAKER_09]: This is perfect timing, especially with the events that happened recently, um, and that we're going to put, um, um, some issues in some corrections in place immediately and not wait for this to be completed.

617
00:55:10,384 --> 00:55:12,185
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a concern for me.

618
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so with this brought up,

619
00:55:15,697 --> 00:55:20,539
[SPEAKER_09]: a memory of an update, I need an update from the crossing guard on the Felsway.

620
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we ever, you know, figure that out with?

621
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:31,503
[SPEAKER_10]: We, we had a meeting Thursday with a lot of the team from city hall, as well as some of the parents that were involved in the Brooke school.

622
00:55:32,103 --> 00:55:34,604
[SPEAKER_10]: And this issue was brought to our attention at that meeting.

623
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:39,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also had Senator Jalen and rep Garbally, who was going to speak to rep Donato.

624
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:41,027
[SPEAKER_10]: It's his district.

625
00:55:41,427 --> 00:55:49,890
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were going to look into the DCR issues, because that's a DCR road, to see if they could, number one, get a crossing guard down at two locations on the Fellsway.

626
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:54,231
[SPEAKER_10]: So they were going to take that in their bailiwick, and they were going to address that.

627
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:55,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

628
00:55:55,051 --> 00:56:00,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we've been trying for that crossing guard for about a year now, and we've been asking about updates.

629
00:56:00,393 --> 00:56:04,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we've reached out to the DCR repeatedly, and that we really weren't getting anywhere.

630
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:08,475
[SPEAKER_09]: before something happens there, I would like that addressed.

631
00:56:08,555 --> 00:56:14,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm glad that Rep Donato will be handling that because I think he'll do an excellent job and look forward.

632
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:19,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Superintendent, could you please give us an update at our next meeting on that?

633
00:56:19,822 --> 00:56:22,583
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm making a motion to have a report.

634
00:56:22,603 --> 00:56:23,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

635
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:33,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make a motion to send to Rep Donato and Senator Jalen a request for a traffic guard at the crosswalk on the Felsway between Salem Street and Fulton Street.

636
00:56:35,118 --> 00:56:36,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that's the correct.

637
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:36,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

638
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,541
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, there've been several requests made.

639
00:56:39,601 --> 00:56:40,922
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a new request.

640
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:46,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and representative Donato has, uh, run into a stone wall with a DCR.

641
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:59,115
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we get multiple, um, reps requesting it, perhaps that we'll get a little bit more steam on it, but it's been difficult because this is not a new request that we've been making this request.

642
00:56:59,455 --> 00:56:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: When St.

643
00:56:59,835 --> 00:57:03,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis closed DCR determined it wasn't necessary, but,

644
00:57:04,312 --> 00:57:06,873
[SPEAKER_03]: we think it's necessary and we just have to keep banging your way at it.

645
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:09,295
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was part of the meeting the other day.

646
00:57:09,335 --> 00:57:11,396
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you on that.

647
00:57:11,436 --> 00:57:16,338
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're going to make that a motion to our state delegation on that motion.

648
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:17,219
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

649
00:57:17,439 --> 00:57:18,519
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed.

650
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:19,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion is passed.

651
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:21,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

652
00:57:21,681 --> 00:57:22,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Cretz, did you wish to say?

653
00:57:22,622 --> 00:57:26,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, I had written down the same exact question about the fellows way.

654
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:28,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was what we were talking about last school year.

655
00:57:29,225 --> 00:57:29,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

656
00:57:29,485 --> 00:57:32,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, everything Aaron mentioned was exactly what I had written down and this is

657
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,843
[SPEAKER_02]: a great program and I'm so glad that we got that funding.

658
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:40,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just terrific with all the crosswalks, so dangerous.

659
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:48,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know, Stephanie, do you know like in the square also where you cross over where Colleen Brigham's is?
