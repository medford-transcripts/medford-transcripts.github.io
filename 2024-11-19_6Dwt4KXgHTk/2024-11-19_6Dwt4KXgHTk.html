    <p>[Vaughn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=10.813s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11.653s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12.474s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=15.275s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=16.196s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=17.316s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=18.297s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=19.797s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=20.678s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=21.308s">President</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=22.429s">Present.</a>  Please rise and salute the flag.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=27.272s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=46.168s">Pursuant</a>  to Governor Baker's March 12th, 2020 order, suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, chapter 30A, section 18, and the Governor's March 15th, 2020 order, imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford City Council will be conducted by a remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=69.292s">specific</a>  information and general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with the right of requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medford.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=82.287s">For</a>  this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=91.069s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=102.196s">In</a>  the event that we're able to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the city of Medford or community media website, an audio or video recording transcript, a rather comprehensive recording of the proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=121.308s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=121.848s">Mr.</a>  President, if we could, Mr. President, I realized that we have been reading the governor's order since March of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=133.812s">And</a>  I would ask that we send this to our city solicitor regarding language that states no in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=144.623s">That</a>  is not, right now what we follow, Mr. President, as you know, we received from our local board of health, the approval of having in-person attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=157.187s">We</a>  follow all the local board of health guidelines, as well as the CDC guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=162.528s">So</a>  I would ask that this be sent to our city solicitor for a potential update, Mr. President, on that language.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=169.11s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=171.27s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=173.615s">Before</a>  we start, our Board of Health Director is not able to attend this evening, so she did send me a brief report. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=182.677s">So</a>  since we've had, since 4-1, we've had 160 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=188.519s">The</a>  majority of those cases are 111 are under 40 years of old. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=198.7s">As</a>  she states, this is not a time to let our guard down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=202.526s">Mask</a>  wearing and testing are still extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=205.389s">All</a>  16 year olds plus are eligible as of Monday and should preregister now on the state website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=215.063s">We</a>  were scheduled to do 50 homebound with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine this week, but they were put on hold due to the feds holding it for more investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=226.511s">We</a>  will be in touch with those people to reschedule as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=232.175s">We</a>  look forward to seeing Marianne. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=234.116s">Oh,</a>  excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=237.099s">Our</a>  largest 46 cases are between the ages of 20 and 29. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=241.741s">So</a>  it seems to be that the bulk of the cases are coming in from the younger people who are getting out and being a little homebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=250.265s">So</a>  we'll have an update again next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=252.986s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=254.147s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=257.534s">Hearings</a>  2-1-3-0-1, City of Medford public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=261.678s">A</a>  public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council via Zoom remote video conferencing on Tuesday evening, April 13th, 2021 at 7 o'clock p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=271.128s">on</a>  a petition from BJ's Social Club under the provisions of chapter 148, section 13 of the general laws of Massachusetts for a flammable storage license to</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=291.8s">I</a>  think we lost the council chambers.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=331.603s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=332.264s">Sorry,</a>  the council chambers are muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=341.288s">We</a>  can't hear, we missed part of the intro and now we can't hear anything.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=348.773s">The</a>  council chambers are muted.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=350.553s">Okay,</a>  we can hear now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=353.175s">We</a>  can hear now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=353.695s">We</a>  did, the people dialed in on Zoom did miss a large part of the intro.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=362.369s">Name</a>  and, excuse me, name and address of the record and... Pat, can you put the mic on? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=367.992s">There</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Vaughn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=372.115s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President and members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=374.916s">For</a>  the record, my name is attorney Mark Vaughn with the law firm of Riemer Braunstein here tonight representing BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=380.079s">It's</a>  okay for us to make a presentation?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=381.76s">I</a>  know, you are in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=384.922s">Yes,</a>  you are in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=386.063s">In</a>  favor is the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=387.103s">Thank</a>  you, we're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=388.504s">Is</a>  there anybody else in favor of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=391.598s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, we close this portion of the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=395.54s">Is</a>  there anybody here in opposition to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=402.423s">Anybody</a>  here in opposition? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=404.744s">Okay,</a>  hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=406.105s">I</a>  see somebody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=410.707s">Jessica</a>  Wall?</p>

    <p>[Wall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=413.228s">Hi,</a>  good evening members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=416.149s">My</a>  name is Jessica Wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=417.27s">I'm</a>  an attorney at Anderson and Krieger in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=420.226s">I</a>  filed a comment letter on behalf of a group of Wellington residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=424.027s">I'm</a>  happy to describe those concerns to the council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=429.169s">And</a>  I believe that there are some members of the community who would also like to speak as well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=434.391s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=434.931s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=435.211s">So</a>  you are not in favor of this?</p>

    <p>[Wall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=437.091s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=437.431s">We</a>  are opposed to the project.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=439.212s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=439.752s">Anybody</a>  else not in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=442.653s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=447.235s">Gentlemen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=448.971s">Would</a>  you like to make a presentation? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=450.132s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=452.633s">Mr.</a>  President, would you like to be my president? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=455.435s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, could you please mark our vice president and vice president? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=459.217s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Vaughn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=460.718s">Good</a>  evening again, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=462.8s">For</a>  the record, attorney Mark Vaughn with the law firm of Riemer and Braunstein based in Burlington, and pleased to be before you in connection with the application representing BJ's Wholesale Club, the property at 278 <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=476.67s">Middlesex</a>  Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=477.611s">So</a>  they have operated a club store location here for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=482.035s">It's</a>  actually the first store in the entire BJ's franchise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=486.559s">I'm</a>  not sure if you're aware of that, but their first store that they ever opened as a company. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=492.284s">and</a>  they're very excited about the opportunity to provide a retail gas offering at this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=497.448s">I'm</a>  sure you're all familiar with the location, but we have it up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=501.09s">It's</a>  a large site. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=502.451s">It's</a>  approximately nine acres bounded by the Felsway and Middlesex Avenue and a large expansive parking area that sets itself up quite well for the proposed use and that the proposed fuel offering can be provided in the far corner of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=522.09s">every</a>  year, this is Middlesex Avenue, this is Belway, this would be where the proposed fuel station would be, well removed from the adjacent residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=533.839s">It</a>  allows for the customers to be able to access the gas station without impacting operations in the main parking field as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=540.604s">So</a>  the gas station use is allowed by right under the existing industrial zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=546.488s">However,</a>  it did require major project special permit review by the Community Development Board, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=551.789s">We</a>  did go through a rather lengthy review process with the Community Development Board where all issues pertaining to traffic, landscaping, lighting, public safety, and all related issues were looked at exhaustively. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=565.318s">So</a>  as part of that special permit review process, I know all departments of the city were involved in reviewing and provided comments as well to the CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=576.165s">who</a>  ultimately voted to grant the special permit by unanimous vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=580.787s">I</a>  think there was one abstention. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=582.887s">As</a>  part of that process and review by the city departments, there were many improvements that were made to the design and conditions opposed accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=592.15s">Austin</a>  Turner, who's with me, can walk through that in a moment if the board council would indulge us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=599.392s">we'd</a>  be making a variety of pedestrian safety, accessibility improvements, landscaping enhancements, sidewalk reconstruction, all features that were brought up in order to make some public benefit to that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=612.638s">So</a>  we did submit today to the council a record of the copy of that CDB decision with some of that backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=619.961s">So</a>  I know while the council did receive a favorable comment from the police department indicating no <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=628.626s">traffic</a>  impact anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=631.008s">I</a>  would also note that the city's traffic engineer, Todd Blake, had reviewed the application as part of the CDB process and also indicated that all issues have been satisfactorily addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=642.962s">The</a>  project was also reviewed by the Conservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=645.965s">Technically</a>  speaking, we do have some wetland jurisdictional areas that are off locus, even though what we're proposing is all within existing paved surface over the property to the north, there are wetland resource areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=659.759s">So</a>  we did trigger Conservation Commission review. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=662.677s">that</a>  was reviewed thoroughly by that body as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=666.338s">And</a>  notably, there's various drainage and stormwater upgrades that are being made here that resulted in them voting unanimously to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=674.5s">So</a>  in a moment, I'd like to just introduce briefly Patrick Netriba, who was with BJ's real estate, and he can explain just I don't want to take any of his thunder away, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=685.595s">This</a>  is going to be something that they do at many of their clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=689.959s">It's</a>  an amenity for their customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=691.561s">It</a>  would be limited to the members of BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=695.885s">So</a>  it's a membership only type of operation, which helps on traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=702.301s">And</a>  again, it's to provide a convenience for their existing customer base. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=706.762s">So</a>  I think it's important to note that there's not going to be any vehicular mechanic or vehicle service, anything like that that goes on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=717.665s">It's</a>  strictly a retail petroleum sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=720.646s">There</a>  wouldn't be a convenience store offering merchandise or things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=724.686s">There's</a>  a small kiosk that's on the property that is really just there with one attendant to be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=731.368s">to</a>  transact business with someone if they are having difficulty operating or need to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=736.11s">So</a>  just one item I would like to mention before turning it over to Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=741.892s">And</a>  I know it was referenced that there was a letter prepared by an attorney representing some folks in the area there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=750.336s">We</a>  are very familiar with the items that were raised in that correspondence. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=753.777s">And</a>  honestly, these issues were raised with the Conservation Commission as well as the Community Development Board <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=761.207s">And</a>  I know as part of that review, I believe those issues were thoroughly reviewed and addressed as they all fall within the criteria of the Community Development Board's review of the special permit application. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=776.213s">So</a>  we've tried to be very responsive throughout the process in terms of trying to address concerns and making sure that they were factored into the ultimate <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=785.069s">ultimate</a>  plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=785.75s">But</a>  if I could, Mr. President, if I could maybe just ask Patrick Netriba to address the body, I would appreciate that. <a

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=797.289s">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=797.709s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=798.009s">My</a>  name is Patrick Netriba. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=799.63s">I'm</a>  with BJ's Wholesale Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=801.11s">Our</a>  address is 25 Research Drive in Westboro, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=804.512s">That's</a>  our home office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=805.912s">And</a>  I'm the director of real estate for BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=807.993s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=808.814s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=810.154s">As</a>  Mark alluded to, Medford's a real special club for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=812.755s">It's</a>  club number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=813.556s">It's</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=814.156s">It's</a>  37 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=815.837s">That's</a>  not too much younger than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=818.458s">But</a>  it started off in 1984 with an idea here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=822.179s">And</a>  it's something we're really proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=824.138s">We</a>  take a lot of pride in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=825.679s">It's</a>  our first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=826.68s">There's</a>  a silver shovel in the home office, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=828.581s">When</a>  you walk in and it says Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=831.323s">So</a>  we value this club and we value our members as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=835.025s">As</a>  I'm sure you're all aware, BJ's members pay a fee to become part of the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=842.27s">I</a>  hope some of you are members, maybe you are, maybe you aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=845.472s">But</a>  part of that is a value proposition that we offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=847.853s">We</a>  offer great prices on milk or diapers or anything else that you want to buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=852.5s">and</a>  including at most of our clubs, gasoline fuel is a big part of what we do and our members clamor for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=859.866s">Hundreds</a>  of members over the years, many of which who I'm sure Medford residents, but some who are not, I'm sure as well have asked for gasoline. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=867.393s">Why</a>  don't we have gasoline in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=869.034s">Why</a>  do I have to go to stone and why do I have to go to revere and good businesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=873.037s">They</a>  listen to people, they listen to their customers, and that's why we're here before you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=877.932s">because</a>  we want to do right by our members and keep servicing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=881.236s">Because</a>  if we don't do that, we won't be in business for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=884.199s">So</a>  with that, I want to hand it off to Austin. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=887.162s">He's</a>  going to give you a quick summary of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=889.044s">And</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=889.484s">Appreciate</a>  your time tonight.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=890.886s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=894.633s">Good</a>  evening, name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=896.333s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=896.693s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, members of the council, Austin Turner with Bowler. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=900.514s">I</a>  am the civil engineer, land development consultant for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=903.715s">What</a>  I'd like to do just briefly is give you a high level view of the project, some of the improvements that have been made to the collaboration with your team, and then we can open it up to any questions, thoughts you might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=914.097s">So</a>  Patrick and Mr. Vaughn gave a very good introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=918.798s">This</a>  particular club, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=921.969s">The</a>  fueling station is, as Mark pointed out, located kind of in that north-east quadrant of the property, which is strategically located in terms of proximity or lack of proximity to the neighborhood and kind of up against that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=935.537s">So</a>  it's kind of its own isolated thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=938.739s">It's</a>  also located in the portion of the property, frankly, is- Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=942.721s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=943.702s">Is</a>  there any way the gentleman could maybe move up the sign and speak into the mic? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=947.424s">Because</a>  I don't think people at home are going to be able to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=951.127s">at</a>  that distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=952.308s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=954.029s">This</a>  portion of the property, frankly, is substantially underutilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=961.554s">It</a>  was an existing parking lot that was never used. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=964.716s">As</a>  Patrick mentioned, this has been in the works for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=967.398s">There's</a>  been a strong desire, request, and interest to establish this offering for members, and so here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=974.603s">We</a>  went through an exhaustive review process with the Conservation Commission, with the Community Development Board, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=981.287s">where,</a>  frankly, this project evolved pretty substantially, and for the better, honestly, as a result of that feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=988.69s">A</a>  number of items have been incorporated into the original design, which are summarized here, and I'll walk you through that very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=995.673s">The</a>  Middlesex Ave out in front are maintaining the access in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1001.016s">The</a>  fueling facility has been arranged in such a manner to really promote efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1008.419s">There</a>  are a number of different fueling facilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1011.184s">use</a>  what's called the tandem arrangement where they're back to back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1013.566s">You've</a>  seen them in those quad packages, which they're not efficient because if one person takes the fuel position in front of you and the other one's open, you can't get around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1020.651s">It</a>  creates stacking issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1023.013s">This</a>  particular arrangement is set up where we have six islands and 12 fueling positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1028.817s">So</a>  you can fuel on either side of the island, one way flow through that position where you would enter through the property here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1036.203s">You</a>  can come in and then filter through these positions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1040.114s">and</a>  then out, take a left, and you come around. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1043.535s">The</a>  traffic flow in that pattern was the subject of much discussion with the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1050.656s">This</a>  large landscape island that was added was at the direct request of the Community Development Board and through some collaborative efforts as part of the public hearing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1060.998s">The</a>  reason it was included, they really wanted to reinforce this kind of counterclockwise position and not have vehicles who had exited the field position come back out <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1070.472s">coming</a>  through a full access driver that was located here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1073.273s">As</a>  a result of that, we converted this to an in only to promote that circulation pattern, put this island in so it pulled vehicles further away and down to that existing curb cut in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1084.379s">That's</a>  a substantial improvement from a traffic flow perspective and something that we focused on quite a bit with the community development for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1091.443s">The</a>  other thing that's an important note here in terms of truck circulation, when a truck does enter off of Middlesex Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1098.442s">There</a>  is a defined loading position that's been in place for 37 years at this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1102.223s">We</a>  are maintaining that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1103.744s">They</a>  come in here, there's signage, they come around the outer perimeter, and they go to the loading. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1108.065s">That's</a>  staying. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1108.745s">So</a>  a fueling truck that would come through here, it's gonna follow that same protocol. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1112.466s">It's</a>  not gonna change anything about deliveries, how the trucks are routed to the property, anything access related to that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1119.429s">Staying</a>  on the access team, this driveway is quite wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1124.39s">It's</a>  been that way forever since the inception of this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1127.352s">Through</a>  our discussions with the CDB and the city's traffic consultant, this driveway became narrower. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1134.438s">We</a>  narrowed that curb radius to the point where we can still accommodate emergency response vehicles and also delivery vehicles, but it's become narrower. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1142.504s">That's</a>  served two purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1143.605s">It</a>  controls traffic better, and also we're upgrading the accessibility in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1149.31s">New</a>  sidewalk, new ADA accessibility, new tip downs, and a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1154.914s">They</a>  don't exist today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1156.817s">The</a>  sidewalk along our frontage is being reconstructed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1168.443s">Yeah,</a>  sure, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1170.124s">I</a>  didn't mean to block you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1170.985s">And</a>  if the bald head is giving glare, then it's... No, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1177.108s">Let's</a>  see if I can get this mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1179.51s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1182.271s">Also,</a>  in terms of access, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1184.997s">On</a>  the Middlesex Corridor, and Sean Kelly from Vanossas here, if he can talk about this in additional detail if the council so desires, we have committed to, through feedback and the request of the city, as well as their traffic engineer, to working with MassDOT to implement bicycle lane striping along this corridor, nearly a mile of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1205.256s">That's</a>  a substantial, substantial benefit, and something that was the subject of much discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1210.958s">It</a>  improves traffic flow along this corridor, but also adds bike lanes, which are in the city's master plan, and something that had been, the city had been, frankly, having trouble implementing because it's a pretty extensive undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1223.533s">and</a>  didn't have the resources to do it, they saw this as an opportunity, and BJ's is agreeing to collaborate with the city and MassDOT to try and implement those improvements there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1233.681s">That's</a>  a pretty substantial upgrade, and it's a lot of work on BJ's behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1239.766s">The</a>  accessibility improvements on the Felsway, we're upgrading that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1243.228s">There's</a>  a crosswalk in there, striping, and sidewalk improvements in that immediate intersection that are also being upgraded as part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1252.27s">Another</a>  item that was talked about was the lack of pedestrian accommodations to this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1259.054s">There</a>  really was none, despite the fact that there was sidewalk infrastructure along Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1265.278s">We're</a>  adding a sidewalk along the entire length of this property to the front door to allow people who may be in the community next to us, right in the general vicinity, to walk to the facility without having to drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1278.005s">There</a>  was no sidewalk today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1279.005s">We</a>  incorporated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1279.866s">That's</a>  part of our plans now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1285.307s">The</a>  landscaping here, particularly along Woodruff Avenue, wasn't doing so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1292.193s">There</a>  was a large void in what was previously existing vegetation in that edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1297.257s">This</a>  stretch along Woodruff Avenue, we're reinforcing that vegetation, new landscaping along that edge, and upgrading the fence to improve its condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1305.384s">It</a>  had not aged very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1309.067s">And</a>  then a number of different plantings inside <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1313.208s">the</a>  parking lot where there really were painted islands and things of that nature, that's being improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1317.672s">That</a>  was also a request of the CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1322.757s">In</a>  terms of stormwater and other improvements, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1327.759s">We</a>  have a modern stormwater system here and extensively reviewed both by the conservation and by CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1333.021s">It</a>  includes mechanical treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1334.582s">It</a>  includes all of the modernizations of the stormwater system that didn't exist or previously was running off and going into that resource area that was offsite. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1341.865s">That's</a>  been extensively reviewed and is being incorporated as part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1346.727s">We're</a>  adding nearly 5,000 square feet of additional landscaping along the frontage and interior, where it was essentially asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1353.791s">That's</a>  pretty substantial in its own right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1357.472s">In</a>  terms of lighting, we do have new lighting on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1360.734s">It's</a>  modern, it's gonna be LED, it's gonna be shielded, it's gonna be cut off, and it's gonna be what you probably heard referred to as dark sky compliant, so it doesn't get that up glove. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1370.701s">It's</a>  just forward-throwing, directional. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1373.083s">The</a>  nice thing about LED is it's efficient, and you can really control how it gets illuminated on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1378.266s">The</a>  lighting design makes this part of the site appropriately lit, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1384.209s">but</a>  not egregiously so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1385.55s">So</a>  you get even lighting levels, but it's not going to be halo or really, really bright. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1395.418s">The</a>  fueling positions, we spent some extensive time with the Conservation Commission, put them on the outer edge of the property, keeping them out of that flow pattern and the internal circulation so the trucks aren't mingling with customers who are fueling. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1409.268s">They're</a>  located right <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1412.148s">right</a>  here, and then a dedicated pull-off for a truck so we can maintain that navigable pattern around the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1419.457s">Another</a>  item that we're incorporating here, and this was, again, some extensive discussion with CDB, we're implementing four electronic vehicle charging stations as part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1430.64s">They're</a>  going to be located generally in the front of the facility to promote their use. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1433.862s">That</a>  was a big initiative that was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1435.323s">It</a>  took some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1436.663s">That</a>  was part of the reason we were working through the CDB process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1440.706s">We</a>  had to get some commitments from folks to come here and join the property and work for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1446.649s">But</a>  we're committed to providing those electronic vehicle charging stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1452.072s">And</a>  then just in terms of this whole package, as I'd mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1458.106s">I</a>  think it's important to just reinforce this process that we went through locally was incredibly valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1464.47s">The</a>  team that you have in the city spent a lot of time with us collaborating on this particular design. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1470.173s">All</a>  the feedback we received, all those number of hearings that we went through made this project substantially improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1475.957s">It's</a>  grown and evolved for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1478.598s">It</a>  was a very valuable process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1481.64s">I</a>  hope that the council sees that as well in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1486.226s">the</a>  City Council or the Community Development Board worked extensively with us to generate this plan, and obviously by way of their unanimous vote, thought that we had done what they asked of us and listened to their feedback, incorporated essentially everything that they asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1501.732s">It</a>  took a while, it was a lot of work, but I think, frankly, the Board should be commended for spending a time in that commitment with us, because I know it was a lot of time and effort on their behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1511.256s">Some</a>  of it went to very, very late in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1514.808s">With</a>  that, oh, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1517.25s">One</a>  thing I want to touch on too, the fueling system, which is obviously the subject of this discussion, is a brand new modernized fueling system. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1524.756s">It</a>  has all of the current modernizations, protocols, safety mechanisms, all of the things that you'd expect from a modern fueling system is incorporated into this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1537.266s">Jim</a>  Stewart is here tonight if you have specific questions on the technology and how the operation of that <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1543.398s">he'd</a>  be happy to answer any of those questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1545.72s">He's</a>  a wicked smart fuel guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1547.602s">So</a>  ask him all the things you need to feel comfortable about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1551.665s">And</a>  I'm sure he's happy to answer those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1553.327s">So</a>  I've talked a lot with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1556.029s">I'd</a>  be happy to answer any questions or at your discretion.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1559.913s">Mr.</a>  President, could we hear from attorney wall before we go into questions?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1568.64s">No,</a>  excuse me.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1570.817s">if</a>  this this is the council's uh portion of the time to ask questions and the public will get a chance after after the council's essay questions okay she was one of the people speaking against yeah uh councilor thank you mr president um yeah i just have a few questions um if the gentleman could share a little bit more about the landscaping improvements i know we have you know you can look at different <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1594.95s">parts</a>  of the city where they have quote-unquote landscaping, which is just a couple of dead bushes and an island. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1599.871s">So</a>  if we could talk more specifically to what that actually might be.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1602.912s">I'd</a>  be happy to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1607.513s">So</a>  what we've done in the very front of the property, the parking lot essentially went right up against the sidewalk almost to the boundary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1616.175s">It's</a>  an asphalt parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1617.815s">We've</a>  pulled the development further interior to the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1621.647s">we've</a>  incorporated about 3,000 square feet of landscaping immediately up against Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1627.713s">It</a>  includes a number of street trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1629.835s">It</a>  includes a number of ground cover plantings in there and a lawn area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1634.901s">The</a>  ground cover plantings, we selected species at the request of the Conservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1642.432s">and</a>  they are buffer zone planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1644.212s">So</a>  there's different species in there to help promote that buffer zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1647.793s">So</a>  we worked with the commission to pick those specific species in there to help promote that buffer zone and enhance the buffer zone that really wasn't anything but a parking lot previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1658.656s">As</a>  you work interior to the property, again, that large landscape island in the center of the property provided an immediate vehicular control. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1669.053s">but</a>  equally as important afforded us the opportunity to incorporate four shade trees where none existed, a number of different ground plantings in there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1677.962s">And</a>  we've incorporated ground plantings and shade trees along the interior of the property where the opportunity afforded us to do that, including up against the building where there are none. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1690.115s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1692.196s">most</a>  importantly, along Woodruff Avenue, shade trees there, and then a number of screening plantings to enhance that buffer that had long since disappeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1702.506s">I</a>  hope that answers the question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1704.008s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1705.149s">How</a>  many street trees do you know?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1709.353s">Hold</a>  that thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1709.973s">14,</a>  as I</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1717.745s">Okay,</a>  and inclusive, so I would understand the ones on the property would obviously be managed or by BJ's landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1724.971s">For</a>  the street trees, would those also be managed by BJ's?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1729.515s">Yes,</a>  ma'am, that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1730.956s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1732.558s">And</a>  then I believe I read in the documents, the bike lanes, are they protected bike lanes or they are just painted bike lanes?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1740.704s">they're</a>  going to be painted bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1742.205s">That's</a>  what we've been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1744.266s">So</a>  they're not going to be some physical barrier, if you will, between them, they're going to be striped.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1749.269s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1749.649s">And</a>  you mentioned this just may have been a turn of phrase, but you said you're going to try and implement the bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1755.492s">Is</a>  that, you know, that's definitely a provision that you were working on, or this is something that's still being explored.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1761.635s">So</a>  where, what was requested at the community development board, which we obviously agreed to was to work with MassDOT <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1768.942s">to</a>  implement this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1770.123s">We've</a>  had initial discussions with MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1772.545s">Part</a>  of that process is continuing to evolve as these improvements are designed and coordinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1779.47s">But</a>  what we've committed to is working with MassDOT to implement these improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1783.193s">Obviously,</a>  that's subject to their review and their technical review of the drawings, but that's a conversation that's happening and it's active and it's ongoing, and we haven't heard anything to the contrary yet.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1793.12s">Okay,</a>  and just one final question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1795.002s">I</a>  wanna make sure my other Councilors have plenty of time <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1797.39s">I</a>  know you mentioned what your customers are looking for as far as getting their gas through BJ's, but has there been any consideration to the fact that there are no less than four gas stations within a half a mile of this location already?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1811.983s">Certainly,</a>  yeah, and I don't think, you know, I'm not a BJ's employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1816.287s">Patrick</a>  can speak to it if he wants to, but in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1820.936s">We're</a>  not looking at it as being another gas station amongst others. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1825.117s">It's</a>  an offering for BJ's members who have asked for this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1828.838s">We're</a>  looking at it as a product and an offering for BJ's club members. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1833.3s">Consideration</a>  has been given to it, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1834.96s">And</a>  frankly, BJ's is making a very, very big financial commitment to implement this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1840.982s">They</a>  wouldn't be making it if they didn't think it was additive to both their facility and the community.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1847.864s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1849.745s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1852.196s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1853.797s">If</a>  you could, and I apologize, before I couldn't get a good view, but could you just show me what the flow would be like going into the driveway for someone that wants to get gas? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1863.161s">Yes,</a>  sir, of course.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1864.542s">So</a>  if you'd come in off Middlesex, enter the property here, you'd have this entrance only, right here, this is the in only driveway, you can't exit the driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1874.446s">You'd</a>  make this move, and then you'd enter, you queue through the fueling position, and then you'd make a left once you were done, come all the way out over here, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1882.535s">exit</a>  and then you'd come out, you could exit that way.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1886.696s">You</a>  don't have any concerns with queuing that way? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1889.917s">I</a>  mean, to me, it seems like you could kind of get into a bit of a log jam once you take that right to get in if you have multiple cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1896.078s">I'm</a>  not questioning, but just so I'm clear, when you say that way, you're referring to the entrance? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1899.419s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1899.759s">So</a>  when you go into the area where you're going to get gas, so you come into the driveway, you take that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1906.98s">I</a>  mean, there are a lot of pumps, which is great, but if you have, I mean, sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1911.55s">get</a>  a lot of customers, which I guess would be a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1914.151s">I</a>  mean, I would imagine you'd get pretty jammed in there, no? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1917.111s">No,</a>  no, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1917.671s">I</a>  mean, it's a great question.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1918.992s">And</a>  it's one that we spend a lot of time talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1920.612s">So</a>  I'm happy to answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1923.452s">This</a>  distance that you see in here, that's kind of that entrance queue, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1927.913s">We</a>  don't expect that that's going to be stacked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1930.634s">There's</a>  sufficient room in there where you can have a vehicle in the pump in the queue, have two vehicles behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1935.856s">and</a>  not have queuing spilling out into that driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1938.417s">So</a>  your concern, I understand and appreciate, is backing up this lane so you're creating this traffic jam where people are not coming in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1945.34s">We</a>  set this up so that you can accommodate a number of vehicles in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1948.922s">We</a>  don't expect that volume to be there at a given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1952.364s">We</a>  have spent a lot of time analyzing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1954.745s">BJ's</a>  operations look at these. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1956.125s">Part</a>  of the reason we have this fueling system set up is it processes vehicles very efficiently through that queue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1963.837s">And</a>  it doesn't create that tandemized issue where you have two pumps that are stacked up and one's in the vehicles in front. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1969.279s">You</a>  can't get to the one in front of it because you're waiting for them to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1973.181s">And</a>  then the reason we have the 12 fueling positions, we don't expect to be using those all the time, but it creates that efficient processing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1980.323s">So</a>  in the event you have 12 cars there, you can push them through very quickly and get them in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1984.865s">And</a>  you don't expect, and you don't anticipate at all that those vehicles are going to queue back up into the engine driver.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1990.93s">Do</a>  you have that same kind of set up at your other locations? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1993.051s">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1993.651s">You</a>  do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1993.871s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1994.231s">And</a>  you find it to be pretty successful? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1995.792s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1996.392s">We</a>  wouldn't do it if you, you know, not to be facetious, but we wouldn't do it if it didn't work that way, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2002.514s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2003.335s">If</a>  I may, Mr. President, do we have anyone on the line from the administration that's answering questions?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2008.677s">Alicia?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2012.478s">Alicia?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2012.758s">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2018.427s">staff,</a>  both the Conservation Commission and Community Development Board, so I'm able to speak to those hearings.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2028.493s">Alicia,</a>  my question will be, you know, when you take a look at the gas tanks that have, you know, proposed for BJs, how do they compare to the gas tanks across the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2042.481s">Are</a>  they same size, same number of tanks? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2045.042s">I'm</a>  just kind of curious.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2048.364s">actually,</a>  you're the first person to ask this question, and we've never had a conversation with the owner across the street about what he has installed.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2058.313s">Do</a>  we have anything on file that we can look at?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2062.156s">I</a>  would have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2063.397s">We</a>  would have to check with the building department to see if they do.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2066.599s">To</a>  me, I'm curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2070.443s">That's</a>  just, you know, I mean, to me, there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2075.393s">I'm</a>  not a gasoline expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2077.694s">I</a>  mean, but I know there's a lot of gas in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2080.335s">I</a>  mean, you're talking, what, I think between the three tanks, there are like 60,000 gallons worth of gas?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2087.419s">I</a>  think it's 64,000.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2089.86s">And</a>  then I would imagine, if I'm correct, the gas station across the street is pretty sizable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2095.677s">I</a>  don't know what they have, but I would imagine it might be something similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2098.739s">So</a>  I'm just curious as to what, you know, that gas station has across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2104.104s">And</a>  I don't know, but I mean, I'm not sure what are the gas stations in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2107.566s">I'm</a>  not sure how they set up, but I mean, that's, to me, that's just kind of curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2114.732s">With</a>  regard to gasoline, so I have questions regarding gasoline delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2120.236s">How</a>  often will this be, will you be getting gas deliveries? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2123.619s">Is</a>  that something that you would be able to answer?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2126.701s">can</a>  answer that question for you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2128.542s">We'll</a>  expect to take a truck here approximately once per day to service the fueling station.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2133.805s">One</a>  time per day to fill up? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2134.986s">Approximately,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2136.227s">And</a>  is that coming at a certain time?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2137.848s">No,</a>  the deliveries are scheduled on demand and controlled via computer based on the demand for gasoline. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2145.693s">So</a>  we monitor that on demand based on our systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2149.495s">And</a>  if we're low, we'll take a delivery at that point and schedule it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2153.223s">to</a>  work with the business operation to avoid peak travel times and what have you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2160.225s">And</a>  if it's not at a certain time, is it going to be between certain hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2164.267s">Will</a>  it be coming late at night or early in the morning?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2166.848s">It</a>  could be scheduled at any time, but we try not to schedule it during our peak hours, you know, Saturday morning when people are shopping or Sunday for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2175.531s">We</a>  do schedule sometimes in the evening or an overnight if possible.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2180.592s">So</a>  is there, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2182.338s">So</a>  one of my concerns would be, and we haven't heard from the neighbors yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2185.901s">I</a>  mean, could there be a gas delivery at five in the morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2188.443s">Is</a>  that something that could happen?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2190.144s">It</a>  could, yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2191.605s">And</a>  it's a completely quiet operation at that rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2195.688s">The</a>  truck would pull up and shut his engine off. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2198.75s">And</a>  then the fuel is dispensed into the tanks via gravity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2201.812s">There's</a>  no pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2202.873s">There's</a>  no whirring of an engine or a motor or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2206.196s">It</a>  flows via a pipe or tube, if you will, into the tanks via gravity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2210.459s">You'd</a>  be hard pressed to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2212.281s">You</a>  know.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2214.422s">Are</a>  these large tanker trucks that are delivering the fuel?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2217.385s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2217.945s">In</a>  Massachusetts, the state regulation, Jim will correct me, 12,000 gallons, I believe is correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2224.049s">Up</a>  to 12,000 gallons, yeah, which is industry standard.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2228.272s">And</a>  I'm just thinking with regard to the neighbors, you know, especially if you're going late at night, early in the morning, do these have diesel engines, these trucks? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2238.139s">You</a>  know, diesel engines are usually louder, so.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2240.691s">Yeah,</a>  just like any other truck, they have a diesel engine, but when they pull up, they turn off their engine. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2246.753s">So</a>  there's no idling while the fuel tanker is dispensing its fuel from the tank of the truck into the tank in the ground.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2255.496s">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2257.216s">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2260.937s">I'm</a>  just trying to think of the impact it's going to have on the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2264.679s">And</a>  I know, for me, if I lived in the neighborhood, I would have questions like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2269.721s">how</a>  is it going to impact the residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2271.282s">That's</a>  so, you know, quality of life issue, noise, traffic, you know, these are all things that, you know, I have questions about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2280.408s">When</a>  I look at a project like that, that's why I ask these types of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2283.751s">It</a>  does have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2285.332s">As</a>  minimal as you may think it seems, I'm not saying that you think it's minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2291.216s">Some</a>  people might think it's minimal, but if you live in the neighborhood, it's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2296.339s">So</a>  that's why I'm asking these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2299.778s">Is</a>  there a, so as far as the safety devices that are set up, I mean, I would imagine there's all kinds of safety devices within the pumps and whatnot.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2308.461s">Yeah,</a>  it's a state-of-the-art system. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2310.062s">We</a>  buy the absolute best system that we can because it's simply not worth taking any risk when it comes to fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2317.404s">And</a>  I can look at all of you and say that with conviction, that that's what we do because it just isn't worth the risk to be cheap on your piping, your tanks, your systems, your people, any of it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2328.59s">We</a>  buy the best that money can buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2333.994s">With</a>  regard to the parking lot and the new plantings, which I think that's the vast improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2341.218s">One</a>  of the complaints I received is that at times the lot can be dirty, trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2349.124s">So</a>  is there a maintenance plan for that parking lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2353.526s">Put</a>  it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2356.408s">You're</a>  just saying that I think the plant things on Woodruff and the Woodruff side, they were in tough shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2362.713s">So</a>  to me, when I hear that, that means that maybe they haven't been maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2366.816s">They</a>  have, you know, so therefore, you know, BJ's maybe hasn't been on the ball with regards to the maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2372.04s">I</a>  mean, is there a maintenance plan in place where this is going to be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2376.755s">maintained</a>  on a regular basis, cleaned on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2380.518s">You</a>  know, if you're putting down mulch yearly, can you talk a little bit about that?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2384.141s">Sure,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2384.681s">This</a>  club receives extra maintenance and has for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2388.004s">I</a>  think when we're talking about some of the plantings were in rough shape, particularly on Woodruff Avenue, maybe you've driven there, but some of the trees on the public side, not on BJ's property, have died over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2398.352s">I</a>  don't know whether it's salt or whatever happens to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2400.774s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2407.441s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2412.584s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2412.784s">We</a>  can't hear if people aren't speaking into the microphone.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2416.346s">I</a>  can illustrate what Austin was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2420.428s">Some</a>  of the trees along this area we were discussing before that the vegetation was in rough shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2425.251s">And</a>  there was a utility project that occurred in this area on wood, where some of the roots for the trees had been cut as a result of that utility work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2434.756s">And</a>  I think that's the reason why some of those trees have died. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2437.421s">You</a>  guys can speak to that perhaps a little bit more, but our efforts to bolster the landscaping here are evident out of plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2444.065s">We</a>  want to screen the neighbors as much as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2446.787s">We</a>  understand, I understand, these people live here and I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2451.79s">I</a>  totally get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2452.89s">This</a>  is their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2456.593s">This</a>  is their front yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2457.813s">And</a>  we have to be sensitive to that, which is why we've done the best that we can to push our facility to the far end of the lot, to screen as much as we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2467.766s">to</a>  make this the best that we can for them, because it's... One information, Councilor Scott Belli. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2480.894s">As</a>  we're asking for this tonight, where has BJ's been for the past few years with those neighbors? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2487.458s">I'm</a>  sure you've known that the fencing and those lines, those homes that have been abutted, there's been some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2495.723s">So</a>  I think that's what Councilor Falco is leading to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2499.285s">It</a>  was nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2500.446s">I</a>  started working there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2501.427s">I</a>  was one of the first people that worked there when I was a kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2503.568s">So</a>  I understand the energy, and I loved your speech at the beginning, but as we moved on and BJ's grew, we kind of forgot about those neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2514.034s">So</a>  we're just, I think that's one of the things I'm concerned too, because if you look at that fence that goes along that area, if those neighbors live, you know, it was deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2523.96s">And</a>  then the mess that goes there, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2525.774s">And,</a>  you know, I, I, I didn't see much until, you know, maybe this project's come to light, but I just hate to see, as we move forward with this and then this is forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2536.937s">So</a>  I just, I think we need more assurance of what type of plan, if I, if Casa Falcos leading to the way you're going with the maintenance, because we didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2545.814s">We</a>  haven't seen in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2547.034s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2549.655s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2550.295s">No</a>  worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2551.115s">I</a>  can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2552.296s">Listen,</a>  we've been there for 37 years and we're not perfect.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2556.257s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2557.797s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2558.557s">And</a>  I won't stand up here and tell you that we are perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2561.878s">I'm</a>  sure we've made mistakes, but we do our best and our maintenance manager does his best. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2566.339s">Even</a>  as recently as February, we had a maintenance project and I know that he, Sean, went around and put flyers in everyone's mailbox to try to <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2575.276s">try</a>  to do our best to notify folks of what we're doing, when we're doing it, and why we have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2579.699s">So</a>  that being said, this club does receive an enhanced maintenance program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2584.163s">I</a>  can get to some more details on that if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2586.364s">I'm</a>  happy to provide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2588.186s">And</a>  we're committed to maintaining that standard and that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2591.388s">And</a>  I'm glad that you've noticed it's gotten better because we want to make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2595.571s">And</a>  I understand that in years past, perhaps we haven't met that standard and haven't lived up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2601.736s">And</a>  I can't change that, but what I can do <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2604.571s">looking</a>  forward for you and to say to you that we will do better and we will follow what we say we do here and now.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2614.081s">So</a>  do you have a maintenance plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2617.124s">Is</a>  there something in writing a maintenance plan that BJ's has for this parking lot?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2621.528s">Yes,</a>  we do.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2622.309s">We</a>  have an internal document. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2623.81s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2624.27s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2624.571s">Is</a>  that something you can send to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2625.912s">It'd</a>  be nice to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2628.173s">I</a>  mean, like I said before, that's one of the complaints I get. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2631.116s">I</a>  know when I'm walking through there, sometimes, you know, it looks like, you know, I'm not sure how often you have a street sweeper come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2640.003s">But</a>  you mentioned, this is, I mean, for some people, this is their front yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2644.166s">And</a>  they're literally looking at this all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2647.368s">So</a>  therefore, you know what, it should be clean all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2650.151s">That's</a>  the way I look</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2656.198s">summarize</a>  what we do and when we do it so that you can review that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2660.54s">Fair</a>  enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2661.601s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2663.202s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2663.622s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2664.322s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2664.803s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2670.345s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2673.027s">I</a>  want to thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2675.428s">Thank</a>  the CD board and the Conservation Commission members for what seemed to be some significant improvements since the start of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2683.872s">I</a>  think my questions may be better suited for Patrick from BJ's.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2691.455s">Sorry</a>  to walk away on you there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2694.156s">Hi,</a>  Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2696.197s">My</a>  first question is, how long do you expect this station to be operational? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2700.439s">You</a>  know, 10 years, 20 years?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2703.6s">The</a>  expected life term of the facility, I would anticipate it's at least 15 years, probably longer, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2712.084s">I</a>  think that's fair to say.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2714.162s">Um,</a>  and do you have an expectation of the annual revenue that you're going to be gaining from this facility?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2721.447s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2722.328s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2724.99s">Um,</a>  I think that would be helpful for us to understand as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2728.212s">Cause</a>  you know, I appreciate what you're saying about your customers, but I think you as a, as a business also have a vested interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2733.355s">You</a>  wouldn't be putting this forward if it wasn't going to, to make you money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2738.018s">Um,</a>  the third piece of this that I want to ask about is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2744.011s">If</a>  this project doesn't finally get final approval, would you commit to making some of the improvements around safety and environmental protection that are included in this plan?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2754.855s">I'm</a>  sorry, I want to make sure I understand your question properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2758.557s">You're</a>  saying if you do not approve the project, will I still provide the mitigation?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2763.018s">Or</a>  some of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2763.579s">I</a>  mean, it seems like currently we have runoff going into a stream, et cetera.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2770.014s">That's</a>  something that we could discuss, but we wouldn't be doing any work out on the parking lot if we weren't building the gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2776.758s">So</a>  I'm not sure if I completely follow you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2780.041s">No,</a>  I'm just wondering. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2781.041s">I</a>  mean, it just, you know, it kind of goes to, I appreciate the comments from my fellow Councilors, Scarpelli and Falco, you know, about stewardship and, you know, being a member of the community, it seems like there are some ongoing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2797.272s">And</a>  then finally, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2800.077s">If,</a>  I guess, say there's a 15 year lifespan, what would the process be for removing the facility if it eventually closes?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2810.92s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2811.42s">No,</a>  that's a fair question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2813.32s">We</a>  will remove it when it reaches its end of its useful life or when we decide that it's no longer viable, one of those two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2819.642s">And</a>  the facility will be decommissioned for state regulation and NFPA as far as the tanks and the underground storage piping lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2828.865s">and</a>  everything that has to be removed in the facility will be removed from the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2833.867s">You</a>  wouldn't know it was there at that point.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2837.629s">Got</a>  it, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2839.49s">And</a>  the reason I ask is just with the commitments from major automakers to move to electric vehicles and the expectation that fossil fuels are no longer going to be the main way that we power transportation going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2853.857s">To</a>  me, this seems like a little bit of a short-term plan <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2858.181s">Um,</a>  and not necessarily where we're going in the long term to be installing a gas station at this late stage in, in our energy transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2866.627s">Um,</a>  so that's why I bring that up, you know, in 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2870.029s">And</a>  is that, does do industry trends reflect what you expect the life of the station to be is 15 years based on the fact that, uh, vehicles are transitioning to electric.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2883.148s">You</a>  know, I wish I could predict the future, but as you'll note in our application and filing and plans, we actually have car chargers at this location because we see that as a potential and something that our members have asked for as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2897.72s">So</a>  we certainly want to cater and service to them with an eye to the present as well as one to the future.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2905.707s">Do</a>  you expect that that could be a potential future outcome as well, a conversion to some sort of electric charging station?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2912.958s">I</a>  would say that all options are on the table, whether it be electric, hydrogen, or some kind of fuel cell. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2918.461s">I</a>  think that those kind of things are certainly on the horizon.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2922.104s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2922.644s">Well,</a>  I appreciate the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2924.745s">I</a>  share some of the concerns of my fellow Councilors, as well as some of these long-term concerns, and I would like to hear from the neighbors as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2931.209s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2933.21s">Councilor</a>  Knox. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2936.592s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2937.573s">I</a>  want to thank my colleagues for their comments, and I want to thank BJ's <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2943.44s">for</a>  being present tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2945.4s">What</a>  I did hear at the outset, Mr. President, was that BJ's values their club and they value their members. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2954.282s">What</a>  I did not hear was that BJ's values the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2959.983s">And</a>  it may be because I live a couple of blocks over, Mr. President, that I could tell you firsthand the number of emails and phone calls I've received over the past <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2973.118s">many</a>  years regarding BJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2976.639s">And</a>  it's great to say that this is their first club, this is their flagship store, it receives extra maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2985.523s">Mr.</a>  President, all you have to do is open your eyes and see that none of that is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2992.825s">All</a>  you have to do is go along Woodruff Ave and see the many breaks in the fence, year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3001.351s">and</a>  the debris from their parking lot blows out into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3006.135s">It</a>  was just about three days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3008.197s">So</a>  if anyone went by there and looked at Woodruff Ave and said, what a nice clean area it is, it was my call to DPW, which happens two or three times a year, Mr. President, to Steve Penaglia, the head of our highway, that got that area once again cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3027.168s">And</a>  it was our DPW that went out there that would cut down the debris and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3032.673s">Yes,</a>  BJ's has done some improvements after many, many, many calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3040.28s">And</a>  I've personally made them to the store managers over and over again, the district managers and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3046.266s">And</a>  they will eventually make some improvements, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3050.782s">But</a>  it's clear to me, if you look at the lot, you look at the debris, you look at the fact that it is not a pedestrian-friendly business. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3061.387s">Anyone</a>  right now that has to walk to BJ's, so if you're an area resident or neighbor and you wanna walk there, you're taking your life in your hands going through their lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3071.851s">That's</a>  how dangerous it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3074.812s">And</a>  that's why the Community Development Board made the recommendations they did, Mr. President, regarding circulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3080.959s">It</a>  wasn't just for vehicular traffic, it was for pedestrians as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3085.862s">That's</a>  how dangerous it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3090.565s">I</a>  remember getting the calls over and over again, Mr. President, because the sweeping that they do in their parking lot, two, three in the morning, the sweeper would be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3103.613s">You</a>  can imagine the noise and the echoing of the noise in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3108.151s">And</a>  I can't tell you how many times, how many calls I had to put out, Mr. President, in order to get BJs to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3116.053s">And</a>  then they stated they did something, and within three weeks, it's back again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3122.175s">The</a>  noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3124.256s">Idling</a>  trucks overnight, Mr. President, with the refrigerators, parked in the lot for hours and hours and hours, idling trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3135.168s">It</a>  wasn't until we brought BJ over and over again and asked them, what can they do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3140.63s">I</a>  believe they started locking their lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3143.112s">I</a>  don't know if they put a chain in the front back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3145.373s">They</a>  started locking their lot, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3147.974s">But</a>  still, at night, that lot remains open on many occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3154.642s">Drag</a>  racing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3155.823s">You</a>  might say, how can you drag race on the back of the lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3159.185s">They</a>  start from the beginning of the lot on the Fellsway, Mr. President, where that little stretch of road runs along Woodruff into the parking lot, and they drag race inside there at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3173.493s">These</a>  aren't made up stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3174.994s">These</a>  are what the neighbors have to put up with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3180.277s">You</a>  know, BJ's has not been a good neighbor, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3183.769s">I've</a>  lived in the area 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3187.251s">They</a>  have not been a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3190.193s">And</a>  I don't believe they value the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3193.155s">If</a>  this is their flagship store, shame on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3196.117s">I'd</a>  hate to see what the other stores look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3202.441s">You</a>  know, they mentioned about substantial improvement to the circulation, to the landscaping, to the lighting on their lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3210.646s">They</a>  haven't mentioned the concerns <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3213.109s">of</a>  the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3216.03s">We</a>  heard that this new station is a great distance away from the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3226.294s">I</a>  challenge anyone to take a walk down there tonight, and we'll see what this great distance is from the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3233.177s">We'll</a>  see, Mr. President, the 64,000 gallons of flammable gas that's going to be in very close proximity to homes in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3241.684s">and</a>  ask if you would like to live that close in that area, or anyone from BJs, if they'd like to live that close. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3248.308s">This</a>  is a secondary use for BJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3252.931s">And</a>  it's great that they wanna take care of their members, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3256.994s">What</a>  else does the membership want? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3259.215s">Where</a>  else can we put that lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3260.496s">It's</a>  a big lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3265.059s">How</a>  else can we accommodate the membership of BJs and disregard the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3272.671s">And</a>  that's exactly what we're doing here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3275.653s">If</a>  I'm not mistaken, BJ's approached the city council some many years ago for a license for gas storage on that property, and they were denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3288.103s">For</a>  many of the same reasons you're hearing here tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3294.589s">You</a>  know, we heard about trucking, one truck a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3298.512s">That's</a>  for the gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3299.272s">That</a>  doesn't include their other operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3301.852s">how</a>  many other trucks are coming in, 18 wheelers, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3305.933s">Operational</a>  noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3308.914s">They're</a>  not putting this gas station for no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3312.175s">As</a>  the gentleman stated, I believe it's near Woburn BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3316.176s">People</a>  would like to have one closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3319.157s">So</a>  we'll divert a lot of that traffic to Woburn, into Middlesex Ave, into the Felsway, into our neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3333.891s">additional</a>  path trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3335.592s">It</a>  was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3336.793s">I</a>  happened to have attended the Conservation Commission hearing on January 15th, and I spoke and represented what I believe the neighborhood concerns, and they did a good job as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3349.284s">I</a>  also spoke at the September 16th Community Development Board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3355.529s">And</a>  let's not forget, Mr. President, we can thank the Community Development Board, the Conservation Commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3362.725s">But</a>  guess who represents the neighbors in the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3366.347s">It's</a>  this Method City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3370.51s">And</a>  we're the ones, Mr. President, that feel the complaints, that hear the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3383.618s">So,</a>  Mr. President, what I would ask is for BJ's tonight to present to us <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3393.649s">what</a>  the lighting impacts associated for this proposal on the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3400.456s">What</a>  are the direct lighting impacts on the residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3404.219s">I'd</a>  like to hear from them tonight, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3407.062s">Okay,</a>  you wanna answer that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3409.504s">On</a>  the lighting?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3431.203s">before</a>  Austin gets into the plighting, Councilor Marks, I just wanted to address some of your concerns because we do hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3437.828s">And</a>  I know you're a resident and I know you've worked with us over many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3443.212s">And</a>  like I said, we've made mistakes and I understand that and I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3448.877s">I</a>  can't erase those things in the past, but what I can do is tell you here now that we will agree and commit to a certain level to make it better for you and for your neighbors, as I've outlined here, but I wanted to, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3461.363s">to</a>  not rebut your statements, but to acknowledge them, because I know that yours are heartfelt and our sympathies are with you on that to make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3471.387s">So,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3473.027s">With</a>  that, Austin, we'll answer your question on the lighting.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3482.491s">Again,</a>  Austin Turner with Polar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3485.012s">So</a>  do you have a question about the lighting? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3487.573s">So</a>  this portion of the property, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3491.631s">the</a>  fueling station on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3492.412s">We</a>  have a select handful of pole-mounted lights, like I mentioned at the opening in my summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3499.859s">They</a>  are LED lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3501.761s">They</a>  are shielded, and the LED allows us to directionally control where the illumination is going to go, as opposed to the old metal halide ones, which are just basically a halo of lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3511.681s">The</a>  canopy has lighting, as you'd expect, for your customary fueling position, similar to the one across the street, except the lighting under here, again, LED and directional, so it's immediately downward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3522.928s">The</a>  lighting levels that we are calculating in front of the plan, which, again, would be impossible to see on the plan that we have provided, show customary and appropriate lighting levels underneath the canopy itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3534.636s">You</a>  can't see it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3539.72s">They</a>  transition out very, very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3541.892s">and</a>  I begin to go to parking lot level lighting very, very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3545.995s">We</a>  have lights, if you can follow my hand, we have individual pole-mounted lights in this corner, a pole-mounted light there behind the canopy, a new pole-mounted light in that island to illuminate the driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3559.526s">The</a>  lighting levels transition very, very quickly down to, you know, less than a couple of tenths. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3567.233s">Foot</a>  candles, as it's measured and calculated on the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3570.115s">So</a>  in terms of impact to the neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3571.994s">It's</a>  no different, in fact, better than what the parking lot lighting is there today, where there's a handful of very, very tall quads or two lights on a tall pole that just don't have any direction or shielding, whereas we have that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3587.787s">And</a>  it's tucked kind of internally, and all the lights are forward throw and face interior, the shield isn't cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3594.152s">So</a>  in terms of your question directly about impacts to the neighborhood, I'd suggest this plan is a substantial improvement over the lighting condition that exists out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3602.014s">It's</a>  a much more modernized and directional lighting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3605.536s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3606.837s">What</a>  about signage? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3608.778s">So</a>  signage, the existing sign that's on that corner that folks are familiar with now, that sign is going to remain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3615.762s">And</a>  it just gets rebranded to acknowledge the fact that there's a cast offering here today, or will be.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3621.625s">So</a>  you're going to add an internally illuminated sign?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3625.267s">I</a>  believe the sign is internally illuminated today.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3627.93s">But</a>  you're going to add an additional sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3630.331s">No,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3630.851s">No,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3631.251s">The</a>  sign itself changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3632.491s">We're</a>  just taking the panel out, rebranding the sign so that it's reflective of the current BJ's gas branding.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3637.973s">So</a>  you're going to have the one BJ sign, and then you're going to replace it with a BJ and gas sign in one sign?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3647.776s">The</a>  structure itself remains the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3652.137s">I'm</a>  over-explaining this, but just so we're all clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3655.478s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3655.798s">You're</a>  just putting a new picture in the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3657.279s">Putting</a>  a new picture in the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3658.92s">That's</a>  probably well articulated.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3661.401s">And</a>  what about, you're going to have a canopy around the station?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3665.023s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3665.443s">There</a>  is a covered canopy over the station.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3669.185s">And</a>  is any illumination associated with that canopy?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3672.187s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3672.467s">That's</a>  what I was describing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3674.488s">There</a>  are lights underneath the canopy that throw light downward onto the fueling positions.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3679.371s">What</a>  about on the exterior of the canopy? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3682.312s">Anything</a>  that's lit up on the exterior?</p>

    <p>[Torner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3684.244s">There's</a>  branding on the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3685.965s">There's</a>  on the two corners here that show in the BJ's gas canopy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3689.286s">Those</a>  are not, they're not illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3691.347s">I</a>  think there may be internal illumination.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3695.949s">BJ's</a>  gas Councilor Marks on a facade of the canopy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3700.332s">We</a>  haven't yet determined which facade it would be, but I understand your concern in terms of having it facing the neighbors in that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3707.695s">And</a>  we're happy to not have that face the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3710.796s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3711.437s">So</a>  what about, okay, that's, well, that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3714.602s">additional</a>  sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3716.303s">It's</a>  additional lighting that wasn't mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3719.884s">I</a>  just want to lay everything on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3721.504s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3721.924s">So</a>  there's no surprises. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3723.185s">And</a>  I want to be what about gas prices? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3725.045s">Are</a>  you not going to say what your prices are?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3726.886s">No,</a>  we have to display the price per state law, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3729.107s">So</a>  we will put we will apply for a permit, whatever process there is in town to modify our existing pylon sign in Austin. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3737.409s">Help</a>  me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3737.809s">Where</a>  is it exactly right there? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3738.97s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3740.11s">To</a>  have our BJ's panel be replaced with <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3744.628s">a</a>  smaller version of BJ's Wholesale Pub Panel, followed by BJ's Gas, and then LED reader boards that will display the pricing, similar to what you see across the street with our neighbors, if you are all familiar with that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3758.155s">Right,</a>  so that's not what we just heard from this gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3762.197s">He</a>  said they were replacing the existing sign within the frame of that sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3766.119s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3767.039s">And</a>  I'm sure you can't fit your pricing in there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3770.581s">Yes,</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3771.601s">So</a>  you're gonna take that existing sign, you're gonna have the BJ's logo, you're gonna have the new station saying gas or whatever it is, and then you're gonna have your illuminated prices for your regular unleaded, high test unleaded, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3786.729s">That's</a>  all gonna fit in the same sign.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3788.65s">That's</a>  correct, yes.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3792.812s">And</a>  you're not gonna expand the square footage?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3796.554s">I</a>  don't believe we've submitted that information, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3800.763s">There's</a>  no intent to change the surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3804.565s">It's</a>  the picture in the frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3805.765s">The</a>  frame inside is not changed.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3809.426s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3811.647s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3812.307s">In</a>  regards to the emissions of odor from the gas, how are you addressing that?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3822.271s">There</a>  will be no emissions from the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3825.933s">I</a>  can have our petroleum engineer speak to that in more detail if you'd like, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3829.87s">Modern</a>  cars have vapor recovery systems, as does the tanker, which dispenses the fuel to suck the fumes from the space where fuel is being dispensed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3840.972s">So</a>  there's little, if any, vapors that emit because of those two systems, which are, Jim, help me out, state requirement, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3848.314s">State</a>  requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3850.414s">Stage</a>  two vapor recovery? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3852.555s">Stage</a>  one, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3854.015s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3856.256s">So</a>  what happens when someone overfills <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3859.269s">it</a>  leaks onto the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3860.309s">Are</a>  there any vapors that are emitted from that?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3863.39s">Of</a>  course there are, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3864.73s">I</a>  wouldn't tell you that there aren't spills at gas stations, but we have a comprehensive... How often does that happen?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3871.292s">I'll</a>  be honest with you, it happens with me all the time.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3873.292s">Does</a>  it?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3874.113s">All</a>  the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3874.673s">I</a>  try not to, but it happens.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3877.113s">I</a>  understand your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3879.774s">I</a>  couldn't tell you exactly how many times it happens at our stations, sir, but I can tell you that we have a comprehensive plan, a spill management plan that I'm also happy to submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3888.143s">as</a>  well that shows how we handle that, what we do, and how we contain a spill, whether it be a large one or a small one, it's just different classifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3896.61s">So</a>  we've tried to think of everything as much as we can.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3900.313s">Is</a>  this self-serve or full-serve or both? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3903.636s">Self-serve.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3904.616s">Self-serve.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3905.077s">So</a>  you will not have any type of attendant on that property?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3908.499s">That</a>  is not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3909.36s">We</a>  will have an attendant who will man the kiosk, which is this <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3914.69s">box</a>  here in the center, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3916.811s">And</a>  that person will switch on or engage the pumps once they've determined that a patron or a member would like to purchase fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3925.233s">And</a>  you plan on selling anything within that little kiosk that this attendant will be there? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3929.875s">The</a>  only thing we sell in the gas station is diesel, regular gasoline, high test gasoline, and memberships. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3937.117s">If</a>  someone wants to renew their membership or buy a membership because they don't have one, that's also possible out of the kiosk.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3943.388s">And</a>  is this only available to BJ's members or can anyone from the public use that?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3947.689s">No,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3948.189s">Members</a>  only. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3949.19s">So</a>  this is a members only gas station? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3950.99s">It</a>  is a members only gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3952.451s">As</a>  I mentioned in my initial speech to you all, it's a benefit for our members and it adds value to our members. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3958.952s">So</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3959.993s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3961.253s">So</a>  why does a company like Stop and Shop provide a discount for their Stop and Shop customers, but also allow you to purchase gas there as well with no discount? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3972.625s">just</a>  so you don't stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3975.146s">And</a>  yours is just an exclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3977.188s">So</a>  it's only for BJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3978.748s">So</a>  if I'm driving there and I'm running out of gas, I can't use your gas.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3982.591s">You</a>  would have to purchase a membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3984.612s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3986.233s">And</a>  how does that benefit the neighborhood and the community?</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3989.674s">Oh,</a>  folks are members. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3990.715s">We</a>  certainly hope they would come frequent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3992.816s">As</a>  we know that there are lots of folks in Medford who are members.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=3996.598s">And</a>  those of us that are not members, we're not welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4000.26s">We</a>  want to make you a member, sir.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4011.003s">I</a>  see the value if I'm a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4012.583s">I</a>  don't see a value if I'm not a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4014.845s">And</a>  that's, I think, something that your corporate office should really look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4020.948s">So</a>  regarding the- Okay, Mr., I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4026.511s">One</a>  other community benefit, if you'd like to speak to them specifically, is that the station can operate <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4031.408s">24-7,</a>  365, in terms of an emergency situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4035.791s">So</a>  if we were to have another super storm, Sandy, or Hurricane Irene, or something like that, our station has generated capacity to be able to run and fuel your fire trucks and fuel your emergency responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4047.237s">And</a>  we've done that elsewhere in New Jersey. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4049.839s">I</a>  can show you the photos of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4052.32s">And</a>  that's a significant benefit that those first responders were happy to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4056.502s">And</a>  of course, this community would also benefit from it, as do all of the communities that we serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4061.497s">So</a>  I didn't mean to interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4062.458s">Do</a>  we have a membership requirement in that circumstance? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4065.62s">That's</a>  a very funny question, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4068.022s">We'll</a>  waive that then. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4068.843s">We'll</a>  waive it that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4070.904s">I'm</a>  sorry to count so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4071.845s">Please</a>  continue.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4073.066s">No,</a>  that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4075.608s">During</a>  the testimony at one of the public hearings, an outside expert came in regarding the report for traffic engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4088.737s">And</a>  they mentioned in their report <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4091.428s">that</a>  they predicted the traffic impacts have been underestimated by your traffic expert.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4098.592s">Can</a>  you speak to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4099.913s">I</a>  have our traffic engineer who I'm happy to have address those concerns, but they were all addressed thoroughly to the satisfaction of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4107.198s">But</a>  if you'd like, I could have him come up and speak about those things.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4110.48s">Well,</a>  I'd like to hear, you know, I realized there's two experts and one saying one thing, one saying another thing.</p>

    <p>[Netriba]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4118.892s">I'm</a>  not a traffic engineer, sir, nor do I pretend to be one, so I'm happy to have Sean come up and give you a brief summary of the Community Development Board's findings, the mitigation, and it was all done to the satisfaction of the city's traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4132.54s">Sean,</a>  you're up.</p>

    <p>[Kelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4136.363s">Thank</a>  you, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4137.183s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4137.503s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Kelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4138.984s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President and members of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4140.985s">Sean</a>  Kelly with Manassas Associates of Traffic Engineers in the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4144.428s">As</a>  was pointed out, we went through a lengthy review of our traffic impact assessment during the <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4149.185s">community</a>  development board process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4151.986s">We</a>  worked with the city traffic engineer, Todd Blake, and we conducted what we feel was a very significant comprehensive study. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4159.01s">We</a>  looked at over 11 intersections in and around the site in terms of traffic operations, how they are today, what they'll be in the future, the economy for growth and traffic, both associated with the project as well as independent of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4171.396s">We</a>  looked at safety characteristics. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4172.977s">We</a>  looked at the traffic generation for the project, what that impact was. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4176.55s">And</a>  I think the point of concern that was raised by the opponent, the gas station across the street, who they were representing at the time, was that we've relied on some industry data published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4189.054s">And</a>  the ITE provides data for a number of land use codes, including gas station service station. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4195.956s">Their</a>  concern was that because it was a BJ's facility, because there's a discounted gas, that that data may not be valid. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4201.857s">And</a>  in fact, it might underestimate the number of trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4204.885s">We</a>  felt that, quite frankly, there's also another argument that that data could actually overstate the trips in the sense that the data that was collected to formulate those equations and rates, including gas stations that sold cigarettes, that sold milk, that sold lottery, that sold the newspaper in the morning, that had the reason you would stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4223.391s">Some</a>  of them had a service garage where you could go and get your oil changed or your inspection sticker done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4228.393s">And</a>  we don't provide any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4230.154s">All</a>  we sell here, as was pointed out, is these gasoline products and then also memberships <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4234.642s">if</a>  you need a membership to purchase the gasoline. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4237.343s">We</a>  recognize the concern and we certainly wanted to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4239.783s">And</a>  again, this was a concern raised by the opposition, not by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4243.044s">So</a>  what we did is we went out and counted an actual operational B-Days facility in Redding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4249.605s">We</a>  felt this was a, I'm sorry, Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4251.565s">This</a>  was a similar site. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4253.846s">It</a>  was located approximate to a residential area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4257.427s">Demographics</a>  were similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4258.987s">And</a>  what the data showed was that the ITE data that we had utilized in the morning actually <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4265.16s">overstated</a>  the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4266.08s">It</a>  was about double what we saw in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4269.541s">In</a>  the evening, we were almost dead on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4271.241s">I</a>  believe that we had projected about 85 customers, and the Stoneham data showed 87 customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4276.142s">So</a>  we were right in the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4277.623s">The</a>  only instance where the actual empirical data was a little bit higher was on a Saturday, where we had about 50 additional customers, about a customer a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4285.784s">We</a>  went through and did an exhaustive recalculation of all the impacts on that Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4289.625s">And</a>  what we found was that, quite frankly, even with that additional traffic, once you disperse across the hour and disperse <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4295.287s">different</a>  intersections, it didn't change the findings of our study. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4299.091s">But</a>  one of the, I think the most important things that came out of that whole exercise with respect to the traffic generation and what the impacts were is that we actually set up cameras in the store and tracked the vehicles to get a hand list. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4310.882s">Are</a>  people coming in just to get gas and then leaving and going back up to the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4314.006s">Are</a>  they doing this as part of another trip where they frequent in the wholesale part? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4318.51s">And</a>  what we found was that <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4320.4s">During</a>  all the periods that we evaluated, whether it was the morning, whether it was the evening commuter, whether it was a Saturday midday, anywhere from 45 up to 55% of the people that got gas did it in conjunction with a trip to the wholesale club. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4333.349s">So</a>  in other words, if you live on the other side of town, most people aren't getting in their car during the evening commute to drive through traffic and go to fuel up simply to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4342.035s">They're</a>  doing it as part of their trip to the wholesale club store. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4344.496s">It's</a>  a multi-purpose trip where they're doing their shopping at BJ's, and while they're there, they're fueling up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4350.606s">And</a>  then similarly, you know, typical with any gas station, you're also gonna get what we call pass-by trips, which are people in the neighborhood that live here, that drive Middlesex, that drive Fellows Way, they go by the site every day on their commute or other purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4363.676s">They</a>  need gas, they're members, they come in, they fuel up and they head back out and they continue home or continue to work wherever they may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4369.461s">So</a>  I think that, you know, the bottom line is that there were concerns raised, we took them seriously, we went out and did counts to verify the empirical, the IT industry data, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4378.834s">The</a>  data showed that the commuter peaks, the busiest hours, the morning and evening, the industry data and the empirical data job very well, and in some cases was conservative. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4387.941s">But</a>  the real point is that much of this traffic, you know, half of it is already, our customers are already going to BJ's to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4394.806s">And</a>  then out of that other half, you're gonna still get people that are in the area just driving these corridors for their other purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4399.91s">So,</a>  you know, we did understand the concerns, you know, we took a good look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4404.033s">I</a>  mean, we literally spent, I think thousands of dollars doing traffic counts, installing cameras, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4409.161s">to</a>  respond to this concern and quite frankly that the findings that we had validated and verified our initial report and put to rest in our mind any concerns about the traffic generation such as that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4421.346s">I</a>  appreciate your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4422.787s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could just end my comments and I appreciate the council indulging me and I appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4430.9s">BJ's</a>  not taking exception to what I had to say, Mr. President, but much of this has been pent up over a number of years with the lack of attention by BJ's to this particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4445.291s">And,</a>  you know, it's great that they're at the table and they're willing to make some improvements, but they're also looking for approval from this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4453.958s">And</a>  it makes me wonder if <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4455.578s">BJ's</a>  would be at the table if that was not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4459.76s">The</a>  council's review of BJ's application for a gas storage and sale license may consider fire and safety hazards associated with the 64,000 gallons of fuel storage next to a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4474.846s">The</a>  council can also consider noise associated with the construction, increased trucking and car trips, and along with operational noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4484.073s">which</a>  we know will happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4486.435s">I</a>  just want to lay out my concerns regarding gasoline emissions, additional trucking, additional noise, additional car trips, fire and safety hazards associated with that amount of gasoline storage next to a neighborhood and the traffic impact on area residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=4505.988s">And</a>  I appreciate everyone indulging me while I made my comments.</p>
