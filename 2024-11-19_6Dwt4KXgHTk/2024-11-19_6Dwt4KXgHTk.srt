[SPEAKER_09]: No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means.

21
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:57,385
[SPEAKER_09]: In the event that we're able to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the city of Medford or community media website, an audio or video recording transcript, a rather comprehensive recording of the proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.

22
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:01,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

23
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:12,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, if we could, Mr. President, I realized that we have been reading the governor's order since March of 2020.

24
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:23,476
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would ask that we send this to our city solicitor regarding language that states no in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted.

25
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:36,566
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not, right now what we follow, Mr. President, as you know, we received from our local board of health, the approval of having in-person attendance.

26
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:42,068
[SPEAKER_13]: We follow all the local board of health guidelines, as well as the CDC guidelines.

27
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:48,550
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask that this be sent to our city solicitor for a potential update, Mr. President, on that language.

28
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

29
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

30
00:02:53,615 --> 00:03:02,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we start, our Board of Health Director is not able to attend this evening, so she did send me a brief report.

31
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:08,499
[SPEAKER_09]: So since we've had, since 4-1, we've had 160 cases.

32
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,660
[SPEAKER_09]: The majority of those cases are 111 are under 40 years of old.

33
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,185
[SPEAKER_09]: As she states, this is not a time to let our guard down.

34
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:24,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Mask wearing and testing are still extremely important.

35
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:33,901
[SPEAKER_09]: All 16 year olds plus are eligible as of Monday and should preregister now on the state website.

36
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:46,211
[SPEAKER_09]: We were scheduled to do 50 homebound with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine this week, but they were put on hold due to the feds holding it for more investigation.

37
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:49,913
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be in touch with those people to reschedule as soon as possible.

38
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:53,816
[SPEAKER_09]: We look forward to seeing Marianne.

39
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:54,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, excuse me.

40
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:01,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Our largest 46 cases are between the ages of 20 and 29.

41
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:10,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So it seems to be that the bulk of the cases are coming in from the younger people who are getting out and being a little homebound.

42
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:12,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll have an update again next week.

43
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:13,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

44
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:14,367
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

45
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:20,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Hearings 2-1-3-0-1, City of Medford public hearing.

46
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:30,627
[SPEAKER_09]: A public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council via Zoom remote video conferencing on Tuesday evening, April 13th, 2021 at 7 o'clock p.m.

47
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:40,477
[SPEAKER_09]: on a petition from BJ's Social Club under the provisions of chapter 148, section 13 of the general laws of Massachusetts for a flammable storage license to

48
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we lost the council chambers.

49
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:32,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

50
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:40,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the council chambers are muted.

51
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:45,571
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't hear, we missed part of the intro and now we can't hear anything.

52
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:49,993
[SPEAKER_09]: The council chambers are muted.

53
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:52,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we can hear now.

54
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:53,655
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear now.

55
00:05:53,695 --> 00:06:00,619
[SPEAKER_03]: We did, the people dialed in on Zoom did miss a large part of the intro.

56
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:07,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and, excuse me, name and address of the record and... Pat, can you put the mic on?

57
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:08,733
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

58
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Mr. President and members of the council.

59
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:20,059
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, my name is attorney Mark Vaughn with the law firm of Riemer Braunstein here tonight representing BJ's.

60
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay for us to make a presentation?

61
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, you are in favor?

62
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:26,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you are in favor of this.

63
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:27,083
[SPEAKER_09]: In favor is the applicant.

64
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, we're good.

65
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:29,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anybody else in favor of this?

66
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:33,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Hearing and seeing none, we close this portion of the hearing.

67
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anybody here in opposition to this?

68
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:43,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody here in opposition?

69
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:45,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, hold on.

70
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:46,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I see somebody here.

71
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:51,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Jessica Wall?

72
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:56,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, good evening members of the council.

73
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,190
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Jessica Wall.

74
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,371
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an attorney at Anderson and Krieger in Boston.

75
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:03,447
[SPEAKER_12]: I filed a comment letter on behalf of a group of Wellington residents.

76
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:08,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to describe those concerns to the council tonight.

77
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:13,570
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe that there are some members of the community who would also like to speak as well.

78
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:14,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

79
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:15,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

80
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:17,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So you are not in favor of this?

81
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:17,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

82
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,672
[SPEAKER_12]: We are opposed to the project.

83
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:19,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

84
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:21,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else not in favor?

85
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:23,954
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

86
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:27,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Gentlemen.

87
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:30,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to make a presentation?

88
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:30,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

89
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:35,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, would you like to be my president?

90
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:37,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, could you please mark our vice president and vice president?

91
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:39,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

92
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening again, Mr. President, members of the council.

93
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:54,087
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, attorney Mark Vaughn with the law firm of Riemer and Braunstein based in Burlington, and pleased to be before you in connection with the application representing BJ's Wholesale Club, the property at 278

94
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Middlesex Avenue.

95
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:01,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have operated a club store location here for many, many years.

96
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:06,178
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually the first store in the entire BJ's franchise.

97
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:11,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you're aware of that, but their first store that they ever opened as a company.

98
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:16,647
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're very excited about the opportunity to provide a retail gas offering at this location.

99
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:20,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you're all familiar with the location, but we have it up here.

100
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a large site.

101
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:41,424
[SPEAKER_05]: It's approximately nine acres bounded by the Felsway and Middlesex Avenue and a large expansive parking area that sets itself up quite well for the proposed use and that the proposed fuel offering can be provided in the far corner of the property.

102
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:53,278
[SPEAKER_05]: every year, this is Middlesex Avenue, this is Belway, this would be where the proposed fuel station would be, well removed from the adjacent residential neighborhood.

103
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It allows for the customers to be able to access the gas station without impacting operations in the main parking field as well.

104
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:06,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So the gas station use is allowed by right under the existing industrial zone.

105
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:10,992
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it did require major project special permit review by the Community Development Board,

106
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:25,158
[SPEAKER_05]: We did go through a rather lengthy review process with the Community Development Board where all issues pertaining to traffic, landscaping, lighting, public safety, and all related issues were looked at exhaustively.

107
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:34,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So as part of that special permit review process, I know all departments of the city were involved in reviewing and provided comments as well to the CDB.

108
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:40,586
[SPEAKER_05]: who ultimately voted to grant the special permit by unanimous vote.

109
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was one abstention.

110
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:51,130
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of that process and review by the city departments, there were many improvements that were made to the design and conditions opposed accordingly.

111
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:58,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Austin Turner, who's with me, can walk through that in a moment if the board council would indulge us.

112
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:12,578
[SPEAKER_05]: we'd be making a variety of pedestrian safety, accessibility improvements, landscaping enhancements, sidewalk reconstruction, all features that were brought up in order to make some public benefit to that area.

113
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:19,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did submit today to the council a record of the copy of that CDB decision with some of that backup.

114
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:27,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know while the council did receive a favorable comment from the police department indicating no

115
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,587
[SPEAKER_05]: traffic impact anticipated.

116
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:41,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also note that the city's traffic engineer, Todd Blake, had reviewed the application as part of the CDB process and also indicated that all issues have been satisfactorily addressed.

117
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,525
[SPEAKER_05]: The project was also reviewed by the Conservation Commission.

118
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:59,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically speaking, we do have some wetland jurisdictional areas that are off locus, even though what we're proposing is all within existing paved surface over the property to the north, there are wetland resource areas.

119
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did trigger Conservation Commission review.

120
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:05,638
[SPEAKER_05]: that was reviewed thoroughly by that body as well.

121
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:14,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And notably, there's various drainage and stormwater upgrades that are being made here that resulted in them voting unanimously to approve it.

122
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:25,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a moment, I'd like to just introduce briefly Patrick Netriba, who was with BJ's real estate, and he can explain just I don't want to take any of his thunder away, but

123
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:29,879
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be something that they do at many of their clubs.

124
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,521
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an amenity for their customers.

125
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:35,665
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be limited to the members of BJ's.

126
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:41,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a membership only type of operation, which helps on traffic.

127
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's to provide a convenience for their existing customer base.

128
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:57,485
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's important to note that there's not going to be any vehicular mechanic or vehicle service, anything like that that goes on here.

129
00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:00,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It's strictly a retail petroleum sale.

130
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:04,666
[SPEAKER_05]: There wouldn't be a convenience store offering merchandise or things like that.

131
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:10,628
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a small kiosk that's on the property that is really just there with one attendant to be able to

132
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:16,050
[SPEAKER_05]: to transact business with someone if they are having difficulty operating or need to pay.

133
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So just one item I would like to mention before turning it over to Patrick.

134
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:30,176
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it was referenced that there was a letter prepared by an attorney representing some folks in the area there.

135
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:33,597
[SPEAKER_05]: We are very familiar with the items that were raised in that correspondence.

136
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:40,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, these issues were raised with the Conservation Commission as well as the Community Development Board

137
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:56,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know as part of that review, I believe those issues were thoroughly reviewed and addressed as they all fall within the criteria of the Community Development Board's review of the special permit application.

138
00:12:56,213 --> 00:13:04,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've tried to be very responsive throughout the process in terms of trying to address concerns and making sure that they were factored into the ultimate

139
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:05,710
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimate plan.

140
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:12,180
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I could, Mr. President, if I could maybe just ask Patrick Netriba to address the body, I would appreciate that.

141
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

142
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:13,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

143
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

144
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:17,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address on the record, please.

145
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:17,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, sure.

146
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:17,989
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.

147
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:19,390
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Patrick Netriba.

148
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,870
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm with BJ's Wholesale Club.

149
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Our address is 25 Research Drive in Westboro, Massachusetts.

150
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,372
[SPEAKER_14]: That's our home office.

151
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:27,973
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm the director of real estate for BJ's.

152
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:28,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your time.

153
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:29,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate it.

154
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:32,535
[SPEAKER_14]: As Mark alluded to, Medford's a real special club for us.

155
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:33,516
[SPEAKER_14]: It's club number one.

156
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:34,096
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.

157
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,536
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 37 years old.

158
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:38,378
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not too much younger than I am.

159
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,139
[SPEAKER_14]: But it started off in 1984 with an idea here in Medford.

160
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:43,400
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's something we're really proud of.

161
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:45,559
[SPEAKER_14]: We take a lot of pride in this community.

162
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,660
[SPEAKER_14]: It's our first one.

163
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,541
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a silver shovel in the home office, right?

164
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:51,102
[SPEAKER_14]: When you walk in and it says Medford, Massachusetts.

165
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:55,005
[SPEAKER_14]: So we value this club and we value our members as well.

166
00:13:55,025 --> 00:14:01,990
[SPEAKER_14]: As I'm sure you're all aware, BJ's members pay a fee to become part of the club.

167
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,991
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope some of you are members, maybe you are, maybe you aren't.

168
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,813
[SPEAKER_14]: But part of that is a value proposition that we offer.

169
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:11,936
[SPEAKER_14]: We offer great prices on milk or diapers or anything else that you want to buy.

170
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,306
[SPEAKER_14]: and including at most of our clubs, gasoline fuel is a big part of what we do and our members clamor for it.

171
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:27,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Hundreds of members over the years, many of which who I'm sure Medford residents, but some who are not, I'm sure as well have asked for gasoline.

172
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:28,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't we have gasoline in Medford?

173
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do I have to go to stone and why do I have to go to revere and good businesses?

174
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:37,141
[SPEAKER_14]: They listen to people, they listen to their customers, and that's why we're here before you tonight.

175
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:41,216
[SPEAKER_14]: because we want to do right by our members and keep servicing them.

176
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:43,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if we don't do that, we won't be in business for too long.

177
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,142
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that, I want to hand it off to Austin.

178
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,803
[SPEAKER_14]: He's going to give you a quick summary of the project.

179
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:49,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you.

180
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:50,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate your time tonight.

181
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:51,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

182
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:55,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

183
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:56,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

184
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:59,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council, Austin Turner with Bowler.

185
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:03,475
[SPEAKER_17]: I am the civil engineer, land development consultant for the project.

186
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:12,757
[SPEAKER_17]: What I'd like to do just briefly is give you a high level view of the project, some of the improvements that have been made to the collaboration with your team, and then we can open it up to any questions, thoughts you might have.

187
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:18,198
[SPEAKER_17]: So Patrick and Mr. Vaughn gave a very good introduction.

188
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:20,078
[SPEAKER_17]: This particular club,

189
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:35,457
[SPEAKER_17]: The fueling station is, as Mark pointed out, located kind of in that north-east quadrant of the property, which is strategically located in terms of proximity or lack of proximity to the neighborhood and kind of up against that road.

190
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:37,398
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's kind of its own isolated thing.

191
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,921
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also located in the portion of the property, frankly, is- Mr. President?

192
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:43,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

193
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:47,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any way the gentleman could maybe move up the sign and speak into the mic?

194
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:50,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't think people at home are going to be able to hear.

195
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:51,848
[SPEAKER_13]: at that distance.

196
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:52,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

197
00:15:54,029 --> 00:16:01,534
[SPEAKER_17]: This portion of the property, frankly, is substantially underutilized.

198
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:04,116
[SPEAKER_17]: It was an existing parking lot that was never used.

199
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:07,198
[SPEAKER_17]: As Patrick mentioned, this has been in the works for some time.

200
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:14,082
[SPEAKER_17]: There's been a strong desire, request, and interest to establish this offering for members, and so here we are.

201
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:20,667
[SPEAKER_17]: We went through an exhaustive review process with the Conservation Commission, with the Community Development Board,

202
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:28,110
[SPEAKER_17]: where, frankly, this project evolved pretty substantially, and for the better, honestly, as a result of that feedback.

203
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:35,653
[SPEAKER_17]: A number of items have been incorporated into the original design, which are summarized here, and I'll walk you through that very quickly.

204
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:40,115
[SPEAKER_17]: The Middlesex Ave out in front are maintaining the access in here.

205
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:48,379
[SPEAKER_17]: The fueling facility has been arranged in such a manner to really promote efficiency.

206
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,260
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a number of different fueling facilities,

207
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,546
[SPEAKER_17]: use what's called the tandem arrangement where they're back to back.

208
00:16:53,566 --> 00:17:00,631
[SPEAKER_17]: You've seen them in those quad packages, which they're not efficient because if one person takes the fuel position in front of you and the other one's open, you can't get around it.

209
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:02,332
[SPEAKER_17]: It creates stacking issues.

210
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:08,797
[SPEAKER_17]: This particular arrangement is set up where we have six islands and 12 fueling positions.

211
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:15,522
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can fuel on either side of the island, one way flow through that position where you would enter through the property here.

212
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,425
[SPEAKER_17]: You can come in and then filter through these positions here.

213
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:22,394
[SPEAKER_17]: and then out, take a left, and you come around.

214
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:30,636
[SPEAKER_17]: The traffic flow in that pattern was the subject of much discussion with the Community Development Board.

215
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:40,518
[SPEAKER_17]: This large landscape island that was added was at the direct request of the Community Development Board and through some collaborative efforts as part of the public hearing process.

216
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:49,420
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason it was included, they really wanted to reinforce this kind of counterclockwise position and not have vehicles who had exited the field position come back out

217
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:52,633
[SPEAKER_17]: coming through a full access driver that was located here.

218
00:17:53,273 --> 00:18:03,879
[SPEAKER_17]: As a result of that, we converted this to an in only to promote that circulation pattern, put this island in so it pulled vehicles further away and down to that existing curb cut in there.

219
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:10,582
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a substantial improvement from a traffic flow perspective and something that we focused on quite a bit with the community development for.

220
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:17,266
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing that's an important note here in terms of truck circulation, when a truck does enter off of Middlesex Avenue,

221
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:22,103
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a defined loading position that's been in place for 37 years at this facility.

222
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:23,123
[SPEAKER_17]: We are maintaining that.

223
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:27,625
[SPEAKER_17]: They come in here, there's signage, they come around the outer perimeter, and they go to the loading.

224
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:28,665
[SPEAKER_17]: That's staying.

225
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:32,326
[SPEAKER_17]: So a fueling truck that would come through here, it's gonna follow that same protocol.

226
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:38,528
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not gonna change anything about deliveries, how the trucks are routed to the property, anything access related to that regard.

227
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:43,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Staying on the access team, this driveway is quite wide.

228
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,551
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been that way forever since the inception of this property.

229
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:54,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Through our discussions with the CDB and the city's traffic consultant, this driveway became narrower.

230
00:18:54,438 --> 00:19:01,523
[SPEAKER_17]: We narrowed that curb radius to the point where we can still accommodate emergency response vehicles and also delivery vehicles, but it's become narrower.

231
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:03,525
[SPEAKER_17]: That's served two purposes.

232
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:08,849
[SPEAKER_17]: It controls traffic better, and also we're upgrading the accessibility in there.

233
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:14,354
[SPEAKER_17]: New sidewalk, new ADA accessibility, new tip downs, and a crosswalk.

234
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:15,815
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't exist today.

235
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:20,039
[SPEAKER_17]: The sidewalk along our frontage is being reconstructed.

236
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:29,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, sure, I'm sorry.

237
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:30,965
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't mean to block you out.

238
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:36,848
[SPEAKER_17]: And if the bald head is giving glare, then it's... No, all right.

239
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see if I can get this mic.

240
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,970
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

241
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:43,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, in terms of access,

242
00:19:44,997 --> 00:20:03,443
[SPEAKER_17]: On the Middlesex Corridor, and Sean Kelly from Vanossas here, if he can talk about this in additional detail if the council so desires, we have committed to, through feedback and the request of the city, as well as their traffic engineer, to working with MassDOT to implement bicycle lane striping along this corridor, nearly a mile of that.

243
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:10,037
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a substantial, substantial benefit, and something that was the subject of much discussion.

244
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:22,621
[SPEAKER_17]: It improves traffic flow along this corridor, but also adds bike lanes, which are in the city's master plan, and something that had been, the city had been, frankly, having trouble implementing because it's a pretty extensive undertaking.

245
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:33,180
[SPEAKER_17]: and didn't have the resources to do it, they saw this as an opportunity, and BJ's is agreeing to collaborate with the city and MassDOT to try and implement those improvements there.

246
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,703
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a pretty substantial upgrade, and it's a lot of work on BJ's behalf.

247
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,848
[SPEAKER_17]: The accessibility improvements on the Felsway, we're upgrading that as well.

248
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:50,574
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a crosswalk in there, striping, and sidewalk improvements in that immediate intersection that are also being upgraded as part of this project.

249
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Another item that was talked about was the lack of pedestrian accommodations to this facility.

250
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:03,817
[SPEAKER_17]: There really was none, despite the fact that there was sidewalk infrastructure along Middlesex Avenue.

251
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:16,704
[SPEAKER_17]: We're adding a sidewalk along the entire length of this property to the front door to allow people who may be in the community next to us, right in the general vicinity, to walk to the facility without having to drive.

252
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:18,965
[SPEAKER_17]: There was no sidewalk today.

253
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:19,846
[SPEAKER_17]: We incorporated that.

254
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,487
[SPEAKER_17]: That's part of our plans now.

255
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:30,712
[SPEAKER_17]: The landscaping here, particularly along Woodruff Avenue, wasn't doing so great.

256
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:36,016
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a large void in what was previously existing vegetation in that edge.

257
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:45,344
[SPEAKER_17]: This stretch along Woodruff Avenue, we're reinforcing that vegetation, new landscaping along that edge, and upgrading the fence to improve its condition.

258
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:47,046
[SPEAKER_17]: It had not aged very well.

259
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,890
[SPEAKER_17]: And then a number of different plantings inside

260
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:57,652
[SPEAKER_17]: the parking lot where there really were painted islands and things of that nature, that's being improved.

261
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,574
[SPEAKER_17]: That was also a request of the CDB.

262
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:06,120
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of stormwater and other improvements,

263
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,501
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a modern stormwater system here and extensively reviewed both by the conservation and by CDB.

264
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:14,562
[SPEAKER_17]: It includes mechanical treatment.

265
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:21,465
[SPEAKER_17]: It includes all of the modernizations of the stormwater system that didn't exist or previously was running off and going into that resource area that was offsite.

266
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:25,667
[SPEAKER_17]: That's been extensively reviewed and is being incorporated as part of this project.

267
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:33,290
[SPEAKER_17]: We're adding nearly 5,000 square feet of additional landscaping along the frontage and interior, where it was essentially asphalt.

268
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,452
[SPEAKER_17]: That's pretty substantial in its own right.

269
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:40,554
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of lighting, we do have new lighting on the property.

270
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:49,981
[SPEAKER_17]: It's modern, it's gonna be LED, it's gonna be shielded, it's gonna be cut off, and it's gonna be what you probably heard referred to as dark sky compliant, so it doesn't get that up glove.

271
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,683
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just forward-throwing, directional.

272
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,766
[SPEAKER_17]: The nice thing about LED is it's efficient, and you can really control how it gets illuminated on the property.

273
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:03,350
[SPEAKER_17]: The lighting design makes this part of the site appropriately lit,

274
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,250
[SPEAKER_17]: but not egregiously so.

275
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:12,495
[SPEAKER_17]: So you get even lighting levels, but it's not going to be halo or really, really bright.

276
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:29,248
[SPEAKER_17]: The fueling positions, we spent some extensive time with the Conservation Commission, put them on the outer edge of the property, keeping them out of that flow pattern and the internal circulation so the trucks aren't mingling with customers who are fueling.

277
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:31,330
[SPEAKER_17]: They're located right

278
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:38,416
[SPEAKER_17]: right here, and then a dedicated pull-off for a truck so we can maintain that navigable pattern around the property.

279
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:49,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Another item that we're incorporating here, and this was, again, some extensive discussion with CDB, we're implementing four electronic vehicle charging stations as part of this project.

280
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,822
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to be located generally in the front of the facility to promote their use.

281
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:55,303
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a big initiative that was discussed.

282
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:56,443
[SPEAKER_17]: It took some time.

283
00:23:56,663 --> 00:24:00,666
[SPEAKER_17]: That was part of the reason we were working through the CDB process.

284
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:06,609
[SPEAKER_17]: We had to get some commitments from folks to come here and join the property and work for that.

285
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:09,991
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're committed to providing those electronic vehicle charging stations.

286
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:16,635
[SPEAKER_17]: And then just in terms of this whole package, as I'd mentioned,

287
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:24,450
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important to just reinforce this process that we went through locally was incredibly valuable.

288
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:30,093
[SPEAKER_17]: The team that you have in the city spent a lot of time with us collaborating on this particular design.

289
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:35,736
[SPEAKER_17]: All the feedback we received, all those number of hearings that we went through made this project substantially improved.

290
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:38,578
[SPEAKER_17]: It's grown and evolved for the better.

291
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:40,279
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a very valuable process.

292
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,802
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope that the council sees that as well in terms of

293
00:24:46,226 --> 00:25:00,552
[SPEAKER_17]: the City Council or the Community Development Board worked extensively with us to generate this plan, and obviously by way of their unanimous vote, thought that we had done what they asked of us and listened to their feedback, incorporated essentially everything that they asked for.

294
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:11,236
[SPEAKER_17]: It took a while, it was a lot of work, but I think, frankly, the Board should be commended for spending a time in that commitment with us, because I know it was a lot of time and effort on their behalf.

295
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:13,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of it went to very, very late in the evening.

296
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:17,110
[SPEAKER_17]: With that, oh, I apologize.

297
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:24,676
[SPEAKER_17]: One thing I want to touch on too, the fueling system, which is obviously the subject of this discussion, is a brand new modernized fueling system.

298
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:36,426
[SPEAKER_17]: It has all of the current modernizations, protocols, safety mechanisms, all of the things that you'd expect from a modern fueling system is incorporated into this project.

299
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:42,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Jim Stewart is here tonight if you have specific questions on the technology and how the operation of that

300
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:45,060
[SPEAKER_17]: he'd be happy to answer any of those questions for you.

301
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,382
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a wicked smart fuel guy.

302
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:51,645
[SPEAKER_17]: So ask him all the things you need to feel comfortable about it.

303
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,287
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sure he's happy to answer those questions.

304
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:56,009
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've talked a lot with that.

305
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:59,392
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be happy to answer any questions or at your discretion.

306
00:25:59,913 --> 00:26:05,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, could we hear from attorney wall before we go into questions?

307
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,641
[SPEAKER_09]: No, excuse me.

308
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:34,249
[SPEAKER_03]: if this this is the council's uh portion of the time to ask questions and the public will get a chance after after the council's essay questions okay she was one of the people speaking against yeah uh councilor thank you mr president um yeah i just have a few questions um if the gentleman could share a little bit more about the landscaping improvements i know we have you know you can look at different

309
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,511
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of the city where they have quote-unquote landscaping, which is just a couple of dead bushes and an island.

310
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:42,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could talk more specifically to what that actually might be.

311
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:46,133
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be happy to, Mr. President.

312
00:26:47,513 --> 00:26:55,535
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we've done in the very front of the property, the parking lot essentially went right up against the sidewalk almost to the boundary.

313
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:57,215
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an asphalt parking lot.

314
00:26:57,815 --> 00:27:00,676
[SPEAKER_17]: We've pulled the development further interior to the property.

315
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:07,033
[SPEAKER_17]: we've incorporated about 3,000 square feet of landscaping immediately up against Middlesex Avenue.

316
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,455
[SPEAKER_17]: It includes a number of street trees.

317
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:14,881
[SPEAKER_17]: It includes a number of ground cover plantings in there and a lawn area.

318
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:21,688
[SPEAKER_17]: The ground cover plantings, we selected species at the request of the Conservation Commission.

319
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,112
[SPEAKER_17]: and they are buffer zone planting.

320
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:27,473
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's different species in there to help promote that buffer zone.

321
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:37,696
[SPEAKER_17]: So we worked with the commission to pick those specific species in there to help promote that buffer zone and enhance the buffer zone that really wasn't anything but a parking lot previously.

322
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:48,198
[SPEAKER_17]: As you work interior to the property, again, that large landscape island in the center of the property provided an immediate vehicular control.

323
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:57,101
[SPEAKER_17]: but equally as important afforded us the opportunity to incorporate four shade trees where none existed, a number of different ground plantings in there as well.

324
00:27:57,962 --> 00:28:09,294
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've incorporated ground plantings and shade trees along the interior of the property where the opportunity afforded us to do that, including up against the building where there are none.

325
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:10,215
[SPEAKER_17]: And

326
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:21,585
[SPEAKER_17]: most importantly, along Woodruff Avenue, shade trees there, and then a number of screening plantings to enhance that buffer that had long since disappeared.

327
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:23,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope that answers the question.

328
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:25,089
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, thank you.

329
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:27,231
[SPEAKER_03]: How many street trees do you know?

330
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:29,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold that thought.

331
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:35,579
[SPEAKER_17]: 14, as I

332
00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and inclusive, so I would understand the ones on the property would obviously be managed or by BJ's landscaping.

333
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:48,314
[SPEAKER_03]: For the street trees, would those also be managed by BJ's?

334
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:50,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

335
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:52,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

336
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:59,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I believe I read in the documents, the bike lanes, are they protected bike lanes or they are just painted bike lanes?

337
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,085
[SPEAKER_17]: they're going to be painted bike lanes.

338
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:04,226
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we've been talking about.

339
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:08,348
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're not going to be some physical barrier, if you will, between them, they're going to be striped.

340
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

341
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:15,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And you mentioned this just may have been a turn of phrase, but you said you're going to try and implement the bike lanes.

342
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:20,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that, you know, that's definitely a provision that you were working on, or this is something that's still being explored.

343
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:28,039
[SPEAKER_17]: So where, what was requested at the community development board, which we obviously agreed to was to work with MassDOT

344
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:30,083
[SPEAKER_17]: to implement this program.

345
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:32,044
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had initial discussions with MassDOT.

346
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:39,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Part of that process is continuing to evolve as these improvements are designed and coordinated.

347
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,772
[SPEAKER_17]: But what we've committed to is working with MassDOT to implement these improvements.

348
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:52,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, that's subject to their review and their technical review of the drawings, but that's a conversation that's happening and it's active and it's ongoing, and we haven't heard anything to the contrary yet.

349
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and just one final question.

350
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna make sure my other Councilors have plenty of time

351
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:09,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you mentioned what your customers are looking for as far as getting their gas through BJ's, but has there been any consideration to the fact that there are no less than four gas stations within a half a mile of this location already?

352
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:16,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly, yeah, and I don't think, you know, I'm not a BJ's employee.

353
00:30:16,287 --> 00:30:20,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick can speak to it if he wants to, but in terms of

354
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:24,897
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not looking at it as being another gas station amongst others.

355
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:28,818
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an offering for BJ's members who have asked for this thing.

356
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:32,800
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking at it as a product and an offering for BJ's club members.

357
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,760
[SPEAKER_17]: Consideration has been given to it, of course.

358
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,762
[SPEAKER_17]: And frankly, BJ's is making a very, very big financial commitment to implement this facility.

359
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:45,503
[SPEAKER_17]: They wouldn't be making it if they didn't think it was additive to both their facility and the community.

360
00:30:47,864 --> 00:30:48,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

361
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:50,385
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

362
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:52,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

363
00:30:53,797 --> 00:31:02,641
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could, and I apologize, before I couldn't get a good view, but could you just show me what the flow would be like going into the driveway for someone that wants to get gas?

364
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:03,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sir, of course.

365
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:13,426
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you'd come in off Middlesex, enter the property here, you'd have this entrance only, right here, this is the in only driveway, you can't exit the driveway.

366
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:21,930
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd make this move, and then you'd enter, you queue through the fueling position, and then you'd make a left once you were done, come all the way out over here,

367
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:25,876
[SPEAKER_17]: exit and then you'd come out, you could exit that way.

368
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:29,516
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have any concerns with queuing that way?

369
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:35,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, to me, it seems like you could kind of get into a bit of a log jam once you take that right to get in if you have multiple cars.

370
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:38,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not questioning, but just so I'm clear, when you say that way, you're referring to the entrance?

371
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:39,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

372
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you go into the area where you're going to get gas, so you come into the driveway, you take that right.

373
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there are a lot of pumps, which is great, but if you have, I mean, sometimes

374
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,610
[SPEAKER_10]: get a lot of customers, which I guess would be a good thing.

375
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:56,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I would imagine you'd get pretty jammed in there, no?

376
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:57,631
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, sir.

377
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:58,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a great question.

378
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:00,592
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's one that we spend a lot of time talking about.

379
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:01,972
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm happy to answer it.

380
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:07,773
[SPEAKER_17]: This distance that you see in here, that's kind of that entrance queue, right?

381
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:09,934
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't expect that that's going to be stacked up.

382
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:15,175
[SPEAKER_17]: There's sufficient room in there where you can have a vehicle in the pump in the queue, have two vehicles behind it.

383
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:18,397
[SPEAKER_17]: and not have queuing spilling out into that driveway.

384
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:24,400
[SPEAKER_17]: So your concern, I understand and appreciate, is backing up this lane so you're creating this traffic jam where people are not coming in and out.

385
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,562
[SPEAKER_17]: We set this up so that you can accommodate a number of vehicles in here.

386
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:31,583
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't expect that volume to be there at a given time.

387
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:34,685
[SPEAKER_17]: We have spent a lot of time analyzing it.

388
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,005
[SPEAKER_17]: BJ's operations look at these.

389
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:42,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Part of the reason we have this fueling system set up is it processes vehicles very efficiently through that queue.

390
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:49,239
[SPEAKER_17]: And it doesn't create that tandemized issue where you have two pumps that are stacked up and one's in the vehicles in front.

391
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,120
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't get to the one in front of it because you're waiting for them to go.

392
00:32:53,181 --> 00:33:00,283
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the reason we have the 12 fueling positions, we don't expect to be using those all the time, but it creates that efficient processing.

393
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:04,665
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the event you have 12 cars there, you can push them through very quickly and get them in and out.

394
00:33:04,865 --> 00:33:10,367
[SPEAKER_17]: And you don't expect, and you don't anticipate at all that those vehicles are going to queue back up into the engine driver.

395
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have that same kind of set up at your other locations?

396
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:13,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sir.

397
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:13,851
[SPEAKER_17]: You do?

398
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:14,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

399
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:15,612
[SPEAKER_17]: And you find it to be pretty successful?

400
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:16,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

401
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:22,234
[SPEAKER_17]: We wouldn't do it if you, you know, not to be facetious, but we wouldn't do it if it didn't work that way, yeah.

402
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:22,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

403
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:27,696
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, Mr. President, do we have anyone on the line from the administration that's answering questions?

404
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:29,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia?

405
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:32,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia?

406
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:32,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.

407
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:45,451
[SPEAKER_24]: staff, both the Conservation Commission and Community Development Board, so I'm able to speak to those hearings.

408
00:33:48,493 --> 00:34:02,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, my question will be, you know, when you take a look at the gas tanks that have, you know, proposed for BJs, how do they compare to the gas tanks across the street?

409
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they same size, same number of tanks?

410
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:05,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kind of curious.

411
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:16,871
[SPEAKER_24]: actually, you're the first person to ask this question, and we've never had a conversation with the owner across the street about what he has installed.

412
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:20,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have anything on file that we can look at?

413
00:34:22,156 --> 00:34:23,357
[SPEAKER_24]: I would have no idea.

414
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:26,579
[SPEAKER_24]: We would have to check with the building department to see if they do.

415
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,383
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, I'm curious about that.

416
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,165
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just, you know, I mean, to me, there's a lot of

417
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:37,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a gasoline expert.

418
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:40,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but I know there's a lot of gas in that area.

419
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:46,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you're talking, what, I think between the three tanks, there are like 60,000 gallons worth of gas?

420
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,539
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's 64,000.

421
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:49,539
64,000.

422
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I would imagine, if I'm correct, the gas station across the street is pretty sizable as well.

423
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what they have, but I would imagine it might be something similar.

424
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:03,863
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just curious as to what, you know, that gas station has across the street.

425
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:07,526
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know, but I mean, I'm not sure what are the gas stations in the community.

426
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:12,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure how they set up, but I mean, that's, to me, that's just kind of curious about that.

427
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:20,096
[SPEAKER_10]: With regard to gasoline, so I have questions regarding gasoline delivery.

428
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:23,559
[SPEAKER_10]: How often will this be, will you be getting gas deliveries?

429
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that something that you would be able to answer?

430
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:28,142
[SPEAKER_14]: can answer that question for you, Councilman.

431
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:33,525
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll expect to take a truck here approximately once per day to service the fueling station.

432
00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:34,886
[SPEAKER_10]: One time per day to fill up?

433
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:35,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Approximately, yes.

434
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:37,428
[SPEAKER_10]: And is that coming at a certain time?

435
00:35:37,848 --> 00:35:45,573
[SPEAKER_14]: No, the deliveries are scheduled on demand and controlled via computer based on the demand for gasoline.

436
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:49,435
[SPEAKER_14]: So we monitor that on demand based on our systems.

437
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:52,577
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we're low, we'll take a delivery at that point and schedule it.

438
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:59,005
[SPEAKER_14]: to work with the business operation to avoid peak travel times and what have you.

439
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:04,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's not at a certain time, is it going to be between certain hours?

440
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:06,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it be coming late at night or early in the morning?

441
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:15,251
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be scheduled at any time, but we try not to schedule it during our peak hours, you know, Saturday morning when people are shopping or Sunday for that matter.

442
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:19,852
[SPEAKER_14]: We do schedule sometimes in the evening or an overnight if possible.

443
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:20,893
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there,

444
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:25,861
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of my concerns would be, and we haven't heard from the neighbors yet.

445
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:28,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, could there be a gas delivery at five in the morning?

446
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:29,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that something that could happen?

447
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,345
[SPEAKER_14]: It could, yeah, yeah.

448
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:35,548
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a completely quiet operation at that rate.

449
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:38,430
[SPEAKER_14]: The truck would pull up and shut his engine off.

450
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,772
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the fuel is dispensed into the tanks via gravity.

451
00:36:41,812 --> 00:36:42,473
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no pump.

452
00:36:42,873 --> 00:36:45,775
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no whirring of an engine or a motor or what have you.

453
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:50,419
[SPEAKER_14]: It flows via a pipe or tube, if you will, into the tanks via gravity.

454
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,860
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd be hard pressed to hear it.

455
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:52,521
[SPEAKER_14]: You know.

456
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:56,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Are these large tanker trucks that are delivering the fuel?

457
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:57,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

458
00:36:57,945 --> 00:37:03,269
[SPEAKER_14]: In Massachusetts, the state regulation, Jim will correct me, 12,000 gallons, I believe is correct?

459
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:06,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Up to 12,000 gallons, yeah, which is industry standard.

460
00:37:08,272 --> 00:37:17,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just thinking with regard to the neighbors, you know, especially if you're going late at night, early in the morning, do these have diesel engines, these trucks?

461
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,940
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, diesel engines are usually louder, so.

462
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:26,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just like any other truck, they have a diesel engine, but when they pull up, they turn off their engine.

463
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:34,795
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no idling while the fuel tanker is dispensing its fuel from the tank of the truck into the tank in the ground.

464
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:37,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

465
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:40,837
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes sense.

466
00:37:40,937 --> 00:37:44,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to think of the impact it's going to have on the neighborhood.

467
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know, for me, if I lived in the neighborhood, I would have questions like this.

468
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:51,222
[SPEAKER_10]: how is it going to impact the residents?

469
00:37:51,282 --> 00:38:00,048
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so, you know, quality of life issue, noise, traffic, you know, these are all things that, you know, I have questions about.

470
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:03,670
[SPEAKER_10]: When I look at a project like that, that's why I ask these types of questions.

471
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:04,911
[SPEAKER_10]: It does have an impact.

472
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:10,435
[SPEAKER_10]: As minimal as you may think it seems, I'm not saying that you think it's minimal.

473
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:16,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people might think it's minimal, but if you live in the neighborhood, it's a concern.

474
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:18,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I'm asking these questions.

475
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:27,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a, so as far as the safety devices that are set up, I mean, I would imagine there's all kinds of safety devices within the pumps and whatnot.

476
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:30,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's a state-of-the-art system.

477
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:37,004
[SPEAKER_14]: We buy the absolute best system that we can because it's simply not worth taking any risk when it comes to fuel.

478
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:48,048
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can look at all of you and say that with conviction, that that's what we do because it just isn't worth the risk to be cheap on your piping, your tanks, your systems, your people, any of it.

479
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,413
[SPEAKER_10]: We buy the best that money can buy.

480
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:59,818
[SPEAKER_10]: With regard to the parking lot and the new plantings, which I think that's the vast improvement.

481
00:39:01,218 --> 00:39:08,123
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the complaints I received is that at times the lot can be dirty, trash.

482
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:13,066
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there a maintenance plan for that parking lot?

483
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:14,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Put it this way.

484
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:22,593
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just saying that I think the plant things on Woodruff and the Woodruff side, they were in tough shape.

485
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:26,796
[SPEAKER_10]: So to me, when I hear that, that means that maybe they haven't been maintained.

486
00:39:26,816 --> 00:39:32,020
[SPEAKER_10]: They have, you know, so therefore, you know, BJ's maybe hasn't been on the ball with regards to the maintenance.

487
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is there a maintenance plan in place where this is going to be, you know,

488
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:40,458
[SPEAKER_10]: maintained on a regular basis, cleaned on a regular basis.

489
00:39:40,518 --> 00:39:43,821
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if you're putting down mulch yearly, can you talk a little bit about that?

490
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:44,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, yeah.

491
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:47,984
[SPEAKER_14]: This club receives extra maintenance and has for quite some time.

492
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:58,332
[SPEAKER_14]: I think when we're talking about some of the plantings were in rough shape, particularly on Woodruff Avenue, maybe you've driven there, but some of the trees on the public side, not on BJ's property, have died over the years.

493
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:00,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know whether it's salt or whatever happens to be.

494
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:00,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

495
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:10,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

496
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:12,744
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

497
00:40:12,784 --> 00:40:14,845
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't hear if people aren't speaking into the microphone.

498
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:18,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I can illustrate what Austin was saying.

499
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:24,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the trees along this area we were discussing before that the vegetation was in rough shape.

500
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:34,396
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was a utility project that occurred in this area on wood, where some of the roots for the trees had been cut as a result of that utility work.

501
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:36,737
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's the reason why some of those trees have died.

502
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:44,045
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys can speak to that perhaps a little bit more, but our efforts to bolster the landscaping here are evident out of plan.

503
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:46,747
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to screen the neighbors as much as we can.

504
00:40:46,787 --> 00:40:51,450
[SPEAKER_14]: We understand, I understand, these people live here and I get that.

505
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I totally get that.

506
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,292
[SPEAKER_14]: This is their neighborhood.

507
00:40:56,593 --> 00:40:57,553
[SPEAKER_14]: This is their front yard.

508
00:40:57,813 --> 00:41:06,919
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have to be sensitive to that, which is why we've done the best that we can to push our facility to the far end of the lot, to screen as much as we can,

509
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:20,614
[SPEAKER_14]: to make this the best that we can for them, because it's... One information, Councilor Scott Belli.

510
00:41:20,894 --> 00:41:26,618
[SPEAKER_14]: As we're asking for this tonight, where has BJ's been for the past few years with those neighbors?

511
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:34,963
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure you've known that the fencing and those lines, those homes that have been abutted, there's been some concerns.

512
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:38,145
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's what Councilor Falco is leading to.

513
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:39,766
[SPEAKER_14]: It was nice.

514
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:41,407
[SPEAKER_14]: I started working there.

515
00:41:41,427 --> 00:41:43,208
[SPEAKER_14]: I was one of the first people that worked there when I was a kid.

516
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:53,574
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand the energy, and I loved your speech at the beginning, but as we moved on and BJ's grew, we kind of forgot about those neighbors.

517
00:41:54,034 --> 00:42:03,780
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're just, I think that's one of the things I'm concerned too, because if you look at that fence that goes along that area, if those neighbors live, you know, it was deplorable.

518
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the mess that goes there,

519
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:16,877
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I, I, I didn't see much until, you know, maybe this project's come to light, but I just hate to see, as we move forward with this and then this is forgotten.

520
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:25,440
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just, I think we need more assurance of what type of plan, if I, if Casa Falcos leading to the way you're going with the maintenance, because we didn't see it.

521
00:42:25,814 --> 00:42:26,854
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't seen in a long time.

522
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:29,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

523
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:30,195
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

524
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:30,995
[SPEAKER_14]: No worries.

525
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:31,975
[SPEAKER_14]: I can understand that.

526
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:35,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen, we've been there for 37 years and we're not perfect.

527
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:37,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

528
00:42:37,797 --> 00:42:38,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

529
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:41,418
[SPEAKER_14]: And I won't stand up here and tell you that we are perfect.

530
00:42:41,878 --> 00:42:46,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure we've made mistakes, but we do our best and our maintenance manager does his best.

531
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:54,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Even as recently as February, we had a maintenance project and I know that he, Sean, went around and put flyers in everyone's mailbox to try to

532
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:59,459
[SPEAKER_14]: try to do our best to notify folks of what we're doing, when we're doing it, and why we have to do it.

533
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:04,123
[SPEAKER_14]: So that being said, this club does receive an enhanced maintenance program.

534
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:06,344
[SPEAKER_14]: I can get to some more details on that if you'd like.

535
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:07,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to provide that.

536
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:11,208
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're committed to maintaining that standard and that level.

537
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:15,051
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm glad that you've noticed it's gotten better because we want to make it better.

538
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:21,536
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand that in years past, perhaps we haven't met that standard and haven't lived up to that.

539
00:43:21,736 --> 00:43:24,138
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can't change that, but what I can do

540
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:30,978
[SPEAKER_14]: looking forward for you and to say to you that we will do better and we will follow what we say we do here and now.

541
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:36,704
[SPEAKER_10]: So do you have a maintenance plan?

542
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:40,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there something in writing a maintenance plan that BJ's has for this parking lot?

543
00:43:41,528 --> 00:43:42,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we do.

544
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:43,650
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an internal document.

545
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:43,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

546
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:44,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

547
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:45,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that something you can send to us?

548
00:43:45,912 --> 00:43:48,113
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be nice to know.

549
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:51,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, like I said before, that's one of the complaints I get.

550
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:59,102
[SPEAKER_10]: I know when I'm walking through there, sometimes, you know, it looks like, you know, I'm not sure how often you have a street sweeper come through.

551
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:04,006
[SPEAKER_10]: But you mentioned, this is, I mean, for some people, this is their front yard.

552
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're literally looking at this all the time.

553
00:44:07,368 --> 00:44:10,091
[SPEAKER_10]: So therefore, you know what, it should be clean all the time.

554
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:10,651
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way I look

555
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:20,160
[SPEAKER_14]: summarize what we do and when we do it so that you can review that.

556
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:20,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough?

557
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:21,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

558
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:23,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

559
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:24,282
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

560
00:44:24,322 --> 00:44:24,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

561
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:30,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

562
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:31,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

563
00:44:33,027 --> 00:44:35,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you for your presentation.

564
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:42,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank the CD board and the Conservation Commission members for what seemed to be some significant improvements since the start of the project.

565
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:47,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my questions may be better suited for Patrick from BJ's.

566
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry to walk away on you there.

567
00:44:54,156 --> 00:44:55,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Patrick.

568
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:59,358
[SPEAKER_04]: My first question is, how long do you expect this station to be operational?

569
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:01,779
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 10 years, 20 years?

570
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:12,064
[SPEAKER_14]: The expected life term of the facility, I would anticipate it's at least 15 years, probably longer, something like that.

571
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:12,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's fair to say.

572
00:45:14,162 --> 00:45:20,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and do you have an expectation of the annual revenue that you're going to be gaining from this facility?

573
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:22,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

574
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:22,828
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

575
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think that would be helpful for us to understand as well.

576
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:33,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, I appreciate what you're saying about your customers, but I think you as a, as a business also have a vested interest.

577
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:37,558
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't be putting this forward if it wasn't going to, to make you money.

578
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:43,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the third piece of this that I want to ask about is, you know,

579
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:54,835
[SPEAKER_04]: If this project doesn't finally get final approval, would you commit to making some of the improvements around safety and environmental protection that are included in this plan?

580
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:58,537
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I want to make sure I understand your question properly.

581
00:45:58,557 --> 00:46:01,838
[SPEAKER_14]: You're saying if you do not approve the project, will I still provide the mitigation?

582
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:03,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Or some of it.

583
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:07,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it seems like currently we have runoff going into a stream, et cetera.

584
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:16,358
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that we could discuss, but we wouldn't be doing any work out on the parking lot if we weren't building the gas station.

585
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:19,000
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not sure if I completely follow you.

586
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,001
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just wondering.

587
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:32,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just, you know, it kind of goes to, I appreciate the comments from my fellow Councilors, Scarpelli and Falco, you know, about stewardship and, you know, being a member of the community, it seems like there are some ongoing issues.

588
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:38,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, you know,

589
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:50,019
[SPEAKER_04]: If, I guess, say there's a 15 year lifespan, what would the process be for removing the facility if it eventually closes?

590
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

591
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,400
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's a fair question.

592
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:59,582
[SPEAKER_14]: We will remove it when it reaches its end of its useful life or when we decide that it's no longer viable, one of those two things.

593
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:08,404
[SPEAKER_14]: And the facility will be decommissioned for state regulation and NFPA as far as the tanks and the underground storage piping lines.

594
00:47:08,865 --> 00:47:13,827
[SPEAKER_14]: and everything that has to be removed in the facility will be removed from the area.

595
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:16,749
[SPEAKER_14]: You wouldn't know it was there at that point.

596
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:18,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it, I appreciate that.

597
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:32,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I ask is just with the commitments from major automakers to move to electric vehicles and the expectation that fossil fuels are no longer going to be the main way that we power transportation going forward.

598
00:47:33,857 --> 00:47:37,439
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, this seems like a little bit of a short-term plan

599
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:46,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and not necessarily where we're going in the long term to be installing a gas station at this late stage in, in our energy transition.

600
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:50,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's why I bring that up, you know, in 15 years.

601
00:47:50,029 --> 00:48:00,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And is that, does do industry trends reflect what you expect the life of the station to be is 15 years based on the fact that, uh, vehicles are transitioning to electric.

602
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:17,580
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I wish I could predict the future, but as you'll note in our application and filing and plans, we actually have car chargers at this location because we see that as a potential and something that our members have asked for as well.

603
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:24,246
[SPEAKER_14]: So we certainly want to cater and service to them with an eye to the present as well as one to the future.

604
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:31,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you expect that that could be a potential future outcome as well, a conversion to some sort of electric charging station?

605
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:38,321
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say that all options are on the table, whether it be electric, hydrogen, or some kind of fuel cell.

606
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:40,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that those kind of things are certainly on the horizon.

607
00:48:42,104 --> 00:48:42,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

608
00:48:42,644 --> 00:48:44,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I appreciate the answer.

609
00:48:44,745 --> 00:48:50,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I share some of the concerns of my fellow Councilors, as well as some of these long-term concerns, and I would like to hear from the neighbors as well.

610
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:51,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

611
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:53,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knox.

612
00:48:56,592 --> 00:48:57,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

613
00:48:57,573 --> 00:49:02,556
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank my colleagues for their comments, and I want to thank BJ's

614
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,500
[SPEAKER_13]: for being present tonight.

615
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:13,562
[SPEAKER_13]: What I did hear at the outset, Mr. President, was that BJ's values their club and they value their members.

616
00:49:14,282 --> 00:49:18,763
[SPEAKER_13]: What I did not hear was that BJ's values the neighborhood.

617
00:49:19,983 --> 00:49:32,485
[SPEAKER_13]: And it may be because I live a couple of blocks over, Mr. President, that I could tell you firsthand the number of emails and phone calls I've received over the past

618
00:49:33,118 --> 00:49:35,599
[SPEAKER_13]: many years regarding BJs.

619
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:43,502
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's great to say that this is their first club, this is their flagship store, it receives extra maintenance.

620
00:49:45,523 --> 00:49:51,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, all you have to do is open your eyes and see that none of that is true.

621
00:49:52,825 --> 00:50:00,488
[SPEAKER_13]: All you have to do is go along Woodruff Ave and see the many breaks in the fence, year after year after year.

622
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:04,974
[SPEAKER_13]: and the debris from their parking lot blows out into the neighborhoods.

623
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:07,877
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just about three days ago.

624
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:25,812
[SPEAKER_13]: So if anyone went by there and looked at Woodruff Ave and said, what a nice clean area it is, it was my call to DPW, which happens two or three times a year, Mr. President, to Steve Penaglia, the head of our highway, that got that area once again cleaned up.

625
00:50:27,168 --> 00:50:31,732
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was our DPW that went out there that would cut down the debris and so forth.

626
00:50:32,673 --> 00:50:38,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, BJ's has done some improvements after many, many, many calls.

627
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,806
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've personally made them to the store managers over and over again, the district managers and so forth.

628
00:50:46,266 --> 00:50:50,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And they will eventually make some improvements, Mr. President.

629
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:59,726
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's clear to me, if you look at the lot, you look at the debris, you look at the fact that it is not a pedestrian-friendly business.

630
00:51:01,387 --> 00:51:10,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone right now that has to walk to BJ's, so if you're an area resident or neighbor and you wanna walk there, you're taking your life in your hands going through their lot.

631
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:14,192
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how dangerous it is, Mr. President.

632
00:51:14,812 --> 00:51:20,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why the Community Development Board made the recommendations they did, Mr. President, regarding circulation.

633
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:25,242
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't just for vehicular traffic, it was for pedestrians as well.

634
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:28,203
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how dangerous it is, Mr. President.

635
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:42,512
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember getting the calls over and over again, Mr. President, because the sweeping that they do in their parking lot, two, three in the morning, the sweeper would be out there.

636
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:47,355
[SPEAKER_13]: You can imagine the noise and the echoing of the noise in the neighborhood.

637
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:55,193
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't tell you how many times, how many calls I had to put out, Mr. President, in order to get BJs to act.

638
00:51:56,053 --> 00:52:00,575
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they stated they did something, and within three weeks, it's back again.

639
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,655
[SPEAKER_13]: The noise.

640
00:52:04,256 --> 00:52:12,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Idling trucks overnight, Mr. President, with the refrigerators, parked in the lot for hours and hours and hours, idling trucks.

641
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:20,270
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't until we brought BJ over and over again and asked them, what can they do about it?

642
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:23,092
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe they started locking their lot.

643
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:25,113
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they put a chain in the front back.

644
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:27,334
[SPEAKER_13]: They started locking their lot, Mr. President.

645
00:52:27,974 --> 00:52:32,596
[SPEAKER_13]: But still, at night, that lot remains open on many occasions.

646
00:52:34,642 --> 00:52:35,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Drag racing.

647
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:38,464
[SPEAKER_13]: You might say, how can you drag race on the back of the lot?

648
00:52:39,185 --> 00:52:50,311
[SPEAKER_13]: They start from the beginning of the lot on the Fellsway, Mr. President, where that little stretch of road runs along Woodruff into the parking lot, and they drag race inside there at night.

649
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:54,714
[SPEAKER_13]: These aren't made up stories.

650
00:52:54,994 --> 00:52:57,636
[SPEAKER_13]: These are what the neighbors have to put up with, Mr. President.

651
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,259
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, BJ's has not been a good neighbor, in my opinion.

652
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:05,550
[SPEAKER_13]: I've lived in the area 30 years.

653
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:08,512
[SPEAKER_13]: They have not been a good neighbor.

654
00:53:10,193 --> 00:53:12,795
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't believe they value the neighborhood, Mr. President.

655
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:15,776
[SPEAKER_13]: If this is their flagship store, shame on them.

656
00:53:16,117 --> 00:53:17,698
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd hate to see what the other stores look like.

657
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:29,265
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they mentioned about substantial improvement to the circulation, to the landscaping, to the lighting on their lot.

658
00:53:30,646 --> 00:53:32,727
[SPEAKER_13]: They haven't mentioned the concerns

659
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,430
[SPEAKER_13]: of the neighborhood, Mr. President.

660
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:42,873
[SPEAKER_13]: We heard that this new station is a great distance away from the homes.

661
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:51,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I challenge anyone to take a walk down there tonight, and we'll see what this great distance is from the homes.

662
00:53:53,177 --> 00:54:01,280
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see, Mr. President, the 64,000 gallons of flammable gas that's going to be in very close proximity to homes in that area.

663
00:54:01,684 --> 00:54:07,548
[SPEAKER_13]: and ask if you would like to live that close in that area, or anyone from BJs, if they'd like to live that close.

664
00:54:08,308 --> 00:54:10,270
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a secondary use for BJs.

665
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:15,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's great that they wanna take care of their members, that's great.

666
00:54:16,994 --> 00:54:18,475
[SPEAKER_13]: What else does the membership want?

667
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Where else can we put that lot?

668
00:54:20,496 --> 00:54:21,357
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a big lot.

669
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:30,983
[SPEAKER_13]: How else can we accommodate the membership of BJs and disregard the neighborhood?

670
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:35,033
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's exactly what we're doing here, Mr. President.

671
00:54:35,653 --> 00:54:46,762
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm not mistaken, BJ's approached the city council some many years ago for a license for gas storage on that property, and they were denied.

672
00:54:48,103 --> 00:54:51,726
[SPEAKER_13]: For many of the same reasons you're hearing here tonight, Mr. President.

673
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:57,731
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we heard about trucking, one truck a day.

674
00:54:58,512 --> 00:54:59,232
[SPEAKER_13]: That's for the gas.

675
00:54:59,272 --> 00:55:01,354
[SPEAKER_13]: That doesn't include their other operations.

676
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:05,033
[SPEAKER_13]: how many other trucks are coming in, 18 wheelers, and so forth.

677
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:06,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Operational noise.

678
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:11,335
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not putting this gas station for no reason.

679
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:15,816
[SPEAKER_13]: As the gentleman stated, I believe it's near Woburn BJ's.

680
00:55:16,176 --> 00:55:17,656
[SPEAKER_13]: People would like to have one closer.

681
00:55:19,157 --> 00:55:27,039
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll divert a lot of that traffic to Woburn, into Middlesex Ave, into the Felsway, into our neighborhood, Mr. President.

682
00:55:33,891 --> 00:55:34,932
[SPEAKER_13]: additional path trips.

683
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:36,393
[SPEAKER_13]: It was stated.

684
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:48,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I happened to have attended the Conservation Commission hearing on January 15th, and I spoke and represented what I believe the neighborhood concerns, and they did a good job as well.

685
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:54,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I also spoke at the September 16th Community Development Board meeting.

686
00:55:55,529 --> 00:56:01,154
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's not forget, Mr. President, we can thank the Community Development Board, the Conservation Commission,

687
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:05,667
[SPEAKER_13]: But guess who represents the neighbors in the neighborhood?

688
00:56:06,347 --> 00:56:08,288
[SPEAKER_13]: It's this Method City Council.

689
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:15,313
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're the ones, Mr. President, that feel the complaints, that hear the concerns.

690
00:56:23,618 --> 00:56:31,623
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Mr. President, what I would ask is for BJ's tonight to present to us

691
00:56:33,649 --> 00:56:40,015
[SPEAKER_13]: what the lighting impacts associated for this proposal on the residents.

692
00:56:40,456 --> 00:56:43,639
[SPEAKER_13]: What are the direct lighting impacts on the residents?

693
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:46,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to hear from them tonight, Mr. President.

694
00:56:47,062 --> 00:56:47,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you wanna answer that?

695
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:49,925
[SPEAKER_08]: On the lighting?

696
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:17,628
[SPEAKER_14]: before Austin gets into the plighting, Councilor Marks, I just wanted to address some of your concerns because we do hear you.

697
00:57:17,828 --> 00:57:23,072
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know you're a resident and I know you've worked with us over many years.

698
00:57:23,212 --> 00:57:27,416
[SPEAKER_14]: And like I said, we've made mistakes and I understand that and I get it.

699
00:57:28,877 --> 00:57:40,466
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't erase those things in the past, but what I can do is tell you here now that we will agree and commit to a certain level to make it better for you and for your neighbors, as I've outlined here, but I wanted to,

700
00:57:41,363 --> 00:57:51,367
[SPEAKER_14]: to not rebut your statements, but to acknowledge them, because I know that yours are heartfelt and our sympathies are with you on that to make it better.

701
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:52,167
[SPEAKER_14]: So, okay.

702
00:57:53,027 --> 00:57:55,028
[SPEAKER_14]: With that, Austin, we'll answer your question on the lighting.

703
00:57:55,368 --> 00:57:56,289
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate your comment.

704
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:03,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, Austin Turner with Polar.

705
00:58:05,012 --> 00:58:06,733
[SPEAKER_17]: So do you have a question about the lighting?

706
00:58:07,573 --> 00:58:10,434
[SPEAKER_17]: So this portion of the property,

707
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:12,372
[SPEAKER_17]: the fueling station on.

708
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:18,818
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a select handful of pole-mounted lights, like I mentioned at the opening in my summary.

709
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:20,800
[SPEAKER_17]: They are LED lights.

710
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:30,330
[SPEAKER_17]: They are shielded, and the LED allows us to directionally control where the illumination is going to go, as opposed to the old metal halide ones, which are just basically a halo of lighting.

711
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:41,848
[SPEAKER_17]: The canopy has lighting, as you'd expect, for your customary fueling position, similar to the one across the street, except the lighting under here, again, LED and directional, so it's immediately downward.

712
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:54,616
[SPEAKER_17]: The lighting levels that we are calculating in front of the plan, which, again, would be impossible to see on the plan that we have provided, show customary and appropriate lighting levels underneath the canopy itself.

713
00:58:54,636 --> 00:58:57,458
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't see it here.

714
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,561
[SPEAKER_17]: They transition out very, very quickly.

715
00:59:01,892 --> 00:59:04,975
[SPEAKER_17]: and I begin to go to parking lot level lighting very, very quickly.

716
00:59:05,995 --> 00:59:18,465
[SPEAKER_17]: We have lights, if you can follow my hand, we have individual pole-mounted lights in this corner, a pole-mounted light there behind the canopy, a new pole-mounted light in that island to illuminate the driveway.

717
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:26,572
[SPEAKER_17]: The lighting levels transition very, very quickly down to, you know, less than a couple of tenths.

718
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:29,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Foot candles, as it's measured and calculated on the plan.

719
00:59:30,115 --> 00:59:31,436
[SPEAKER_17]: So in terms of impact to the neighborhood,

720
00:59:31,994 --> 00:59:47,247
[SPEAKER_17]: It's no different, in fact, better than what the parking lot lighting is there today, where there's a handful of very, very tall quads or two lights on a tall pole that just don't have any direction or shielding, whereas we have that now.

721
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:53,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's tucked kind of internally, and all the lights are forward throw and face interior, the shield isn't cut off.

722
00:59:54,152 --> 01:00:00,898
[SPEAKER_17]: So in terms of your question directly about impacts to the neighborhood, I'd suggest this plan is a substantial improvement over the lighting condition that exists out there.

723
01:00:02,014 --> 01:00:05,116
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a much more modernized and directional lighting program.

724
01:00:05,536 --> 01:00:06,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

725
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:07,837
[SPEAKER_17]: What about signage?

726
01:00:08,778 --> 01:00:14,841
[SPEAKER_17]: So signage, the existing sign that's on that corner that folks are familiar with now, that sign is going to remain.

727
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:20,984
[SPEAKER_17]: And it just gets rebranded to acknowledge the fact that there's a cast offering here today, or will be.

728
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:24,586
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're going to add an internally illuminated sign?

729
01:00:25,267 --> 01:00:27,028
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe the sign is internally illuminated today.

730
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:30,011
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're going to add an additional sign?

731
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:30,711
[SPEAKER_13]: No, sir.

732
01:00:30,851 --> 01:00:31,211
[SPEAKER_17]: No, sir.

733
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:32,391
[SPEAKER_17]: The sign itself changes.

734
01:00:32,491 --> 01:00:37,953
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just taking the panel out, rebranding the sign so that it's reflective of the current BJ's gas branding.

735
01:00:37,973 --> 01:00:47,236
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're going to have the one BJ sign, and then you're going to replace it with a BJ and gas sign in one sign?

736
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:51,737
[SPEAKER_17]: The structure itself remains the same.

737
01:00:52,137 --> 01:00:54,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm over-explaining this, but just so we're all clear.

738
01:00:55,478 --> 01:00:55,758
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

739
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:57,239
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just putting a new picture in the picture.

740
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Putting a new picture in the picture.

741
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,241
[SPEAKER_17]: That's probably well articulated.

742
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:04,363
[SPEAKER_13]: And what about, you're going to have a canopy around the station?

743
01:01:05,023 --> 01:01:05,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

744
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:08,805
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a covered canopy over the station.

745
01:01:09,185 --> 01:01:11,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And is any illumination associated with that canopy?

746
01:01:12,187 --> 01:01:12,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

747
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:13,668
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I was describing.

748
01:01:14,488 --> 01:01:18,330
[SPEAKER_17]: There are lights underneath the canopy that throw light downward onto the fueling positions.

749
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:21,592
[SPEAKER_13]: What about on the exterior of the canopy?

750
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:23,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything that's lit up on the exterior?

751
01:01:24,244 --> 01:01:25,485
[SPEAKER_17]: There's branding on the sign.

752
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:29,246
[SPEAKER_17]: There's on the two corners here that show in the BJ's gas canopy.

753
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:31,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are not, they're not illuminated.

754
01:01:31,347 --> 01:01:32,828
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there may be internal illumination.

755
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:40,312
[SPEAKER_14]: BJ's gas Councilor Marks on a facade of the canopy.

756
01:01:40,332 --> 01:01:47,175
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't yet determined which facade it would be, but I understand your concern in terms of having it facing the neighbors in that situation.

757
01:01:47,695 --> 01:01:50,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're happy to not have that face the neighbors.

758
01:01:50,796 --> 01:01:51,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

759
01:01:51,437 --> 01:01:53,298
[SPEAKER_13]: So what about, okay, that's, well, that's,

760
01:01:54,602 --> 01:01:56,123
[SPEAKER_13]: additional sign.

761
01:01:56,303 --> 01:01:58,723
[SPEAKER_13]: It's additional lighting that wasn't mentioned.

762
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,364
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to lay everything on the table.

763
01:02:01,504 --> 01:02:01,904
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand.

764
01:02:01,924 --> 01:02:03,025
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's no surprises.

765
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:04,985
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to be what about gas prices?

766
01:02:05,045 --> 01:02:06,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you not going to say what your prices are?

767
01:02:06,886 --> 01:02:09,027
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we have to display the price per state law, sir.

768
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:17,389
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will put we will apply for a permit, whatever process there is in town to modify our existing pylon sign in Austin.

769
01:02:17,409 --> 01:02:17,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Help me out.

770
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:18,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is it exactly right there?

771
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:19,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

772
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,051
[SPEAKER_14]: To have our BJ's panel be replaced with

773
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:36,714
[SPEAKER_14]: a smaller version of BJ's Wholesale Pub Panel, followed by BJ's Gas, and then LED reader boards that will display the pricing, similar to what you see across the street with our neighbors, if you are all familiar with that.

774
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:40,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, so that's not what we just heard from this gentleman.

775
01:02:42,197 --> 01:02:46,079
[SPEAKER_13]: He said they were replacing the existing sign within the frame of that sign.

776
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:46,579
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

777
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,501
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure you can't fit your pricing in there as well.

778
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:51,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we can.

779
01:02:51,601 --> 01:03:06,689
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're gonna take that existing sign, you're gonna have the BJ's logo, you're gonna have the new station saying gas or whatever it is, and then you're gonna have your illuminated prices for your regular unleaded, high test unleaded, and so forth.

780
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:08,530
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all gonna fit in the same sign.

781
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:09,470
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct, yes.

782
01:03:12,812 --> 01:03:14,753
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're not gonna expand the square footage?

783
01:03:16,554 --> 01:03:20,136
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe we've submitted that information, yeah.

784
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:23,984
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no intent to change the surface.

785
01:03:24,565 --> 01:03:25,585
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the picture in the frame.

786
01:03:25,765 --> 01:03:29,206
[SPEAKER_14]: The frame inside is not changed.

787
01:03:29,426 --> 01:03:29,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

788
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:31,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

789
01:03:32,307 --> 01:03:41,251
[SPEAKER_13]: In regards to the emissions of odor from the gas, how are you addressing that?

790
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:45,232
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be no emissions from the station.

791
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:49,294
[SPEAKER_14]: I can have our petroleum engineer speak to that in more detail if you'd like, but

792
01:03:49,870 --> 01:04:00,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Modern cars have vapor recovery systems, as does the tanker, which dispenses the fuel to suck the fumes from the space where fuel is being dispensed.

793
01:04:00,972 --> 01:04:07,894
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's little, if any, vapors that emit because of those two systems, which are, Jim, help me out, state requirement, right?

794
01:04:08,314 --> 01:04:08,954
[SPEAKER_14]: State requirement.

795
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:11,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Stage two vapor recovery?

796
01:04:12,555 --> 01:04:13,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Stage one, thank you.

797
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:16,116
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

798
01:04:16,256 --> 01:04:18,136
[SPEAKER_13]: So what happens when someone overfills

799
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:20,289
[SPEAKER_13]: it leaks onto the ground.

800
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:23,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any vapors that are emitted from that?

801
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course there are, sir.

802
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:30,912
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't tell you that there aren't spills at gas stations, but we have a comprehensive... How often does that happen?

803
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:32,892
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be honest with you, it happens with me all the time.

804
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:33,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it?

805
01:04:34,113 --> 01:04:34,653
[SPEAKER_13]: All the time.

806
01:04:34,673 --> 01:04:36,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I try not to, but it happens.

807
01:04:37,113 --> 01:04:39,074
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand your position.

808
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:47,676
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't tell you exactly how many times it happens at our stations, sir, but I can tell you that we have a comprehensive plan, a spill management plan that I'm also happy to submit.

809
01:04:48,143 --> 01:04:56,410
[SPEAKER_14]: as well that shows how we handle that, what we do, and how we contain a spill, whether it be a large one or a small one, it's just different classifications.

810
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,672
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've tried to think of everything as much as we can.

811
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this self-serve or full-serve or both?

812
01:05:03,636 --> 01:05:04,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Self-serve.

813
01:05:04,616 --> 01:05:05,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Self-serve.

814
01:05:05,077 --> 01:05:08,139
[SPEAKER_13]: So you will not have any type of attendant on that property?

815
01:05:08,499 --> 01:05:09,240
[SPEAKER_14]: That is not correct.

816
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,904
[SPEAKER_14]: We will have an attendant who will man the kiosk, which is this

817
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:16,150
[SPEAKER_14]: box here in the center, sir.

818
01:05:16,811 --> 01:05:23,373
[SPEAKER_14]: And that person will switch on or engage the pumps once they've determined that a patron or a member would like to purchase fuel.

819
01:05:25,233 --> 01:05:29,655
[SPEAKER_14]: And you plan on selling anything within that little kiosk that this attendant will be there?

820
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:37,057
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing we sell in the gas station is diesel, regular gasoline, high test gasoline, and memberships.

821
01:05:37,117 --> 01:05:42,599
[SPEAKER_14]: If someone wants to renew their membership or buy a membership because they don't have one, that's also possible out of the kiosk.

822
01:05:43,388 --> 01:05:47,569
[SPEAKER_13]: And is this only available to BJ's members or can anyone from the public use that?

823
01:05:47,689 --> 01:05:48,049
[SPEAKER_14]: No, sir.

824
01:05:48,189 --> 01:05:48,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Members only.

825
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,910
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a members only gas station?

826
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:52,351
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a members only gas station.

827
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:58,932
[SPEAKER_14]: As I mentioned in my initial speech to you all, it's a benefit for our members and it adds value to our members.

828
01:05:58,952 --> 01:05:59,332
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes.

829
01:05:59,993 --> 01:06:01,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

830
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:12,036
[SPEAKER_13]: So why does a company like Stop and Shop provide a discount for their Stop and Shop customers, but also allow you to purchase gas there as well with no discount?

831
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,686
[SPEAKER_13]: just so you don't stop and shop.

832
01:06:15,146 --> 01:06:16,827
[SPEAKER_13]: And yours is just an exclusive.

833
01:06:17,188 --> 01:06:18,708
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's only for BJs.

834
01:06:18,748 --> 01:06:22,010
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I'm driving there and I'm running out of gas, I can't use your gas.

835
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,412
[SPEAKER_14]: You would have to purchase a membership.

836
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:25,552
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

837
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:28,994
[SPEAKER_13]: And how does that benefit the neighborhood and the community?

838
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:30,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, folks are members.

839
01:06:30,715 --> 01:06:32,656
[SPEAKER_14]: We certainly hope they would come frequent us.

840
01:06:32,816 --> 01:06:35,478
[SPEAKER_14]: As we know that there are lots of folks in Medford who are members.

841
01:06:36,598 --> 01:06:40,080
[SPEAKER_13]: And those of us that are not members, we're not welcome.

842
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,621
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to make you a member, sir.

843
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Frank, we're not welcome.

844
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:44,299
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't say that.

845
01:06:44,439 --> 01:06:45,700
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you're always welcome.

846
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:50,782
[SPEAKER_14]: And we hope that you'll see the value that we provide to the community, as many people have seen.

847
01:06:51,003 --> 01:06:52,543
[SPEAKER_13]: I see the value if I'm a member.

848
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see a value if I'm not a member.

849
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:59,087
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's, I think, something that your corporate office should really look into.

850
01:07:00,948 --> 01:07:06,371
[SPEAKER_13]: So regarding the- Okay, Mr., I'm sorry.

851
01:07:06,511 --> 01:07:10,853
[SPEAKER_14]: One other community benefit, if you'd like to speak to them specifically, is that the station can operate

852
01:07:11,408 --> 01:07:15,310
[SPEAKER_14]: 24-7, 365, in terms of an emergency situation.

853
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:26,737
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we were to have another super storm, Sandy, or Hurricane Irene, or something like that, our station has generated capacity to be able to run and fuel your fire trucks and fuel your emergency responders.

854
01:07:27,237 --> 01:07:29,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've done that elsewhere in New Jersey.

855
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I can show you the photos of it.

856
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:36,442
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a significant benefit that those first responders were happy to have.

857
01:07:36,502 --> 01:07:40,805
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, this community would also benefit from it, as do all of the communities that we serve.

858
01:07:41,497 --> 01:07:42,438
[SPEAKER_14]: So I didn't mean to interrupt.

859
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have a membership requirement in that circumstance?

860
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,101
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a very funny question, sir.

861
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:48,803
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll waive that then.

862
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:50,344
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll waive it that day.

863
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:51,825
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry to count so much.

864
01:07:51,845 --> 01:07:52,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Please continue.

865
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:53,646
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's all right.

866
01:07:55,608 --> 01:08:07,817
[SPEAKER_13]: During the testimony at one of the public hearings, an outside expert came in regarding the report for traffic engineering.

867
01:08:08,737 --> 01:08:10,759
[SPEAKER_13]: And they mentioned in their report

868
01:08:11,428 --> 01:08:18,112
[SPEAKER_13]: that they predicted the traffic impacts have been underestimated by your traffic expert.

869
01:08:18,592 --> 01:08:19,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you speak to that?

870
01:08:19,913 --> 01:08:27,178
[SPEAKER_14]: I have our traffic engineer who I'm happy to have address those concerns, but they were all addressed thoroughly to the satisfaction of the board.

871
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:30,119
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you'd like, I could have him come up and speak about those things.

872
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:37,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'd like to hear, you know, I realized there's two experts and one saying one thing, one saying another thing.

873
01:08:38,892 --> 01:08:51,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not a traffic engineer, sir, nor do I pretend to be one, so I'm happy to have Sean come up and give you a brief summary of the Community Development Board's findings, the mitigation, and it was all done to the satisfaction of the city's traffic engineer.

874
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:52,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Sean, you're up.

875
01:08:56,363 --> 01:08:56,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Patrick.

876
01:08:57,183 --> 01:08:57,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

877
01:08:57,503 --> 01:08:58,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, please.

878
01:08:58,984 --> 01:09:00,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mr. President and members of the Council.

879
01:09:00,985 --> 01:09:03,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Sean Kelly with Manassas Associates of Traffic Engineers in the project.

880
01:09:04,428 --> 01:09:08,390
[SPEAKER_15]: As was pointed out, we went through a lengthy review of our traffic impact assessment during the

881
01:09:09,185 --> 01:09:10,926
[SPEAKER_15]: community development board process.

882
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:18,470
[SPEAKER_15]: We worked with the city traffic engineer, Todd Blake, and we conducted what we feel was a very significant comprehensive study.

883
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:30,956
[SPEAKER_15]: We looked at over 11 intersections in and around the site in terms of traffic operations, how they are today, what they'll be in the future, the economy for growth and traffic, both associated with the project as well as independent of the project.

884
01:09:31,396 --> 01:09:32,856
[SPEAKER_15]: We looked at safety characteristics.

885
01:09:32,977 --> 01:09:35,858
[SPEAKER_15]: We looked at the traffic generation for the project, what that impact was.

886
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:48,714
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the point of concern that was raised by the opponent, the gas station across the street, who they were representing at the time, was that we've relied on some industry data published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

887
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:54,315
[SPEAKER_15]: And the ITE provides data for a number of land use codes, including gas station service station.

888
01:09:55,956 --> 01:10:01,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Their concern was that because it was a BJ's facility, because there's a discounted gas, that that data may not be valid.

889
01:10:01,857 --> 01:10:03,978
[SPEAKER_15]: And in fact, it might underestimate the number of trips.

890
01:10:04,885 --> 01:10:23,351
[SPEAKER_15]: We felt that, quite frankly, there's also another argument that that data could actually overstate the trips in the sense that the data that was collected to formulate those equations and rates, including gas stations that sold cigarettes, that sold milk, that sold lottery, that sold the newspaper in the morning, that had the reason you would stop there.

891
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:27,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them had a service garage where you could go and get your oil changed or your inspection sticker done.

892
01:10:28,393 --> 01:10:29,713
[SPEAKER_15]: And we don't provide any of that.

893
01:10:30,154 --> 01:10:34,155
[SPEAKER_15]: All we sell here, as was pointed out, is these gasoline products and then also memberships

894
01:10:34,642 --> 01:10:36,462
[SPEAKER_15]: if you need a membership to purchase the gasoline.

895
01:10:37,343 --> 01:10:39,763
[SPEAKER_15]: We recognize the concern and we certainly wanted to address it.

896
01:10:39,783 --> 01:10:42,504
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, this was a concern raised by the opposition, not by the city.

897
01:10:43,044 --> 01:10:48,765
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we did is we went out and counted an actual operational B-Days facility in Redding.

898
01:10:49,605 --> 01:10:51,505
[SPEAKER_15]: We felt this was a, I'm sorry, Stoneham.

899
01:10:51,565 --> 01:10:53,086
[SPEAKER_15]: This was a similar site.

900
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:57,187
[SPEAKER_15]: It was located approximate to a residential area.

901
01:10:57,427 --> 01:10:58,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Demographics were similar.

902
01:10:58,987 --> 01:11:04,348
[SPEAKER_15]: And what the data showed was that the ITE data that we had utilized in the morning actually

903
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,020
[SPEAKER_15]: overstated the traffic.

904
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,921
[SPEAKER_15]: It was about double what we saw in Stoneham.

905
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:11,041
[SPEAKER_15]: In the evening, we were almost dead on.

906
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:16,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe that we had projected about 85 customers, and the Stoneham data showed 87 customers.

907
01:11:16,142 --> 01:11:17,002
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were right in the money.

908
01:11:17,623 --> 01:11:25,124
[SPEAKER_15]: The only instance where the actual empirical data was a little bit higher was on a Saturday, where we had about 50 additional customers, about a customer a minute.

909
01:11:25,784 --> 01:11:29,605
[SPEAKER_15]: We went through and did an exhaustive recalculation of all the impacts on that Saturday.

910
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:34,966
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we found was that, quite frankly, even with that additional traffic, once you disperse across the hour and disperse

911
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:38,150
[SPEAKER_15]: different intersections, it didn't change the findings of our study.

912
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:50,042
[SPEAKER_15]: But one of the, I think the most important things that came out of that whole exercise with respect to the traffic generation and what the impacts were is that we actually set up cameras in the store and tracked the vehicles to get a hand list.

913
01:11:50,882 --> 01:11:53,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Are people coming in just to get gas and then leaving and going back up to the street?

914
01:11:54,006 --> 01:11:58,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they doing this as part of another trip where they frequent in the wholesale part?

915
01:11:58,510 --> 01:11:59,451
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we found was that

916
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:13,309
[SPEAKER_15]: During all the periods that we evaluated, whether it was the morning, whether it was the evening commuter, whether it was a Saturday midday, anywhere from 45 up to 55% of the people that got gas did it in conjunction with a trip to the wholesale club.

917
01:12:13,349 --> 01:12:21,534
[SPEAKER_15]: So in other words, if you live on the other side of town, most people aren't getting in their car during the evening commute to drive through traffic and go to fuel up simply to go home.

918
01:12:22,035 --> 01:12:24,476
[SPEAKER_15]: They're doing it as part of their trip to the wholesale club store.

919
01:12:24,496 --> 01:12:29,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a multi-purpose trip where they're doing their shopping at BJ's, and while they're there, they're fueling up.

920
01:12:30,606 --> 01:12:43,036
[SPEAKER_15]: And then similarly, you know, typical with any gas station, you're also gonna get what we call pass-by trips, which are people in the neighborhood that live here, that drive Middlesex, that drive Fellows Way, they go by the site every day on their commute or other purpose.

921
01:12:43,676 --> 01:12:49,421
[SPEAKER_15]: They need gas, they're members, they come in, they fuel up and they head back out and they continue home or continue to work wherever they may be.

922
01:12:49,461 --> 01:12:58,168
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that, you know, the bottom line is that there were concerns raised, we took them seriously, we went out and did counts to verify the empirical, the IT industry data,

923
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:07,641
[SPEAKER_15]: The data showed that the commuter peaks, the busiest hours, the morning and evening, the industry data and the empirical data job very well, and in some cases was conservative.

924
01:13:07,941 --> 01:13:14,246
[SPEAKER_15]: But the real point is that much of this traffic, you know, half of it is already, our customers are already going to BJ's to begin with.

925
01:13:14,806 --> 01:13:19,830
[SPEAKER_15]: And then out of that other half, you're gonna still get people that are in the area just driving these corridors for their other purposes.

926
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:23,953
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, we did understand the concerns, you know, we took a good look at it.

927
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:28,637
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we literally spent, I think thousands of dollars doing traffic counts, installing cameras,

928
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:39,445
[SPEAKER_15]: to respond to this concern and quite frankly that the findings that we had validated and verified our initial report and put to rest in our mind any concerns about the traffic generation such as that.

929
01:13:41,346 --> 01:13:42,427
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate your comments.

930
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:50,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, if I could just end my comments and I appreciate the council indulging me and I appreciate

931
01:13:50,900 --> 01:14:04,571
[SPEAKER_13]: BJ's not taking exception to what I had to say, Mr. President, but much of this has been pent up over a number of years with the lack of attention by BJ's to this particular neighborhood.

932
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:13,277
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, it's great that they're at the table and they're willing to make some improvements, but they're also looking for approval from this council.

933
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:15,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And it makes me wonder if

934
01:14:15,578 --> 01:14:18,379
[SPEAKER_13]: BJ's would be at the table if that was not the case.

935
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:34,145
[SPEAKER_13]: The council's review of BJ's application for a gas storage and sale license may consider fire and safety hazards associated with the 64,000 gallons of fuel storage next to a residential neighborhood.

936
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:43,589
[SPEAKER_13]: The council can also consider noise associated with the construction, increased trucking and car trips, and along with operational noise.

937
01:14:44,073 --> 01:14:45,914
[SPEAKER_13]: which we know will happen, Mr. President.

938
01:14:46,435 --> 01:15:05,308
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to lay out my concerns regarding gasoline emissions, additional trucking, additional noise, additional car trips, fire and safety hazards associated with that amount of gasoline storage next to a neighborhood and the traffic impact on area residents, Mr. President.

939
01:15:05,988 --> 01:15:10,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And I appreciate everyone indulging me while I made my comments.

940
01:15:10,692 --> 01:15:12,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

941
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:17,687
[SPEAKER_09]: How many gallons of gas do you plan on selling every day?

942
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,211
[SPEAKER_09]: How many do you have an average of what you're selling?

943
01:15:21,231 --> 01:15:21,871
[SPEAKER_09]: You're at the station?

944
01:15:23,413 --> 01:15:24,514
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have that information.

945
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:26,856
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm sorry.

946
01:15:26,896 --> 01:15:31,040
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a 64,000 tank gasoline there, and the truck can only bring 12,000 gallons.

947
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,325
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you start selling gas at a pretty good clip, you're going to need more than one truck every day.

948
01:15:37,455 --> 01:15:39,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, we expect about one truck a day.

949
01:15:39,496 --> 01:15:42,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're gonna need more than one truck because the truck you said the truck only holds 12,000 gallons.

950
01:15:43,098 --> 01:15:43,698
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct, sir.

951
01:15:43,879 --> 01:15:46,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you'll be probably getting more than one truck a day.

952
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's not I'm not agreeing.

953
01:15:49,101 --> 01:15:49,502
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

954
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:53,784
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, and I was so disappointed with the answer that you gave Councilor Bez.

955
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,486
[SPEAKER_09]: When he asked you if the framework wouldn't go through.

956
01:15:57,546 --> 01:16:04,530
[SPEAKER_09]: You said and you said that you made a point that if it wasn't for this gas station, you wouldn't be doing any work in the parking lot.

957
01:16:05,671 --> 01:16:06,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was a

958
01:16:06,807 --> 01:16:10,690
[SPEAKER_09]: And I gotta be honest with you, I'm a BJ's customer for probably 30 plus years.

959
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:11,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't go to that store.

960
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:13,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why, because it's dirty.

961
01:16:14,132 --> 01:16:15,553
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys don't spend any money in there.

962
01:16:16,274 --> 01:16:24,119
[SPEAKER_09]: And the few times I do go there, when I pull into the parking lot, I see car carriers in there, other trucks that you're allowed to park there.

963
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:29,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say, just like my other Councilor said, you guys have been there for many years and you haven't spent anything.

964
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:34,827
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm a little disappointed when you made that comment, the Councilor asked.

965
01:16:34,847 --> 01:16:35,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So what you're saying is,

966
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:40,591
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's no gas, we're not going to do anything here.

967
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:44,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you may have taken Mr. Netrieva's comment out of context.

968
01:16:44,873 --> 01:16:45,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's what he said.

969
01:16:45,773 --> 01:16:56,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think what he meant, what he was referring to was that if they weren't doing the project, I think you were talking about drainage upgrades and things of that nature, where the project locus is here.

970
01:16:56,738 --> 01:17:01,960
[SPEAKER_14]: You wouldn't be doing any work in the parking lot.

971
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me clarify the statement.

972
01:17:04,008 --> 01:17:11,655
[SPEAKER_14]: we certainly wouldn't be constructing any of the drainage improvements or other hardscape options that are related to the application.

973
01:17:12,196 --> 01:17:18,662
[SPEAKER_14]: But in terms of the maintenance items that you've brought forward, surely we strive to be better and to make ourselves better.

974
01:17:18,682 --> 01:17:28,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there are concerns about that, regardless of whether- These are things that should have been done years ago, as my other council stated, not just because you're looking for something from this tonight.

975
01:17:29,153 --> 01:17:34,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you mentioned that there's going to be a charging station for electric cars.

976
01:17:34,938 --> 01:17:36,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those going to be free?

977
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,121
[SPEAKER_14]: They will be open to the public, yes.

978
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:41,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they free or do they have to pay?

979
01:17:41,663 --> 01:17:48,749
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to have a membership to the vendor who's providing them and you can sign up for that.

980
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:54,714
[SPEAKER_14]: But they will offer the pricing for electric at the lowest available rate possible.

981
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:59,363
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not tied to the BJ's membership, answering your question.

982
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:03,287
[SPEAKER_09]: So the electric charging station is not tied to that, but the gas station is tied to that.

983
01:18:03,627 --> 01:18:03,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, sir.

984
01:18:04,969 --> 01:18:13,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me say, I don't go to that store because I go to the store, it's so much cleaner, parking lot's cleaner.

985
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:14,639
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, they're in a...

986
01:18:16,072 --> 01:18:21,395
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an apartment building right next door, but for some reason, you managed to maintain that property.

987
01:18:21,756 --> 01:18:27,359
[SPEAKER_09]: But as you said, this is your first store in the country, and you haven't spent anything on this property in years.

988
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:32,022
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite frankly, I'm a little disappointed that you haven't been a good neighbor for all these other people.

989
01:18:34,524 --> 01:18:35,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

990
01:18:35,804 --> 01:18:37,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

991
01:18:37,265 --> 01:18:40,507
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, I'd like to thank our applicants for being here this evening.

992
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:43,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they've done a wonderful job with their presentation.

993
01:18:43,429 --> 01:18:44,630
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been very thorough.

994
01:18:45,063 --> 01:18:49,445
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can certainly appreciate the work that they've put in over the months leading up to today.

995
01:18:51,926 --> 01:19:01,091
[SPEAKER_14]: In hearing the presentation, I understood that you said that you would be selling diesel gas there, but again, the gas would only be open to members.

996
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:09,615
[SPEAKER_14]: So you don't have any wholesale agreements with local trucking companies or local providers or anything like that, commercial industry that would be filling up there.

997
01:19:10,091 --> 01:19:13,034
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a BJ's membership, you can come use the station.

998
01:19:13,174 --> 01:19:23,402
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's not some sort of agreement with, you know, Akati Foods, who's right around the corner to say, you know, come fill up your trucks at our place and we'll give you the discount rate.

999
01:19:23,482 --> 01:19:27,426
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we primarily cater to families.

1000
01:19:28,006 --> 01:19:36,633
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't lie to you, there probably are some small businesses that take advantage of our pricing, but we certainly aren't looking to have fleet-wide services through our station.

1001
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:38,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1002
01:19:39,725 --> 01:19:45,908
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of the presentation, I do think you guys have done a great job, and you should, because you're professionals, and that's what you do, right?

1003
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:48,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you guys, this is what you do, real estate people.

1004
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:52,992
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have some concerns about the project, and I echo some of my councilor's sentiments.

1005
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:59,215
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see a community need for another service station when we have four already in a mile radius.

1006
01:20:00,516 --> 01:20:05,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I also have noise and air pollution concerns with the abutting neighborhood.

1007
01:20:05,938 --> 01:20:09,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And most importantly, the biggest concern I have

1008
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:26,925
[SPEAKER_14]: because this parcel is abutted by two heavily congested, well-traveled roadways that are not controlled by the local municipality, in order for us to implement any pedestrian or vehicular or pedestrian vehicle conflict safety controls, we can't do it on our own.

1009
01:20:28,086 --> 01:20:30,566
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to go through the state or through the DCI.

1010
01:20:31,207 --> 01:20:38,489
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll be honest with you, we've been doing that right now for the intersection of South Street and Main for six years, and tonight,

1011
01:20:38,905 --> 01:20:41,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, they're gonna be doing something there after six years.

1012
01:20:42,227 --> 01:20:46,470
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a complicating factor that's making this a very difficult vote.

1013
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:53,395
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that coupled with the fact that there are a number of residents in the area that are about the property or live near the property that are opposed to it.

1014
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:59,879
[SPEAKER_14]: When I look at this letter right here, I see individuals who I've known for 20 to 30 years that live in this community.

1015
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,263
[SPEAKER_14]: So it makes it very difficult for me to vote in favor of this paper this evening, to be quite honest with you.

1016
01:21:05,854 --> 01:21:14,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but for the reasons that I stated, um, not, uh, as a reflection of the presentation of the work that you guys have done this evening, quite frankly, I've been around a little while.

1017
01:21:14,757 --> 01:21:18,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen all this goes, um, you know, right now, you know, you're on the goal line.

1018
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight's the night you bump it in.

1019
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:20,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1020
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:24,061
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you get it in, you get it in and then you cram it and it's time to start construction.

1021
01:21:24,641 --> 01:21:27,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but, but I think there are just a number of, uh, question marks.

1022
01:21:28,024 --> 01:21:32,506
[SPEAKER_14]: in variables in here that are going to make it very difficult for me to support your application this evening.

1023
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:35,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I do appreciate the presentation and the work that you've done.

1024
01:21:35,947 --> 01:21:37,968
[SPEAKER_14]: The traffic engineer was excellent.

1025
01:21:38,028 --> 01:21:41,709
[SPEAKER_14]: However, for me this evening, this is something that I don't think I'll be able to support.

1026
01:21:42,349 --> 01:21:46,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, like I said at the beginning of our CBB hearing, we're here to listen tonight.

1027
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:51,213
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've heard Councilor Marks, we've heard your comments, we've heard Councilor Scarapelli.

1028
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:54,674
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're happy to listen and to take those things under advisement.

1029
01:21:54,734 --> 01:21:57,075
[SPEAKER_14]: We've made some commitments to provide you with some information.

1030
01:21:57,932 --> 01:22:01,915
[SPEAKER_14]: We certainly have to continue the dialogue so that we can make it better going forward.

1031
01:22:01,935 --> 01:22:03,576
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll hear me say that many times.

1032
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,217
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to make it better going forward.

1033
01:22:06,398 --> 01:22:11,081
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I had a time machine to erase the things that you brought up and the things that you brought up.

1034
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:12,482
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't do that.

1035
01:22:12,542 --> 01:22:19,427
[SPEAKER_14]: All I can say is what we will do going forward and put that in writing as part of an approval.

1036
01:22:19,447 --> 01:22:23,811
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not prejudicing you on that, but that's what we can offer.

1037
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:26,793
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can also offer you a partner to deal with PCR

1038
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:40,153
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of the mitigation, we heard you on the complete streets, we heard you on the mitigation package that Todd Blake and your team wanted, and we're willing to partner with you on that, and we're willing to listen to that.

1039
01:22:40,233 --> 01:22:45,255
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's also, you know, some of the concerns that the CD board share.

1040
01:22:45,914 --> 01:22:50,918
[SPEAKER_14]: and Todd Blake share or the bicycle commission share aren't necessarily some of the priority concerns that we share.

1041
01:22:51,659 --> 01:23:04,049
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, when you go through a negotiation like that with the CD board, which is there in their scope authority and purview, you get something that, you know, seems agreeable to that board that you're before, but some of the stuff might not necessarily work when you come here for the last level.

1042
01:23:04,089 --> 01:23:07,892
[SPEAKER_14]: But let me be clear that we want to hear what your concerns are.

1043
01:23:08,953 --> 01:23:12,576
[SPEAKER_14]: That is critical and important and most certainly valid.

1044
01:23:12,776 --> 01:23:15,418
[SPEAKER_14]: So please tell us if you'd like to talk

1045
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:20,954
[SPEAKER_14]: in public or we would need to have another meeting where the meeting minutes are documented.

1046
01:23:21,214 --> 01:23:23,756
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to hear you, okay?

1047
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:24,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1048
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:26,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Rao.

1049
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:28,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1050
01:23:28,941 --> 01:23:33,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have two follow-up questions, and I appreciate you asking that question about the electric charging.

1051
01:23:33,725 --> 01:23:34,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I had that one as well.

1052
01:23:35,806 --> 01:23:38,548
[SPEAKER_03]: If this were approved, how long would construction take?

1053
01:23:38,569 --> 01:23:42,932
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why I keep sitting down.

1054
01:23:42,952 --> 01:23:43,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so sorry.

1055
01:23:44,836 --> 01:23:45,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I answer your question.

1056
01:23:46,177 --> 01:23:55,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Construction is anticipated to take approximately four months on the average that the building station once a building permit was issued by by the department.

1057
01:23:56,143 --> 01:23:57,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

1058
01:23:57,604 --> 01:23:59,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also specifically, we've talked.

1059
01:23:59,765 --> 01:24:04,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other Councilors are bringing up specifically that the fencing issues on Woodruff.

1060
01:24:04,929 --> 01:24:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So in addition to the landscaping that's planned, would that fence be completely replaced?

1061
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:10,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And what would it be replaced with?

1062
01:24:10,992 --> 01:24:13,734
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, because again, that the trash blowing into the neighborhood

1063
01:24:14,775 --> 01:24:15,796
[SPEAKER_03]: is a consistent issue.

1064
01:24:16,596 --> 01:24:17,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, I understand.

1065
01:24:17,436 --> 01:24:25,239
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ask Austin to join me on that question in terms of the actual fence upgrades, but I don't want to misspeak or misquote the package.

1066
01:24:26,999 --> 01:24:28,540
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows the details of the plan.

1067
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:31,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And Austin Turner with Polar.

1068
01:24:32,421 --> 01:24:41,865
[SPEAKER_17]: So the fence is intended to be replaced with a fence that's a new fence upgraded with the screening slats in there.

1069
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:43,105
[SPEAKER_17]: But frankly,

1070
01:24:44,127 --> 01:24:50,752
[SPEAKER_17]: we've that was acceptable when we were talking to the community development board, and I thought that was amenable to replace that fence and make it new again.

1071
01:24:50,772 --> 01:24:57,358
[SPEAKER_17]: If the council has other preferences and they prefer something different and more robust, we'd be happy to entertain that as well.

1072
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:00,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

1073
01:25:00,861 --> 01:25:10,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and to echo my fellow councillors, I really appreciate your presentation and the time you put into it, but at the end of the day, I represent the citizens of Medford, the residents of Medford.

1074
01:25:10,048 --> 01:25:12,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't represent BJ, so I have to vote.

1075
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,360
[SPEAKER_03]: according to what I've been hearing on that.

1076
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:14,900
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1077
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:19,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1078
01:25:20,102 --> 01:25:22,003
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also want to thank you for your presentation tonight.

1079
01:25:22,023 --> 01:25:23,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you answering all our questions.

1080
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:25,465
[SPEAKER_10]: You were just talking about the fence.

1081
01:25:26,545 --> 01:25:30,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anyone reached out to the neighbors to see what the neighbors would like for a fence?

1082
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:32,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think they're the ones who are going to have to see it every day.

1083
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:38,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Has there been any discussion there with regards to what type of fence they would like to see?

1084
01:25:42,782 --> 01:25:45,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't been able to speak much, but there hasn't.

1085
01:25:45,804 --> 01:25:50,247
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the difficulties of the whole COVID thing, right, is we went through the CDB process.

1086
01:25:51,128 --> 01:25:54,730
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we had maybe filed the application right when the pandemic hit.

1087
01:25:54,770 --> 01:26:02,775
[SPEAKER_14]: So we actually were talking about having some type of a community meeting where we could engage, but we haven't.

1088
01:26:02,936 --> 01:26:07,259
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're happy to do that if there's a point of contact or someone that we could reach out to.

1089
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:09,340
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, during the CDB process,

1090
01:26:10,263 --> 01:26:14,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was a CBB member or maybe it was that asked about it.

1091
01:26:14,846 --> 01:26:22,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it make sense to have a connection from the neighborhood so folks could walk it towards BJ's without having to come around?

1092
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:29,517
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think that's something that we're adverse to necessarily, but we didn't want to have a fence opening there.

1093
01:26:29,537 --> 01:26:32,599
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not something that the neighborhood, you know, necessarily wanted.

1094
01:26:32,659 --> 01:26:38,103
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're, we're, you know, fine with having that communication and that dialogue.

1095
01:26:38,143 --> 01:26:38,684
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if,

1096
01:26:40,272 --> 01:26:45,134
[SPEAKER_14]: anyone has suggestions in that regard as to how we could facilitate that?

1097
01:26:45,354 --> 01:26:59,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think that, you know, as far as the fence goes, I would think that the neighbors should have, they should weigh heavily in the decision as to what type of fence should go there, because they're going to have to see it every single day.

1098
01:27:00,901 --> 01:27:08,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So the way I look at it is they should have a, you know, a major, you know, role in that decision.

1099
01:27:09,744 --> 01:27:16,565
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as having an opening, I would say that's a discussion with the neighbors as well, because that is going to create foot traffic.

1100
01:27:16,605 --> 01:27:18,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if that's what they want or not.

1101
01:27:18,846 --> 01:27:20,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And I definitely want to hear from the neighbors.

1102
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:25,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that there's probably, I would imagine, some that want to speak on this tonight.

1103
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:30,788
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would think they should definitely have a role with regard to what type of fence is selected.

1104
01:27:31,828 --> 01:27:34,249
[SPEAKER_10]: The other question I had was for the traffic engineer, I believe.

1105
01:27:34,893 --> 01:27:37,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I apologize if I missed this, because I was trying to take some notes.

1106
01:27:38,355 --> 01:27:41,016
[SPEAKER_10]: When was it, did you say you put traffic counters on the street?

1107
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,717
[SPEAKER_10]: When was that done?

1108
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna even again, Sean Kelly with Van Ness.

1109
01:27:50,501 --> 01:27:52,682
[SPEAKER_15]: We did our counts back in pre-COVID.

1110
01:27:52,702 --> 01:27:56,244
[SPEAKER_15]: We did them, I think when we initially started the support, it was probably the spring of 2019.

1111
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:59,065
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we met with Todd Blake.

1112
01:27:59,085 --> 01:28:01,307
[SPEAKER_15]: He'd asked us to add a couple of intersections to the study area.

1113
01:28:01,347 --> 01:28:03,868
[SPEAKER_15]: And those probably counted towards the end of the spring, early summer.

1114
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,242
[SPEAKER_15]: and we balanced things and seasonally adjusted as required.

1115
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:11,784
[SPEAKER_15]: But all the data we collected was pre-COVID, so there was no impact on the pandemic.

1116
01:28:11,945 --> 01:28:12,925
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my question.

1117
01:28:12,945 --> 01:28:16,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to make sure there were pre-COVID pandemic numbers.

1118
01:28:16,767 --> 01:28:17,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything was pre-COVID, correct.

1119
01:28:17,948 --> 01:28:19,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you very much.

1120
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:22,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1121
01:28:22,351 --> 01:28:34,238
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I echo my colleagues when they express the hard work that you put into this, but I think that, as you can see, we appreciate all the commissions and boards that you work with,

1122
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:39,011
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are concerns and concerns are valid.

1123
01:28:41,052 --> 01:28:46,794
[SPEAKER_14]: The impact of the community and what we need to fix, I appreciate that that's being heard and hopefully we can move on that.

1124
01:28:47,174 --> 01:28:55,417
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are also other concerns that I need to vet a little bit more with the impact of traffic.

1125
01:28:56,117 --> 01:29:04,240
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that we have a professional here today, but just the idea of what type of impact as we do these improvements

1126
01:29:04,721 --> 01:29:06,722
[SPEAKER_14]: that you'll see a bigger flow into that area.

1127
01:29:06,782 --> 01:29:12,023
[SPEAKER_14]: We just built a few hundred condominiums just next door.

1128
01:29:12,823 --> 01:29:18,305
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to be adding a wholesale food distribution company just next door.

1129
01:29:18,685 --> 01:29:22,486
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're talking massive impact.

1130
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:29,268
[SPEAKER_14]: These are questions I would like to talk to our city engineer, traffic engineer, if these are the things that were discussed.

1131
01:29:29,687 --> 01:29:39,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your professionalism, what we are trying to do, but as a representative of the city of Medford, we want to make sure that we have our team here.

1132
01:29:40,636 --> 01:29:51,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I appreciate your due diligence with those committees, but this committee that holds on it, I received this information today at two o'clock, so that's bothersome in itself.

1133
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:58,390
[SPEAKER_14]: We listen to our constituents, because that's what we're here for, but I think that

1134
01:30:00,253 --> 01:30:02,654
[SPEAKER_14]: the concerns that we really need to look at.

1135
01:30:03,034 --> 01:30:15,117
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're adding that the Council Falco brought up a point that nobody really looks at the impact of the amount of gallons of gasoline right across from each other, what kind of safety impact that makes.

1136
01:30:15,937 --> 01:30:28,961
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something I'd like to talk to the Chief about, you know, something that, you know, do we have, you know, mechanism in place if something does happen in case of catastrophic issues in that area and what effect that would take to that immediate neighborhood.

1137
01:30:29,704 --> 01:30:30,885
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some concerns.

1138
01:30:31,105 --> 01:30:33,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know where we're going with this.

1139
01:30:33,247 --> 01:30:37,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I think for me, really listening to the neighbors right now would be a great time.

1140
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:40,193
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that we've talked enough if we can.

1141
01:30:40,593 --> 01:30:50,782
[SPEAKER_14]: I think listening to the neighbors right now would be a huge plus to understand what we need to fix to move forward or what their concerns are.

1142
01:30:50,902 --> 01:30:51,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1143
01:30:51,383 --> 01:30:57,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I may ask one quick question, how big is the propane tank in the back of the lawn?

1144
01:31:07,819 --> 01:31:12,381
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll have to get back to you, but let me get back to you as opposed to giving you the wrong answer on the record.

1145
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:13,441
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I appreciate it.

1146
01:31:13,461 --> 01:31:13,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1147
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:16,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'd rather you answer that.

1148
01:31:16,462 --> 01:31:20,584
[SPEAKER_14]: I have two numbers in my head and I just don't want to tell you the wrong one, so I'm happy to provide it.

1149
01:31:21,224 --> 01:31:22,665
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could, I greatly appreciate that.

1150
01:31:22,705 --> 01:31:23,325
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fine.

1151
01:31:23,745 --> 01:31:24,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1152
01:31:24,346 --> 01:31:25,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else, gentlemen?

1153
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:27,267
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some residents.

1154
01:31:27,287 --> 01:31:30,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Jessica Wall, name and address on the record, please.

1155
01:31:32,381 --> 01:31:33,302
[SPEAKER_09]: We can unmute Jessica.

1156
01:31:34,763 --> 01:31:35,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, good evening, everybody.

1157
01:31:35,964 --> 01:31:37,226
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Jessica Wall.

1158
01:31:37,466 --> 01:31:42,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an attorney at Anderson and Krieger in Boston, 50 Milk Street downtown.

1159
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:56,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I represent, as I mentioned earlier, I represent a group of Medford residents, Wellington residents, and local businesses, including the businesses across the street from the proposed BJ's gas station that we've been discussing tonight.

1160
01:31:57,456 --> 01:32:02,859
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't wanna take up too much of your time, and I appreciate all of the councilor's questions that have been raised.

1161
01:32:03,219 --> 01:32:08,842
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, frankly, these are questions that Wellington residents have been raising for over a year now.

1162
01:32:09,933 --> 01:32:16,860
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of the things that we heard from the applicant tonight are new, despite the fact that we've raised them previously.

1163
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:18,342
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to talk about that a little bit.

1164
01:32:19,783 --> 01:32:22,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Wellington has been opposed to this project from the beginning.

1165
01:32:23,668 --> 01:32:27,832
[SPEAKER_12]: We've voiced all those concerns to the Community Development Board, to the Conservation Commission.

1166
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:38,367
[SPEAKER_12]: and as Councilor Marks alluded to, the City Council can make its own decision in terms of noise and impacts and lighting and impacts to the residents.

1167
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:40,468
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what we're really here about tonight.

1168
01:32:41,249 --> 01:32:43,170
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a few issues that I want to preview for you.

1169
01:32:44,197 --> 01:32:49,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Noise and light and odor, those are all things that we need to hear more about.

1170
01:32:49,822 --> 01:32:52,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the things that were described tonight were news.

1171
01:32:53,846 --> 01:32:56,068
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the first time that I've heard some of these issues.

1172
01:32:56,568 --> 01:33:02,293
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never seen a mock-up of lighting and how that's gonna look for the residents nearby.

1173
01:33:02,313 --> 01:33:07,258
[SPEAKER_12]: There's never been information presented, as far as I know, about 5 a.m.

1174
01:33:07,278 --> 01:33:10,801
[SPEAKER_12]: deliveries before, odors, or any of those sorts of issues.

1175
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:23,442
[SPEAKER_12]: there hasn't been any outreach to the community that I'm aware of in terms of offense or in terms of any sort of outreach, sort of offline outside of a meeting to think about what the residents are concerned about.

1176
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:27,183
[SPEAKER_12]: So, or a maintenance plan for that point.

1177
01:33:27,703 --> 01:33:38,366
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I'm concerned that there's been lots of review of this project before, but it's only now that the city council is asking these questions that the applicant is taking an opportunity to address them.

1178
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:40,266
[SPEAKER_12]: And really it's about,

1179
01:33:40,962 --> 01:33:41,862
[SPEAKER_12]: being a good neighbor.

1180
01:33:42,282 --> 01:33:55,246
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that the council has identified that what's the public benefit to having this gas station in terms of, you know, there are already four within the half mile radius.

1181
01:33:56,266 --> 01:34:00,888
[SPEAKER_12]: And the applicant has raised this, that it's really a member's only benefit, right?

1182
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:03,208
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a benefit to the community as a whole.

1183
01:34:03,688 --> 01:34:05,949
[SPEAKER_12]: And the things that they're doing for the project in terms of

1184
01:34:06,451 --> 01:34:12,537
[SPEAKER_12]: stormwater improvements and that sort of thing are things that they've said they probably wouldn't be doing otherwise.

1185
01:34:13,238 --> 01:34:19,564
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are things that I don't consider public benefits when there are things that an existing business could have been doing to be a good neighbor.

1186
01:34:20,124 --> 01:34:28,472
[SPEAKER_12]: So I really do dispute the idea that there are public benefits associated with it when it's a members only business for profit for a private corporation.

1187
01:34:30,134 --> 01:34:37,800
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition to that, just to touch on a few issues, fire and safety, we haven't been aware of any specific details for fire protection there.

1188
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:43,525
[SPEAKER_12]: I can tell you, I can give an answer about the storage for the gas station across the street.

1189
01:34:44,326 --> 01:34:51,292
[SPEAKER_12]: So the fuel tanks across the street are 30,000 gallons, which is less than half of what BJ's is asking for here.

1190
01:34:51,792 --> 01:34:52,993
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not similar.

1191
01:34:53,053 --> 01:34:55,335
[SPEAKER_12]: This would actually be a substantial increase in that regard.

1192
01:34:56,586 --> 01:35:00,228
[SPEAKER_12]: And then in terms of traffic, just to pause on that.

1193
01:35:00,408 --> 01:35:06,812
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's true that the community development board looked at traffic issues.

1194
01:35:07,592 --> 01:35:11,254
[SPEAKER_12]: That does not preclude the city council from looking at them as well.

1195
01:35:12,215 --> 01:35:24,021
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, Mr. Netriba mentioned at the beginning of the presentation that BJ's customers are clamoring, I think was the word he used, for gas station use at BJ's locations.

1196
01:35:24,648 --> 01:35:32,790
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's consistent with our understanding from our traffic expert that we think that they're under counting potential trips or underestimating them.

1197
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:44,813
[SPEAKER_12]: We pointed this out at the Community Development Board stage and we said to BJ's, you have the best data of anybody about what's going on at your existing locations that are similar in terms of traffic counts.

1198
01:35:45,693 --> 01:35:48,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And they went out and looked at one particular location

1199
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:53,202
[SPEAKER_12]: And we would submit that one data point is really not, it can't be the whole story here.

1200
01:35:53,463 --> 01:35:56,024
[SPEAKER_12]: There certainly is probably more out there to tell.

1201
01:35:56,784 --> 01:36:10,832
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I think that the council has raised many questions about BJ's past behavior as neighbors, questions that, you know, throughout over a year for you still remained unanswered until they were asked this evening.

1202
01:36:11,845 --> 01:36:20,871
[SPEAKER_12]: So we think that BJ's has just not put sufficient information forth for the council to approve the license application as it's put together now.

1203
01:36:21,532 --> 01:36:29,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And at a minimum, we're asking the council to require more information from BJ's to make an informed decision about this particular application.

1204
01:36:30,578 --> 01:36:33,280
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm happy to answer any questions that the council may have with me.

1205
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:38,043
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there may be other residents on the Zoom hearing who might wanna offer comments as well.

1206
01:36:39,651 --> 01:36:40,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Jessica.

1207
01:36:40,331 --> 01:36:42,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have anybody else from the public that would like to speak?

1208
01:36:42,433 --> 01:36:50,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1209
01:36:51,577 --> 01:36:56,660
[SPEAKER_01]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1210
01:37:02,827 --> 01:37:03,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me now?

1211
01:37:26,946 --> 01:37:27,566
[SPEAKER_09]: We can hear you now. 

1212
01:37:28,187 --> 01:37:29,127
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, sorry about that.

1213
01:37:29,407 --> 01:37:31,828
[SPEAKER_01]: My headphones died or we're dying.

1214
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:35,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so we got problems with this lot.

1215
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:37,171
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge lot in a nice neighborhood.

1216
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:39,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taking up a lot of nice space in our city.

1217
01:37:40,172 --> 01:37:43,794
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of dirty, as you pointed out, President Caraviello.

1218
01:37:43,834 --> 01:37:50,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I'd do the math because we often hear about how commercial properties pay a higher mill rate than residential.

1219
01:37:50,076 --> 01:37:52,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore we want them in our city because they pay so many taxes.

1220
01:37:53,942 --> 01:38:19,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did the math and this lot is so huge and the improvements are so minimal that they pay about 56 cents per square foot of taxes on this lot, while a nearby house, 70 Woodruff Street, pays $1.28, which is more than double in the same neighborhood per square feet of tax each year at the lot.

1221
01:38:20,964 --> 01:38:27,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to point that out as we think of these commercial lots as this wonderful benefit, they're paying so much taxes.

1222
01:38:27,767 --> 01:38:33,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to remember that's not always true because they're not developing it to the same intensity that other uses are.

1223
01:38:33,609 --> 01:38:39,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, William.

1224
01:38:39,491 --> 01:38:40,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Murray, did you have your hand up?

1225
01:38:42,773 --> 01:38:43,873
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1226
01:38:43,913 --> 01:38:45,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have anybody else from the public that would like to speak?

1227
01:38:50,529 --> 01:38:51,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see anybody.

1228
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:55,633
[SPEAKER_09]: At this point, the chair awaits a motion.

1229
01:39:00,377 --> 01:39:01,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, sir.

1230
01:39:01,998 --> 01:39:16,731
[SPEAKER_14]: So if it, I don't know what the protocol is or the procedure, whether you have a committee process for licenses like this, but, you know, obviously we've heard some items that I think deserve some follow-up with the council.

1231
01:39:17,371 --> 01:39:19,453
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there's an opportunity to,

1232
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:21,528
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, be able to do that.

1233
01:39:21,548 --> 01:39:31,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's coming back here to continue hearing or at a committee level, or I guess I would respectfully request that, you know, we have a chance to respond to some.

1234
01:39:31,895 --> 01:39:49,667
[SPEAKER_14]: If you'd like, we could, uh, we could table this to a date certain if you'd like, or we can meet in committee of the whole Mr. President, um, vice president night, I'm not sure if there are certain, uh, statutory timelines that are associated with whether or not the council must act in a certain timeframe and where he's already gone through certain

1235
01:39:50,188 --> 01:39:51,308
[SPEAKER_14]: levels of approval already.

1236
01:39:52,469 --> 01:39:57,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wondering if it might make more sense for the applicant to withdraw his application and resubmit it.

1237
01:39:57,731 --> 01:40:00,732
[SPEAKER_14]: That way, it wouldn't have an impact on the Community Development Board's decisions.

1238
01:40:01,012 --> 01:40:06,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think if we voted down, you might have to start from the beginning again and go all the way back through the process.

1239
01:40:06,194 --> 01:40:07,295
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not 100% sure.

1240
01:40:07,995 --> 01:40:10,956
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we take action on this, it's unfavorable.

1241
01:40:10,996 --> 01:40:12,117
[SPEAKER_14]: You might have to start over again.

1242
01:40:12,157 --> 01:40:16,939
[SPEAKER_14]: If you withdraw your application and it has to come back to us, I think that that CD board ruling still stands.

1243
01:40:17,139 --> 01:40:18,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure about that.

1244
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:27,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we have to act in a certain frame of time because it's permanent, you know what I mean?

1245
01:40:27,442 --> 01:40:50,276
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'd be fine waiving the timeframe for the council to act voluntarily until such time to reconvene, whether that's, again, I'm not as familiar with your process in terms of whether that's as a committee as a whole, or back here, how best to facilitate that dialogue.

1246
01:40:55,455 --> 01:40:59,639
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair awaits a motion.

1247
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,463
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, uh, I'm not sure if the petitioner is allowed to waive that requirement.

1248
01:41:04,483 --> 01:41:06,045
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a statutory requirement.

1249
01:41:06,805 --> 01:41:14,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and at this particular time, Mr. President, this issue has been out before the community for close to two years.

1250
01:41:14,132 --> 01:41:16,114
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been ample input

1251
01:41:16,567 --> 01:41:46,180
[SPEAKER_13]: by both residents, by this council, by BJ's, and at this junction, based on what was brought up by this council regarding additional trucking, additional traffic impacts, additional car trips, noise, regarding gasoline emissions, fire and health concerns, regarding the amount of storage, regarding that BJ's has not been a good neighbor,

1252
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:51,952
[SPEAKER_13]: In the area, Mr. President, I would move for denial, Mr. President, of the application.

1253
01:41:55,813 --> 01:41:56,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.

1254
01:42:03,135 --> 01:42:05,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, can you put his microphone on?

1255
01:42:05,195 --> 01:42:06,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1256
01:42:07,336 --> 01:42:08,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Pat, can you put his microphone on?

1257
01:42:10,617 --> 01:42:11,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, I'm sorry.

1258
01:42:12,198 --> 01:42:28,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Just if I could, Mr. President, through you to the council and following up on Council Member Knight's prior inquiry, we would be happy to withdraw the application at this point in time if that's something that the council would allow.

1259
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:31,684
[SPEAKER_09]: That's your decision if you wanna withdraw.

1260
01:42:32,904 --> 01:42:34,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I would second Councilor Marks' motion.

1261
01:42:35,685 --> 01:42:37,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I have a motion on the table, Mr. President.

1262
01:42:37,886 --> 01:42:38,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

1263
01:42:39,349 --> 01:42:42,490
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not sure that that's the case, whether or not there is a time for it.

1264
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:47,232
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking there is, Mr. President, normally when the permit comes before us, we have to act within a certain amount of time.

1265
01:42:47,252 --> 01:42:51,153
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's a special permit, 48 section five, tells us we have to act the next amount of days.

1266
01:42:52,273 --> 01:42:54,134
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where I was coming from with that.

1267
01:42:54,154 --> 01:42:58,095
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I certainly am comfortable voting on the paper this evening.

1268
01:42:58,135 --> 01:43:06,038
[SPEAKER_14]: It's probably not gonna be what the applicants are looking for, and that's okay with me, but we could also lay the paper on the table before we can get a legal opinion.

1269
01:43:06,098 --> 01:43:08,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Either way, I'm fine with it.

1270
01:43:09,157 --> 01:43:14,159
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, Mr. President, my concerns have been addressed.

1271
01:43:14,879 --> 01:43:24,802
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that because BJ has put forth so much effort in putting together the presentation, it would be a common courtesy to provide them the opportunity to come before us once again.

1272
01:43:24,882 --> 01:43:29,644
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, I certainly don't have a problem voting on the paper this evening if the motion has been seconded.

1273
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:34,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks has a motion on the floor that has been seconded by Councilor Bears.

1274
01:43:35,505 --> 01:43:36,186
[SPEAKER_09]: At this point.

1275
01:43:37,166 --> 01:43:37,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.

1276
01:43:39,989 --> 01:43:43,191
[SPEAKER_14]: If it pleases the council, we're happy to withdraw the application.

1277
01:43:43,291 --> 01:43:49,095
[SPEAKER_14]: We would certainly like to continue our discussion with you and would prefer not to receive a negative vote.

1278
01:43:49,115 --> 01:43:54,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, we want to continue to work with you, as I've said here in this hearing tonight.

1279
01:43:54,479 --> 01:44:08,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you are not able to grant us a continuance from whatever procedure process that is, and that's a question to you right now, then we're happy to withdraw our application and we will talk us

1280
01:44:08,462 --> 01:44:14,565
[SPEAKER_14]: with you and internally on next steps.

1281
01:44:15,005 --> 01:44:15,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, if I could.

1282
01:44:18,366 --> 01:44:19,286
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not quite sure.

1283
01:44:19,346 --> 01:44:26,649
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Council Vice President Knight mentioned that fact that they may not have to go back before the Community Development Board or the Conservation Commission.

1284
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:34,973
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not quite sure without having our legal counsel give us guidance on that, that that is indeed correct.

1285
01:44:35,713 --> 01:44:37,514
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would state at this point,

1286
01:44:38,055 --> 01:44:40,738
[SPEAKER_13]: that we move forward on the motion that I made Mr. President.

1287
01:44:41,618 --> 01:44:43,921
[SPEAKER_14]: And we would summarily request a withdrawal.

1288
01:44:44,861 --> 01:44:48,645
[SPEAKER_09]: So the gentleman that the petitioner is going to withdraw there.

1289
01:44:50,026 --> 01:44:52,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I still ask that we take our vote Mr. President.

1290
01:44:53,229 --> 01:44:54,691
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a Medford City Council meeting.

1291
01:44:55,792 --> 01:44:57,013
[SPEAKER_09]: There is nothing to take a vote on.

1292
01:44:57,133 --> 01:44:57,413
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?

1293
01:44:57,433 --> 01:44:58,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1294
01:45:02,047 --> 01:45:03,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just disagree with you on this.

1295
01:45:03,428 --> 01:45:11,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the issue has been discussed, you know, if a councillor put it forward and there was discussion, they can no longer withdraw the paper and it's already gone through other committees as well, so.

1296
01:45:14,396 --> 01:45:16,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Move the question, Mr. President.

1297
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:20,380
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1298
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:23,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1299
01:45:23,562 --> 01:45:26,844
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd like to go on the record with a request for the withdrawal, Mr. President.

1300
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:27,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1301
01:45:28,025 --> 01:45:29,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, if you can both note that for the record,

1302
01:45:30,475 --> 01:45:32,996
[SPEAKER_08]: that they would like to withdraw.

1303
01:45:39,178 --> 01:45:40,518
[SPEAKER_13]: This is to deny, yes.

1304
01:45:41,559 --> 01:45:43,199
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a two-year process.

1305
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,641
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a two-year process.

1306
01:45:46,981 --> 01:45:49,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1307
01:45:51,142 --> 01:45:55,063
[SPEAKER_09]: So the motion by Councilor Marks to deny, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1308
01:45:55,564 --> 01:45:56,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1309
01:45:57,584 --> 01:45:59,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do have in the record that you'd like to withdraw also.

1310
01:46:02,128 --> 01:46:02,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

1311
01:46:03,988 --> 01:46:05,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to clarify, yes means deny?

1312
01:46:05,869 --> 01:46:09,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes would mean deny.

1313
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:10,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Then yes.

1314
01:46:12,731 --> 01:46:13,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1315
01:46:13,511 --> 01:46:13,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1316
01:46:14,531 --> 01:46:15,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

1317
01:46:16,552 --> 01:46:17,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1318
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:17,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1319
01:46:18,092 --> 01:46:18,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1320
01:46:19,212 --> 01:46:19,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1321
01:46:21,553 --> 01:46:21,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1322
01:46:23,053 --> 01:46:23,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1323
01:46:25,414 --> 01:46:26,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative.

1324
01:46:26,894 --> 01:46:27,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1325
01:46:28,695 --> 01:46:28,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1326
01:46:29,555 --> 01:46:30,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And again,

1327
01:46:32,408 --> 01:46:38,932
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have on the record that you did want to withdraw, and we will get a legal opinion on that.

1328
01:46:40,412 --> 01:46:45,536
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving on.

1329
01:46:45,556 --> 01:47:00,605
[SPEAKER_09]: 21-308, offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council have a city engineer and a representative from Medford to attend the next council meeting to explain

1330
01:47:01,129 --> 01:47:04,912
[SPEAKER_09]: New curb cut, the new cutouts for the Winthrop Street area has already been dug up.

1331
01:47:04,932 --> 01:47:06,294
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something from last week.

1332
01:47:07,134 --> 01:47:12,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if the gentleman from Eversource is on the call.

1333
01:47:12,339 --> 01:47:13,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he said he was going to be late.

1334
01:47:16,362 --> 01:47:17,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Is anyone from Eversource here?

1335
01:47:18,744 --> 01:47:18,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?

1336
01:47:19,825 --> 01:47:20,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Who would that be?

1337
01:47:22,448 --> 01:47:24,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Liz Stone, where is Liz Stone?

1338
01:47:24,049 --> 01:47:26,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Liz Stone, Liz Stone from Eversource.

1339
01:47:28,007 --> 01:47:32,808
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to default my colleague here.

1340
01:47:33,328 --> 01:47:45,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob Collins was also on the call source and he is the city engineers also in the question we had is I'm looking for an update.

1341
01:47:46,532 --> 01:47:54,614
[SPEAKER_09]: As many people have seen if you go down with the street area, you see all white lines all looking for cutouts and when I was out there today.

1342
01:47:55,598 --> 01:48:02,159
[SPEAKER_09]: from the circle at Winthrop Street down, down heading towards Route 60.

1343
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:03,279
[SPEAKER_09]: They were cutting up today.

1344
01:48:03,639 --> 01:48:08,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you give us an update on what's happening on this project?

1345
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:10,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about the slow connection here.

1346
01:48:10,821 --> 01:48:12,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I had problems unmuting myself.

1347
01:48:12,921 --> 01:48:14,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So my name is Rob Collins.

1348
01:48:14,281 --> 01:48:16,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the Eversource project manager for this project.

1349
01:48:19,042 --> 01:48:22,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the opportunity to come forward and give you an update on the project.

1350
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:29,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So to answer your question, let me see if I can share screen.

1351
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:40,143
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like someone, the host is gonna have to disable the screen sharing to allow me to share.

1352
01:48:40,163 --> 01:48:42,184
[SPEAKER_09]: He's gonna make you a call.

1353
01:48:43,004 --> 01:48:43,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1354
01:49:02,102 --> 01:49:05,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1355
01:49:07,225 --> 01:49:10,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you see share?

1356
01:49:10,628 --> 01:49:11,088
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1357
01:49:11,108 --> 01:49:15,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see the screen in front of you now?

1358
01:49:15,771 --> 01:49:16,111
[SPEAKER_08]: We can.

1359
01:49:16,772 --> 01:49:16,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1360
01:49:17,832 --> 01:49:30,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I, uh, just, uh, before I answer your question just to, uh, to bring everyone, uh, who's not familiar with the project, uh, up to speed on the project and, uh, just give a quick overview of the project.

1361
01:49:30,861 --> 01:49:30,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

1362
01:49:31,601 --> 01:49:51,115
[SPEAKER_06]: For those who are not aware of the project, it's to install 115,000 volt underground transmission line from the substation right on the border of Woburn and Winchester, the Woburn substation through Winchester, Medford, Somerville, Boston to the substation on the Mystic River.

1363
01:49:54,117 --> 01:49:57,900
[SPEAKER_06]: From a Medford standpoint,

1364
01:49:59,278 --> 01:50:01,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that you can see just the Medford piece right now.

1365
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:10,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And it basically, each of these blue boxes indicates a manhole.

1366
01:50:11,043 --> 01:50:16,145
[SPEAKER_06]: We have manholes seven through 16 in Medford.

1367
01:50:18,006 --> 01:50:23,148
[SPEAKER_06]: The red line indicates work that has been completed.

1368
01:50:24,229 --> 01:50:27,750
[SPEAKER_06]: The green line indicates work that is still remaining.

1369
01:50:28,649 --> 01:50:40,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I believe that you're asking about the area right in through here, which is essentially from the manhole eight area down towards the traffic circle.

1370
01:50:43,376 --> 01:50:52,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I think predominantly what you're looking at or what you're asking about is the area in front of the high school where

1371
01:50:53,450 --> 01:51:02,373
[SPEAKER_06]: We excavated last year and encountered a number of utilities that were different than what was shown on our drawings.

1372
01:51:02,993 --> 01:51:13,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as a result, we've had to go back and there is a segment in through the high school area where we excavated, I ended up backfilling it last year.

1373
01:51:13,876 --> 01:51:15,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to test pit.

1374
01:51:16,437 --> 01:51:21,498
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if this is gonna transfer or not.

1375
01:51:23,513 --> 01:51:31,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you, I have in front of me a set of plans showing the Winthrop Street, Medford High School entrance, that doesn't show?

1376
01:51:31,339 --> 01:51:33,121
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1377
01:51:33,721 --> 01:51:36,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so let's see, how do we?

1378
01:51:43,409 --> 01:51:50,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you mean to stop sharing and then share the other screen or share your whole screen?

1379
01:51:50,235 --> 01:51:51,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I think right now you're just sharing one file.

1380
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:56,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what I'm trying to do and I can't get to the stops.

1381
01:51:58,143 --> 01:52:01,786
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not allowing me to get, I'm using multiple monitors here.

1382
01:52:01,886 --> 01:52:08,110
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not allowing me to get to the stops sharing.

1383
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:10,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I can stop it for you.

1384
01:52:12,213 --> 01:52:12,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you stop it?

1385
01:52:13,074 --> 01:52:14,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll start back up.

1386
01:52:15,295 --> 01:52:15,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there we go.

1387
01:52:17,236 --> 01:52:18,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if this works.

1388
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:29,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see a set of plans in front of you?

1389
01:52:29,503 --> 01:52:31,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Not yet.

1390
01:52:36,908 --> 01:52:37,349
[SPEAKER_06]: How about now?

1391
01:52:37,369 --> 01:52:40,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we do.

1392
01:52:40,431 --> 01:52:40,871
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1393
01:52:40,952 --> 01:52:41,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1394
01:52:41,872 --> 01:52:44,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the entrance to the high school.

1395
01:52:44,254 --> 01:52:45,375
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on Winthrop Street.

1396
01:52:46,596 --> 01:52:53,421
[SPEAKER_06]: All of these boxes and colored lines indicate utilities that are different than what was shown on the drawings.

1397
01:52:54,642 --> 01:53:11,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And we didn't, even though we did a lot of test pits in the area, we did not identify this, what I classify as a differing site condition, did not encounter these differing site conditions until we got out here and actually started excavating.

1398
01:53:11,923 --> 01:53:13,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So what has ended up happening is

1399
01:53:15,031 --> 01:53:37,987
[SPEAKER_06]: We ended up actually doing about, after we encountered these utilities, we did about $50,000 worth of test pitting all along through here to find a route through this congested intersection where we could move our transmission line to because where it's currently located, we physically could not install it there.

1400
01:53:38,547 --> 01:53:44,431
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think what you're asking about where we've already dug

1401
01:53:45,000 --> 01:54:00,707
[SPEAKER_06]: and now we're coming back and re-digging is through this area, where we did dig through this area and we've back-filled it, patched it, and now we're changing the alignment to go through here and up through this corridor.

1402
01:54:00,727 --> 01:54:11,411
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's what you're looking at when you're driving the street and finding different areas that were already patched and were...

1403
01:54:14,371 --> 01:54:16,151
[SPEAKER_06]: cutting the pavement in a different location.

1404
01:54:18,672 --> 01:54:21,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's more than just in front of the high school.

1405
01:54:21,133 --> 01:54:26,874
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to be all the way down Winthrop Street, where you can see the white lines where you're gonna be cutting again.

1406
01:54:28,194 --> 01:54:32,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have not completed that section of the alignment.

1407
01:54:32,615 --> 01:54:42,557
[SPEAKER_06]: We've installed the manholes, but we have not gone any further than this area south of the alignment.

1408
01:54:51,725 --> 01:55:02,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, from a work progression standpoint, manhole nine is at 175.

1409
01:55:04,949 --> 01:55:07,889
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually I stand corrected, I apologize.

1410
01:55:07,929 --> 01:55:11,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So this location is between manhole eight and manhole nine.

1411
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:16,732
[SPEAKER_06]: We have done in manhole nine,

1412
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:37,667
[SPEAKER_06]: We have done approximately from manhole nine, we've done to about here where we start crossing the street and we've done north of manhole nine up towards the park.

1413
01:55:38,288 --> 01:55:47,132
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have not connected from manhole eight up in this area down to where manhole nine is located.

1414
01:55:48,993 --> 01:55:52,315
[SPEAKER_06]: So while you're thinking that we've done

1415
01:55:52,907 --> 01:55:55,890
[SPEAKER_06]: some work in here and we're revising it, that's not the case.

1416
01:55:56,010 --> 01:56:02,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the process is you basically install the manholes and then you work from one manhole to the next.

1417
01:56:03,098 --> 01:56:09,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're doing is we've installed, if I go back to, hopefully this will do it.

1418
01:56:10,986 --> 01:56:12,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see the picture that I showed earlier?

1419
01:56:12,788 --> 01:56:13,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1420
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:26,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you stop me from sharing and then we'll do it again?

1421
01:56:26,501 --> 01:56:34,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1422
01:56:34,184 --> 01:56:40,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I see today you're cutting from Wintershade up to the rotary.

1423
01:56:41,887 --> 01:56:42,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1424
01:56:43,228 --> 01:56:44,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw you were cutting there today.

1425
01:56:45,388 --> 01:56:46,049
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

1426
01:56:47,329 --> 01:56:49,650
[SPEAKER_06]: That's in preparation for the work this summer.

1427
01:56:50,347 --> 01:56:54,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So the rotary is right around here.

1428
01:56:57,449 --> 01:57:05,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've done manhole 10, which is right in front of the American Legion.

1429
01:57:07,152 --> 01:57:12,573
[SPEAKER_06]: We have not done from manhole 10 down to Mystic Valley Parkway.

1430
01:57:13,454 --> 01:57:18,655
[SPEAKER_06]: This red line right here represents crossing the Mystic River and stopping right at Mystic Valley Parkway.

1431
01:57:19,697 --> 01:57:20,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We still can't see anything around.

1432
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:21,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you can't?

1433
01:57:22,522 --> 01:57:22,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Darn it.

1434
01:57:27,751 --> 01:57:30,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Technology is wonderful when you know what you're doing and it works, right?

1435
01:57:49,735 --> 01:57:50,195
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1436
01:57:50,796 --> 01:57:52,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me try this again.

1437
01:57:59,742 --> 01:58:00,382
[SPEAKER_06]: How about now?

1438
01:58:02,343 --> 01:58:02,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1439
01:58:03,044 --> 01:58:03,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1440
01:58:03,744 --> 01:58:04,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

1441
01:58:05,165 --> 01:58:10,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So this red line right here represents where we've crossed the Mystic River.

1442
01:58:13,436 --> 01:58:19,859
[SPEAKER_06]: right at this location where the red turns to green is right at the Medford Garden, and it's at Mystic Valley Parkway.

1443
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:33,627
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have installed manhole 10, which is located in front of the American Legion, but we have not installed the trench from manhole 10 down to Mystic Valley Parkway.

1444
01:58:34,747 --> 01:58:41,951
[SPEAKER_06]: We've installed manhole nine, which is at Victory Garden, and we've installed a few hundred feet of pipe

1445
01:58:42,561 --> 01:58:46,102
[SPEAKER_06]: south of that, but that's where we ended last year.

1446
01:58:46,923 --> 01:59:05,550
[SPEAKER_06]: So with the exception of in front of the high school, the lines that you're seeing being cut right now is connecting the dots going from where we stopped last year down to manhole 10, from manhole 10 down to the Medford garden area.

1447
01:59:05,870 --> 01:59:10,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Likewise, where we stopped last year between Robinson

1448
01:59:11,141 --> 01:59:18,622
[SPEAKER_06]: and Manhole 8, and then from, so this is, Robinson is where Manhole 7 is located.

1449
01:59:19,422 --> 01:59:21,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Manhole 8 is down near the gas station.

1450
01:59:22,903 --> 01:59:30,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's where we stopped, so we've started cutting where we stopped last year down to Manhole 8.

1451
01:59:32,225 --> 01:59:37,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Likewise, where we stopped last year between Manhole 8 and Manhole 9, continuing down to Manhole 10.

1452
01:59:44,045 --> 01:59:54,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So from a recutting standpoint, the only location that we're recutting the street where we did work before is through that high school intersection.

1453
01:59:55,011 --> 02:00:03,576
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest of it is just connecting the dots from where we stopped last year between locations of where we stopped to where we stopped.

1454
02:00:11,781 --> 02:00:13,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that answer your question?

1455
02:00:17,381 --> 02:00:18,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

1456
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:19,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1457
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:26,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much for showing us the detailed drawings.

1458
02:00:27,723 --> 02:00:28,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple of quick questions.

1459
02:00:28,783 --> 02:00:33,204
[SPEAKER_10]: So do we know when the work will be performed with regard to the rest of the installation?

1460
02:00:34,565 --> 02:00:39,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to be starting on the 20th, the day after Patriots Day.

1461
02:00:40,766 --> 02:00:46,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on a meeting we had with the city this morning, the city has asked that we start with one crew.

1462
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:55,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh, right now, uh, I'm working with a contractor to determine where that one crew will be starting.

1463
02:00:55,816 --> 02:00:59,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll get back to, uh, Mr. McGivern on that to let him know.

1464
02:01:00,259 --> 02:01:11,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, uh, the, the plan is to start next week with one crew, um, probably in the manhole seven to eight location, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

1465
02:01:12,587 --> 02:01:16,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And moving South towards, uh, towards the, uh,

1466
02:01:16,875 --> 02:01:18,235
[SPEAKER_06]: the circle, the traffic circle.

1467
02:01:19,976 --> 02:01:30,158
[SPEAKER_10]: And in that trip, maybe Tim McGivin can answer this if he's on the call, but why one crew?

1468
02:01:30,398 --> 02:01:32,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you want, I can answer that, Tim.

1469
02:01:32,479 --> 02:01:41,981
[SPEAKER_06]: The police chief was concerned about how many detail officers he has with respect to our project plus other projects in the city.

1470
02:01:42,722 --> 02:01:44,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the chief,

1471
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:49,414
[SPEAKER_06]: made the decision this morning that he was going to allow us to start with one crew.

1472
02:01:50,475 --> 02:01:56,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after work progressed for a while, he'd evaluate additional crews.

1473
02:01:58,361 --> 02:02:01,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know when that reevaluation will take place?

1474
02:02:02,464 --> 02:02:03,305
[SPEAKER_06]: We're supposed to meet.

1475
02:02:03,485 --> 02:02:10,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to set up a meeting with the city next week after we've started work to make that evaluation.

1476
02:02:13,433 --> 02:02:20,098
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as do we know, so do we know why is this going to take place?

1477
02:02:20,178 --> 02:02:22,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we know how long it's going to take place?

1478
02:02:22,179 --> 02:02:28,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I would imagine it sounds like it's all over the map if we're not sure how many crews that are going to be doing the work.

1479
02:02:29,565 --> 02:02:33,748
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's one crew, I'm hoping that the one crew is just short term.

1480
02:02:35,769 --> 02:02:38,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I am as well, but I don't know the answer to that.

1481
02:02:43,036 --> 02:02:49,977
[SPEAKER_10]: And is it basically the number of people that can do details or is it actually a budget issue?

1482
02:02:51,638 --> 02:02:54,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a budget issue because we pay for the details.

1483
02:02:55,738 --> 02:03:04,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is truly a number of people that can never, officers available for details.

1484
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:10,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Are the residents being notified when the work's going to be taking place?

1485
02:03:11,448 --> 02:03:12,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they are.

1486
02:03:12,448 --> 02:03:18,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a robust outreach program that does notify the residents in advance.

1487
02:03:19,932 --> 02:03:22,813
[SPEAKER_10]: And will the work be taking place between certain hours?

1488
02:03:24,073 --> 02:03:27,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Up in this area, yes, between normal work hours.

1489
02:03:28,575 --> 02:03:30,596
[SPEAKER_06]: There are segments where we may be limited.

1490
02:03:30,676 --> 02:03:36,479
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, down in the high school, when the school is operational, we may have some limitation on hours.

1491
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:38,680
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the most part, the project

1492
02:03:40,132 --> 02:03:43,113
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially a seven to five, seven to four time period.

1493
02:03:43,133 --> 02:03:50,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so do you have any type of goal as to when this is going to be finally completed?

1494
02:03:51,975 --> 02:03:57,196
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we've been talking about this project, I think for, it's quite a few years now.

1495
02:03:59,077 --> 02:04:00,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get it done as soon as we can.

1496
02:04:01,717 --> 02:04:07,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, we, you know, how many crews we can have working at a time is a big factor.

1497
02:04:10,663 --> 02:04:13,605
[SPEAKER_06]: We, I worked with the contractor over the winter.

1498
02:04:13,665 --> 02:04:28,092
[SPEAKER_06]: We put together a plan that we thought would work based on production rates observed last year and having multiple crews last year.

1499
02:04:28,532 --> 02:04:38,858
[SPEAKER_06]: We felt that with three concurrent crews working during the day and the city has asked that we perform the work in front of the

1500
02:04:40,451 --> 02:04:43,373
[SPEAKER_06]: police station on Main Street in that area at night.

1501
02:04:44,714 --> 02:04:58,003
[SPEAKER_06]: We felt that with three day crews and starting later in the summer, a night crew that we would be completed, it would take the entire construction season to complete the complete work in Medford.

1502
02:05:00,384 --> 02:05:08,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, until we know when we can start more crews, I have no idea what the impact is on our schedule.

1503
02:05:11,479 --> 02:05:24,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and so, okay, so it sounds like it's one crew for the time being until we can free up more details to increase the number of crews.

1504
02:05:26,595 --> 02:05:27,756
[SPEAKER_19]: May I?

1505
02:05:28,977 --> 02:05:29,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

1506
02:05:29,929 --> 02:05:30,990
[SPEAKER_10]: By all means, yeah.

1507
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:39,116
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, and what Rob is just what Rob said is correct the other there is another factor there's quite a bit of construction happening in the city this summer.

1508
02:05:39,476 --> 02:05:46,562
[SPEAKER_19]: So when the chief was making his decision that was also a factor that has to do with details but it also has to do with

1509
02:05:47,422 --> 02:05:50,824
[SPEAKER_19]: just the sheer number of construction sites on the road taking place.

1510
02:05:52,304 --> 02:06:02,149
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, as having three crews on Winthrop Street and one in Winchester as well, so that's sort of four in a row on Winthrop Street.

1511
02:06:02,229 --> 02:06:03,970
[SPEAKER_19]: So there was some concern there.

1512
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:08,592
[SPEAKER_19]: There's gonna be some work happening on High Street, potentially some work happening on Riverside Avenue.

1513
02:06:08,612 --> 02:06:13,594
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have some work in Medford Square that's gonna be happening from Comcast.

1514
02:06:14,054 --> 02:06:15,395
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a busy summer.

1515
02:06:16,215 --> 02:06:22,761
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was also a factor in this Councilor Falco.

1516
02:06:23,021 --> 02:06:24,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1517
02:06:24,102 --> 02:06:25,403
[SPEAKER_10]: No further questions at this time.

1518
02:06:25,423 --> 02:06:25,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1519
02:06:26,024 --> 02:06:26,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Biz.

1520
02:06:27,906 --> 02:06:28,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1521
02:06:29,127 --> 02:06:30,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Rob, for your presentation.

1522
02:06:30,608 --> 02:06:38,435
[SPEAKER_04]: If the three crews were permitted, if your full plan that you had sketched out was able to go into effect,

1523
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:46,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that timeline include the resurfacing and recurbing of the project completed by the end of this construction season?

1524
02:06:48,305 --> 02:06:51,407
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wouldn't, predominantly for two reasons.

1525
02:06:51,787 --> 02:06:59,131
[SPEAKER_06]: One is we need the three crews just for pipe installation, the excavation and the pipe installation.

1526
02:07:00,372 --> 02:07:08,276
[SPEAKER_06]: The second reason is you really don't want to be milling and paving

1527
02:07:08,974 --> 02:07:11,935
[SPEAKER_06]: over a trench that hasn't set over a winter time.

1528
02:07:13,375 --> 02:07:27,160
[SPEAKER_06]: From a settlement standpoint, good construction practice is you want a trench to set over a winter so that it normalizes itself and after you mill and pave it, you don't have additional settlement.

1529
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:38,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I met with Mr. McGiven early on in the project and collectively we agreed that it made sense that

1530
02:07:38,928 --> 02:07:47,132
[SPEAKER_06]: we wait to do the milling and paving for a season after the trenching has been completed.

1531
02:07:47,592 --> 02:07:55,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that said, Tim did ask this morning that we look at trying to get some of the milling and paving done this summer.

1532
02:07:57,416 --> 02:08:05,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you that that is a concern to me from a productivity standpoint because if

1533
02:08:07,705 --> 02:08:12,167
[SPEAKER_06]: milling and paving takes away from my ability to get pipe installed.

1534
02:08:12,528 --> 02:08:15,109
[SPEAKER_06]: That's counterproductive to getting the project completed.

1535
02:08:17,570 --> 02:08:17,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1536
02:08:18,531 --> 02:08:19,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate that.

1537
02:08:20,512 --> 02:08:29,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, even if you were at full capacity this year, some element of milling and paving would still be done next year, next season.

1538
02:08:30,197 --> 02:08:30,837
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

1539
02:08:31,657 --> 02:08:32,398
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1540
02:08:33,558 --> 02:08:36,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would include the sidewalks and curbing along Winthrop Street.

1541
02:08:38,504 --> 02:08:53,932
[SPEAKER_06]: That sidewalks and curbing, we would do where we've gone into the sidewalk or damaged the sidewalk, but I know the city has a project to do sidewalk and curb restoration that Eversource has provided funding for as part of the MOU.

1542
02:08:54,332 --> 02:08:57,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be, Tim would need to talk about the schedule for that.

1543
02:08:59,335 --> 02:09:01,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Tim, if you could just quickly.

1544
02:09:01,056 --> 02:09:01,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1545
02:09:03,177 --> 02:09:07,099
[SPEAKER_19]: That project is out to bid right now, so we're anticipating getting bids back.

1546
02:09:08,491 --> 02:09:12,974
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, we'll coordinate that work with Eversource's crews work out there.

1547
02:09:13,675 --> 02:09:22,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Those two jobs, one in the Winthrop Street Rotary, some ramps, and then there's some sidewalk work up on the northern end of Winthrop Street.

1548
02:09:22,862 --> 02:09:28,746
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are relatively short and small compared to what Mr. Collins is discussing tonight.

1549
02:09:28,786 --> 02:09:32,348
[SPEAKER_19]: So I feel pretty confident in being able to coordinate that effort.

1550
02:09:33,209 --> 02:09:33,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

1551
02:09:34,730 --> 02:09:34,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1552
02:09:35,391 --> 02:09:35,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1553
02:09:35,911 --> 02:09:36,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Tim.

1554
02:09:37,742 --> 02:09:45,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my last question is, if you can only use one crew this season, do you expect the project to go beyond next season?

1555
02:09:47,986 --> 02:09:53,428
[SPEAKER_06]: No, if we can only use one crew this season, it would take all of this year.

1556
02:09:53,868 --> 02:10:00,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And depending on how many crews we could use next year, it would take all of next year and possibly into the following year.

1557
02:10:00,410 --> 02:10:03,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if we're limited to one crew, if it's going to take us,

1558
02:10:03,789 --> 02:10:12,515
[SPEAKER_06]: three crews all construction season this year to finish it, and we're limited to one crew, then just simple math says it's going to be three years.

1559
02:10:13,996 --> 02:10:14,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1560
02:10:15,377 --> 02:10:29,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tim, I guess along those lines, given the size of this project, the scope of it, how long it's been going on compared to some of the other work going on this summer, do you think it might be possible to prioritize this project?

1561
02:10:32,461 --> 02:10:38,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, ultimately it comes down to the chief making a call on public safety.

1562
02:10:40,043 --> 02:10:48,746
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know exactly where it's going to go, but I'm confident that we'll be able to have Eversource mobilize more than one crew this season.

1563
02:10:48,806 --> 02:10:49,586
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I hope so.

1564
02:10:51,267 --> 02:10:57,269
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the big factors at play here, and one of the things that a lot of folks are keeping their eye on,

1565
02:10:57,975 --> 02:11:01,017
[SPEAKER_19]: as far as completing the project, is the resurfacing aspect of it.

1566
02:11:01,777 --> 02:11:11,663
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I did request this morning in our meeting was, and we had everybody there, the chief was there, Commissioner Kearns was there, myself, Mr. Blake.

1567
02:11:12,383 --> 02:11:24,770
[SPEAKER_19]: So because of the idea of having, starting with one crew and this potentially taking longer than this season, I floated the idea and requested

1568
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:39,517
[SPEAKER_19]: that we look at or ever so us look at resurfacing Mystic Avenue and potentially South Street to discuss that because those trenches have sat over that winter and those should be ready for resurfacing.

1569
02:11:39,998 --> 02:11:48,242
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think a lot of folks understand that Mystic Avenue probably can't hold on another year without unraveling even more.

1570
02:11:49,409 --> 02:11:53,772
[SPEAKER_19]: So that discussion is ongoing.

1571
02:11:53,792 --> 02:11:57,775
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm hoping that Eversource comes back favorable on that.

1572
02:11:59,216 --> 02:12:15,828
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that will go a long way, because if you can imagine if this does go into next year or next full construction season, but Mystic Avenue and South Street has been resurfaced, then we've narrowed the remaining resurfacing to Winthrop Street.

1573
02:12:16,528 --> 02:12:20,732
[SPEAKER_19]: So I feel like that's a pretty good direction to take this in.

1574
02:12:22,073 --> 02:12:39,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I would agree with that, Tim, and I would like to make a motion that the council requests that that group that met take into consideration what you just said and also try to develop a plan including prioritizing details that completes this project by the end of the 2022 construction season.

1575
02:12:42,619 --> 02:12:56,708
[SPEAKER_19]: It should be noted, too, that many of the projects happening, we don't have as much control over as an entity coming in and requesting street opening permits because they're MassDOT or they're MWRA projects.

1576
02:12:57,488 --> 02:12:59,670
[SPEAKER_19]: So state projects, we just have a little bit less control.

1577
02:13:00,730 --> 02:13:02,891
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would like to prioritize certain projects, too.

1578
02:13:03,512 --> 02:13:05,053
[SPEAKER_19]: It's sometimes difficult to do.

1579
02:13:05,073 --> 02:13:11,417
[SPEAKER_19]: I think everybody wants Eversource to be done, including Eversource, but it comes down to public safety and what

1580
02:13:12,977 --> 02:13:15,838
[SPEAKER_19]: the Medford Police Department feels is appropriate and safe.

1581
02:13:16,878 --> 02:13:18,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I completely hear that.

1582
02:13:18,618 --> 02:13:20,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to make the request.

1583
02:13:21,919 --> 02:13:25,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is such a large amount of priority roadway in the city.

1584
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:29,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of folks have had, you know, I hear about it all the time.

1585
02:13:29,821 --> 02:13:31,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree with you.

1586
02:13:31,961 --> 02:13:33,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we can all get it done as quickly as possible.

1587
02:13:33,741 --> 02:13:37,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope maybe we can come to some sort of compromise that that can allow that to happen.

1588
02:13:38,542 --> 02:13:39,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1589
02:13:42,227 --> 02:13:43,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1590
02:13:43,108 --> 02:13:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if I could ask Rob through the chair, thank you for the presentation.

1591
02:13:47,651 --> 02:13:52,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some residents reach out when I live, like many Medford residents, I live very close to this project.

1592
02:13:52,834 --> 02:13:55,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see up close and personal most days.

1593
02:13:55,836 --> 02:14:02,280
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of loose gravel and small particles from the patchwork.

1594
02:14:02,541 --> 02:14:09,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the cutting, you know, it's on the sidewalk, it's in the edges of the road, which makes it really challenging for bike riders.

1595
02:14:09,065 --> 02:14:10,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm curious if there's any intention

1596
02:14:11,204 --> 02:14:12,164
[SPEAKER_03]: to do some cleanup work.

1597
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:16,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's near where the curbing is left near Victory Park.

1598
02:14:16,725 --> 02:14:31,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty messy up and down Winthrop Street, which I would think is at least in large part to the road being cut up and patched frequently over the past many years at this point, but at least in the recent time.

1599
02:14:31,629 --> 02:14:38,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious if there's any intention to clean that up now or as the project goes on through the spring and summer.

1600
02:14:42,591 --> 02:14:43,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, do you have an answer for her?

1601
02:14:44,192 --> 02:14:45,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm writing myself a note, I'm sorry.

1602
02:14:45,833 --> 02:14:47,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So the answer is yes, absolutely.

1603
02:14:49,015 --> 02:14:50,496
[SPEAKER_06]: We will get out there and clean it up.

1604
02:14:52,718 --> 02:14:57,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a matter of, we haven't gotten remobilized yet after the winter.

1605
02:14:58,682 --> 02:15:02,985
[SPEAKER_06]: The contractor is required to broom sweep when he's done at the end of the day.

1606
02:15:05,046 --> 02:15:06,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll just,

1607
02:15:06,823 --> 02:15:11,247
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, reach out and make that a point that this is an issue that has to get addressed.

1608
02:15:11,567 --> 02:15:14,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And I apologize that it hasn't been addressed.

1609
02:15:15,491 --> 02:15:16,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

1610
02:15:18,434 --> 02:15:19,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Berco.

1611
02:15:19,715 --> 02:15:20,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1612
02:15:20,456 --> 02:15:28,543
[SPEAKER_10]: To Councilor Morell's point, if I may, you said it's broom swept, is that what you mentioned?

1613
02:15:32,678 --> 02:15:36,301
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of each day, the contractor is required to broom sweep his area.

1614
02:15:36,561 --> 02:15:43,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, so that there's no loose gravel, as the councilor mentioned, or loose asphalt laying around.

1615
02:15:44,767 --> 02:15:49,791
[SPEAKER_10]: At any point in time, is there a source ever sent through a street sweeping crew?

1616
02:15:52,432 --> 02:16:01,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot say off the top of my head when it has happened, but yes, there has been both McCourt has,

1617
02:16:02,003 --> 02:16:07,144
[SPEAKER_06]: upon occasion had a street sweeper out there, I believe.

1618
02:16:07,204 --> 02:16:14,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's time to get the street sweeper out there on a more regular basis, especially people are gonna be biking and walking more often.

1619
02:16:14,906 --> 02:16:26,168
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be, I mean, I would think in the interest of public safety, it'd be best to have that go through on a regular basis, at least once a week, I would think, just to keep it clean and safe for everyone involved.

1620
02:16:32,346 --> 02:16:34,167
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll definitely talk to the contractor about that.

1621
02:16:35,047 --> 02:16:36,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1622
02:16:36,187 --> 02:16:39,549
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, I have to go back to the number of crews.

1623
02:16:39,889 --> 02:16:45,311
[SPEAKER_10]: So you were saying, I think, back last summer, at one point in time, you had three crews during the day.

1624
02:16:45,371 --> 02:16:45,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

1625
02:16:46,431 --> 02:16:48,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

1626
02:16:48,812 --> 02:16:59,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Would I be correct in saying that if you wanted this job that's starting again, or project, I should say, on April 20th, ideally, would you want to have three crews again?

1627
02:16:59,676 --> 02:16:59,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1628
02:17:03,214 --> 02:17:15,820
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know occasionally when we have a lot of road work going on and construction work, sometimes there are details that if we don't have enough people to cover, we go outside and whatnot.

1629
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:18,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Has that been entertained as an option?

1630
02:17:20,442 --> 02:17:22,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, repeat the question.

1631
02:17:23,463 --> 02:17:30,907
[SPEAKER_10]: So sometimes when we have major construction projects going on or various construction projects, we might not have enough people to cover the detail.

1632
02:17:32,088 --> 02:17:36,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the city goes outside occasionally to have people cover those details.

1633
02:17:36,810 --> 02:17:39,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Has that been an option that the administration has looked at?

1634
02:17:40,932 --> 02:17:43,853
[SPEAKER_06]: That was done periodically last year.

1635
02:17:45,474 --> 02:17:53,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Routinely, what happens is the contractor will go to the police department, ask for a number of details for the following week.

1636
02:17:53,997 --> 02:18:00,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the police department doesn't have the officers available, they will reach out to

1637
02:18:03,141 --> 02:18:06,364
[SPEAKER_06]: abutting communities and look for additional support.

1638
02:18:06,784 --> 02:18:10,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So that has been done routinely throughout the construction so far.

1639
02:18:12,688 --> 02:18:19,013
[SPEAKER_10]: So has that been done when you had your most recent meeting and decided to start the work on April 20th?

1640
02:18:19,073 --> 02:18:21,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there any discussion to go outside for those details?

1641
02:18:23,997 --> 02:18:27,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what discussion the police department had internally.

1642
02:18:29,551 --> 02:18:31,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not bring it up during the meeting.

1643
02:18:33,332 --> 02:18:41,015
[SPEAKER_06]: The police chief was just concerned about being able to provide the details and the public safety and all the other work going on.

1644
02:18:41,095 --> 02:18:48,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And so his statement was, let's start with one crew and then we'll assess it and move from there.

1645
02:18:52,998 --> 02:18:57,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this is not right, but I feel like the police chief's running the project now.

1646
02:18:58,851 --> 02:19:10,737
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and I don't mean to say that, I'm not trying to be, I just, to me it seems like we should, this project has been going on for, I think, I've been on the council for, I'm in my sixth year.

1647
02:19:11,558 --> 02:19:15,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this project has been going on for at least four of those six years.

1648
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:23,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just seems like the work needs to get done sooner than later.

1649
02:19:23,084 --> 02:19:25,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like having one crew start on April 20th

1650
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:30,411
[SPEAKER_10]: is completely disingenuous to the people that live on that roadway.

1651
02:19:30,451 --> 02:19:36,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they have been putting up with construction on a regular basis for a long time now.

1652
02:19:37,713 --> 02:19:42,434
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would think it should be a major priority for this administration to really get this done.

1653
02:19:44,255 --> 02:19:49,936
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I feel like when we're starting off with one crew, I feel like the priority is not there.

1654
02:19:50,196 --> 02:19:53,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not sure if Tim, you can address this or Rob, if you can address this.

1655
02:19:53,597 --> 02:19:55,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it just seems like there should be more

1656
02:19:57,201 --> 02:20:00,183
[SPEAKER_10]: There should be more crews to really get this done.

1657
02:20:02,084 --> 02:20:04,205
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was not just the details.

1658
02:20:04,265 --> 02:20:05,366
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to be clear on that.

1659
02:20:05,646 --> 02:20:13,991
[SPEAKER_19]: And also I want to say that we're trying to paraphrase what the chief is saying, and it really should be coming from him.

1660
02:20:14,011 --> 02:20:21,235
[SPEAKER_19]: He made decisions based off of the information he was provided by me, by Eversource.

1661
02:20:21,975 --> 02:20:42,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, we met internally about it and, um, you know, initially a few weeks back, I think two or three weeks back, we had a sort of our first meeting with Eversource for the year where Eversource, uh, Mr. Collins presented the schedule, presented a number of crews, uh, and that was taken in and it was digested and assessed.

1662
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:45,952
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, that, that was the decision that was made.

1663
02:20:46,252 --> 02:20:49,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I said, I think the one crew is probably, and I'm, I'm.

1664
02:20:49,654 --> 02:21:02,101
[SPEAKER_19]: trying to, you know, paraphrase what the chief was saying, you know, start with one crew, evaluate the situation, and then, you know, see if we can add another one on, if that makes sense.

1665
02:21:02,441 --> 02:21:14,127
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, when you have, and I understand, you know, where he's coming from, from a public safety standpoint, and I understand that the residents want it to be complete on Winthrop Street, but

1666
02:21:15,027 --> 02:21:33,351
[SPEAKER_19]: You may remember from last year where there was three traffic management setups right in a row all summer, basically, and that, you know, I don't want to put words in the chief's mouth at all, but some of the results of that may have impacted this decision.

1667
02:21:33,771 --> 02:21:34,712
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not quite sure.

1668
02:21:36,152 --> 02:21:42,357
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, from an engineering construction standpoint, you know, I see whatever SOS wants to do.

1669
02:21:42,417 --> 02:21:45,099
[SPEAKER_19]: I see what McCord is planning to do, and it makes sense.

1670
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:53,245
[SPEAKER_19]: But, you know, I'm definitely not the final authority on public safety within the right of way, and that is Chief Buckley.

1671
02:21:53,285 --> 02:21:56,047
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why he's involved in these conversations.

1672
02:21:56,327 --> 02:22:03,473
[SPEAKER_19]: And he has a couple of great traffic sergeants that do the day-to-day work that we meet with on a regular basis for various projects.

1673
02:22:05,194 --> 02:22:10,015
[SPEAKER_19]: have been involved, you know, for this project since I think the beginning.

1674
02:22:11,075 --> 02:22:20,097
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're pretty well informed of what's happening out there on the streets and the detail officers, which obviously get feedback, see it on a daily basis.

1675
02:22:20,697 --> 02:22:23,418
[SPEAKER_19]: So I mean, I don't see it on a daily basis, those guys do.

1676
02:22:25,318 --> 02:22:28,319
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, Tim, does the Mayor sit in on those meetings as well?

1677
02:22:30,194 --> 02:22:37,699
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor herself was not at the meeting, no, but I believe Chief of Staff David Rodriguez was there, at least partially today.

1678
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:44,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's fine with the one crew working on this project?

1679
02:22:46,023 --> 02:22:46,244
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry?

1680
02:22:47,484 --> 02:22:49,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's fine with the one crew working on this project?

1681
02:22:50,566 --> 02:22:53,548
[SPEAKER_19]: I have not heard his particular opinion on the matter.

1682
02:22:55,409 --> 02:22:56,710
[SPEAKER_19]: During that portion of the meeting,

1683
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:04,202
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think he spoke up, but I don't know if he would have to speak for himself on that matter.

1684
02:23:06,663 --> 02:23:06,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1685
02:23:09,944 --> 02:23:11,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Rice.

1686
02:23:11,725 --> 02:23:13,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1687
02:23:13,286 --> 02:23:14,486
[SPEAKER_14]: And Rob, thank you for being here.

1688
02:23:14,526 --> 02:23:15,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the update.

1689
02:23:16,007 --> 02:23:19,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I too live in the neighborhood and I am waiting for this project to be done.

1690
02:23:19,901 --> 02:23:22,462
[SPEAKER_14]: and I can't wait to see some more shovels in the ground up there.

1691
02:23:23,182 --> 02:23:27,583
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, thank you very much for being here this evening and giving us this update.

1692
02:23:27,683 --> 02:23:33,864
[SPEAKER_14]: It appears to me that although you're not going according to a schedule, it seems as though the project is progressing.

1693
02:23:34,085 --> 02:23:37,305
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd hate to see this go into another construction cycle after next year.

1694
02:23:37,845 --> 02:23:43,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Quite frankly, I'd hate to see it go into another construction cycle after this year, but it is what it is, as they say in the big city.

1695
02:23:44,567 --> 02:23:48,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly would support Councilor Behr's motion

1696
02:23:48,906 --> 02:23:56,290
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would offer it, I'd offer a second to that, that Eversource take every effort and step to speed up this process.

1697
02:23:56,570 --> 02:23:59,291
[SPEAKER_14]: But with that being said, I just wanted to thank Rob for being here this evening.

1698
02:23:59,331 --> 02:24:00,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's had a long night listening.

1699
02:24:01,312 --> 02:24:04,553
[SPEAKER_14]: And I certainly think he did a great job with the presentation.

1700
02:24:04,573 --> 02:24:08,675
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to offer my well wishes to him and thank him for his efforts.

1701
02:24:09,756 --> 02:24:10,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1702
02:24:11,597 --> 02:24:12,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions?

1703
02:24:13,197 --> 02:24:16,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, on the motion by Councilor Briz,

1704
02:24:17,887 --> 02:24:19,327
[SPEAKER_09]: seconded by Vice President Knight.

1705
02:24:21,088 --> 02:24:23,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1706
02:24:23,508 --> 02:24:24,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1707
02:24:25,648 --> 02:24:26,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1708
02:24:26,489 --> 02:24:27,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be brief.

1709
02:24:27,129 --> 02:24:30,469
[SPEAKER_13]: My colleagues, I think, did a great job on this.

1710
02:24:30,489 --> 02:24:43,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I think it's only appropriate that we receive a correspondence from the chief of police regarding his reasoning for only allowing the one crew to start off on April 20th.

1711
02:24:43,812 --> 02:24:45,812
[SPEAKER_13]: And what are his expectations

1712
02:24:46,837 --> 02:24:50,619
[SPEAKER_13]: to have more crews added and what that timeframe is.

1713
02:24:50,999 --> 02:24:54,561
[SPEAKER_13]: I think residents should be aware of what's going on, Mr. President.

1714
02:24:55,021 --> 02:25:02,124
[SPEAKER_13]: And I won't reiterate what my colleagues stated, but this project, as Councilor Falco mentioned, has been going on since 2017.

1715
02:25:02,764 --> 02:25:06,506
[SPEAKER_13]: And really, I think this has to come to some type of resolve.

1716
02:25:06,586 --> 02:25:07,906
[SPEAKER_09]: You have an amendment?

1717
02:25:08,747 --> 02:25:09,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, please.

1718
02:25:09,447 --> 02:25:11,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Councilor Bears,

1719
02:25:14,474 --> 02:25:21,560
[SPEAKER_09]: as amended by Councilor Bears, and as amended by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1720
02:25:21,580 --> 02:25:23,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1721
02:25:28,987 --> 02:25:29,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1722
02:25:30,548 --> 02:25:30,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1723
02:25:31,989 --> 02:25:32,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caput.

1724
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:32,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1725
02:25:33,511 --> 02:25:34,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

1726
02:25:35,392 --> 02:25:35,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1727
02:25:36,573 --> 02:25:36,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1728
02:25:37,214 --> 02:25:37,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1729
02:25:38,275 --> 02:25:38,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1730
02:25:39,445 --> 02:25:40,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1731
02:25:40,345 --> 02:25:40,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1732
02:25:40,806 --> 02:25:41,566
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello?

1733
02:25:41,626 --> 02:25:43,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I move the motion passes.

1734
02:25:43,147 --> 02:25:52,632
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-1-3-8, I'll provide Vice President Knight, whereas April 5th, 2021 commemorates the 16th anniversary of the passing of the late State Senator Charles E. Shannon Jr.

1735
02:25:52,932 --> 02:26:07,940
[SPEAKER_09]: who represented Medford with integrity and compassion in the State Senate and the State Legislature from 1990 to 2005, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in his honor, and be it further resolved that 4-13-21,

1736
02:26:10,408 --> 02:26:13,350
[SPEAKER_09]: 2021 Council meeting be dedicated in his memory.

1737
02:26:13,370 --> 02:26:14,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight.

1738
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:18,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you for entertaining me with this this evening.

1739
02:26:18,972 --> 02:26:24,334
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that I bring forward every year to honor my mentor and my dear friend, the late State Senator Charlie Shannon.

1740
02:26:24,994 --> 02:26:26,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Charlie was a United States Army veteran.

1741
02:26:27,135 --> 02:26:29,656
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a police officer injured in the line of duty.

1742
02:26:29,676 --> 02:26:37,539
[SPEAKER_14]: He served as an elected assessor in the city in the town of Winchester and later on in the Massachusetts State Senate from 1990 until his untimely passing in 2005.

1743
02:26:39,262 --> 02:26:51,492
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing, Mr. President, the child has been gone for so many years and his legacy lives on in this community when you go to places like Shannon Beach or when we go over our budget meetings every year and we talk about the Shannon Public Safety Grants.

1744
02:26:52,452 --> 02:26:59,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Senator Shannon was someone who did a great job for the people of this community and for the people in his district and he's sorely missed.

1745
02:26:59,698 --> 02:27:04,482
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't had a senator like that that performs constituent services the way the child Shannon did in a long time, Mr. President.

1746
02:27:05,062 --> 02:27:06,203
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's just someone that was

1747
02:27:06,912 --> 02:27:19,696
[SPEAKER_14]: a neighborhood guy, a person that was really able to connect to people, someone who I had the pleasure of working for, someone who Councilor Marks had the opportunity to work for, someone who I had the pleasure of working with, with your son Richard in the office as well.

1748
02:27:19,896 --> 02:27:24,057
[SPEAKER_14]: So Charlie was a great guy, did a lot for the community and he's someone who should be remembered.

1749
02:27:24,177 --> 02:27:29,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in offering a moment of silence in his honor this evening.

1750
02:27:30,879 --> 02:27:34,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could just put a little, you know, I got involved,

1751
02:27:35,011 --> 02:27:40,972
[SPEAKER_09]: which with Senator Shannon, when I was the president of the Medford Recreational Hockey League, when they were gonna shut the building down.

1752
02:27:41,552 --> 02:27:45,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was my sort of my first foray into the political world.

1753
02:27:45,153 --> 02:27:49,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had gone to some other people in the legislature and they turned me down.

1754
02:27:50,694 --> 02:27:52,174
[SPEAKER_09]: And I ended up with Senator Shannon.

1755
02:27:52,254 --> 02:27:56,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason you have McCarthy-Rink today is because of Senator Shannon.

1756
02:27:56,315 --> 02:28:00,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And then since then we developed a friendship over the many years.

1757
02:28:00,516 --> 02:28:02,176
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been a good friend to me and my family.

1758
02:28:02,777 --> 02:28:04,837
[SPEAKER_09]: My son worked for him for a couple of summers.

1759
02:28:05,596 --> 02:28:07,299
[SPEAKER_09]: along with Vice President Knight.

1760
02:28:07,339 --> 02:28:12,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, he's been a friend and it's one of the reasons I'm sitting here tonight.

1761
02:28:12,225 --> 02:28:15,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I thank him for the things he's taught me over the years.

1762
02:28:15,549 --> 02:28:18,814
[SPEAKER_09]: And I support Vice President Knight on this.

1763
02:28:19,535 --> 02:28:21,157
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could all rise for a moment of silence.

1764
02:28:45,879 --> 02:28:47,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor, yes.

1765
02:28:49,221 --> 02:28:49,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1766
02:28:50,621 --> 02:28:50,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1767
02:28:52,102 --> 02:28:52,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1768
02:28:53,783 --> 02:28:54,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1769
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:56,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1770
02:28:56,944 --> 02:28:58,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, 70 affirmative motion passes.

1771
02:28:58,845 --> 02:29:12,392
[SPEAKER_09]: 21319 offered by Vice President Knight, whereas there is an ongoing investigation into the snow plowing operations in the city of Medford and whereas the investigation is being handled by an outside private consultant being so resolved

1772
02:29:13,203 --> 02:29:19,787
[SPEAKER_09]: that the city administration, in the interest of transparency, provide the Medford City Council with the following information.

1773
02:29:19,967 --> 02:29:26,091
[SPEAKER_09]: One, description of the alleged infraction, violation or misconduct being investigated.

1774
02:29:26,131 --> 02:29:29,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, cost and scope of the private consultant contract.

1775
02:29:30,094 --> 02:29:36,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Three, explanation as to why the community was not notified of the allegations resulting in this investigation.

1776
02:29:37,019 --> 02:29:37,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight.

1777
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:39,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1778
02:29:39,641 --> 02:29:45,123
[SPEAKER_14]: At this time, I'd like to amend the paper and withdraw items one through three and replace it with the following language.

1779
02:29:45,723 --> 02:29:52,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it so resolved, the Medford City Council and the city administration in the interest of transparency, convene an executive session to discuss.

1780
02:29:54,527 --> 02:29:55,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Mr. Clerk.

1781
02:29:57,068 --> 02:30:01,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas this is an ongoing investigation, Mr. President, I just want to have an opportunity to be informed as to what's going on.

1782
02:30:01,970 --> 02:30:03,271
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if there is any

1783
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:06,361
[SPEAKER_14]: wrongdoing going on down there.

1784
02:30:06,401 --> 02:30:07,781
[SPEAKER_14]: It is an ongoing investigation.

1785
02:30:08,201 --> 02:30:13,504
[SPEAKER_14]: However, in the interest of transparency, I do think it's important that this council is informed as to what's going on.

1786
02:30:14,444 --> 02:30:25,890
[SPEAKER_14]: We think back to last term, we think back to a couple of items that occurred and the then-councilor, now mayor, was very, very concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding the investigations into those items.

1787
02:30:25,930 --> 02:30:31,653
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's only proper that this council be afforded the same courtesies that she expected when she sat on this board.

1788
02:30:31,973 --> 02:30:34,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

1789
02:30:35,493 --> 02:30:44,963
[SPEAKER_09]: for discussion on the motion by vice-president as amended by constant a second by constant Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1790
02:30:47,966 --> 02:30:48,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Council bears.

1791
02:30:49,427 --> 02:30:49,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1792
02:30:50,609 --> 02:30:51,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1793
02:30:51,530 --> 02:30:51,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1794
02:30:52,270 --> 02:30:53,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President night.

1795
02:30:53,131 --> 02:30:53,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1796
02:30:53,752 --> 02:30:54,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilmarks.

1797
02:30:54,673 --> 02:30:54,973
Yes.

1798
02:30:55,394 --> 02:30:56,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Morell.

1799
02:30:56,435 --> 02:30:56,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1800
02:30:57,616 --> 02:30:58,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Scarpelli.

1801
02:30:58,988 --> 02:30:59,748
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello.

1802
02:30:59,768 --> 02:31:02,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Senator, affirmative motion passes.

1803
02:31:02,830 --> 02:31:14,976
[SPEAKER_09]: 21320 offered by Vice President Lay, President Caraviello, being so resolved that the Medford Historic District Commission examined the feasibility and report back to the council on its findings on the establishment of a self-referred Italian American heritage district.

1804
02:31:15,016 --> 02:31:15,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Lay.

1805
02:31:16,096 --> 02:31:17,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1806
02:31:18,077 --> 02:31:22,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody who's lived in this community for a number of years understands the rite of passage.

1807
02:31:22,379 --> 02:31:26,461
[SPEAKER_14]: We are a family that was born and raised in the North End.

1808
02:31:26,854 --> 02:31:35,463
[SPEAKER_14]: then ended up somewhere in South Medford for a period of time and settled roots there, and then they made their trek, their migration north to probably Stoneham.

1809
02:31:36,003 --> 02:31:47,735
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a story in every family, Mr. President, that says that they had someone that they knew that was from the North End and ended up moving to South Medford, and South Medford was a very vibrant Italian-American neighborhood, Mr. President.

1810
02:31:50,097 --> 02:31:51,758
[SPEAKER_14]: The neighborhoods get gentrified and time changes.

1811
02:31:51,818 --> 02:31:58,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's very important that we remember the Italian American heritage and the roots in that neighborhood that have made Medford such a strong community.

1812
02:31:59,101 --> 02:32:02,843
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank you for joining me in co-sponsoring this resolution.

1813
02:32:03,223 --> 02:32:07,305
[SPEAKER_14]: And I ask my council colleagues to support sending this item to the Historical District Commission for review.

1814
02:32:07,925 --> 02:32:11,287
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all too often that we talk about establishing historical districts in this community.

1815
02:32:11,627 --> 02:32:16,489
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is just one opportunity for us to look at that and maybe capitalize on some of our great history here in Medford.

1816
02:32:16,509 --> 02:32:19,050
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I do ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

1817
02:32:20,161 --> 02:32:20,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1818
02:32:21,002 --> 02:32:25,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I just want to reiterate that I want to thank the Vice President for including me on this.

1819
02:32:25,266 --> 02:32:28,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, that's where I'm from.

1820
02:32:28,669 --> 02:32:30,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I started in South Medford.

1821
02:32:30,130 --> 02:32:30,910
[SPEAKER_09]: I moved to school there.

1822
02:32:31,831 --> 02:32:33,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I have many friends there that still live there.

1823
02:32:34,253 --> 02:32:42,921
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I think this is something, if we're going to establish a district, this is where most of the Italian people who came to Medford are residing.

1824
02:32:46,687 --> 02:32:48,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other further discussion on this?

1825
02:32:48,508 --> 02:32:53,111
[SPEAKER_14]: It's important, Mr. President, to think about all the great people that came before us that grew up in that neighborhood.

1826
02:32:53,151 --> 02:33:01,415
[SPEAKER_14]: We talk about, like, Dolly Petrala, who was the youngest licensed hairstylist in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in history, 15 years old, business owner.

1827
02:33:01,956 --> 02:33:09,120
[SPEAKER_14]: We talk about someone like Arthur de la Rousseau, who did so much for the neighborhood and for immigrants coming into Massachusetts and into this country.

1828
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:12,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's important that we remember them and hold them in high regard, Mr. President.

1829
02:33:12,482 --> 02:33:20,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone like Alderman Martini, who grew up on Method Street, was one of the founders of the Italian Little Children, for example.

1830
02:33:20,467 --> 02:33:22,328
[SPEAKER_14]: All grew up right in South Method, right around Tufts Park.

1831
02:33:22,848 --> 02:33:27,571
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's something that I think is worth consideration and worth examination, Mr. President.

1832
02:33:27,591 --> 02:33:29,672
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, on the motion by Vice President Knight, second and by.

1833
02:33:30,072 --> 02:33:30,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1834
02:33:30,372 --> 02:33:30,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1835
02:33:31,093 --> 02:33:32,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bearst.

1836
02:33:33,694 --> 02:33:34,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1837
02:33:34,535 --> 02:33:36,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just like to make an amendment.

1838
02:33:36,356 --> 02:33:38,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time we were discussing historic districts,

1839
02:33:38,966 --> 02:33:41,308
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the issues was we don't have a timeline.

1840
02:33:41,328 --> 02:33:41,949
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a plan.

1841
02:33:41,969 --> 02:33:44,311
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a list of any potential districts in the city.

1842
02:33:44,371 --> 02:33:56,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like an amendment to make an amendment asking the historic district commission to provide a timeline for the creation of a plan outlining potential historic districts across the city.

1843
02:33:56,041 --> 02:33:57,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1844
02:33:57,963 --> 02:34:00,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support that motion.

1845
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:05,109
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was a similar motion that I made in the budget hearings in 2016 and we're still waiting for it.

1846
02:34:07,102 --> 02:34:09,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, on the motion by- Mr. President.

1847
02:34:09,283 --> 02:34:12,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll cut the roll, I'm sorry, I didn't see your hand up.

1848
02:34:12,084 --> 02:34:14,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, no, I did, Miriam Broxson has her hand up.

1849
02:34:15,626 --> 02:34:16,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Who has her hand up?

1850
02:34:16,647 --> 02:34:20,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Miriam Broxson, I believe Sharon Diaz has her hand up as well, I think.

1851
02:34:20,669 --> 02:34:22,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Miriam Broxson.

1852
02:34:22,229 --> 02:34:22,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Miriam Broxson.

1853
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:26,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, please.

1854
02:34:26,851 --> 02:34:28,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Miriam Broxson, Exchange Avenue, Medford.

1855
02:34:29,433 --> 02:34:30,133
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have a question.

1856
02:34:30,193 --> 02:34:34,255
[SPEAKER_18]: What exactly does that mean when you say it's declaring a historical district?

1857
02:34:34,738 --> 02:34:40,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Does that mean that money will be put into the area or does that mean that we get a plaque?

1858
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:43,441
[SPEAKER_18]: What exactly comes with that designation?

1859
02:34:43,461 --> 02:34:48,883
[SPEAKER_18]: As someone who lives in South Method, I'm just curious of what that would mean for my area.

1860
02:34:48,903 --> 02:35:00,746
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be an opportunity for stewardship between members of the Italian American community and members of our administration to sit down and discuss certain aspects of our history in that neighborhood and see if we can shed light on it.

1861
02:35:00,766 --> 02:35:02,807
[SPEAKER_14]: When I think of this and I talk about it, I envision

1862
02:35:03,334 --> 02:35:16,642
[SPEAKER_14]: storyboards and that crazy cutout that they just put in down in Tufts Square that would say, you know, with maybe some old pictures that would have stories about very significant individuals that grew up in the neighborhood that were contributory, that contributed to the greatness of our community.

1863
02:35:17,023 --> 02:35:22,066
[SPEAKER_14]: We could talk about the tragic fire that occurred down there in South Medford, the lives that were lost.

1864
02:35:22,166 --> 02:35:24,207
[SPEAKER_14]: We could talk about a number of items.

1865
02:35:24,587 --> 02:35:30,551
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, really it's a way to preserve history, to determine that this is a show that we really value.

1866
02:35:31,158 --> 02:35:35,461
[SPEAKER_14]: the effort individuals in that neighborhood made that are from Italian-American descent.

1867
02:35:35,521 --> 02:35:46,768
[SPEAKER_14]: At one point in time, you couldn't walk through that neighborhood without finding, you know, individuals that spoke fluent Italian right in the front yard.

1868
02:35:46,868 --> 02:35:55,273
[SPEAKER_14]: It's changed a lot over the years, but there's still a significant population there that respects or honors the Italians.

1869
02:35:55,393 --> 02:36:00,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a good way to bring the community together during a period of division as well.

1870
02:36:03,418 --> 02:36:05,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1871
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:05,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Sharon D'Eso.

1872
02:36:10,184 --> 02:36:14,028
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, everyone, and thank you for the... Here I am.

1873
02:36:14,048 --> 02:36:14,709
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1874
02:36:15,669 --> 02:36:17,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you hear me now, President Caraviello?

1875
02:36:17,911 --> 02:36:19,313
[SPEAKER_09]: We can hear you.

1876
02:36:20,093 --> 02:36:21,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, Sharon.

1877
02:36:22,255 --> 02:36:22,856
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1878
02:36:23,697 --> 02:36:25,178
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for the time tonight.

1879
02:36:28,914 --> 02:36:33,275
[SPEAKER_23]: Sharon Deyeso Circuit Road Mass Ave in Medford.

1880
02:36:33,775 --> 02:36:36,896
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to just take a second here of your time.

1881
02:36:37,657 --> 02:36:41,418
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to get rid of this TV that's over here.

1882
02:36:41,658 --> 02:36:42,678
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1883
02:36:44,219 --> 02:36:48,480
[SPEAKER_23]: I just heard the presentation by Mr. Knight with a novel idea.

1884
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:56,982
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if that entails certain streets or what will happen during this promotion that he mentioned.

1885
02:36:57,062 --> 02:36:58,663
[SPEAKER_23]: Frankly, I think it's insulting.

1886
02:36:59,281 --> 02:37:08,944
[SPEAKER_23]: to people who have spent a lot of time and efforts in writing letters to have the school committee be for us this decision.

1887
02:37:08,964 --> 02:37:14,266
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanna make a quick comment, and I do thank all the councilmen for their time.

1888
02:37:15,186 --> 02:37:19,287
[SPEAKER_23]: You've seized the moment, so I'm going to seize the moment while we're on this subject.

1889
02:37:20,308 --> 02:37:24,689
[SPEAKER_23]: Two publications during the last few weeks,

1890
02:37:25,236 --> 02:37:28,778
[SPEAKER_23]: printed my article regarding the Columbus School.

1891
02:37:28,798 --> 02:37:30,439
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not.

1892
02:37:32,020 --> 02:37:34,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we're not addressing the Columbus School.

1893
02:37:35,422 --> 02:37:40,224
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm talking about No, I want to talk about the Italian notion if you would just bear with me for a second.

1894
02:37:40,764 --> 02:37:45,127
[SPEAKER_23]: So that whole issue in the issue tonight too is not about being Italian.

1895
02:37:46,434 --> 02:37:57,963
[SPEAKER_23]: It's about sort of, this is sort of like a band-aid on assuaging Italian feelings, I think right now, and don't be insulted because I'm a supporter of Adam Knight.

1896
02:37:58,364 --> 02:37:59,645
[SPEAKER_23]: He does his homework.

1897
02:38:00,966 --> 02:38:12,115
[SPEAKER_23]: I think this really needs to have a close examination before people really vote on a historic review of this until the Columbus School issue is really resolved.

1898
02:38:12,635 --> 02:38:14,377
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank you for your time.

1899
02:38:14,697 --> 02:38:22,082
[SPEAKER_23]: people who are concerned about either issue now should definitely write to the school committee, or the mayor, or the council.

1900
02:38:22,502 --> 02:38:25,084
[SPEAKER_23]: If you don't do it now, this won't stop.

1901
02:38:25,544 --> 02:38:27,625
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much and have a good evening.

1902
02:38:28,866 --> 02:38:35,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Laurel Ruma, name and address of the record, please.

1903
02:38:35,590 --> 02:38:37,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Laurel Ruma, 149 Burgett Avenue.

1904
02:38:37,791 --> 02:38:42,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to ask, are there rules that go along with the houses?

1905
02:38:43,925 --> 02:38:45,906
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood is considered a historic district.

1906
02:38:46,426 --> 02:38:48,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you make changes to your house?

1907
02:38:48,466 --> 02:38:50,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you improve your house?

1908
02:38:50,167 --> 02:38:51,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you leave your house as is?

1909
02:38:52,848 --> 02:38:57,329
[SPEAKER_14]: The resolution is before the council is for the historic district commission to examine the feasibility.

1910
02:38:57,389 --> 02:38:59,110
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure that that will come up in their examination.

1911
02:39:01,170 --> 02:39:06,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear that level?

1912
02:39:06,032 --> 02:39:06,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1913
02:39:07,552 --> 02:39:08,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion on this?

1914
02:39:11,374 --> 02:39:12,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Any more questions from the council?

1915
02:39:14,925 --> 02:39:24,828
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Beahs, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1916
02:39:26,709 --> 02:39:27,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1917
02:39:30,290 --> 02:39:30,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Peers.

1918
02:39:31,610 --> 02:39:31,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1919
02:39:32,931 --> 02:39:33,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1920
02:39:33,771 --> 02:39:33,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1921
02:39:34,291 --> 02:39:34,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

1922
02:39:35,091 --> 02:39:35,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1923
02:39:35,711 --> 02:39:36,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1924
02:39:36,752 --> 02:39:37,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1925
02:39:37,332 --> 02:39:37,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1926
02:39:38,372 --> 02:39:38,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1927
02:39:40,033 --> 02:39:40,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1928
02:39:41,033 --> 02:39:41,253
Yes.

1929
02:39:41,933 --> 02:39:42,653
[SPEAKER_09]: President Caraviello.

1930
02:39:42,693 --> 02:39:44,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm confirming the motion passes.

1931
02:39:46,043 --> 02:40:01,351
[SPEAKER_09]: 21321 offered by Councilor Moorlach, whereas the new green line extensions for our currently named Ball Square Station is majority located in South Bevan Inn, whereas accurate naming of stations is essential for wayfinding and placemaking.

1932
02:40:01,371 --> 02:40:14,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so resolved that the City Council requests that the MBTA General Manager Steve Hoflach appropriately name the station as

1933
02:40:15,313 --> 02:40:16,394
[SPEAKER_09]: all square South Medford.

1934
02:40:16,434 --> 02:40:22,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that a copy of this request be sent to our state delegation.

1935
02:40:23,521 --> 02:40:24,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1936
02:40:24,682 --> 02:40:30,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight actually introduced a very similar language requesting the same thing back in January.

1937
02:40:30,688 --> 02:40:37,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason I'm introducing it again in April is at the request of our Greenland Extension Community Working Group members, Jim Silva, Laurel Ruma,

1938
02:40:38,357 --> 02:40:53,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Jennifer Dorsen in Somerville who worked tirelessly on this and because we have not received a response from our original request and neither have any of the other parties who have made the same requests including our own mayor, the mayor of Somerville and Christine Barber.

1939
02:40:53,395 --> 02:40:57,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So we as we are about seven and a half months away from the opening of this station,

1940
02:40:58,747 --> 02:41:08,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Um and just the fact that with the exception of the entrance walkway off the Broadway a bit bridge and the first eight ft from the Boston Avenue entrance, the station sits entirely in the city of Medford.

1941
02:41:09,249 --> 02:41:17,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Um and in South Medford, I'm just asking that this request be sent once more to the general manager to see if we can at least get a response.

1942
02:41:18,191 --> 02:41:20,812
[SPEAKER_03]: If not the answer that we were seeking.

1943
02:41:20,832 --> 02:41:22,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1944
02:41:24,287 --> 02:41:35,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mr. President, and you'll notice in our packets of 33021, we did receive a response from the mayor saying that the mayor's office is in support of this initiative and has reached out to advocate for it as well.

1945
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:36,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1946
02:41:36,890 --> 02:41:39,891
[SPEAKER_14]: 31921 signed Brianne Ong and Corwin, mayor.

1947
02:41:40,511 --> 02:41:42,732
[SPEAKER_14]: So it looks like we're all on the same page here.

1948
02:41:42,792 --> 02:41:50,734
[SPEAKER_14]: For once, Mr. President, the administration and the council, and it's a matter of getting Clerk Hurtubise's former employer on board to see if they can get this done.

1949
02:41:51,383 --> 02:41:59,027
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank Councilor Morell for supporting the result once again, and I move for approval.

1950
02:42:00,308 --> 02:42:10,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

1951
02:42:11,373 --> 02:42:11,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1952
02:42:12,614 --> 02:42:13,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1953
02:42:13,514 --> 02:42:13,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1954
02:42:14,075 --> 02:42:14,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

1955
02:42:14,915 --> 02:42:15,195
Yes.

1956
02:42:15,375 --> 02:42:15,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1957
02:42:16,196 --> 02:42:16,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1958
02:42:17,196 --> 02:42:17,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1959
02:42:18,217 --> 02:42:18,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1960
02:42:19,337 --> 02:42:20,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1961
02:42:20,318 --> 02:42:20,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1962
02:42:20,728 --> 02:42:21,188
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello.

1963
02:42:21,208 --> 02:42:21,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1964
02:42:22,088 --> 02:42:26,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank my colleagues who have supported this over the last several weeks.

1965
02:42:26,389 --> 02:42:31,690
[SPEAKER_09]: As we all know, Verizon is in the process of rolling out 5G throughout our community.

1966
02:42:31,830 --> 02:42:34,551
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, Mr. President,

1967
02:42:50,980 --> 02:42:55,844
[SPEAKER_13]: this process has been lackluster at the very best.

1968
02:42:56,805 --> 02:42:59,086
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been insufficient community outreach.

1969
02:43:00,027 --> 02:43:19,521
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if you attended any of the two hearings that have taken place so far, you will hear that from residents, even the emails we receive and the phone calls that many residents feel left out of the process, feel that they haven't had any decision making within this process.

1970
02:43:20,123 --> 02:43:22,885
[SPEAKER_13]: and feel that their concerns don't matter.

1971
02:43:23,545 --> 02:43:26,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's their own feeling and their own opinion.

1972
02:43:26,887 --> 02:43:33,371
[SPEAKER_13]: And residents are entitled to that, Mr. President, because indeed, I have the same feeling, Mr. President.

1973
02:43:34,192 --> 02:43:37,914
[SPEAKER_13]: And I attended both meetings that were held, both public hearings.

1974
02:43:38,695 --> 02:43:48,101
[SPEAKER_13]: And to say that the public hearing is a place to allow for public comment, I believe falls short of the mark

1975
02:43:49,123 --> 02:43:56,769
[SPEAKER_13]: when residents are given two minutes to speak and really can't get their message out within that period of time.

1976
02:43:57,750 --> 02:44:05,956
[SPEAKER_13]: If we recall back a little over a year ago, I believe it was, there was a meeting up here with well over 100 residents that got canceled.

1977
02:44:06,737 --> 02:44:15,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Then there was a follow-up meeting, as Council Vice President Knight refers to, that was held by the city in Verizon, and it was like a science fair.

1978
02:44:16,243 --> 02:44:36,861
[SPEAKER_13]: that you come in and you just walk around to different exhibits that were laid out here in the chamber, and you never really got to sit down and hear what other residents have to say, never got really to participate in a back and forth dialogue, and I believe that was part of the insufficiency regarding community outreach.

1979
02:44:36,921 --> 02:44:38,523
[SPEAKER_13]: The city, Mr. President,

1980
02:44:39,116 --> 02:44:40,916
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's no reflection on the board members.

1981
02:44:40,956 --> 02:44:54,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope they don't take it personal on the small 5G, but the city was ill prepared for this much anticipated 5G hearing that took place, the two that took place over the last two weeks.

1982
02:44:54,759 --> 02:45:05,141
[SPEAKER_13]: The city did not present one subject matter expert, but relied heavily on Verizon and their subject matter experts.

1983
02:45:06,101 --> 02:45:08,822
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that lends itself right there, Mr. President,

1984
02:45:09,246 --> 02:45:13,508
[SPEAKER_13]: to people in the community feeling that there's no one there looking out for their interest.

1985
02:45:14,389 --> 02:45:16,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think they have every right to believe so.

1986
02:45:17,190 --> 02:45:24,053
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had ample time to bring a subject matter expert on board that can give us some guidance.

1987
02:45:25,474 --> 02:45:36,500
[SPEAKER_13]: People I've spoken with aren't necessarily against 5G, they're concerned with the proximity of 5G to their home, to their bedroom, to their front porch, to where their kids play.

1988
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:39,021
[SPEAKER_13]: That's their concern and they have every right

1989
02:45:39,434 --> 02:45:40,917
[SPEAKER_13]: to be concerned, Mr. President.

1990
02:45:41,538 --> 02:45:48,192
[SPEAKER_13]: I think right now where the next public hearing is coming up to finish off the remaining 20

1991
02:45:49,702 --> 02:45:50,403
[SPEAKER_13]: applications.

1992
02:45:50,463 --> 02:45:51,944
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe there are 44 altogether.

1993
02:45:52,285 --> 02:45:55,008
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe there's roughly 20 left or right around that.

1994
02:45:55,488 --> 02:45:56,749
[SPEAKER_13]: The next hearing is coming up.

1995
02:45:57,410 --> 02:45:59,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And we should be discussing next steps now.

1996
02:46:00,533 --> 02:46:11,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Because from what we heard, Mr. President, this was the first of many applications that are going to be submitted, not only by Verizon, but other vendors as well.

1997
02:46:12,465 --> 02:46:33,921
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we learned from this first process a number of things, of which that the small ad hoc small cell committee, we need to prepare for the next round of anticipated applications and putting safeguards out there that

1998
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:39,102
[SPEAKER_13]: will indeed address resident concerns and next step suggestions.

1999
02:46:39,622 --> 02:46:51,268
[SPEAKER_13]: So tonight, Mr. President, and I know the clerk is looking at me with an evil eye, because we've often, this council has approved so many amendments and suggestions, but Mr. Clerk, just bear with me.

2000
02:46:52,528 --> 02:46:57,891
[SPEAKER_13]: The next steps, Mr. President, we have to look at discussing improving the public outreach.

2001
02:46:59,071 --> 02:47:02,593
[SPEAKER_13]: If we continue to have a process where people feel left out,

2002
02:47:04,406 --> 02:47:10,632
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to make this process very difficult, not just for 5G, in general going forward.

2003
02:47:10,972 --> 02:47:20,241
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to devise a better way of reaching out to the community, getting feedback, implementing that feedback, and doing additional public outreach.

2004
02:47:20,842 --> 02:47:26,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Just notifying people of a public hearing, in my opinion, is not enough public outreach.

2005
02:47:26,987 --> 02:47:28,489
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to discuss immediately

2006
02:47:29,193 --> 02:47:35,819
[SPEAKER_13]: to bring a consultant on board that has 5G expertise to protect our city's interests.

2007
02:47:36,359 --> 02:47:38,040
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not too late, Mr. President.

2008
02:47:38,721 --> 02:47:40,142
[SPEAKER_13]: That has to happen immediately.

2009
02:47:40,783 --> 02:47:51,111
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to discuss amending the existing interim policy or creating a new ordinance to add community input and additional health and safety guides.

2010
02:47:51,691 --> 02:47:56,876
[SPEAKER_13]: This council over the last year and a half has offered probably close to 18 to 20 amendments

2011
02:47:59,176 --> 02:48:12,211
[SPEAKER_13]: asking the city administration to look at the interim policy and make some changes based on what we believe could provide some protection for our community and answer some questions in our community.

2012
02:48:12,712 --> 02:48:14,434
[SPEAKER_13]: That is yet to happen, Mr. President.

2013
02:48:15,095 --> 02:48:18,679
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not opposed to creating an ordinance at the time, if we recall,

2014
02:48:19,278 --> 02:48:25,969
[SPEAKER_13]: The interim policy was created because Verizon approached the city back in 2019.

2015
02:48:26,510 --> 02:48:29,274
[SPEAKER_13]: They sat down with the city administration back in 2019.

2016
02:48:32,011 --> 02:48:34,052
[SPEAKER_13]: They sat with the city engineer.

2017
02:48:34,252 --> 02:48:35,532
[SPEAKER_13]: They sat with the board of health.

2018
02:48:35,933 --> 02:48:38,914
[SPEAKER_13]: They sat with the city solicitor at the time.

2019
02:48:39,254 --> 02:48:40,835
[SPEAKER_13]: They sat with the mayor at the time.

2020
02:48:41,515 --> 02:48:43,496
[SPEAKER_13]: And Verizon said, we're coming into the community.

2021
02:48:43,916 --> 02:48:51,359
[SPEAKER_13]: The city was under the gun to create some type of policy, some type of mechanism to hold Verizon accountable.

2022
02:48:51,699 --> 02:48:56,341
[SPEAKER_13]: They put forward an interim policy within a matter of 24 to 48 hours.

2023
02:48:56,701 --> 02:49:00,863
[SPEAKER_13]: They sent it to the council after creating this interim policy.

2024
02:49:01,403 --> 02:49:06,644
[SPEAKER_13]: And we use that as a guide, Mr. President, knowing these applications were being submitted.

2025
02:49:07,065 --> 02:49:15,627
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing that prevents us as a community to creating an ordinance now, enhancing the existing interim policy.

2026
02:49:16,047 --> 02:49:20,508
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, an interim policy has the same teeth as an ordinance.

2027
02:49:21,141 --> 02:49:24,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we already have the current document, let's work with the current document.

2028
02:49:25,183 --> 02:49:28,065
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm open to any suggestions, Mr. President.

2029
02:49:28,525 --> 02:49:43,574
[SPEAKER_13]: We also need to start immediately to discuss expanding the ad hoc small cell committee to include resident participation on the small cell committee and an expert in 5G on this committee.

2030
02:49:45,315 --> 02:49:48,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Why would you create a committee with an even number of members?

2031
02:49:49,554 --> 02:49:51,215
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens with a two-to-two vote?

2032
02:49:52,696 --> 02:49:53,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Can anyone tell me?

2033
02:49:55,018 --> 02:49:56,299
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens with a two-to-two vote?

2034
02:49:57,319 --> 02:49:58,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's denied.

2035
02:49:59,221 --> 02:50:01,162
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes no sense, Mr. President.

2036
02:50:02,103 --> 02:50:06,085
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of these things can be done at the wave of a pen.

2037
02:50:06,686 --> 02:50:07,446
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all it takes.

2038
02:50:08,187 --> 02:50:12,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, an interim policy is far less rigid than an ordinance.

2039
02:50:13,791 --> 02:50:17,053
[SPEAKER_13]: It's far less rigid, and it could be far more fluid

2040
02:50:17,478 --> 02:50:23,201
[SPEAKER_13]: and changes and thinking and quick reactions, Mr. President, to safeguard this community.

2041
02:50:24,122 --> 02:50:25,763
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to discuss mitigation.

2042
02:50:26,463 --> 02:50:27,684
[SPEAKER_13]: This council has voted on it.

2043
02:50:27,704 --> 02:50:28,845
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll bring it up again.

2044
02:50:29,585 --> 02:50:31,446
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to discuss mitigation.

2045
02:50:32,247 --> 02:50:42,553
[SPEAKER_13]: This council has requested 7-0 to ask the small ad hoc committee to stop moving forward on applications.

2046
02:50:44,966 --> 02:51:06,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Last week, last Thursday, when they brought it up, I specifically mentioned that one recommendation, even though we voted on a number of recommendations, and we were told by the lawyer from KP Law, not our own lawyer, that not quite sure that has any bearing that the council wants the small cell committee to stop at this point.

2047
02:51:06,677 --> 02:51:08,078
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we were told, Mr. President.

2048
02:51:09,264 --> 02:51:20,768
[SPEAKER_14]: So, vice president night, what Councilor Marks is saying is that we have a private consultant acting as a lawyer but we don't have a private consultant on the 5g subcommittee that acts in the interest of the people's health.

2049
02:51:22,249 --> 02:51:22,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Well put.

2050
02:51:23,249 --> 02:51:24,350
[SPEAKER_13]: That's exactly what's happening.

2051
02:51:24,830 --> 02:51:27,031
[SPEAKER_13]: That's exactly what's happening right now, Mr. President.

2052
02:51:28,553 --> 02:51:36,578
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is a major issue, Mr. President, that recommendations by the community and by the council are being ignored, in my opinion.

2053
02:51:36,938 --> 02:51:42,561
[SPEAKER_13]: When you have a unanimous vote by the council, it should carry some merit in some way, Mr. President.

2054
02:51:42,841 --> 02:51:44,522
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's no rush to judgment.

2055
02:51:44,862 --> 02:51:52,347
[SPEAKER_13]: No matter what 90-day shock rock we keep hearing, that Verizon is saying, Method, you're on a 90-day shock rock.

2056
02:51:52,747 --> 02:51:56,189
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in the middle of a pandemic, Mr. President, for the last 14 months.

2057
02:51:57,315 --> 02:51:58,435
[SPEAKER_13]: in the middle of a pandemic.

2058
02:51:58,995 --> 02:52:02,256
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, indeed, Verizon submitted their applications a while back.

2059
02:52:02,616 --> 02:52:09,457
[SPEAKER_13]: But this community has every right to test out what's going to happen in this community, and every right to stand up.

2060
02:52:09,817 --> 02:52:26,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though FCC regulations may say you can't discuss certain things like health, and you can't put a moratorium, which are FCC regulations, we have every right as the protectors of our residents and our community to stand up and say, wait a minute.

2061
02:52:26,707 --> 02:52:28,088
[SPEAKER_13]: we want to take a closer look.

2062
02:52:28,709 --> 02:52:32,612
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're not going to go by any 90-day shot clock, Mr. President.

2063
02:52:33,713 --> 02:52:54,811
[SPEAKER_13]: We also need to discuss a community meeting with our state and federal delegation to address the 5G rollout and the concerns we have with the FCC regulations and this declaratory regulation that ties the hands of local municipalities, that does not allow local municipalities to make their own decisions.

2064
02:52:56,380 --> 02:53:03,783
[SPEAKER_13]: The last thing we need are people up in Congress and people up in the White House, Mr. President, to be making local decisions.

2065
02:53:04,423 --> 02:53:06,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows best about local government?

2066
02:53:07,844 --> 02:53:09,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Not the people sitting in Congress.

2067
02:53:09,685 --> 02:53:11,686
[SPEAKER_13]: I can assure you that, Mr. President.

2068
02:53:13,547 --> 02:53:19,189
[SPEAKER_13]: I would also ask, Mr. President, and this is a process of proven suggestion.

2069
02:53:20,690 --> 02:53:22,450
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking about the process.

2070
02:53:22,850 --> 02:53:24,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now when Verizon comes in,

2071
02:53:25,029 --> 02:53:26,470
[SPEAKER_13]: They fill out an application.

2072
02:53:27,090 --> 02:53:31,112
[SPEAKER_13]: They submit their location criteria, where they think the best poll is.

2073
02:53:31,653 --> 02:53:36,175
[SPEAKER_13]: They submit their insurance binder, they're saying they have enough insurance.

2074
02:53:36,675 --> 02:53:40,817
[SPEAKER_13]: They submit a lot of different paperwork, and they submit it to the city.

2075
02:53:41,138 --> 02:53:44,980
[SPEAKER_13]: This is where we'd like to be, in front of 102 Main Street.

2076
02:53:47,121 --> 02:53:48,662
[SPEAKER_13]: And that person that lives at 102 Main Street,

2077
02:53:50,319 --> 02:53:51,299
[SPEAKER_13]: then gets notice.

2078
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:57,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Here you are, Verizon wants to be in front of your home, go to a public hearing if you have a problem.

2079
02:53:58,282 --> 02:54:03,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not, Mr. President, why not have an application of interest?

2080
02:54:04,584 --> 02:54:14,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not require through the interim policy that if Verizon or any other entity want to come in the community, the first thing they do is submit an application of interest.

2081
02:54:15,703 --> 02:54:23,908
[SPEAKER_13]: We are interested in coming into the community, and we are interested in going in front of this location, or that location, just of interest.

2082
02:54:24,729 --> 02:54:29,472
[SPEAKER_13]: That would trigger off the city, then, Mr. President, to do guess what?

2083
02:54:29,992 --> 02:54:31,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Public outreach.

2084
02:54:33,814 --> 02:54:39,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not address, Mr. President, if there are people in the community that support 5G,

2085
02:54:40,467 --> 02:54:45,849
[SPEAKER_13]: People in the community don't believe that there may be associated health risks of being that close to the poll.

2086
02:54:46,449 --> 02:54:54,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we reach out to the community and ask those that wouldn't mind having 5G in a poll in front of their home?

2087
02:54:55,833 --> 02:54:57,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like a novel idea.

2088
02:54:59,074 --> 02:55:04,476
[SPEAKER_13]: That way you're not just placing polls, Mr. President, you're asking for public input.

2089
02:55:05,487 --> 02:55:11,368
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you happen to get 20, 40, 50, 60, 100, 200 people that said, you know what?

2090
02:55:12,629 --> 02:55:14,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't mind it in front of my house.

2091
02:55:15,009 --> 02:55:22,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not be armed with that information and then go to Verizon and say, now when you come in, you have your application.

2092
02:55:23,511 --> 02:55:31,393
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the locations, when you do your grid and your networking, these are the locations we prefer you select.

2093
02:55:33,032 --> 02:55:45,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Therefore, we head off all the public resentment, Mr. President, all the concerns that may be out there, which are rightfully so, about being in close proximity to 5G, and we head a lot of that off.

2094
02:55:45,799 --> 02:55:48,020
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a suggestion, Mr. President.

2095
02:55:48,580 --> 02:55:50,321
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's a worthy suggestion.

2096
02:55:50,761 --> 02:56:03,366
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we were sitting around a table discussing this and not just having Verizon force feed us what the next steps are, which is currently happening now, we're being force fed this by Verizon.

2097
02:56:03,786 --> 02:56:09,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Rather than us leading this, we should be leading the discussion, not Verizon.

2098
02:56:10,229 --> 02:56:11,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's the reverse right now.

2099
02:56:12,350 --> 02:56:15,371
[SPEAKER_13]: So I make a motion, Mr. President, that the mayor

2100
02:56:15,959 --> 02:56:21,381
[SPEAKER_13]: amend the interim 5G policy to include similar language that I just proposed.

2101
02:56:21,881 --> 02:56:24,102
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd be willing to sit down with the administration.

2102
02:56:24,482 --> 02:56:31,485
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be willing to sit down with the small cell ad hoc committee to work out some language in their interim policy.

2103
02:56:32,145 --> 02:56:35,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a worthy suggestion to look at, Mr. President.

2104
02:56:36,687 --> 02:56:43,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Mr. President, I think it was quite telling over the last two meetings of the public hearings that

2105
02:56:44,716 --> 02:56:52,697
[SPEAKER_13]: And out of the four board members, there was one board member that voted some petitions up and voted some petitions down.

2106
02:56:54,758 --> 02:56:56,818
[SPEAKER_13]: And the board members have every right to vote.

2107
02:56:57,778 --> 02:57:08,960
[SPEAKER_13]: That board member was the head of the Board of Health, which to me carries an awful lot of weight when we're discussing public health in this community, an awful lot of weight.

2108
02:57:09,700 --> 02:57:12,781
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President,

2109
02:57:13,450 --> 02:57:28,119
[SPEAKER_13]: that we put in the form of a motion, I'd like to know that the Board of Health Director state whether or not 5G is a public health risk to the citizens of Medford.

2110
02:57:31,001 --> 02:57:39,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm asking the Board of Health Director whether or not 5G, she considers 5G a public health risk to the citizens of Medford.

2111
02:57:40,927 --> 02:57:42,348
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we all have the right to know

2112
02:57:43,018 --> 02:57:48,361
[SPEAKER_13]: when someone takes a vote, Mr. President, especially a vote that goes one way, then another way, then another way.

2113
02:57:48,801 --> 02:57:51,403
[SPEAKER_13]: What is the reasoning for that vote, Mr. President?

2114
02:57:51,763 --> 02:57:59,247
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there's a public health concern in this city, I'd like to hear it directly from the horse's mouth, which is the head of the Board of Health.

2115
02:58:00,448 --> 02:58:05,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Also during the meeting, Mr. President, Verizon asked for a waiver.

2116
02:58:06,492 --> 02:58:12,195
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason why they asked for a waiver, Mr. President, was the fact that our policy states that

2117
02:58:12,540 --> 02:58:18,581
[SPEAKER_13]: These small cell antennas have to be located within a shroud or a canister.

2118
02:58:19,562 --> 02:58:21,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Says it right in our policy.

2119
02:58:21,982 --> 02:58:23,323
[SPEAKER_13]: It's black and white.

2120
02:58:24,183 --> 02:58:26,083
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no ands, ifs, or buts about that.

2121
02:58:26,743 --> 02:58:29,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Verizon stated at the public hearing they had their expert.

2122
02:58:31,024 --> 02:58:32,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, we didn't have an expert.

2123
02:58:33,525 --> 02:58:38,866
[SPEAKER_13]: They stated that their 5G cell doesn't work if it's located within a canister.

2124
02:58:40,167 --> 02:58:42,067
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm being told other communities

2125
02:58:43,052 --> 02:58:48,214
[SPEAKER_13]: have asked that, and they are receiving that, Mr. President.

2126
02:58:48,694 --> 02:58:57,196
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm being told that our board is going to give Verizon a waiver to waive that section of the interim policy.

2127
02:58:58,157 --> 02:59:09,020
[SPEAKER_13]: So on one hand, these members can waive policy, but they can't consider amendments offered by an elected board, seven members of the council.

2128
02:59:09,640 --> 02:59:12,221
[SPEAKER_13]: So I find that a little ironic, Mr. President.

2129
02:59:14,094 --> 02:59:15,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Another point, Mr. President.

2130
02:59:18,155 --> 02:59:25,297
[SPEAKER_13]: It was mentioned during one of the meetings by the city engineer, and he could speak for himself, he's a very capable person.

2131
02:59:26,217 --> 02:59:28,518
[SPEAKER_13]: He asked, which I thought was an excellent question.

2132
02:59:29,038 --> 02:59:36,259
[SPEAKER_13]: He said, in my background as an engineer, we do post-testing, I mean pre-testing and post-testing.

2133
02:59:37,240 --> 02:59:42,641
[SPEAKER_13]: So for instance, 5G has this cell device that they wanna locate on our poles.

2134
02:59:44,388 --> 02:59:48,691
[SPEAKER_13]: 5G Verizon does rigorous testing in a control environment.

2135
02:59:50,532 --> 02:59:58,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Then they take the 5G antenna out of that control environment and they locate it on a pole 10 feet from your bedroom window.

2136
03:00:00,577 --> 03:00:03,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Now something goes awry with that 5G.

2137
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:12,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Supposedly Verizon has a mechanism that sends an alarm to Verizon saying we have a concern

2138
03:00:12,591 --> 03:00:14,411
[SPEAKER_13]: This pole, there's something wrong with it.

2139
03:00:14,931 --> 03:00:19,032
[SPEAKER_13]: They may be emitting too much microwaves in that area.

2140
03:00:19,412 --> 03:00:21,673
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not functioning the way it should.

2141
03:00:22,133 --> 03:00:27,514
[SPEAKER_13]: And supposedly, that mechanism will send a truck out, and they'll do the testing they have to do.

2142
03:00:27,534 --> 03:00:32,935
[SPEAKER_13]: The city engineer mentioned a great point.

2143
03:00:33,635 --> 03:00:41,777
[SPEAKER_13]: He said, what about having twice a year, three times a year, quarterly a year to have post-testing?

2144
03:00:42,509 --> 03:00:55,137
[SPEAKER_13]: So Verizon will come out to our 50, 60, 80, 100 locations, which won't take them long, they're a huge company, and test them by hand and make sure they're functioning properly.

2145
03:00:55,398 --> 03:01:09,687
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not relying on a little bell to go off, or you're not relying on some safeguard that who knows, may work in the winter, may not work in the summer, who knows under what conditions, because it hasn't been tested.

2146
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:10,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

2147
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,942
[SPEAKER_13]: It was tested in an environment, a control setting.

2148
03:01:14,362 --> 03:01:19,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And we all know it's not a control setting in the winter, in the summer of New England weather.

2149
03:01:20,385 --> 03:01:22,986
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought that was a great suggestion, Mr. President.

2150
03:01:23,467 --> 03:01:25,708
[SPEAKER_13]: And Verizon pooh-poohed the idea.

2151
03:01:28,169 --> 03:01:31,470
[SPEAKER_13]: But other communities, Burlington, I looked at their policy.

2152
03:01:31,771 --> 03:01:38,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Cambridge, they have it built in for periodic reviews of their 5G.

2153
03:01:39,329 --> 03:01:40,270
[SPEAKER_13]: They have it built in.

2154
03:01:42,131 --> 03:01:44,673
[SPEAKER_13]: But for some reason, I don't know.

2155
03:01:45,073 --> 03:01:47,715
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like we just bend over for Verizon.

2156
03:01:49,856 --> 03:02:08,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, Mr. President, Chapter 74, Section 225 of the Municipal Ordinances of Medford states, not making this up, Section B, extensions

2157
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:15,263
[SPEAKER_13]: shall not be made on any pole without the approval of the superintendent of wires.

2158
03:02:17,764 --> 03:02:22,286
[SPEAKER_13]: So if they have an extension with this device, to me is an extension.

2159
03:02:22,846 --> 03:02:26,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the poles in the city now are higher than other poles.

2160
03:02:26,547 --> 03:02:27,588
[SPEAKER_13]: These are extensions.

2161
03:02:30,429 --> 03:02:34,931
[SPEAKER_13]: That ordinance, Mr. President, has not been followed.

2162
03:02:37,850 --> 03:02:45,692
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to know how many extensions has Verizon put on these locations and other locations.

2163
03:02:46,072 --> 03:03:01,336
[SPEAKER_13]: As we heard, I think it was from Councilor Penta last week or the week before, stating that they've been around the city for well over a year now preparing for this and working on polls that they're not even requesting applications for.

2164
03:03:02,796 --> 03:03:05,457
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are extensions going on, Mr. President.

2165
03:03:06,621 --> 03:03:12,326
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think we should be giving a waiver to a city ordinance, Mr. President.

2166
03:03:16,229 --> 03:03:29,180
[SPEAKER_13]: The last thing, Mr. President, is I believe in many of the conditions that the small ad hoc committee put on, I think we're rightfully so to help benefit this community.

2167
03:03:31,342 --> 03:03:35,165
[SPEAKER_13]: But when you have 12, I think it was 12 last count I had,

2168
03:03:36,216 --> 03:03:43,423
[SPEAKER_13]: 12 conditions on an application, I think it speaks volumes to what is going on.

2169
03:03:44,024 --> 03:03:45,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do we need 12 conditions?

2170
03:03:47,847 --> 03:03:51,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the interim policy is not enough.

2171
03:03:51,731 --> 03:03:54,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the interim policy needs to be tweaked.

2172
03:03:54,574 --> 03:03:59,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the interim policy, Mr. President, needs additional follow-up.

2173
03:04:01,052 --> 03:04:29,894
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that we receive an immediate opinion from the city solicitor, and I'm putting this in the form of a motion, regarding Chapter 74, Section 225, regarding Verizon's poll extensions and whether or not these approvals and this process, Mr. President, should be valid and should continue forward when I believe it's in violation of city municipal ordinance.

2174
03:04:31,755 --> 03:04:35,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank my colleagues for listening again.

2175
03:04:35,376 --> 03:04:41,878
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank them for their support over the last several weeks, many of which have made their opinions known.

2176
03:04:42,518 --> 03:04:53,381
[SPEAKER_13]: And most of all, Mr. President, I want to thank the community for uniting around this issue and making sure whatever is done, Mr. President, we know what the long-term

2177
03:04:54,193 --> 03:04:56,274
[SPEAKER_13]: impacts may be to this community.

2178
03:04:56,734 --> 03:04:59,935
[SPEAKER_13]: And right now, we don't know what the long-term impacts are.

2179
03:05:00,375 --> 03:05:03,036
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's not rush to judgment on this.

2180
03:05:03,076 --> 03:05:03,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2181
03:05:04,277 --> 03:05:05,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Member Rowe.

2182
03:05:06,617 --> 03:05:07,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2183
03:05:07,458 --> 03:05:12,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the points of mitigation and just the interim policy itself.

2184
03:05:13,720 --> 03:05:22,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I also am dismayed that, you know, Verizon's continued language of really having no interest in doing anything for the City of Medford other than getting their place on these polls as fast as possible,

2185
03:05:23,541 --> 03:05:24,381
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're going to be able to do that.

2186
03:05:24,401 --> 03:05:26,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, little regard for any process on our side.

2187
03:05:26,142 --> 03:05:46,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Um I also am in full support of, you know, strengthening the interim policy putting in the form of ordinance accounts remarks also raises a great point in that, um, we're working on these shot clocks where you know Verizon is trying to get in what they want before we can establish something and just simply the length of time it takes by process to get that

2188
03:05:53,041 --> 03:05:59,746
[SPEAKER_03]: know, seek that the administration does what they can with the interim policy because they're able to be agile in a way we cannot.

2189
03:06:01,007 --> 03:06:07,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Listening to last week's meeting, it seems like there was a lot of concern about the setback and the interim policy is not specific in the setback.

2190
03:06:07,931 --> 03:06:16,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It references being able to have a setback, a specific setback distance, but it's not actually prescriptive for that.

2191
03:06:16,550 --> 03:06:26,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something that could definitely be addressed, and I think would assuage a lot of people's concerns, which I'd like to see in the update to the interim policy, or short of that, if when we consider an ordinance.

2192
03:06:26,696 --> 03:06:29,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanna go on record with all that.

2193
03:06:29,618 --> 03:06:30,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

2194
03:06:31,699 --> 03:06:32,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2195
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:33,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2196
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:40,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I can't say it enough, but thank you, Councilor Marks, for your leadership on this huge issue.

2197
03:06:40,244 --> 03:06:42,426
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that, and you may,

2198
03:06:43,988 --> 03:06:45,029
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, questions that you had.

2199
03:06:45,629 --> 03:06:49,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, my question to you is, uh, is there an amendment?

2200
03:06:49,533 --> 03:07:11,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to have an emergency meeting with the mayor, the city administration, the small cell, uh, group to sit down to discuss, um, and find some resolution as we move forward and making sure that I know that there's been talk that, you know, I don't know if, uh, Alicia hunters online,

2201
03:07:12,355 --> 03:07:27,034
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not see her, but I know Alicia did mention that to the public that that out to the public that there was some concerns that this council had the privy to do something we didn't follow through with that.

2202
03:07:28,769 --> 03:07:37,993
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know she said that she didn't, it was a remark, but when it was brought up during the meeting the other evening, she concurred to those statements.

2203
03:07:38,033 --> 03:07:52,019
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanna make sure that as we move forward, we have way too much divide and to have a department head working on putting a divide between the city administration and their department heads.

2204
03:07:52,458 --> 03:07:58,601
[SPEAKER_14]: and this council when we need to be working together to make sure that we're protecting our constituents.

2205
03:07:58,701 --> 03:08:06,225
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure the city administration has the same intentions, but when you have a department head

2206
03:08:07,097 --> 03:08:12,498
[SPEAKER_14]: spewing those lines that we need to make sure that we stop that immediately.

2207
03:08:13,018 --> 03:08:26,521
[SPEAKER_14]: And we call for a meeting, a joint meeting with all parties involved to make sure that we put a stronger policy or like the Councilor Marks that policies is done quicker, it puts forward what we need right away.

2208
03:08:27,021 --> 03:08:33,682
[SPEAKER_14]: But maybe we can talk about setting policy while we're working on an ordinance that will take us a little more time.

2209
03:08:34,783 --> 03:08:37,284
[SPEAKER_14]: If that hasn't, that's not an amendment.

2210
03:08:37,304 --> 03:08:38,845
[SPEAKER_13]: If it wasn't part of it, I'd welcome that.

2211
03:08:38,925 --> 03:08:40,766
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't mind that, I'd call that for an amendment.

2212
03:08:41,406 --> 03:08:52,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Amend this paper to have an emergency meeting with the mayor, the city administration, and the small cell committee, and look to

2213
03:08:54,142 --> 03:09:05,850
[SPEAKER_14]: find some resolutions or some teeth to the existing policy while we move forward with a city ordinance, because this is going to start happening very fast.

2214
03:09:06,471 --> 03:09:06,991
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

2215
03:09:07,932 --> 03:09:09,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2216
03:09:10,354 --> 03:09:11,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2217
03:09:11,935 --> 03:09:16,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to repeat the comments of my fellow Councilors and I promise I won't go on for too long.

2218
03:09:17,339 --> 03:09:21,061
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think it might behoove us also to think even bigger about this.

2219
03:09:21,802 --> 03:09:22,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I think

2220
03:09:23,010 --> 03:09:25,512
[SPEAKER_04]: very likely there will be a 6G and a 7G.

2221
03:09:26,392 --> 03:09:30,876
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have issues with the broadband wired lines in the city right now.

2222
03:09:31,256 --> 03:09:42,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I brought this up at the beginning of this term in January, 2020, but looking into municipal broadband, is it possible for the city to be in ownership of these devices and in that way control the placement?

2223
03:09:43,485 --> 03:09:51,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanna put that idea out there for any future meetings, thinking outside the box of different ways that we could address the issue.

2224
03:09:51,530 --> 03:09:52,651
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2225
03:09:53,715 --> 03:09:54,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2226
03:09:54,736 --> 03:09:58,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So Councilor Marks, you have three motions, correct?

2227
03:10:01,900 --> 03:10:03,001
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three separate motions.

2228
03:10:05,222 --> 03:10:13,127
[SPEAKER_09]: You have one, the first one for the mayor to sit down and review your suggestions that are given.

2229
03:10:13,147 --> 03:10:21,171
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a second one that the Board of Health Director give us her estimate, give us her opinion on the 5G risk.

2230
03:10:23,187 --> 03:10:34,990
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have a third one with an opinion from the solicitor on chapter 74, 225, section B. Am I correct?

2231
03:10:35,651 --> 03:10:36,911
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct, Mr. President.

2232
03:10:37,091 --> 03:10:41,272
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, I guess- As amended by Councilor Scarpelli to have an emergency meeting.

2233
03:10:43,713 --> 03:10:45,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct, correct, yeah, emergency meeting.

2234
03:10:46,094 --> 03:10:50,935
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you want to vote them all in one package or do you want to vote them separately?

2235
03:10:51,280 --> 03:10:53,761
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I have no problem voting them as one, Mr. President.

2236
03:10:53,821 --> 03:11:08,326
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just ask that if we can add the public comments regarding the discussions that we should be having, I laid out, I think it was seven different comments regarding what the next step should be.

2237
03:11:09,027 --> 03:11:16,990
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know if that requires a formal vote, but if we can add that into the minutes of the record, and I can go over them with the city clerk.

2238
03:11:17,870 --> 03:11:18,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2239
03:11:20,111 --> 03:11:20,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk.

2240
03:11:22,469 --> 03:11:23,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor, one question.

2241
03:11:26,091 --> 03:11:27,572
[SPEAKER_14]: You did have a question there.

2242
03:11:28,452 --> 03:11:31,454
[SPEAKER_14]: You had a motion about the Board of Health Director.

2243
03:11:31,474 --> 03:11:35,956
[SPEAKER_14]: You wanted to state whether or not five days of public health risks in the city of New Bedford, correct?

2244
03:11:36,037 --> 03:11:36,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

2245
03:11:37,817 --> 03:11:38,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2246
03:11:39,759 --> 03:11:41,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

2247
03:11:42,760 --> 03:11:44,021
[SPEAKER_11]: The mic isn't.

2248
03:11:44,081 --> 03:11:46,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

2249
03:11:46,782 --> 03:11:51,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that this is an ongoing thing, and I want to compliment Councilor Marks

2250
03:11:52,329 --> 03:12:02,971
[SPEAKER_11]: because speaking throughout the community, he has taken the charge on this particular issue, not to be for or against, but just to bring the awareness and to have some understanding of a communication.

2251
03:12:03,492 --> 03:12:09,113
[SPEAKER_11]: As I said before, this is a $5 billion G5 undertaking by Verizon.

2252
03:12:09,913 --> 03:12:16,434
[SPEAKER_11]: And some two years ago, when they first came into the city and had a discussion on this, they allegedly stated there was 143 locations or 143 polls

2253
03:12:19,053 --> 03:12:22,135
[SPEAKER_11]: that they had identified here in the city of Method as to where they were gonna go.

2254
03:12:22,796 --> 03:12:30,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, these poles are all owned by National Grid and on National Grid's poles, you have fire, you have police, you have alarm systems.

2255
03:12:30,541 --> 03:12:36,085
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all pole renters and they pay National Grid to be on those poles.

2256
03:12:36,185 --> 03:12:45,492
[SPEAKER_11]: And by paying National Grid to be on those poles, National Grid is now receiving a financial inducement, so to speak.

2257
03:12:46,468 --> 03:12:56,193
[SPEAKER_11]: In return, that inducement doesn't find itself anywhere back to the rate payers of National Grid, but all Verizon is doing is getting more and more profit.

2258
03:12:56,754 --> 03:13:05,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not spending $5 billion just for the sake of having $5 billion to spend, because the subscribers to Verizon plans are gonna pay for that in the long run.

2259
03:13:06,159 --> 03:13:13,683
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been no explanation as between 4G to 5G, whether there's anything medically or substantially different,

2260
03:13:14,226 --> 03:13:17,788
[SPEAKER_11]: that could possibly hurt somebody because of the medical portions of that.

2261
03:13:18,448 --> 03:13:33,036
[SPEAKER_11]: So the question then becomes, and alluding back to council Marx's comment, if you have the lady who is a board of health director, who sits on this board of four, which makes no sense at all, but who sits on this board of four, you've had 11 votes so far.

2262
03:13:33,676 --> 03:13:38,719
[SPEAKER_11]: And of those 11 votes, six of them have been against and five of them had been for.

2263
03:13:39,983 --> 03:13:47,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I would strongly suggest that you would ask, some one of you folks, ask a question of why the people voted the way they did.

2264
03:13:48,165 --> 03:14:00,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you understood last week, there was two young ladies here from a certain part of Medford who was concerned about a poll being in front of their house and the poll being in front of their house, not wanting it there, not knowing what the 5G could admit.

2265
03:14:01,748 --> 03:14:05,389
[SPEAKER_11]: So of the five that got approved as compared to the six that didn't get approved,

2266
03:14:06,181 --> 03:14:09,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Do the six have an argument against the five or does the five have an argument against the six?

2267
03:14:10,363 --> 03:14:13,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to play what kind of game is this going to turn out to be?

2268
03:14:13,884 --> 03:14:15,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Who gets it and who doesn't get it?

2269
03:14:15,625 --> 03:14:16,305
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not right.

2270
03:14:16,966 --> 03:14:29,371
[SPEAKER_11]: But the most important thing that I think is missing here that the mayor of this community, having this committee being sent up should have made some kind of an agreement with Verizon as to what the city of Medford is going to get in return

2271
03:14:29,793 --> 03:14:38,457
[SPEAKER_11]: for having Verizon come into this city and go from 4G to 5G, because the only one right now that's going to be making all the money up front is going to be National Grid on the poles.

2272
03:14:38,997 --> 03:14:44,840
[SPEAKER_11]: And Verizon in the long run will get this, whether it goes to 5G, 6G, 7G, who knows, that's not the point.

2273
03:14:44,880 --> 03:14:53,324
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact of the matter is they're here, they were planning for it as of two years ago, whether it's 143 poles or 143 locations, that seems to be the issue.

2274
03:14:54,344 --> 03:14:55,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're going to have this meeting,

2275
03:14:56,345 --> 03:14:59,766
[SPEAKER_11]: this meeting, however this meeting is going to be sent up, what's the logic?

2276
03:15:00,267 --> 03:15:03,528
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the reasoning behind approval and disapproval?

2277
03:15:04,028 --> 03:15:15,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the director of public health voted against it, and even if it was because she felt that it wasn't right for the city, then it's not right for the city all the time, not just part of the time.

2278
03:15:15,913 --> 03:15:21,916
[SPEAKER_11]: And those people that voted for it, as compared to the six times they didn't vote for it, well, what was their logic to it?

2279
03:15:22,569 --> 03:15:33,954
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's very important that if they're going to make a decision, and you said there's 11 requirements on there, then those 11 requirements have to be met by all applicants that come, all 42 applicants.

2280
03:15:34,674 --> 03:15:43,918
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that's being said, there's no logic, there's no rhyme or reason right now to the 11 decisions that have been made thus far, six for, six against, and five for.

2281
03:15:44,459 --> 03:15:45,579
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you justify that?

2282
03:15:45,619 --> 03:15:51,922
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you explain to the city that you have this committee of ongoing people with no experts on there

2283
03:15:52,674 --> 03:15:54,197
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't make any sense at all.

2284
03:15:54,217 --> 03:16:01,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And when the taxpayers can ask that question, you have this subcommittee that's not even odd number, it's even.

2285
03:16:02,830 --> 03:16:14,662
[SPEAKER_11]: and you're being restricted according to FCC that you can't vote because of any medical concerns, but you have your own director of public health on the committee and she votes against it.

2286
03:16:14,722 --> 03:16:17,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what's her logic for voting against it?

2287
03:16:17,505 --> 03:16:20,268
[SPEAKER_11]: What are all the other members who voted against it?

2288
03:16:20,348 --> 03:16:21,329
[SPEAKER_11]: What was their logic?

2289
03:16:21,649 --> 03:16:23,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And what was the logic of the five that got approved?

2290
03:16:24,953 --> 03:16:26,034
[SPEAKER_11]: That's important to know.

2291
03:16:26,795 --> 03:16:29,976
[SPEAKER_11]: because you're going to play playing this game with 40 somewhat applications.

2292
03:16:30,477 --> 03:16:31,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Some get it, some don't.

2293
03:16:32,217 --> 03:16:33,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Some streets get it, some don't.

2294
03:16:34,058 --> 03:16:35,779
[SPEAKER_11]: One house has it, another one doesn't.

2295
03:16:35,799 --> 03:16:37,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And what are you going to do?

2296
03:16:37,260 --> 03:16:42,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Wind up having a lawsuit between people in the city saying, hey, how can you give it to one and not another?

2297
03:16:42,622 --> 03:16:44,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't want it there, but you let it be there.

2298
03:16:44,983 --> 03:16:51,566
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good suggestion you came up with, Councilor Marks, because if somebody wants to come and put a poll in a particular area, then maybe they should

2299
03:16:52,102 --> 03:16:58,125
[SPEAKER_11]: come in advance, say this is where we'd like to do it, and get a find out, let's find out if people are for it or against it.

2300
03:16:59,106 --> 03:17:09,391
[SPEAKER_11]: But the one thing you forgot to mention on whether it's Burlington or Cambridge, they've got a committee, they've got a committee that's uniform, either it's for or against, it's not split.

2301
03:17:09,872 --> 03:17:15,915
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're dealing with a subcommittee or whatever you want to call this committee, that's split, you have no professionals,

2302
03:17:16,445 --> 03:17:19,626
[SPEAKER_11]: No medical experts, you definitely don't have any technical experts.

2303
03:17:20,026 --> 03:17:27,689
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that being said, how can anybody trust that whether 5G is better than 4G, medically or otherwise, it doesn't exist.

2304
03:17:28,369 --> 03:17:37,632
[SPEAKER_11]: But this city is allowing a multi-billion dollar corporation to come in and right now, nobody knows if the city of Medford is getting anything.

2305
03:17:38,172 --> 03:17:42,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody knows if this mayor has made any kind of an agreement with Verizon to come in here and do it.

2306
03:17:43,354 --> 03:17:45,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And the only ones that are gonna get rich in the long run

2307
03:17:46,596 --> 03:17:51,301
[SPEAKER_11]: is going to be rising in the long run and national grid up front, and your rates aren't going to go down.

2308
03:17:52,002 --> 03:17:53,644
[SPEAKER_11]: So what have you accomplished?

2309
03:17:53,804 --> 03:17:56,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Or better yet, you've allowed somebody to come in.

2310
03:17:57,067 --> 03:17:57,648
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great.

2311
03:17:57,728 --> 03:18:00,611
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have this meeting with that subcommittee, with the mayor.

2312
03:18:01,852 --> 03:18:06,196
[SPEAKER_11]: with the legal counsel that you have, and you should bring in a medical and you should bring in a legal expert.

2313
03:18:06,257 --> 03:18:09,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't make any difference if FCC rules and regulations say you can't vote on that.

2314
03:18:10,140 --> 03:18:16,887
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a determination because if the person that's on the committee is medically entitled with the knowledge to know that the 5Gs

2315
03:18:18,032 --> 03:18:19,852
[SPEAKER_11]: will not work in behalf of the city.

2316
03:18:19,872 --> 03:18:22,513
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't pick and choose what part of the city you want it to go in.

2317
03:18:22,893 --> 03:18:24,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It either is or it isn't.

2318
03:18:24,533 --> 03:18:27,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Your technical person will say either it is or it isn't.

2319
03:18:27,454 --> 03:18:29,295
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't go from 4G to 5G.

2320
03:18:29,575 --> 03:18:32,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's your expert to tell you what's the difference between the two?

2321
03:18:32,355 --> 03:18:33,375
[SPEAKER_11]: That hasn't even come out.

2322
03:18:35,216 --> 03:18:35,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2323
03:18:36,176 --> 03:18:37,236
[SPEAKER_11]: That hasn't even come out.

2324
03:18:38,457 --> 03:18:39,637
[SPEAKER_11]: These are important questions.

2325
03:18:39,677 --> 03:18:42,437
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've already voted on 11 applications.

2326
03:18:43,478 --> 03:18:44,578
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make any sense.

2327
03:18:45,438 --> 03:18:51,003
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't run a professional business on something such as this and then be left out in the cold.

2328
03:18:51,404 --> 03:18:53,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And here are seven of you trying to ask questions.

2329
03:18:53,806 --> 03:18:59,231
[SPEAKER_11]: You have one city council who took the bull by the horns and the people appreciate that.

2330
03:18:59,251 --> 03:19:00,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate that.

2331
03:19:00,112 --> 03:19:02,114
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think all seven of you appreciate it.

2332
03:19:02,474 --> 03:19:05,077
[SPEAKER_11]: But the fact of the matter is one simple question.

2333
03:19:06,418 --> 03:19:08,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's running the show here, Verizon?

2334
03:19:09,909 --> 03:19:11,871
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't know, they seem to be running the show.

2335
03:19:12,271 --> 03:19:13,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it National Grid?

2336
03:19:13,272 --> 03:19:14,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's their poll.

2337
03:19:14,933 --> 03:19:16,174
[SPEAKER_11]: They're allowing to go up there.

2338
03:19:16,494 --> 03:19:18,315
[SPEAKER_11]: They're allowing renters to go up there.

2339
03:19:18,836 --> 03:19:25,101
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have any verification from anybody in the city, from the mayor down, where that transparency is, I don't know.

2340
03:19:25,121 --> 03:19:27,923
[SPEAKER_11]: It needs to come out, it needs to be found.

2341
03:19:29,524 --> 03:19:35,849
[SPEAKER_11]: And if this continues to go on like this, and you folks know me, and that four member committee just keeps going on, and they make those approvals,

2342
03:19:36,758 --> 03:19:42,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then shame on the people of Medford for electing the administration that has allowed this to happen.

2343
03:19:43,343 --> 03:19:45,485
[SPEAKER_11]: You city council have at least taken your position.

2344
03:19:46,325 --> 03:19:48,927
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's a transparency issue here that needs to come forward.

2345
03:19:49,428 --> 03:19:50,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has yet to come forward.

2346
03:19:51,109 --> 03:19:54,191
[SPEAKER_11]: And because of that, somebody is going to have to pay the price for that.

2347
03:19:54,652 --> 03:20:01,857
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully, the 5G doesn't go into neighborhoods where people subsequently medically find out that there was something wrong.

2348
03:20:02,691 --> 03:20:10,075
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to find yourself into like a Johnson and Johnson situation that just came up now with the federal government because people now have a concern.

2349
03:20:10,335 --> 03:20:11,916
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been some bad reactions to it.

2350
03:20:12,396 --> 03:20:13,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that mean that they're all bad?

2351
03:20:13,677 --> 03:20:17,979
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it doesn't mean that they're all that they're bad, but you've got plenty of time to test this thing out.

2352
03:20:17,999 --> 03:20:27,064
[SPEAKER_11]: If they've been here two years ago, since 2019 and saying that we're going to have 143 locations, and this is now 2021, something is wrong.

2353
03:20:27,524 --> 03:20:31,746
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's been no situation, no communication, I would respectfully ask that one of you

2354
03:20:32,851 --> 03:20:44,862
[SPEAKER_11]: ask the city administration, the mayor's office, what, if anything, is the city of Method going to get, or is the city of Method getting, by allowing Verizon to come in and put 5G on these poles?

2355
03:20:45,603 --> 03:20:47,305
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a money matter, follow the money.

2356
03:20:47,605 --> 03:20:49,106
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about money, as we all know.

2357
03:20:50,007 --> 03:20:52,409
[SPEAKER_11]: $5 billion is not chump change.

2358
03:20:52,469 --> 03:20:54,211
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a huge investment nationwide.

2359
03:20:54,972 --> 03:20:57,154
[SPEAKER_11]: And when T-Mobile can rent off the same pole

2360
03:20:58,922 --> 03:21:02,725
[SPEAKER_11]: that Verizon is putting up, you know, they're all making money.

2361
03:21:03,545 --> 03:21:03,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2362
03:21:04,286 --> 03:21:06,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2363
03:21:07,748 --> 03:21:13,312
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

2364
03:21:13,993 --> 03:21:18,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the... Mr. Castagnetti.

2365
03:21:23,079 --> 03:21:23,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Castagnetti.

2366
03:21:29,091 --> 03:21:31,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Caraviello.

2367
03:21:32,052 --> 03:21:32,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

2368
03:21:34,973 --> 03:21:39,534
[SPEAKER_22]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushion Street, tomorrow, 101 Main Street.

2369
03:21:42,394 --> 03:21:43,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your time.

2370
03:21:43,475 --> 03:21:47,176
[SPEAKER_22]: I especially want to thank you.

2371
03:21:47,456 --> 03:21:53,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks to Councilor Marks for all the information, tons of homework.

2372
03:21:54,918 --> 03:21:56,558
[SPEAKER_22]: He's been doing it consistently.

2373
03:21:57,682 --> 03:22:00,563
[SPEAKER_22]: He truly earns his $30,000 salary.

2374
03:22:01,243 --> 03:22:02,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor.

2375
03:22:03,104 --> 03:22:04,304
[SPEAKER_22]: You got a race.

2376
03:22:04,324 --> 03:22:12,066
[SPEAKER_22]: As I said, as I said at the last Verizon meeting and the next one, by the way, I believe is 7 p.m.

2377
03:22:12,146 --> 03:22:13,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Thursday, Councilor.

2378
03:22:15,427 --> 03:22:26,811
[SPEAKER_22]: On Zoom, as I said at the last meeting on part two of the of the three meetings, I guess is I told Verizon, it seems like this is a done deal.

2379
03:22:28,168 --> 03:22:34,131
[SPEAKER_22]: through their lobbyists and other high-tech companies, and they got the law on their side.

2380
03:22:34,251 --> 03:22:36,932
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess from what I understand, we cannot say no.

2381
03:22:38,593 --> 03:22:49,598
[SPEAKER_22]: We can mitigate whatever that means, but they'll definitely, if they're not approved, litigate, and that's gonna cost us a lot to the taxpayers' coffers.

2382
03:22:51,779 --> 03:22:52,279
[SPEAKER_22]: Obviously,

2383
03:22:53,012 --> 03:23:00,855
[SPEAKER_22]: They cannot guarantee this is a safe situation when they install it, because it very well could be a potential problem.

2384
03:23:01,335 --> 03:23:06,217
[SPEAKER_22]: I gave them a simple example, low tech.

2385
03:23:06,237 --> 03:23:15,100
[SPEAKER_22]: 40, 50 years ago, we were painting the house, inside the house, and then 30 years later, they start saying, well, we have a lead paint problem.

2386
03:23:16,141 --> 03:23:22,063
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't care how safe they say it is, but at least if we cannot stop this,

2387
03:23:23,163 --> 03:23:28,164
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have a loved one that's gonna have an apartment directly across from this pole.

2388
03:23:28,464 --> 03:23:37,346
[SPEAKER_22]: And by the way, the apartment is five feet above the telephone pole, which is worse.

2389
03:23:39,606 --> 03:23:45,268
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not happy about this because I don't know about the future and I can't trust nobody.

2390
03:23:46,288 --> 03:23:52,109
[SPEAKER_22]: So I asked Verizon directly, I'll ask them again, maybe you will, maybe they'll laugh.

2391
03:23:52,796 --> 03:24:05,324
[SPEAKER_22]: But if it's so effing safe, at least why don't you put up a $10 billion charity bond for possible health concerns in the future?

2392
03:24:06,004 --> 03:24:07,325
[SPEAKER_22]: That is my only point, sir.

2393
03:24:07,485 --> 03:24:08,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for listening.

2394
03:24:09,206 --> 03:24:10,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

2395
03:24:10,847 --> 03:24:19,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

03:25:19,467 --> 03:25:20,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2431
03:25:20,348 --> 03:25:21,089
Thank you.

2432
03:25:23,788 --> 03:25:30,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we are talking about a true legend and patriarch of this community.

2433
03:25:31,675 --> 03:25:51,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe Bruno, great family man, a man that loved his wife, devoted to her, a great dad to his daughter Maria and son Dean, the best grandpa in the world from what I hear, and a person that really loved Medford.

2434
03:25:51,914 --> 03:25:55,876
[SPEAKER_14]: and was really committed to doing what's best for the city of Medford.

2435
03:25:57,156 --> 03:26:08,361
[SPEAKER_14]: I often would get phone calls from Mr. Bruno whenever there would be a strong issue that he felt that he needed to share his input and his knowledge and his guidance.

2436
03:26:08,461 --> 03:26:14,683
[SPEAKER_14]: And I always took it with such respect and pride because he was that type of person.

2437
03:26:15,243 --> 03:26:17,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Every decision he made, and I remember him

2438
03:26:17,665 --> 03:26:31,048
[SPEAKER_14]: years ago with the founders of the Method Youth Soccer Program, when it just started with a small group of dads that wanted to do something big that's now turned into one of the biggest youth organizations in Massachusetts.

2439
03:26:32,928 --> 03:26:35,889
[SPEAKER_14]: He wanted to start something that would benefit our kids.

2440
03:26:36,629 --> 03:26:38,430
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mr. Bruno was there.

2441
03:26:40,490 --> 03:26:45,011
[SPEAKER_14]: When I heard the news of his passing this past week, it broke my heart for the fact that

2442
03:26:45,977 --> 03:26:50,718
[SPEAKER_14]: We lost another one, and the question we've been asking is, who's gonna take that spot?

2443
03:26:50,738 --> 03:26:52,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's gonna pick up that torch?

2444
03:26:52,798 --> 03:26:56,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Because people like Joe Bruno don't come around too often.

2445
03:26:58,600 --> 03:27:09,282
[SPEAKER_14]: As I told Dean, my dad will be waiting for him at the gates in heaven, and I'm sure they'll look down and hope that we'll do them proud.

2446
03:27:09,622 --> 03:27:14,823
[SPEAKER_14]: And to the Bruno family, my condolences.

2447
03:27:15,672 --> 03:27:26,036
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope we make Mr. Bruno proud, because I know that he'll be following this Method City Council from above.

2448
03:27:26,116 --> 03:27:29,317
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2449
03:27:29,918 --> 03:27:31,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2450
03:27:32,539 --> 03:27:35,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I've known Joe Bruno for as long as I can remember.

2451
03:27:36,660 --> 03:27:40,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe was a classmate of my father's, class of 1961 at Somerville High School.

2452
03:27:41,562 --> 03:27:43,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Grew up on Domino Street in Somerville.

2453
03:27:43,737 --> 03:27:48,581
[SPEAKER_14]: had a very successful career at Verizon, working for Verizon after he got out of the United States Army.

2454
03:27:49,361 --> 03:27:54,345
[SPEAKER_14]: And Joe was also a veteran of the office of State Senator Charlie Shannon.

2455
03:27:54,805 --> 03:27:57,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe was in aid to Senator Shannon for a number of years, as was his son, Dean.

2456
03:27:58,267 --> 03:28:02,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think there's anybody in this community that could ever say a bad thing about Joe Bruno.

2457
03:28:02,651 --> 03:28:05,673
[SPEAKER_14]: He's probably one of the kindest, gentlest men you'd ever meet in your life.

2458
03:28:07,494 --> 03:28:10,056
[SPEAKER_14]: A man of great faith, a man who loved his family.

2459
03:28:11,023 --> 03:28:12,364
[SPEAKER_14]: and someone who's going to be sorely missed.

2460
03:28:13,024 --> 03:28:23,166
[SPEAKER_14]: I had the opportunity to speak with Joe just last week, Mr. President, and we made plans after he was going to get his second shot to go sit in the backyard and catch up because we haven't been able to see each other in quite a bit of time.

2461
03:28:23,226 --> 03:28:29,408
[SPEAKER_14]: And during that conversation, he told me that his health was taking a turn for the worst and that his treatments weren't working as well as they were supposed to.

2462
03:28:29,488 --> 03:28:40,091
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was very saddening, Mr. President, to have that conversation with a friend who knew that he was struggling, but who still took the time to reach out and call and talk to see how I was doing.

2463
03:28:40,640 --> 03:28:46,041
[SPEAKER_14]: that the whole conversation was about what's going on in Medford, what's going on in the city, what's new.

2464
03:28:46,101 --> 03:28:48,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe is someone that loved Medford, he loved politics, he loved helping people.

2465
03:28:49,982 --> 03:28:53,063
[SPEAKER_14]: He's instilled those values in his children and his grandchildren.

2466
03:28:53,743 --> 03:28:57,824
[SPEAKER_14]: His wife, Rosalie, is a wonderful person who I've gotten to know very well over the years.

2467
03:28:58,024 --> 03:29:01,245
[SPEAKER_14]: And my heart goes out to the family, Mr. President, this is a tough one.

2468
03:29:01,905 --> 03:29:05,005
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to express my condolences to the family.

2469
03:29:06,206 --> 03:29:06,926
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a great loss.

2470
03:29:07,657 --> 03:29:09,839
[SPEAKER_14]: not only to this community, but especially to them.

2471
03:29:10,219 --> 03:29:11,120
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a dear friend.

2472
03:29:11,420 --> 03:29:13,682
[SPEAKER_14]: So I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution.

2473
03:29:14,062 --> 03:29:14,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2474
03:29:14,863 --> 03:29:15,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

2475
03:29:15,924 --> 03:29:16,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2476
03:29:16,905 --> 03:29:19,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to send my condolences to the Bruno family.

2477
03:29:20,948 --> 03:29:23,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Bruno is a great person.

2478
03:29:23,190 --> 03:29:29,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll never forget the day when I first won elections to the city council, my first time running.

2479
03:29:29,936 --> 03:29:31,897
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the first phone call I got the next morning.

2480
03:29:32,598 --> 03:29:34,800
[SPEAKER_10]: He called me, he congratulated me, he wished me well.

2481
03:29:35,629 --> 03:29:48,059
[SPEAKER_10]: and very, very supportive and love to talk about Matthew, love to talk about the issues, but he was just a really, really special person.

2482
03:29:48,980 --> 03:29:51,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone that is, you just can't replace.

2483
03:29:52,003 --> 03:29:55,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, he's just a really special part of our community.

2484
03:29:56,106 --> 03:29:59,289
[SPEAKER_10]: You always saw him with his grandkids and he was always having fun.

2485
03:29:59,809 --> 03:30:04,513
[SPEAKER_10]: He was always smiling, easy to talk to, and he will be missed.

2486
03:30:05,317 --> 03:30:06,658
[SPEAKER_10]: tremendously in our community.

2487
03:30:06,718 --> 03:30:10,302
[SPEAKER_10]: My thoughts and prayers go out to his family.

2488
03:30:10,422 --> 03:30:10,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2489
03:30:10,802 --> 03:30:11,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2490
03:30:12,443 --> 03:30:13,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2491
03:30:13,464 --> 03:30:15,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, because I didn't grow up here.

2492
03:30:15,506 --> 03:30:21,111
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that get mentioned that I didn't have the pleasure of knowing, but I was lucky enough to know Mr. Bruno.

2493
03:30:21,231 --> 03:30:24,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And after I met him, seemingly run into him everywhere in the city.

2494
03:30:24,554 --> 03:30:29,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and anytime I saw him, he greeted me as if, you know, we went back decades.

2495
03:30:30,477 --> 03:30:32,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an incredible loss for the community.

2496
03:30:32,838 --> 03:30:35,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And I send my condolences to the Bruno family.

2497
03:30:36,679 --> 03:30:37,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2498
03:30:40,161 --> 03:30:41,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2499
03:30:41,421 --> 03:30:43,842
[SPEAKER_13]: And I won't reiterate what my colleague stated.

2500
03:30:43,902 --> 03:30:50,244
[SPEAKER_13]: But the one thing I remember about Joe was that you always knew where you stood with Joe.

2501
03:30:50,904 --> 03:30:58,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, he would come out and tell you, you know, if you were talking to him and he disagreed, he let you know he disagreed.

2502
03:30:58,851 --> 03:31:04,854
[SPEAKER_13]: He never sugarcoated anything, and I respected him for that, and I think that's what made Joe who he is.

2503
03:31:05,674 --> 03:31:12,698
[SPEAKER_13]: As was mentioned by my colleagues, he was a true family man and really cared about the people that he was in contact with.

2504
03:31:12,818 --> 03:31:19,081
[SPEAKER_13]: And on behalf of this council, I just want to send my condolences to his family and his wife.

2505
03:31:19,781 --> 03:31:21,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Martins.

2506
03:31:21,722 --> 03:31:24,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, I'm going to reiterate what Councilor Papro said.

2507
03:31:25,224 --> 03:31:26,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known Joe for about 20 years,

2508
03:31:28,393 --> 03:31:36,118
[SPEAKER_09]: When Joe found out that I was gonna run for council, he was one of the first people to call me, you know, encourage me to do this.

2509
03:31:36,178 --> 03:31:43,203
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanna thank him for his friendship over the years and, you know, to his family, you know, who are in their mourning right now.

2510
03:31:43,263 --> 03:31:45,885
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I think Joe's gonna be missed in our community.

2511
03:31:46,585 --> 03:31:48,046
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can all rise for a moment of silence.

2512
03:32:03,936 --> 03:32:06,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2513
03:32:06,597 --> 03:32:10,919
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, seconded by Councilor Falco, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2514
03:32:17,023 --> 03:32:17,663

[SPEAKER_09]: 20680 and 21304, April 6th, community hall.

2530
03:32:37,507 --> 03:32:41,390
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a community hall in regards to our housing production plan.

2531
03:32:41,910 --> 03:32:47,434
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a quite a lengthy document, and it will be further discussed going down the line.

[SPEAKER_09]: The motion by Vice President Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor Scott Belli.

2548
03:33:17,300 --> 03:33:19,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Diane are you here?

2549
03:33:19,842 --> 03:33:21,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Diane, name and address of the record please.

2550
03:33:22,267 --> 03:33:25,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Diane Sullivan, Jerome Street, West Medford.

2551
03:33:26,071 --> 03:33:27,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Mr. President.

2552
03:33:27,432 --> 03:33:32,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and through you to the council for the opportunity to share with you tonight.

2553
03:33:33,297 --> 03:33:37,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here in my capacity as your local anti-hunger activist.

2554
03:33:38,022 --> 03:33:47,090
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recently learned that Project Bread, whom many of you may know for their annual walk for hunger, has named this week Snap Awareness Week.

2555
03:33:47,731 --> 03:33:58,516
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who may not know, SNAP is our federal government supplemental nutrition assistance program, arguably our nation's first line of defense against hunger, particularly during this pandemic.

2556
03:33:59,357 --> 03:34:10,062
[SPEAKER_00]: However, recent data shows that more than 4,800 of our Medford neighbors are currently not receiving the SNAP benefits for which they are likely eligible.

2557
03:34:10,723 --> 03:34:16,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, these are our community members currently enrolled in Medicaid, but not enrolled in the SNAP program.

2558
03:34:17,566 --> 03:34:31,175
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do my part for SNAP Awareness Week, I wanted to share this information with you all and also share some of the resources that are available to our neighbors who may not know about the SNAP program or may not realize that they are in fact eligible.

2559
03:34:32,056 --> 03:34:39,341
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to our city's multilingual resource line, folks can call Project Bread's food source hotline.

2560
03:34:39,801 --> 03:34:40,482
[SPEAKER_00]: That number is 1-800-645-8333.

2561
03:34:46,138 --> 03:34:57,946
[SPEAKER_00]: The hotline can accommodate over 180 languages and Councilors are available to assist callers by screening them for SNAP eligibility on through helping them to submit an application over the phone.

2562
03:34:58,527 --> 03:35:00,448
[SPEAKER_00]: The hotline number again is 1-800-645-8333.

2563
03:35:00,468 --> 03:35:02,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're available Monday through Friday 8 a.m.

2564
03:35:02,470 --> 03:35:02,630
[SPEAKER_00]: to 7 p.m.

2565
03:35:02,810 --> 03:35:03,450
[SPEAKER_00]: and on Saturdays 10 a.m.

2566
03:35:03,590 --> 03:35:03,971
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2 p.m.

2567
03:35:11,776 --> 03:35:23,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on their website, projectbred.org, Project Bread has a new live chat function where folks who may think that they're eligible can go online and chat directly with a Councilor.

2568
03:35:23,880 --> 03:35:26,981
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe those hours may be the same as for the hotline.

2569
03:35:27,682 --> 03:35:34,604
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, folks can apply directly online with the Department of Transitional Assistance through their DTA Connect feature.

2570
03:35:34,644 --> 03:35:37,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks can Google that DTA Connect

2571
03:35:38,165 --> 03:35:39,546
[SPEAKER_00]: and can apply online.

2572
03:35:39,566 --> 03:35:50,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, those that are uncertain if they're eligible and would like to speak to a Councilor who can walk them through a process of submitting an application, they can call Project Bread at 1-800-645-8333.

2573
03:35:52,131 --> 03:35:53,091
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

2574
03:35:53,151 --> 03:36:01,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to share this information with you all, the Councilors, as you may have folks that contact your office who may be in need of assistance.

2575
03:36:02,395 --> 03:36:05,076
[SPEAKER_00]: There are efforts that I'm proud to be a part of

2576
03:36:06,216 --> 03:36:11,018
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to ensure that those who are eligible for these benefits are indeed receiving them.

2577
03:36:11,058 --> 03:36:19,541
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good, of course, for the families who are able to extend their food budget, but it also helps generate a local economy.

2578
03:36:19,661 --> 03:36:22,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just wanted to thank you for your time.

2579
03:36:23,442 --> 03:36:24,002
