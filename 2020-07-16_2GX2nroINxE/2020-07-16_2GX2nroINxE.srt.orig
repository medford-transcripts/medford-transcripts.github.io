1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next speaker is Mike Gammarello.

2
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:08,816
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives in the district, he's a teacher, and he and Anna live together in a housing co-op for some time.

3
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:12,479
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to give you some thoughts about Anna and why he's so excited about this campaign.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone for being here.

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:19,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats Anna.

6
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:25,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, the first time we met, instead of a handshake, Anna gave me a comforting hug.

7
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:31,881
[SPEAKER_00]: From then on, I knew she was going to be a loving, caring, and compassionate person in my life.

8
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:38,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived with Anna and her partner for many, many years, and life when he came into this world.

9
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:41,324
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at someone, you get to see them at their best.

10
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:43,384
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see them at their worst.

11
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:49,266
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, I would say I'm someone that knows Anna very well.

12
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:55,068
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here to say that Anna is really good people, and I live for her.

13
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,355
[SPEAKER_00]: My partner and I live in the district.

14
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:07,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a teacher, and when I got my teaching job, Anna sat down with me and helped me with my cover letter and resume.

15
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:09,928
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Anna will fight for me because she already has.

16
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:16,134
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Anna will fight for our district because I can see it in what she does every day.

17
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see the changes she will bring.
