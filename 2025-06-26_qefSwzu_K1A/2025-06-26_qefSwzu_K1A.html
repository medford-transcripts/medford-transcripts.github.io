    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=175.66s">I'm</a>  going to share my other screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=177.48s">Can</a>  you see HMR.TownlinePlaza? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=192.364s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=193.284s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=196.782s">So,</a>  thank you for having us back before we. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=201.706s">As</a>  you mentioned, we're back in June to talk about each mark coming to town line Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=206.93s">So</a>  we've made some changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=208.392s">We've</a>  done a lot of work with city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=210.573s">We</a>  heard what the board said. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=211.554s">We</a>  heard what city staff said, and we're really excited about these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=215.457s">Given</a>  that it has been a little bit of time, I figured I'd just reorient everybody to the study. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=220.401s">This</a>  is timeline Plaza outlined in green. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=223.31s">with</a>  the Medford-Malden City line through. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=225.811s">So</a>  my favorite joke is it should be called City Line Plaza and not Town Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=230.074s">This</a>  white line here shows where that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=232.075s">And</a>  then H-Mart is in the southernmost part of the site where Crunch Fitness used to occupy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=236.657s">Crunch</a>  relocated in March of 2022 to Broadway Plaza, one of our sister properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=244.261s">This</a>  is zooming in on that area so you can see the MBTA lines, Middlesex Avenue, and again H-Mart outlined in red. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=252.66s">As</a>  was mentioned, this is a reoccupancy of an existing structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=257.583s">There</a>  is one site change that was previously proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=260.985s">Skinning</a>  up this island right here to accommodate truck movements. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=264.687s">We</a>  have since now come back and made more improvements that I will walk through. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=270.65s">Site</a>  pictures from before, so this is the building, this is approaching from the south. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=278.826s">This</a>  is approaching the property, you know, if you continue at middle sex tab, or you're approaching from the mall inside Highland. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=284.31s">This</a>  is where John Burr is was just closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=290.375s">Once</a>  you're within the property, this is the. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=293.937s">Building</a>  that contains the future age mark down here at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=298.34s">Stores</a>  with a covered walkway along and a sea of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=302.183s">That</a>  we are going to improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=305.593s">And</a>  this is looking from the other side of the property, crunch fitness shown here is where H Mart is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=311.198s">Behind</a>  the building, there's some significant parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=314.201s">This</a>  is where the MBTA was staging for some work they previously did.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=317.564s">And</a>  now I'm going to do our updates.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=325.751s">So</a>  this is the site plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=327.595s">Hearing</a>  at the last meeting, a lot of comments about the pedestrian connectivity to the property and throughout the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=333.697s">That's</a>  really where we focused our efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=336.419s">And</a>  then throughout conversations with staff, we've talked through traffic, we talked through making some additional landscape improvements as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=344.402s">So</a>  the landscape is what I will show first. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=347.963s">This</a>  shows some of the existing landscaping on site in green, the light green here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=353.445s">And</a>  then this is showing where we've added some landscaping in the front of the property.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=358.074s">I'll</a>  zoom in on this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=373.967s">So</a>  this is the existing landscaped island that runs through the center of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=379.592s">Right</a>  here is where H-Mart is going to be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=382.314s">So</a>  we're proposing to add some landscaped islands really along the internal driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=388.177s">And</a>  then a couple throughout the center of the parking lot as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=392.159s">And</a>  adding pedestrian connection, which I will show on a technical drawing in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=407.504s">This</a>  is a previous drawing that we presented in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=411.725s">That</a>  had showed the change to the parking lot here to accommodate truck turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=417.038s">And</a>  then the loading in the rear where we were striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=419.199s">So</a>  it was very minimal changes at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=420.92s">And</a>  we heard the comments loud and clear about improving pedestrian connectivity, improving landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=428.264s">So</a>  this is the updated drawing, which I was in on in a minute, but overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=436.969s">From</a>  the large parking fields behind the building, we have added a pedestrian path that's striped with bollards to protect it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=444.858s">to</a>  encourage people to park back here and allow a route from the rear parking to the front entrance of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=452.58s">This</a>  is the technical drawing showing the landscape improvements that I'll zoom in on in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=457.842s">We</a>  have also shown striping added to all the crosswalks at the front of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=463.423s">Places</a>  where there are not handicap ramps today, we are proposing those. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=467.865s">All</a>  of the work along the front of the property is not on our land, it's Matthew T's land. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=472.413s">So</a>  it's subject to their review and approval, but we're going to work with them online. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=476.656s">We've</a>  shown increased striping throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=480.438s">In</a>  adding some landscaping through here and adding a new sidewalk, we had to relocate some handicapped spaces, so we've added them proximate to the front entrance of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=489.963s">And</a>  then these are showing the landscape violence.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=492.885s">So</a>  I will now zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=502.532s">We've</a>  also added the bike racks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=504.534s">That</a>  was one of the other comments previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=506.475s">And</a>  we will add wayfinding signage to direct both customers and employees that there is more parking behind the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=513.561s">And</a>  we already require employees to park in the rear. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=516.583s">We're</a>  a little lax on that admittedly right now as part of the property is vacant, but it's something that we will encourage and enforce going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=523.989s">As</a>  you can see here, we're adding in concrete to get from the existing sidewalk <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=531.89s">up</a>  into our land, then we're striping pedestrian access across. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=537.593s">And</a>  then we're adding in a brand new sidewalk that goes all the way through the heart of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=542.795s">This</a>  caused us to lose some parking along here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=544.916s">We</a>  had originally shown some one-way spaces, but after reviewing with Director Blake, he had the great suggestion to just keep it entirely parallel parking along here so it's not confusing for the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=556.662s">With</a>  doing that, we were actually able to widen the landscaping through here a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=561.333s">So</a>  we picked up some additional landscaping here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=564.215s">We've</a>  added trees, and we've added trees where we could throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=568.458s">So</a>  there's trees added here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=570.239s">Places</a>  where the landscaping was not quite wide enough, we're going to add shrubs and bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=574.281s">And</a>  then throughout, we're going to improve the ground covering here, so it won't just be mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=579.184s">We'll</a>  add some more taller grasses and things like that that are hardy, but add visual relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=585.789s">You</a>  can see some added striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=587.99s">This</a>  is showing more detail on the crosswalks <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=592.221s">And</a>  then the bike racks on the sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=595.545s">This</a>  is the landscape island that has always been proposed to be shifted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=604.775s">This</a>  is just showing the landscaping in more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=611.082s">And</a>  you can see here the bollards that are along the pedestrian walkway.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=618.301s">And</a>  because I'm extremely visible, my colleague, Vanessa Gonzalez, helped put together these images. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=622.963s">So</a>  if you're at the property, you can kind of see where the greenscape is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=626.824s">So</a>  we're adding a landscaped island in the middle, out front of Omni Dentist, California. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=635.067s">This</a>  shows one of the areas that's striped today that we're gonna convert to landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=639.889s">This</a>  is my favorite. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=641.27s">This</a>  is showing where the concrete walk is being added. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=644.151s">So</a>  this will be a sidewalk that runs all the way <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=647.713s">Basically</a>  along this landscape island, it jogs slightly because in order to keep the parallel parking, which is going to be throughout here, there's parallel existing today, and then it's perpendicular. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=659.157s">This</a>  is going to be entirely parallel. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=661.438s">We've</a>  added landscaping between where we had to make some jogs, but then we kept it as tight to the left as we could so that we could really add any additional landscaping here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=670.781s">Obviously,</a>  the larger the landscaping, the better the planting material will do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=674.662s">So</a>  we're almost doubling the width towards the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=677.802s">And</a>  then today there's not landscaping at the top of the island, and we're going to add that at the top and the bottom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=685.229s">This</a>  is that view of we've walked through and you're looking back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=688.653s">So,</a>  showing the increased landscaping with along here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=692.276s">Dark</a>  gray is where the pedestrian sidewalk will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=695.74s">And</a>  then the landscaping at the ends fixing this kind of funky design right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=702.487s">These</a>  spaces were shown as handicapped, so these are the ones that were relocating to the side of the building as well.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=711.793s">And</a>  this shows the other islands being converted from striped to landscaping.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=719.517s">The</a>  technical drawings, if anybody has questions later. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=722.599s">And</a>  then the truck route that the truck will navigate through the property that showed <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=729.554s">You</a>  know, once we've relocated this island and mentioned up a little bit with the loss of 1 space, the truck will be able to maneuver on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=739.358s">So,</a>  that shows all of our improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=742.039s">We're</a>  really excited about this and we hope that the board as well and would love to talk to her any questions or comments.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=751.682s">Thank</a>  you so much for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=753.583s">I</a>  can definitely appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=757.528s">You</a>  discussing and bring in some of the board and staff's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=760.629s">We</a>  got a pedestrian and vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=763.37s">Connected</a>  pedestrian connectivity and vehicle circulation, so thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=768.671s">But</a>  before we deliberate with the board, I'm going to actually open it up to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=774.413s">The</a>  public. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=778.565s">I'm</a>  going to well, actually, I will ask the city staff if there's any questions there, if there's any comments from the staff.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=793.192s">I</a>  don't think I have anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=795.112s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=795.673s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=796.073s">Danielle.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=797.474s">Madam</a>  chair in our staff memo, we incorporated some conditions that don't appear on the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=807.965s">It</a>  seems the engineering department, a city engineer is requiring that all heaved and cracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=815.312s">Sidewalk</a>  panels be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=818.494s">Um,</a>  that's not reflected on the plans here and I want to make sure that the applicant is aware of that condition.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=827.883s">So,</a>  thank you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=828.864s">So</a>  both the heat and crack sidewalks, which I believe we're on middle sex staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=833.348s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=834.757s">And</a>  the crosswalks here, when we reviewed with staff previously, we had shown striping, we didn't pick up that they wanted to add the concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=842.584s">We</a>  are willing to do that on the 2 Medford entrances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=847.147s">And</a>  then, in terms of the heaved and cross sidewalks, the ones that we saw were actually where the ramps will be added for the parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=856.255s">So</a>  those will be updated as part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=859.296s">We're</a>  happy with those conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=860.756s">The</a>  only thing we just request being changed is that it says subject to math approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=865.477s">Because</a>  it's not our land, so we can't guarantee that we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=868.718s">We're</a>  willing to do what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=870.018s">We</a>  just have to work with them on it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=875.659s">And</a>  as far as. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=877.92s">You</a>  had mentioned that you were going to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=881.361s">Native</a>  plants, such as shrubs, can you go into detail a little bit more outside of the new shade trees that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=889.093s">that</a>  you planned on adding? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=890.193s">I</a>  didn't I didn't catch anything outside of shrubs.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=893.895s">And</a>  I want to provide detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=896.496s">We</a>  are going to work with city staff on making sure they're native plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=899.517s">We've</a>  had some struggles here on property with the plants surviving. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=902.938s">We've</a>  been told that the plants that have been installed at Wegmans actually have done a really good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=908.42s">So</a>  it's something that we had talked with Amanda and Danielle about getting a list of plants from staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=913.687s">incorporating</a>  those. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=915.107s">They're</a>  not shown on the plans right now, because it's something we're doing throughout the property, but they will be native plants, and they will be coordinated with the staff, which I think was also one of the conditions.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=925.83s">Yes,</a>  prior to the final selection, you would need to coordinate it with the city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=932.871s">I'm</a>  sorry, Danielle, did you want to highlight anything else?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=937.341s">Oh,</a>  I just wanted to add that I did reach out to our, to Aggie Tootin, who is the tree warden in the, I think that's her title, or the director of forestry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=947.826s">She</a>  had been out on an extended leave, so wasn't able to respond to my request to weigh in on native plantings, but once they're at the stage of selecting plants, I'll be sure to have some recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=963.212s">So</a>  we weren't able to have any at this time.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=969.165s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=971.046s">And</a>  then there was parking demand to reduce the cruising for parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=976.507s">Are</a>  you able to mandate that the employees park in the rear as suggested previously?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=982.029s">Yes,</a>  it's included in all of our tenant leases that they need to park where we tell them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=986.67s">We</a>  have the opportunity to change that as the property sees fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=992.611s">So</a>  we will be mandating that they park in the rear.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=995.328s">And</a>  so they're popular, you'll still leave it open of like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=999.051s">Wayfinding</a>  signs for the actual customers to realize that there's parking back there too.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1004.195s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1004.775s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1005.115s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1006.176s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1007.637s">I'm</a>  still sharing the screen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1010.579s">So</a>  this parking back here will be encouraged for employees, but it won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1016.524s">Customers</a>  will also be allowed to park in the back as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1018.885s">So</a>  the signage will. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1021.627s">Be</a>  added along the front saying additional parking behind the space.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1028.3s">We</a>  still need to design that.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1030.581s">Also,</a>  thank you very much for answering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1033.761s">There</a>  was a question whether or not that there was an existing connection to the state's MWRA connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1042.603s">Do</a>  you anticipate there being any problem with that process if it's not?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1047.944s">We</a>  don't anticipate that, but we do understand that if there's a change in what's shown, we'll need to re-review with either staff or the board at that time.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1055.505s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1056.165s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1058.768s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1059.968s">Are</a>  there any other questions from city staff or from the board at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1064.83s">I'll</a>  open it up to the board if none from the city.</p>

    <p>[O1CMBj7JDes_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1073.332s">I've</a>  got a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1075.333s">Have</a>  you done a turning movement study for the crux on this in this location? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1081.895s">My</a>  worry is since you have been adding some landscaping there, especially the one <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1088.92s">On</a>  the bar, like, the new 1 that you just added landscaping added to be redesigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1094.225s">I</a>  feel like the truck's going to run over that and create a big patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1097.447s">Like,</a>  is there a turning moving study of some sort?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1103.793s">So,</a>  we did trucks entering and leaving the property and that was actually the 1 item island that we had shown originally moved because. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1112.52s">The</a>  truck was clipping the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1115.655s">And</a>  so that's why we are previously proposing to just shift that 1 portion of the island up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1121.12s">All</a>  the improvements that we're making are not in areas that were impacted by the truck movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1124.764s">So</a>  we felt really great about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1126.645s">We</a>  were initially concerned about spaces with the additional islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1130.049s">So</a>  we had to relocate some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1132.171s">To</a>  see down here in order to add, but they're not in areas that were impacted by the truck.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1138.236s">Also,</a>  this is something that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1143.46s">I</a>  have a few questions unless you had more charade.</p>

    <p>[O1CMBj7JDes_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1149.202s">No,</a>  please go for sure.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1151.823s">Catherine,</a>  I really appreciate the approach that your team has taken with the crosswalks, the landscaping, the additional islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1159.205s">I</a>  think that's just what we were looking for with some of the suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1163.526s">So,</a>  I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1167.016s">I</a>  see that you guys relocated the accessible spaces to the side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1174.098s">What</a>  sort of lighting is at that corner? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1176.699s">Because</a>  I can just see, like, you know, thinking of myself as an employee running late for work, you know, speeding around that corner, or, you know, a truck driver trying to make delivery times, or, you know, a customer trying to get, you know, that one last dinner ingredient, and moving fairly quickly, you know, over that crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1197.108s">I</a>  don't know if there's a way to add additional lighting or potentially raise the crosswalk, or if that's even in our scope of stuff we're allowed to ask for, but just want to throw some attention on that shift with the crosswalk and the space movement.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1214.397s">Yeah,</a>  happy to talk through a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1216.578s">There's</a>  no special lighting thing over here, but this is the entrance way, which is a glass vestibule, so that actually provides a little bit more ambient light in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1224.582s">This</a>  is a covered walkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1226.747s">If</a>  we are noticing that there's an issue, we can add a building light in this side, but we'd of course want to make sure it's not casting too much light onto the neighbors or things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1236.936s">The</a>  front parking lot has lighting as does the back parking lot have overhead lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1242.48s">This</a>  will also be fully striped, and so the entire area will be the white striping that stands out a little bit more, as well this area along here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1250.627s">I</a>  wouldn't want to do a raised crosswalk in this area because <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1256.139s">Of</a>  the trucks, um, you know, deliveries will be usually off hours and, you know, there'll be a lot of activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1262.861s">And</a>  so it can just cause a little bit of wear and tear on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1266.542s">And</a>  we are also keeping some parking ADA parking in the front of the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1271.243s">So</a>  it was just the two that were actually further away from the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1274.764s">Um,</a>  that were previously right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1276.405s">Um,</a>  we have existing ones here, here and down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1280.266s">So</a>  they're kind of evenly spread out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1281.846s">There's</a>  now a higher concentration towards the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1284.268s">Okay,</a>  but I do want to just also ensure everything that's shown is grayed out will be striped to the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1289.61s">This</a>  is just showing existing versions proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1292.471s">So,</a>  you know, making sure that all these crosswalks are striped and like a really visible white paint to provide pedestrian safety.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1300.335s">That's</a>  really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1301.655s">Thanks</a>  for pointing out the spots that are staying. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1303.496s">I</a>  must have overlooked those. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1306.017s">So</a>  I appreciate your responses.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1309.318s">They're</a>  not as in your face.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1314.032s">That's</a>  why we ask the questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1316.053s">Did</a>  I answer everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1316.993s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1317.273s">I</a>  know you had a couple of questions.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1319.034s">That</a>  was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1320.055s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1321.935s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1325.817s">Any</a>  other questions from board members?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1333.64s">I</a>  actually have a final question. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1335.561s">I</a>  wasn't sure if there was going to be a food court of some sort that was proposed inside of the store.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1344.505s">Yes,</a>  I'm sorry, my previous presentation had store pictures from inside the store, and I can send that over after. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1351.048s">But</a>  yes, I believe they have a food court inside the store, like their other locations.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1355.61s">So</a>  can you just reiterate your trash and litter mitigation for the site, especially for this having a food court?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1362.973s">Sure,</a>  so they've added additional dumpsters in the rear. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1366.394s">And</a>  as a food operator, both this grocery store and then somebody that, you know, quasi restaurant, <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1373.538s">There's</a>  additional state requirements in terms of food waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1377.419s">So</a>  that's why there's a lot more dumpsters in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1382.621s">Previously,</a>  there was only one dumpster that serviced this entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1385.862s">Other</a>  tenants have their own individual dumpsters as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1389.103s">So</a>  these ones that are shown are entirely for HMR. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1393.564s">And</a>  they'll work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1394.284s">I</a>  know there were a bunch of comments from the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1397.525s">Those</a>  will all be coordinated through the building permit process because their permit drawings show a lot more detail.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1405.654s">Thank</a>  you for answering.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1409.116s">If</a>  I thank you.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1414.999s">If</a>  I may follow up on that, I appreciate the answer about the dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1419.082s">Can</a>  you also speak a little bit about humor and food court? <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1429.208s">Patrons</a>  who might be coming and kind of as they're walking out to their cars are kind of eating outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1436.369s">Can</a>  you talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1437.99s">Trash</a>  mitigation in the parking area and sidewalks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1444.331s">So,</a>  we have a couple existing what I call pedestrian trash cans. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1449.171s">So,</a>  obviously, like, for people walking by. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1452.412s">Scattered</a>  throughout the sidewalk, there is a fair amount of trash on site today. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1456.413s">So</a>  we do anticipate adding. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1459.01s">one</a>  to two more trash cans as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1462.891s">I</a>  think it's going to be very popular so it wouldn't surprise me if it's two. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1466.653s">It's</a>  one of the things there is some existing and so we kind of see we have day porters that are there every single day emptying the trash and they're on top of it both throughout the parking lot and along the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1478.617s">And</a>  so we have some there today and we anticipate adding more as needed and something we want to stay on top of it as well too because we know customers don't want to come to a dirty property either.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1503.538s">If</a>  there are no other comments from the board, I will now open it up to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1507.548s">I</a>  skipped ahead a little bit earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1510.735s">And</a>  I'll open up the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1513.215s">by</a>  stating that those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1518.737s">You</a>  can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1526.66s">Before</a>  providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1529.761s">A</a>  reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1534.323s">Comments</a>  is, it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1537.245s">However,</a>  if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1545.409s">Amanda,</a>  can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1551.534s">Absolutely,</a>  so we didn't have any previously received comments or letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1556.317s">I</a>  am refreshing our inbox now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1559.319s">And</a>  just a reminder folks can use the raise hand feature, or if you're having trouble finding that you can use the chat function just to identify yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1568.145s">So</a>  I'll give folks maybe a minute or 2 just to respond to that while I check the email.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1581.133s">Okay,</a>  so no new emails.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1585.596s">And</a>  I'm not seeing any hands or messages in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1590.679s">I'm</a>  just going to scan skim through and see if anybody sort of waving their hands on the screen or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qefSwzu_K1A&t=1598.064s">But</a>  I think we're good.</p>
