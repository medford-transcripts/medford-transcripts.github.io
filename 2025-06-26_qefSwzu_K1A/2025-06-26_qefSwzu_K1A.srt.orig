[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

28
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,196
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited to have you Amanda.

29
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you please introduce any staff on the phone?

00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:57,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with us, we also have a director of our office, Alicia hunt.

32
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,260
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as senior planner, Danielle Evans, and our graduate intern.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Clem do set to set.

34
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:07,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's everybody.

35
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:10,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Amanda.

36
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:19,047
[SPEAKER_03]: The 1st item on our list tonight is a site plan review for 285 to 295, middle 6. known as H. mark is being continued from 8 to 23.

37
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:29,441
[SPEAKER_03]: As a reminder, this project is a retenting of an existing structure, which was previously a gym at Townline Plaza, and it was a grocery store.

38
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:35,906
[SPEAKER_03]: While all the board members can discuss the project, only myself, Ari, Emily, and Peter are eligible to vote on this item.

39
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:42,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I now invite the applicant to present their revised site plan and outline any changes that you'd like to highlight.

40
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

41
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me okay?

42
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:47,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

43
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:48,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

44
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:52,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember last time I talked with Amanda and Danielle, my headphones did not work.

45
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:54,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know if it stops working.

46
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to share my other screen.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:10,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see HMR.TownlinePlaza?

48
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:12,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

49
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:13,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

50
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:20,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you for having us back before we.

51
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:26,370
[SPEAKER_02]: As you mentioned, we're back in June to talk about each mark coming to town line Plaza.

52
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've made some changes.

53
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,013
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a lot of work with city staff.

54
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:31,534
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard what the board said.

55
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:34,336
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard what city staff said, and we're really excited about these changes.

56
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:39,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Given that it has been a little bit of time, I figured I'd just reorient everybody to the study.

57
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:42,523
[SPEAKER_02]: This is timeline Plaza outlined in green.

58
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,751
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Medford-Malden City line through.

59
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:49,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So my favorite joke is it should be called City Line Plaza and not Town Hall.

60
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,674
[SPEAKER_02]: This white line here shows where that is.

61
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:56,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And then H-Mart is in the southernmost part of the site where Crunch Fitness used to occupy.

62
00:03:56,657 --> 00:04:02,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Crunch relocated in March of 2022 to Broadway Plaza, one of our sister properties.

63
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:11,645
[SPEAKER_02]: This is zooming in on that area so you can see the MBTA lines, Middlesex Avenue, and again H-Mart outlined in red.

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,482
[SPEAKER_02]: As was mentioned, this is a reoccupancy of an existing structure.

65
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,884
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one site change that was previously proposed.

66
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:24,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Skinning up this island right here to accommodate truck movements.

67
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:28,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We have since now come back and made more improvements that I will walk through.

68
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Site pictures from before, so this is the building, this is approaching from the south.

69
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:44,170
[SPEAKER_02]: This is approaching the property, you know, if you continue at middle sex tab, or you're approaching from the mall inside Highland.

70
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,912
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where John Burr is was just closed.

71
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you're within the property, this is the.

72
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Building that contains the future age mark down here at the end.

73
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Stores with a covered walkway along and a sea of parking.

74
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:03,164
[SPEAKER_02]: That we are going to improve.

75
00:05:05,593 --> 00:05:09,937
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is looking from the other side of the property, crunch fitness shown here is where H Mart is going.

76
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:14,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Behind the building, there's some significant parking.

77
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,544
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where the MBTA was staging for some work they previously did.

78
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:22,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm going to do our updates.

79
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:26,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the site plan.

80
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:33,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing at the last meeting, a lot of comments about the pedestrian connectivity to the property and throughout the property.

81
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:35,538
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really where we focused our efforts.

82
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:43,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And then throughout conversations with staff, we've talked through traffic, we talked through making some additional landscape improvements as well.

83
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So the landscape is what I will show first.

84
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: This shows some of the existing landscaping on site in green, the light green here.

85
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:57,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is showing where we've added some landscaping in the front of the property.

86
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:13,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll zoom in on this.

87
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:19,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the existing landscaped island that runs through the center of the property.

88
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here is where H-Mart is going to be going.

89
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:26,878
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're proposing to add some landscaped islands really along the internal driveway.

90
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:31,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a couple throughout the center of the parking lot as well.

91
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And adding pedestrian connection, which I will show on a technical drawing in a minute.

92
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:51,065
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a previous drawing that we presented in June.

93
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:56,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That had showed the change to the parking lot here to accommodate truck turns.

94
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the loading in the rear where we were striping.

95
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was very minimal changes at the time.

96
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And we heard the comments loud and clear about improving pedestrian connectivity, improving landscaping.

97
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:16,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the updated drawing, which I was in on in a minute, but overview.

98
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:23,713
[SPEAKER_02]: From the large parking fields behind the building, we have added a pedestrian path that's striped with bollards to protect it.

99
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:30,880
[SPEAKER_02]: to encourage people to park back here and allow a route from the rear parking to the front entrance of the building.

100
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,222
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the technical drawing showing the landscape improvements that I'll zoom in on in a minute.

101
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:42,343
[SPEAKER_02]: We have also shown striping added to all the crosswalks at the front of the property.

102
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:47,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Places where there are not handicap ramps today, we are proposing those.

103
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:52,026
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the work along the front of the property is not on our land, it's Matthew T's land.

104
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:55,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's subject to their review and approval, but we're going to work with them online.

105
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:58,457
[SPEAKER_02]: We've shown increased striping throughout.

106
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:09,203
[SPEAKER_02]: In adding some landscaping through here and adding a new sidewalk, we had to relocate some handicapped spaces, so we've added them proximate to the front entrance of the building.

107
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:11,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these are showing the landscape violence.

108
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:13,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will now zoom.

109
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:23,993
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also added the bike racks.

110
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:26,275
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the other comments previously.

111
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:33,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will add wayfinding signage to direct both customers and employees that there is more parking behind the building.

112
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:36,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And we already require employees to park in the rear.

113
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:43,969
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a little lax on that admittedly right now as part of the property is vacant, but it's something that we will encourage and enforce going forward.

114
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:51,035
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see here, we're adding in concrete to get from the existing sidewalk

115
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,132
[SPEAKER_02]: up into our land, then we're striping pedestrian access across.

116
00:08:57,593 --> 00:09:01,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're adding in a brand new sidewalk that goes all the way through the heart of the property.

117
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:04,896
[SPEAKER_02]: This caused us to lose some parking along here.

118
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:15,041
[SPEAKER_02]: We had originally shown some one-way spaces, but after reviewing with Director Blake, he had the great suggestion to just keep it entirely parallel parking along here so it's not confusing for the customer.

119
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:20,744
[SPEAKER_02]: With doing that, we were actually able to widen the landscaping through here a little bit.

120
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So we picked up some additional landscaping here.

121
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:28,157
[SPEAKER_02]: We've added trees, and we've added trees where we could throughout.

122
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's trees added here.

123
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:33,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Places where the landscaping was not quite wide enough, we're going to add shrubs and bushes.

124
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:39,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And then throughout, we're going to improve the ground covering here, so it won't just be mulch.

125
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:44,708
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll add some more taller grasses and things like that that are hardy, but add visual relief.

126
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see some added striping.

127
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,652
[SPEAKER_02]: This is showing more detail on the crosswalks

128
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the bike racks on the sidewalk.

129
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:59,009
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the landscape island that has always been proposed to be shifted.

130
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,897
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just showing the landscaping in more detail.

131
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:13,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see here the bollards that are along the pedestrian walkway.

132
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:22,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I'm extremely visible, my colleague, Vanessa Gonzalez, helped put together these images.

133
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:26,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're at the property, you can kind of see where the greenscape is going.

134
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:32,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're adding a landscaped island in the middle, out front of Omni Dentist, California.

135
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,329
[SPEAKER_02]: This shows one of the areas that's striped today that we're gonna convert to landscaping.

136
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,790
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my favorite.

137
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,911
[SPEAKER_02]: This is showing where the concrete walk is being added.

138
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:47,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will be a sidewalk that runs all the way

139
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:59,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically along this landscape island, it jogs slightly because in order to keep the parallel parking, which is going to be throughout here, there's parallel existing today, and then it's perpendicular.

140
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be entirely parallel.

141
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:10,721
[SPEAKER_02]: We've added landscaping between where we had to make some jogs, but then we kept it as tight to the left as we could so that we could really add any additional landscaping here.

142
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:13,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the larger the landscaping, the better the planting material will do.

143
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:16,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're almost doubling the width towards the top.

144
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:22,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And then today there's not landscaping at the top of the island, and we're going to add that at the top and the bottom as well.

145
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,752
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that view of we've walked through and you're looking back.

146
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:31,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So, showing the increased landscaping with along here.

147
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark gray is where the pedestrian sidewalk will be.

148
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:42,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the landscaping at the ends fixing this kind of funky design right here.

149
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:48,050
[SPEAKER_02]: These spaces were shown as handicapped, so these are the ones that were relocating to the side of the building as well.

150
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:56,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And this shows the other islands being converted from striped to landscaping.

151
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:02,579
[SPEAKER_02]: The technical drawings, if anybody has questions later.

152
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:07,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the truck route that the truck will navigate through the property that showed

153
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:16,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once we've relocated this island and mentioned up a little bit with the loss of 1 space, the truck will be able to maneuver on the site.

154
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:21,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that shows all of our improvements.

155
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:27,241
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really excited about this and we hope that the board as well and would love to talk to her any questions or comments.

156
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:33,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your presentation.

157
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I can definitely appreciate.

158
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:40,609
[SPEAKER_03]: You discussing and bring in some of the board and staff's concerns.

159
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,689
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a pedestrian and vehicle.

160
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Connected pedestrian connectivity and vehicle circulation, so thank you for that.

161
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:53,352
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we deliberate with the board, I'm going to actually open it up to.

162
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:54,933
[SPEAKER_03]: The public.

163
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:08,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to well, actually, I will ask the city staff if there's any questions there, if there's any comments from the staff.

164
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,932
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have anything.

165
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:15,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

166
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:16,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

167
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:16,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle.

168
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:27,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam chair in our staff memo, we incorporated some conditions that don't appear on the plans.

169
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:34,391
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems the engineering department, a city engineer is requiring that all heaved and cracked.

170
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:37,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Sidewalk panels be replaced.

171
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:43,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that's not reflected on the plans here and I want to make sure that the applicant is aware of that condition.

172
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:48,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you, Danielle.

173
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:52,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So both the heat and crack sidewalks, which I believe we're on middle sex staff.

174
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:53,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

175
00:13:54,757 --> 00:14:02,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And the crosswalks here, when we reviewed with staff previously, we had shown striping, we didn't pick up that they wanted to add the concrete.

176
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:06,347
[SPEAKER_02]: We are willing to do that on the 2 Medford entrances.

177
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:15,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, in terms of the heaved and cross sidewalks, the ones that we saw were actually where the ramps will be added for the parking spaces.

178
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So those will be updated as part of this project.

179
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:20,716
[SPEAKER_02]: We're happy with those conditions.

180
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:24,977
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing we just request being changed is that it says subject to math approval.

181
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:28,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not our land, so we can't guarantee that we can do it.

182
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:29,978
[SPEAKER_02]: We're willing to do what we want to do.

183
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,279
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to work with them on it.

184
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:36,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as.

185
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,901
[SPEAKER_03]: You had mentioned that you were going to add.

186
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:47,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Native plants, such as shrubs, can you go into detail a little bit more outside of the new shade trees that.

187
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:50,133
[SPEAKER_03]: that you planned on adding?

188
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:53,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't I didn't catch anything outside of shrubs.

189
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:55,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to provide detail.

190
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,437
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to work with city staff on making sure they're native plants.

191
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:02,918
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had some struggles here on property with the plants surviving.

192
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:07,880
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been told that the plants that have been installed at Wegmans actually have done a really good job.

193
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that we had talked with Amanda and Danielle about getting a list of plants from staff.

194
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:14,607
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporating those.

195
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:24,469
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not shown on the plans right now, because it's something we're doing throughout the property, but they will be native plants, and they will be coordinated with the staff, which I think was also one of the conditions.

196
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:31,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, prior to the final selection, you would need to coordinate it with the city staff.

197
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:36,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Danielle, did you want to highlight anything else?

198
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:47,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I just wanted to add that I did reach out to our, to Aggie Tootin, who is the tree warden in the, I think that's her title, or the director of forestry.

199
00:15:47,826 --> 00:16:02,732
[SPEAKER_12]: She had been out on an extended leave, so wasn't able to respond to my request to weigh in on native plantings, but once they're at the stage of selecting plants, I'll be sure to have some recommendations.

200
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,973
[SPEAKER_12]: So we weren't able to have any at this time.

201
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:09,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

202
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:14,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was parking demand to reduce the cruising for parking.

203
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:20,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to mandate that the employees park in the rear as suggested previously?

204
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:25,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's included in all of our tenant leases that they need to park where we tell them.

205
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:32,131
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the opportunity to change that as the property sees fit.

206
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:34,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will be mandating that they park in the rear.

207
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're popular, you'll still leave it open of like.

208
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:43,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Wayfinding signs for the actual customers to realize that there's parking back there too.

209
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:44,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

210
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:45,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

211
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:45,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

212
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:46,616
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

213
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:48,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still sharing the screen, right?

214
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:56,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So this parking back here will be encouraged for employees, but it won't.

215
00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:58,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Customers will also be allowed to park in the back as well.

216
00:16:58,885 --> 00:16:59,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So the signage will.

217
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:05,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Be added along the front saying additional parking behind the space.

218
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,320
[SPEAKER_05]: We still need to design that.

219
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:13,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, thank you very much for answering that.

220
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:21,822
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a question whether or not that there was an existing connection to the state's MWRA connection.

221
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:26,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you anticipate there being any problem with that process if it's not?

222
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:34,905
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't anticipate that, but we do understand that if there's a change in what's shown, we'll need to re-review with either staff or the board at that time.

223
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:35,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

224
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:36,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

225
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:39,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

226
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:44,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other questions from city staff or from the board at this point?

227
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll open it up to the board if none from the city.

228
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:54,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a question.

229
00:17:55,333 --> 00:18:00,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done a turning movement study for the crux on this in this location?

230
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:07,317
[SPEAKER_01]: My worry is since you have been adding some landscaping there, especially the one

231
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,684
[SPEAKER_01]: On the bar, like, the new 1 that you just added landscaping added to be redesigned.

232
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:17,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the truck's going to run over that and create a big patch.

233
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:19,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is there a turning moving study of some sort?

234
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:31,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we did trucks entering and leaving the property and that was actually the 1 item island that we had shown originally moved because.

235
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,021
[SPEAKER_02]: The truck was clipping the island.

236
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:40,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we are previously proposing to just shift that 1 portion of the island up.

237
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,744
[SPEAKER_02]: All the improvements that we're making are not in areas that were impacted by the truck movement.

238
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:46,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So we felt really great about that.

239
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:50,009
[SPEAKER_02]: We were initially concerned about spaces with the additional islands.

240
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to relocate some of them.

241
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:57,335
[SPEAKER_02]: To see down here in order to add, but they're not in areas that were impacted by the truck.

242
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this is something that.

243
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,041
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a few questions unless you had more charade.

244
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:11,783
[SPEAKER_01]: No, please go for sure.

245
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:18,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Catherine, I really appreciate the approach that your team has taken with the crosswalks, the landscaping, the additional islands.

246
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:23,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's just what we were looking for with some of the suggestions.

247
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:24,827
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I really appreciate that.

248
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:32,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I see that you guys relocated the accessible spaces to the side of the building.

249
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:36,679
[SPEAKER_13]: What sort of lighting is at that corner?

250
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:55,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I can just see, like, you know, thinking of myself as an employee running late for work, you know, speeding around that corner, or, you know, a truck driver trying to make delivery times, or, you know, a customer trying to get, you know, that one last dinner ingredient, and moving fairly quickly, you know, over that crosswalk.

251
00:19:57,108 --> 00:20:13,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if there's a way to add additional lighting or potentially raise the crosswalk, or if that's even in our scope of stuff we're allowed to ask for, but just want to throw some attention on that shift with the crosswalk and the space movement.

252
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:15,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, happy to talk through a couple of things.

253
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:24,222
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no special lighting thing over here, but this is the entrance way, which is a glass vestibule, so that actually provides a little bit more ambient light in the area.

254
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:25,663
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a covered walkway.

255
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:36,916
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are noticing that there's an issue, we can add a building light in this side, but we'd of course want to make sure it's not casting too much light onto the neighbors or things like that.

256
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:42,340
[SPEAKER_02]: The front parking lot has lighting as does the back parking lot have overhead lights.

257
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,607
[SPEAKER_02]: This will also be fully striped, and so the entire area will be the white striping that stands out a little bit more, as well this area along here.

258
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:55,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to do a raised crosswalk in this area because

259
00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:02,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the trucks, um, you know, deliveries will be usually off hours and, you know, there'll be a lot of activity.

260
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it can just cause a little bit of wear and tear on that.

261
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:10,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are also keeping some parking ADA parking in the front of the space.

262
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:13,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just the two that were actually further away from the store.

263
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:16,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that were previously right here.

264
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:20,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have existing ones here, here and down here.

265
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:21,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of evenly spread out.

266
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,747
[SPEAKER_02]: There's now a higher concentration towards the store.

267
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:29,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but I do want to just also ensure everything that's shown is grayed out will be striped to the same level.

268
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,871
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just showing existing versions proposed.

269
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:39,254
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, making sure that all these crosswalks are striped and like a really visible white paint to provide pedestrian safety.

270
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:41,115
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really helpful.

271
00:21:41,655 --> 00:21:43,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for pointing out the spots that are staying.

272
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:45,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I must have overlooked those.

273
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:49,298
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate your responses.

274
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:51,899
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not as in your face.

275
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:55,092
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we ask the questions.

276
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:56,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I answer everything?

277
00:21:56,993 --> 00:21:57,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

278
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:58,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you had a couple of questions.

279
00:21:59,034 --> 00:21:59,494
[SPEAKER_13]: That was it.

280
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:00,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

281
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:02,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

282
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions from board members?

283
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a final question.

284
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:22,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure if there was going to be a food court of some sort that was proposed inside of the store.

285
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:30,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm sorry, my previous presentation had store pictures from inside the store, and I can send that over after.

286
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:35,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I believe they have a food court inside the store, like their other locations.

287
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:41,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you just reiterate your trash and litter mitigation for the site, especially for this having a food court?

288
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:46,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so they've added additional dumpsters in the rear.

289
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:53,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a food operator, both this grocery store and then somebody that, you know, quasi restaurant,

290
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,299
[SPEAKER_02]: There's additional state requirements in terms of food waste.

291
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why there's a lot more dumpsters in this area.

292
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:05,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Previously, there was only one dumpster that serviced this entire building.

293
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:09,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Other tenants have their own individual dumpsters as well.

294
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:12,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So these ones that are shown are entirely for HMR.

295
00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:14,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll work.

296
00:23:14,284 --> 00:23:17,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there were a bunch of comments from the Board of Health.

297
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:22,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will all be coordinated through the building permit process because their permit drawings show a lot more detail.

298
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for answering.

299
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:33,999
[SPEAKER_05]: If I thank you.

300
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:38,821
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may follow up on that, I appreciate the answer about the dumpster.

301
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:45,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you also speak a little bit about humor and food court?

302
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:55,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Patrons who might be coming and kind of as they're walking out to their cars are kind of eating outside.

303
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:57,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk about.

304
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Trash mitigation in the parking area and sidewalks.

305
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:09,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have a couple existing what I call pedestrian trash cans.

306
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:11,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So, obviously, like, for people walking by.

307
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:16,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Scattered throughout the sidewalk, there is a fair amount of trash on site today.

308
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do anticipate adding.

309
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,111
[SPEAKER_02]: one to two more trash cans as needed.

310
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:26,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be very popular so it wouldn't surprise me if it's two.

311
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:38,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the things there is some existing and so we kind of see we have day porters that are there every single day emptying the trash and they're on top of it both throughout the parking lot and along the sidewalk.

312
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:47,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have some there today and we anticipate adding more as needed and something we want to stay on top of it as well too because we know customers don't want to come to a dirty property either.

313
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,287
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are no other comments from the board, I will now open it up to the public.

314
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I skipped ahead a little bit earlier.

315
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll open up the public comment period.

316
00:25:13,215 --> 00:25:18,537
[SPEAKER_03]: by stating that those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.

317
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:26,140
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

318
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

319
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:33,963
[SPEAKER_03]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide

320
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:36,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments is, it is not part of the public record.

321
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:43,628
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

322
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:50,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

323
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:55,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, so we didn't have any previously received comments or letters.

324
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:58,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I am refreshing our inbox now.

325
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:07,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a reminder folks can use the raise hand feature, or if you're having trouble finding that you can use the chat function just to identify yourself.

326
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:13,228
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give folks maybe a minute or 2 just to respond to that while I check the email.

327
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so no new emails.

328
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:30,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not seeing any hands or messages in the chat.

329
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,563
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to scan skim through and see if anybody sort of waving their hands on the screen or anything like that.

330
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:38,725
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're good.

331
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:41,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Amanda.

332
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:47,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to close the public comment period and we're going to go back to board deliberation.

333
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:49,452
[SPEAKER_03]: So there has been

334
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,161
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we decide whether or not we are going to approve, deny, or approve with conditions.

335
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:06,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to test the board and just see where you wanted to start off with any conditions.

336
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:15,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I can name a few that I know that we will need to go over, but does anyone have anything to add or any questions that they want to cover at this time?

337
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:19,505
[SPEAKER_03]: So any clarifying questions that they want from Ms.

338
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:19,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Weatherby?

339
00:27:29,268 --> 00:27:36,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, let's let's discuss some conditions and see if we can actually get this going so that we can possibly get to an approval.

340
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,826
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's okay with the board to see if we can.

341
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,200
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much deliberate on that for one.

342
00:27:43,220 --> 00:28:00,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was some new, uh, in addition to the shade trees that the proponent has showed us, there was a discussion of some native plantings to make sure that, um, the parking lot would be, um, that the heat island effect would be reduced off the parking lot, um, within previous materials.

343
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:08,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And the proponent has already said that they will be working with, um, city staff, uh, to determine final selection of that.

344
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:10,083
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a condition I would impose.

345
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:11,992
[SPEAKER_13]: A quick question, Jackie.

346
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:14,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we got too many conditions.

347
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:17,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I mean, it just answered me.

348
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:19,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to confirm who was drafting the conditions.

349
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:20,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

350
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I so I apologize.

351
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:27,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually Amanda acting in the realm of clerk.

352
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:35,742
[SPEAKER_03]: As of right now, Amanda, I just want to clarify that you are going along with our are you recording our conditions?

353
00:28:36,383 --> 00:29:00,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, so I took some notes from previous meeting the previous meeting and also in in this case as well, although I feel like most of them are actually captured by PDS staff had drafted a couple of conditions that were put in the most recent revised memo, which, of course, not obligated to take up, but as a point of reference for you all.

354
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:13,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and so to clarify on my end, I'm reading what the PDS staff has provided us with and I want to see how the board feels about these conditions and if you want to adopt them to go forward for approval.

355
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:26,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first one would be in addition to the new shade trees, we're talking about native planning such as the flowering shrubs that Ms.

356
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:27,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Weatherby has already discussed.

357
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:32,784
[SPEAKER_03]: If the board is OK with that approval.

358
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but with that conditions.

359
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:43,188
[SPEAKER_12]: You need me to send those to Emily to have in front of you or I think they're in the folder, right?

360
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:50,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's in the yeah, yeah.

361
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:55,634
[SPEAKER_14]: My screen would be helpful for you to put them on screen or actually have them if you want me to put them on screen.

362
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, that would be helpful to have visual enough.

363
00:30:05,343 --> 00:30:22,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't have the permission, sorry.

364
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:25,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll just go through.

365
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:47,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And as discussed, in order to meet customer parking demand and reduce cruising for the parking behavior, which creates congestion and reduces pedestrian safety, employees and staff will be required to park in the rear parking lot, as well as wayfinding signs be provided to make customers aware of the availability of the rear parking.

366
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:57,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that one makes sense to me.

367
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:01,756
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like the applicant is already willing to do that.

368
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:06,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, agreed.

369
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:11,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And.

370
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:17,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, the proposal will comply with the requirements of the fire chief's memo dated 6 to.

371
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,072
[SPEAKER_03]: During the original 6 to 2023 from the department.

372
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:31,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and we also confirmed that the drive aisles all meet the requirements too.

373
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:43,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And in accordance with the city engineering comments and their memo dated 6-2-2023, the heaved and cracked panels of the sidewalk along Meadow Avenue must be replaced in conformance with city standards.

374
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:53,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one and the next one were just, were requested adding, um, subject to mass DOT review and approval as it's their land.

375
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:54,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

376
00:31:55,387 --> 00:31:56,750
[SPEAKER_12]: And that should be Middlesex.

377
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I cut and paste his comments.

378
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:00,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Middlesex, yes.

379
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:04,986
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't get caught in spellcheck.

380
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:14,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for public purposes.

381
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:14,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read out.

382
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:27,725
[SPEAKER_03]: In accordance with the city engineering comments in their memo dated 6-2-2023, driveway apron must be reconstructed to ensure conformance with MAAB regulations, particularly in regard to cross slopes, widths, and accessible paths.

383
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:33,606
[SPEAKER_03]: The accessible walkway, which is a sidewalk, should cross the apron via Portland cement concrete panels.

384
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:43,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the final one that we had was just to ensure that trash and litigation for the site.

385
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with there being a full court, and you said you would work with the board of health on that.

386
00:32:54,854 --> 00:33:01,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so just to clarify that there's 2 items with that kind of works with the board of health on all their internal and their personal use.

387
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:06,857
[SPEAKER_02]: We provide locations on site where they can do it, and then they have to dispose of their own waste.

388
00:33:06,877 --> 00:33:09,739
[SPEAKER_02]: They generate inside and anything with loading and service.

389
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:14,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, as the landlord, will handle the pedestrian trash, all the on-site cleanup.

390
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:16,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to make that clear.

391
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:20,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Both parties are willing to do it, but administered in two different ways.

392
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:34,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you'll just work with the board of health on appropriate trash and mitigation for those items.

393
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the support have any other.

394
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:45,224
[SPEAKER_03]: For 1, do we accept all these conditions as is, or does the board have anything to add.

395
00:33:45,864 --> 00:33:51,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Or subtract if none.

396
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,912
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make a motion to approve the conditions as stated.

397
00:33:58,932 --> 00:33:59,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

398
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:14,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second it with the kind of addition of the in collaboration with MassDOT.

399
00:34:14,662 --> 00:34:14,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

400
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:18,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and that would be part of one of the conditions.

401
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Or actually two, so that's all encompassing.

402
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:26,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So the site I am

403
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:33,583
[SPEAKER_03]: So, a roll call for acceptance of the site plan site plan approval with conditions as stated.

404
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:37,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do a roll call vice chair Emily.

405
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:38,785

[SPEAKER_00]: And Marijansky?

412
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:01,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

413
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:03,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry to interrupt.

414
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, apologies, Chair.

415
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:14,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only eligible members to vote are Ari, yourself, Emily and Peter.

416
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:15,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.

417
00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:18,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually said that at the beginning, and I'm so used to doing roll call.

418
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:18,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

419
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:19,694
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go back.

420
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:27,317
[SPEAKER_03]: New board members are not eligible because you were not part of the board at the time that the public hearing was opened.

421
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:31,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to go back and start over.

422
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:37,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for clarity, vice chair, you need to you just everybody voted yes, right?

423
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:39,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I so Jackie did not.

424
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:42,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I was only the ones that are eligible.

425
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:43,776
[SPEAKER_07]: You just count those votes.

426
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:45,037
[SPEAKER_03]: You count those votes?

427
00:35:45,057 --> 00:35:45,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

428
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:50,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll call because it's remote.

429
00:35:52,203 --> 00:35:56,606
[SPEAKER_03]: So just for clarity, I will go back vice chair Emily Hederman.

430
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:59,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I Peter cows.

431
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:00,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

432
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Ari Fishman?

433
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:03,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

434
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:06,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, say aye.

435
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:11,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Your site plan has been approved with the conditions as stated.

436
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:12,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

437
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:15,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Wetherby, thank you so much for your presentation and for your time here.

438
00:36:16,756 --> 00:36:17,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

439
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:18,797
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

440
00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:20,498
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited to bring H-Mart as well.

441
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,739
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited to have you.

442
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:25,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to have H-Mart.

443
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:27,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

444
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:28,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night, everyone.

445
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:30,346
[SPEAKER_03]: You too, bye-bye.

446
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:42,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the next item on the list tonight is special permit for 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is Bank of America.

447
00:36:42,873 --> 00:36:44,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It was continued from 7-19-23.

448
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:50,978
[SPEAKER_03]: The applicant is in the processes of revising the plan documents for the board's review and has requested a continuance.

449
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:55,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to entertain a motion to continue this item to the next board meeting, which is a date certain on 9-6-23.

450
00:37:00,763 --> 00:37:02,304
[SPEAKER_03]: A 2nd 2nd.

451
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:06,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vice chair and we had a man.

452
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:08,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I Peter cows.

453
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:12,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I. Are you fishermen.

454
00:37:13,571 --> 00:37:18,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I. Pam Mary asking I. Sally, a key key.

455
00:37:19,174 --> 00:37:23,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure I watched her.

456
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:25,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself, Jackie mcpherson's I.

457
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:29,269
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been moved to 9623.

458
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:36,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And our next item on the list is petition referred from city council for zoning ordinance amendments, which has continued from 8 to 23.

459
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:44,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to invite Danielle Evans, which is senior planner for the city to present any changes to the amendment to the board.

460
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:48,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

461
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me find.

462
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:56,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Teresa's headphones were talking.

463
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:57,947
[SPEAKER_12]: corner of the room.

464
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:10,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you all have a chance to look at the revised staff report?

465
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:21,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I did, but I unfortunately did not have a chance to watch the video, so I don't believe I'm eligible to decide on this.

466
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

467
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:29,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, have you been keeping track of what we saw was the last meeting was when the public hearing was opened.

468
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,617
[SPEAKER_12]: So everyone who was at that meeting.

469
00:38:34,517 --> 00:38:35,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless.

470
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:43,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone listened and attested to having read them or watch the meeting, so I think Peter.

471
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:45,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Peter, were you able to?

472
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:51,085
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I knew I needed to watch and attest to was the H1 OK.

473
00:38:56,032 --> 00:39:02,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so then in that case, Peter and Emily, it sounds like you can be part of discourse, but not eligible to vote on this item.

474
00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:15,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sherrod as well, you weren't part of the board quite yet when this was opened, so able to be part of discourse, but not eligible to vote on this item.

475
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:18,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for clarifying Amanda.

476
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, why me?

477
00:39:29,582 --> 00:39:49,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So while you're getting the document open, the background here for everybody and for any members of the public who are watching tonight is that the city council had some changes they wanted to make to the table of use and parking regulations around particularly motor vehicle uses.

478
00:39:51,810 --> 00:40:08,055
[SPEAKER_07]: in a particular district, and they asked, they were aware that from the zoning recodification, there were a number of other changes that we were recommending that are generally minor in nature, some of which are actually

479
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:11,296
[SPEAKER_07]: One is an unintended consequence.

480
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,336
[SPEAKER_07]: A few are some clarifications.

481
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:20,998
[SPEAKER_07]: One is a correction that does not fall in the realm of Scrivener's error, although you could argue it.

482
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:31,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they asked us to put together a list and a packet of changes that are not wholesale, let's change up all of Medford zoning.

483
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,941
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the plan moving forward.

484
00:40:33,961 --> 00:40:37,082
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking to hire a consultant to do that, but rather,

485
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:46,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I would sort of say administrative changes that are straightforward and easy for people to understand overall.

486
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:55,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we did, we, as staff, and we provided those to the counselors who reviewed them, agreed that, yes, they would like to be the proponent on those.

487
00:40:56,706 --> 00:41:02,687
[SPEAKER_07]: So these were officially put on the city council agenda by Councilor Behrs and Councilor Carviello.

488
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:07,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they are legally referred to the CD board

489
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:11,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So they must refer them to this board for public hearing and comment.

490
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:18,925
[SPEAKER_07]: You make recommendations to the city council, and then they have a public hearing on it and they vote on the changes.

491
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:26,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So over the course of that, we have also, this was a public hearing that opened at the last meeting.

492
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:32,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have also since then sent these to legal counsel for the city.

493
00:41:33,479 --> 00:41:36,240
[SPEAKER_07]: They had some language changes on some of them.

494
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly they work with us on the form of things to make sure they're presented correctly.

495
00:41:42,322 --> 00:41:44,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we've incorporated all of that.

496
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:46,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, so Danielle, did you get the document open?

497
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:48,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you want to present the changes tonight from what?

498
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:54,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can be clear that the board can make any recommendations on these they want.

499
00:41:55,476 --> 00:42:02,517
[SPEAKER_07]: When we give a memo to the council, what we're going to say is, this one that you sent us, we agree with.

500
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:06,998
[SPEAKER_07]: This one that you sent us, we recommend these changes.

501
00:42:07,418 --> 00:42:10,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they may or may not take the changes that come out of this board.

502
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:16,780
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm sharing my screen so it's easier to follow along.

503
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,260
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this is in the packet.

504
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:21,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, under the.

505
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:29,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Immediate zoning changes, I think is what we've been calling it also pre phase 2 changes.

506
00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:32,305
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

507
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:39,067
[SPEAKER_12]: These are the motor vehicle related uses that originated in city council.

508
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:47,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, let's see, let's just changing some of these wise, you know, by right to.

509
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:56,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Special permit and city council elected to make themselves the special permit granting authority.

510
00:42:56,307 --> 00:43:00,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia, did you mention if we should be.

511
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:07,975
[SPEAKER_07]: On on that 1, I would say that I've discussed with some of the counselors who should be the special permit granting authority.

512
00:43:08,994 --> 00:43:18,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually unusual that a city council's a special permit granting authority that's sort of historic, how it has always been here in Medford.

513
00:43:19,257 --> 00:43:27,320
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a better practice to have the planning board, be the special permit granting authority because you would be looking at

514
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:40,404
[SPEAKER_07]: the comprehensive plan and planning considerations, and you all are not elected, so you don't have to do things based on whether or not you're going to get voted or voted out of office for making those decisions.

515
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:54,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you were amenable, our recommendation from the office is actually to change these from being, and we would stick to the one column that they're already addressing, which is the C2 zone.

516
00:43:54,768 --> 00:44:12,639
[SPEAKER_07]: and to recommend that instead of making, because they're changing the yeses to special permit and special permit city council, if you all wanted to make that special permit CD board as a recommendation, they would be open to hearing that, so.

517
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:21,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the one related to keeping certain uses off of places like Mystic Avenue, correct?

518
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:29,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, so this particularly, these changes they put forward are the C2 district, which is Mystic Ave.

519
00:44:31,156 --> 00:44:37,002
[SPEAKER_07]: That is, everybody knows Mystic Ave, or do I need to be more clear about that?

520
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:37,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

521
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:50,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, just quickly, it does make sense that the planning board, as Daniel has already outlined, and yourself has already outlined, Lucia, that we see things more holistically with the city's vision.

522
00:44:52,336 --> 00:45:06,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it comes to one of those things where I feel like it should be an elected board that is special from a granting agency, but I mean, authority, but

523
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:11,350
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're saying that you want, I can definitely see what you mean.

524
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:18,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I had some hesitations before because it almost looked like we were trying to keep certain uses out on purpose.

525
00:45:19,192 --> 00:45:32,115
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's because you want it to be looked at more holistically, I just wanted to clarify that with the board that it just, as you said, it makes sense that we're actually looking at it at the city's vision.

526
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:49,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Right well, for example, they're not planners, they could be any experience and on the board we tend to have planners engineers transportation experts, you know, land use people architects people who understand.

527
00:45:50,977 --> 00:45:55,678
[SPEAKER_07]: how different uses interact with each other, what are the impacts of traffic and stuff.

528
00:45:56,438 --> 00:45:59,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And elected officials could have any background at all.

529
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,059
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they know is who's yelling loudest at them.

530
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:15,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you're making a decision about what is an appropriate use, is it really the people who are living next door to it who should decide or a bigger view of the community?

531
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:31,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And for example, there are people who are objecting to a multifamily building that is a block from the new train station because they're used to their neighborhood, they like it the way it is and they don't want a denser neighborhood.

532
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:34,118
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a block from a new train station, right?

533
00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:39,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a really appropriate use and we need to be increasing density around train stations.

534
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:45,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you were to leave a decision like that to an elected board, they might bow to like,

535
00:46:46,076 --> 00:46:50,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the people who've lived there don't like it, right?

536
00:46:50,557 --> 00:47:07,542
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where, and I will say in this case, yes, last night, actually, they voted to approve that, but that's the sort of the risk, and that's why looking at it, and you never wanna look at who are the actual individuals on a city council or a zoning board or a planning board at this moment.

537
00:47:08,062 --> 00:47:13,864
[SPEAKER_07]: When we make changes to zoning, even though we know that we're planning to rezone in the next year or two,

538
00:47:14,644 --> 00:47:24,913
[SPEAKER_07]: you need to think about if this is the way it's going to be for the next 20 or 30 years, we're not thinking about who is on the board now, but who's going to be on the board in 8, 10, 15 years from now.

539
00:47:25,673 --> 00:47:31,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And who's obligated to get the city's highest and best use for a site, right?

540
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:46,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be inclined to support the motion to switch it to be the planning board.

541
00:47:47,196 --> 00:48:04,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I can imagine in 10 years it being this one exception where all permits are with the planning department except for motor vehicles and that's like an unnecessary bit of absurdity.

542
00:48:06,212 --> 00:48:11,834
[SPEAKER_06]: even if we understand where it's coming from now, that feels like it should be compatible with other decisions.

543
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:12,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

544
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Same.

545
00:48:17,016 --> 00:48:17,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

546
00:48:17,316 --> 00:48:31,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, as a traffic engineer who's worked in private development, it was kind of a surprise for me to come to this board and see exactly how much approval the city council needs to have when in most municipalities where I've worked, it already is the planning board that makes most decisions.

547
00:48:37,843 --> 00:48:43,966
[SPEAKER_12]: that was also one of the things that surprised me the most when I came to Medford was, well, what does the licensing commission do?

548
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:45,547
[SPEAKER_12]: And what does a planning board do?

549
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:49,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Because all the powers seem to, for those decisions seem to rest in city council.

550
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:53,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there's, you know, all this talk about charter review and who has power, who doesn't.

551
00:48:53,932 --> 00:49:04,258
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think if folks haven't seen how it works elsewhere, what is normal, then they don't realize that

552
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,631
[SPEAKER_12]: For it's an outlier in this respect.

553
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:17,540
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, I'm building off that point, Danielle, I think, regardless of who is doing the deciding, you know, the, the city council, you know, is.

554
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Influential to our.

555
00:49:21,363 --> 00:49:24,545
[SPEAKER_13]: to our codes, as you can see here with these changes.

556
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:37,814
[SPEAKER_13]: So as long as we, the Community Development Board, are implementing the codes and reviewing per our jurisdiction, then we're just kind of following their direction.

557
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:48,181
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I think it makes sense, but I'm not able to vote, but I agree with what you guys are saying.

558
00:49:51,185 --> 00:50:09,541
[SPEAKER_12]: So in addition to these, so this came from city council and our office, while we're at it, it's not just car sales lots that are banging down the door.

559
00:50:09,561 --> 00:50:16,566
[SPEAKER_12]: I also get lots of calls from warehouses and self-storage and other undesirable uses that are getting kicked out of,

560
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:28,427
[SPEAKER_12]: some of our neighboring communities, like they're coming from Cambridge and Somerville or Arlington, they're looking for new homes and they're coming to Medford because we allow them by right.

561
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:44,160
[SPEAKER_12]: And so until we're able to redraw our boundaries and decide where some of these issues could go by right, I think that an extra layer, you know, it's this discretionary review is warranted.

562
00:50:44,781 --> 00:50:45,642
[SPEAKER_12]: So for

563
00:50:46,802 --> 00:50:53,504
[SPEAKER_12]: So parking area or garage, you're not accessory to a permitted principal use.

564
00:50:53,524 --> 00:51:02,226
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically like the parking lots along Mystic Ave that are rented out for school bus storage, that kind of stuff's by right right now.

565
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:06,667
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we want more parking lots to store school buses.

566
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:16,130
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that should be at least a special permit to say, is this spot an appropriate location?

567
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:23,763
[SPEAKER_12]: So we switch those from yeses, which are by right to the CD board across the board for that.

568
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And then.

569
00:51:28,205 --> 00:51:38,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Also added to the wholesale transportation, industrial uses added a few more to be special permits in those cases, I think most of these.

570
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,051
[SPEAKER_12]: We flipped to board of appeals to be consistent with what

571
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:48,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Board is already providing that relief.

572
00:51:49,937 --> 00:52:14,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, the fuel and ice sales switch from by right to needing a special permit in the C2, then warehouse, wholesale, establishment, and mini or self-storage warehouse.

573
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:20,819
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lot of self-storage, a lot in Medford.

574
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:35,883
[SPEAKER_12]: I was joking around that at some point I want to do a study of how many self-storage facilities we have per capita in Medford compared to our budding communities, because I guarantee we have more.

575
00:52:36,383 --> 00:52:45,685
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that those should not be something that can just come in by right, but a special permit, if it's an appropriate use for the location.

576
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:50,955
[SPEAKER_12]: And so those would be going to board of appeals, unless anyone has any.

577
00:52:54,378 --> 00:52:56,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Opinion on whether it shouldn't be them.

578
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,742
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was just trying to be consistent with.

579
00:53:00,363 --> 00:53:03,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Who was the for this use category in general.

580
00:53:08,009 --> 00:53:13,353
[SPEAKER_12]: And then for accessory uses the only 1 in here that we that I switched.

581
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:16,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Was open storage.

582
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:23,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Change that to not being by right to being the community development board because right now it's.

583
00:53:24,631 --> 00:53:29,794
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot by right and we see 2 and I don't think we need.

584
00:53:31,115 --> 00:53:33,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Open storage being able to go wherever they want.

585
00:53:35,717 --> 00:53:37,338
[SPEAKER_12]: So, those were the changes that.

586
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anybody have any questions about the additional uses that we added?

587
00:53:44,324 --> 00:54:08,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, we were going by, you know, the comprehensive plan was our guiding document for which uses are what we're trying to see in Medford, in certain areas of the city, and what those areas of the city are currently zoned, and then making the changes based on that.

588
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:15,182
[SPEAKER_12]: So it wasn't like an arbitrary, we're just gonna flip this slide to a CD special permit.

589
00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:19,184
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, there was a process that we went through to come up with that.

590
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:24,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I move on?

591
00:54:27,409 --> 00:54:27,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

592
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:33,733
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the second one is multiple principal structures on a lot in the most recent recodification.

593
00:54:35,614 --> 00:54:38,496
[SPEAKER_12]: It was changed to not allow multiple principal dwellings

594
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:45,832
[SPEAKER_12]: structures anywhere except the mixed use zone, and that caused a lot of unintended consequences.

595
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:54,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the shopping centers are now non-conforming, and the housing authority properties are non-conforming.

596
00:54:54,836 --> 00:55:06,881
[SPEAKER_12]: They're in the middle of trying to rehabilitate their projects and all of a sudden, what they wanted to do wasn't allowed anymore to have multiple principal structures.

597
00:55:06,921 --> 00:55:08,022
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to rectify that.

598
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:24,617
[SPEAKER_12]: make that something that is allowed everywhere in the city, in any zone, except in the two single-family zones, the SF1 and SF2, along with the general residential zoning district, except by special permit.

599
00:55:25,177 --> 00:55:35,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Because depending on the circumstances of the lot, it might be completely appropriate to have two principal structures rather than one massive structure.

600
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:38,407
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be very context,

601
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:46,937
[SPEAKER_12]: specific, so by special permit will allow that to be evaluated.

602
00:55:46,957 --> 00:55:51,698
[SPEAKER_12]: And that special permit would rest with the community board.

603
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:59,300
[SPEAKER_13]: By definition, an accessory dwelling unit, an ADU, is not considered a principal structure, correct?

604
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

605
00:56:03,742 --> 00:56:08,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the third was the second associate member for the Board of Appeals and to clarify

606
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:11,630
[SPEAKER_12]: the length of the term.

607
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:28,881
[SPEAKER_12]: We modified this slightly from what you saw at the last public hearing to update the form to make it more clear per legal counsel.

608
00:56:31,964 --> 00:56:38,068
[SPEAKER_12]: The point of this is to stagger the terms so one member shall expire each year and to allow the two associate members.

609
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:47,516
[SPEAKER_12]: and the correcting the unintended additional referrals to the CDB.

610
00:56:50,117 --> 00:57:10,067
[SPEAKER_12]: During the recodification, the findings, so the section six findings under chapter 48, they hadn't been classified as special permits in the last ordinance, so they were just going to the zoning board for non-conforming structures and uses to modify them.

611
00:57:11,258 --> 00:57:20,940
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the most in the recent recodification, they were called special permits and we have requirements in the ordinance that say that all special permits have to be referred to the city board.

612
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,881
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think that was the intention.

613
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:25,081
[SPEAKER_12]: These are very minor.

614
00:57:27,962 --> 00:57:28,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Minor things that.

615
00:57:30,082 --> 00:57:33,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Shouldn't require referral, but it wouldn't preclude them.

616
00:57:33,963 --> 00:57:34,423
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if the.

617
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:36,284
[SPEAKER_12]: City council feels really wanted.

618
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,461
[SPEAKER_12]: the city board to weigh in than they could.

619
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:51,127
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing that stops them from doing it, but they wouldn't be required, which would be what the process was before the recodification.

620
00:57:51,727 --> 00:57:54,328
[SPEAKER_12]: It was one of the situations of an unintended consequence.

621
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:04,954
[SPEAKER_12]: We specify special permits as required by the table of use and parking regulations.

622
00:58:08,848 --> 00:58:16,709
[SPEAKER_12]: And then number five, I think I'm going to skip over this because this is more complicated and will require some more discussion.

623
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:17,810
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll get to that at the end.

624
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:23,491
[SPEAKER_12]: For number six is updating the inclusionary housing provisions.

625
00:58:24,631 --> 00:58:35,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, there's provisions that requires a special permit to provide the inclusionary housing, which doesn't make sense.

626
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:42,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Some cities and towns have this, but many that I worked in have not.

627
00:58:43,504 --> 00:58:45,744
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that you need to comply with.

628
00:58:45,884 --> 00:58:54,667
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's unnecessary because of all projects that trigger inclusionary zoning are subject to site plan review.

629
00:58:55,087 --> 00:58:59,328
[SPEAKER_12]: So they are reviewed and there can be conditions and there's oversight.

630
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:06,550
[SPEAKER_12]: And also for 3A zoning, we cannot have special permits in there.

631
00:59:07,138 --> 00:59:20,666
[SPEAKER_12]: And currently our inclusionary housing ordinance is being studied, having an economic feasibility analysis done on it to make sure that we can use it.

632
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:30,012
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there's anything in there saying special permits are required, then that will complicate the rezoning for 3A.

633
00:59:32,062 --> 00:59:38,107
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically this just goes through, you know, deleting mentions of needing special permits.

634
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:48,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Switching DHCD to executive office of housing, livable communities to reflect the new name change.

635
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:54,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Adding site plan review authority.

636
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,961
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing that I did add was that

637
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:06,805
[SPEAKER_12]: regarding the provisions is that the number of bedrooms of the affordable unit shall be proportionate to that of the market rate units.

638
01:00:07,165 --> 01:00:09,446
[SPEAKER_12]: That wasn't expressly called out.

639
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:23,451
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would strongly suggest and pseudo require developers do that, but there's nothing in the ordinance that actually said that.

640
01:00:24,492 --> 01:00:27,753
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to make it quite obvious because

641
01:00:28,672 --> 01:00:45,021
[SPEAKER_12]: when it was getting time to get the affordable units approved and submitted to the state, I would get floor plans to look at, and it'd be like the one bedrooms, and it's like none of the two bedrooms or three bedrooms, like, well, you can't do that.

642
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:56,167
[SPEAKER_12]: It had the percentage of units, but they weren't, with the bedroom counts, that they weren't proportionate in that way.

643
01:00:56,985 --> 01:01:02,110
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a great change to now expressly call that out.

644
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:12,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel, I don't want to cut you off, but if you had referred to 3 a, and I don't know if you wanted to just just for public purposes at this point.

645
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:18,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of explain that 3 is related to the multi house and actor.

646
01:01:18,284 --> 01:01:18,945
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only that.

647
01:01:19,405 --> 01:01:23,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I'll also have, I believe you put an agenda item on this.

648
01:01:23,812 --> 01:01:26,714
[SPEAKER_12]: of an update of the city's process.

649
01:01:26,734 --> 01:01:48,247
[SPEAKER_12]: But yes, for the public listening, chapter 40A has a new section 3A that was passed by the state legislature and regulations or guidelines were put out by DHCD, now EOHLC, of how to implement those.

650
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:52,009
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was that multifamily housing must be allowed by right

651
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:59,254
[SPEAKER_12]: within a half a mile of transit stations or MBTA communities.

652
01:01:59,334 --> 01:02:05,199
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are an MBTA community, specifically a rapid transit community.

653
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:08,701
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have the quickest timeline to get this done.

654
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:15,407
[SPEAKER_12]: So we wanna make sure that we're not passing zoning that wouldn't comply.

655
01:02:15,427 --> 01:02:18,449
[SPEAKER_12]: And it seemed like an opportune time to fix that.

656
01:02:20,894 --> 01:02:25,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Having inclusionary housing previously by special meant, which is didn't pretty much make sense.

657
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:31,762
[SPEAKER_03]: This is meant should be mandatory for the that's just that would be in conflict with the rule, correct?

658
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:32,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

659
01:02:33,964 --> 01:02:43,812
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, yeah, so basically, that just, you know, just cleans it up.

660
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:47,575
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all the strikeout is about.

661
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:50,800
[SPEAKER_12]: a special permit.

662
01:02:51,441 --> 01:02:55,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And then just kind of wordsmithing it.

663
01:02:56,344 --> 01:03:04,909
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is, as I said before, everywhere in the document, switching DHCD to EOHLC, as we have been directed to.

664
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:18,416
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the definitions that were in the individual sections were, the intention was for them to have been moved to a

665
01:03:20,192 --> 01:03:25,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Complete definition section, but they got dropped and they were never added.

666
01:03:25,233 --> 01:03:31,875
[SPEAKER_12]: And we want to restore them back to their individual sections.

667
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's actually when they're.

668
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:42,798
[SPEAKER_12]: When they're read outside of the individual section for which they're.

669
01:03:43,418 --> 01:03:47,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Applied to, I think it introduces confusion and.

670
01:03:49,065 --> 01:04:04,473
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of the definition sections actually are pretty important and aren't necessarily like specific as like a condition, but telling you like who's the SPGA for this for this section.

671
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:14,318
[SPEAKER_12]: And so until we can do a comprehensive audit of all our definitions, I think it's best not to move them and to put them back.

672
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:17,660
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that was like the affordability

673
01:04:20,114 --> 01:04:35,699
[SPEAKER_12]: All of the inclusionary housing definitions got dropped, which are all of these, which are really important when understanding what the requirements are of that section, rather than having to flip all the way to the end of the ordinance to read them.

674
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:46,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Reinserting the language for linkage, so all of the linkage definitions, putting those back in,

675
01:04:46,724 --> 01:04:56,310
[SPEAKER_12]: So the parks and recreation, police and fire, roads and traffic, and water and sewer facilities linkage definitions were dropped.

676
01:04:57,291 --> 01:05:01,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, so those are all, pardon my scrolling.

677
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:10,099
[SPEAKER_12]: The adult use marijuana establishment definitions, those were dropped.

678
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll put those, I don't have them listed here because I don't think

679
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,541
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually had them handy.

680
01:05:20,002 --> 01:05:22,904
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the solar energy definitions also got dropped.

681
01:05:23,864 --> 01:05:37,712
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe signage, which I don't think I even have a copy of, but it would be the old signage definitions putting them back.

682
01:05:40,043 --> 01:05:41,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, can I interrupt for one second?

683
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:47,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make a technical, not any disagreement with Danielle, I want to make a technical clarification to the board.

684
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:56,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's here in front of us is what the council had on their list to make changes.

685
01:05:57,779 --> 01:06:00,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of this is deleted from the zoning.

686
01:06:03,445 --> 01:06:10,694
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like, oh, we're not moving them out of the end area.

687
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:16,401
[SPEAKER_07]: When the recodification happened, they forgot to put them into the end.

688
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:19,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're literally not anywhere in our zoning right now.

689
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:22,684
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're basically bringing them back out.

690
01:06:23,084 --> 01:06:25,284
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council sent us this list.

691
01:06:25,784 --> 01:06:30,846
[SPEAKER_07]: However, the adult use marijuana and the signs ones are also missing.

692
01:06:31,306 --> 01:06:44,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So the recommendation from the CD board would be, yes, we agree, put those back in where they belong in the zoning and also put in the marijuana definitions

693
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:45,968
[SPEAKER_07]: and the sign definitions.

694
01:06:46,428 --> 01:06:55,773
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're not making any recommendation of changing those definitions, just from the old ordinances to bring them back.

695
01:06:57,314 --> 01:07:13,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can actually see if you were to go to our current zoning right now, the marijuana section and the sign section both say definitions, see definition section 12.0 at the end, but there are no marijuana definitions in there and there are no sign definitions in that section.

696
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:26,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would actually, the recommendation from the city board would be, in addition to the ones you, the city council, are saying you wanna put back, you should also put back these others.

697
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:37,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions on any of that before we talk about number five?

698
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,782
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a very cool clarification, Alicia.

699
01:07:42,783 --> 01:07:45,705
[SPEAKER_06]: That certainly makes a very strong case for it.

700
01:07:45,725 --> 01:07:46,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

701
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:49,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, it was very funny.

702
01:07:49,368 --> 01:07:57,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I had one of our developers was like, Alicia, we're trying to comply with your solar ordinance, but there are no solar definitions.

703
01:07:57,994 --> 01:08:01,116
[SPEAKER_07]: And we went to the old version of the ordinance and there are definitions.

704
01:08:01,156 --> 01:08:03,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we use those definitions?

705
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:04,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, oh my God.

706
01:08:06,588 --> 01:08:13,774
[SPEAKER_12]: And now the old ordinance isn't on Unicode anymore, which was my cheat to see was between the two.

707
01:08:13,794 --> 01:08:16,536
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not there anymore.

708
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:18,398
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can't even refer people to that.

709
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:24,823
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have a really, really old paper-bound copy that's been photocopied a gazillion times.

710
01:08:26,865 --> 01:08:27,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

711
01:08:27,825 --> 01:08:28,586
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not ideal.

712
01:08:36,123 --> 01:08:44,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so regarding number five, which is clarifying and de-conflicting which authority is the SPGA when there are multiple forms of relief.

713
01:08:45,528 --> 01:08:52,591
[SPEAKER_12]: We had the majority of this language, I think, was reviewed by legal counsel.

714
01:08:55,993 --> 01:08:59,674
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some cans of worms that can be opened.

715
01:09:03,812 --> 01:09:08,897
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just, I don't know if we can sever those three sections.

716
01:09:11,459 --> 01:09:12,600
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't, did we ever get an opinion?

717
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we, are we permitted to do that?

718
01:09:14,962 --> 01:09:16,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Or are we.

719
01:09:17,524 --> 01:09:18,645
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean by sever?

720
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:22,088
[SPEAKER_07]: So like in, in approving the.

721
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:24,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

722
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:29,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So what will frequently happen in the city councils, they'll have a motion.

723
01:09:30,038 --> 01:09:33,600
[SPEAKER_07]: within this case, what is it like eight portion, eight parts, right?

724
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,821
[SPEAKER_07]: They're numbered one through eight.

725
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:45,468
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they'll move to sever and then they'll approve items one, three and six and they'll table two and four and they'll deny seven, right?

726
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:52,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So if, or they may say there are eight things in here, we love all eight of them and they approve the whole thing in one vote.

727
01:09:53,173 --> 01:09:54,674
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that what you're asking about?

728
01:09:55,035 --> 01:09:57,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, because we don't have this specific

729
01:09:58,857 --> 01:10:17,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could advise them that our recommendation is that they sever the items and that they do not approve item five because we do not have appropriate language for them to vote on, but we recommend approving the other seven items.

730
01:10:20,024 --> 01:10:27,347
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was wondering if we could even get more, drill down even more because it was, a lot of it was, let's see,

731
01:10:30,009 --> 01:10:35,590
[SPEAKER_12]: If I see, do I have to switch screens?

732
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:36,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, which screen do you guys see now?

733
01:10:37,771 --> 01:10:39,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you see an ordinance or do you see the file still?

734
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,351
[SPEAKER_07]: We still see the file.

735
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:43,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

736
01:10:45,972 --> 01:10:46,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

737
01:10:46,272 --> 01:10:55,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So part of it, so the way the language that they had on there, actually, I just want to open up the version that the council sent to us.

738
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:02,873
[SPEAKER_07]: City Council paper zoning changes.

739
01:11:08,837 --> 01:11:26,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things that we're gonna ask Clem, hey surprise Clem, we're gonna ask you to do is to write up like the recommendations are gonna be looking at what the council sent us and then what is it that we're recommending, what's different.

740
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:35,013
[SPEAKER_07]: What they sent us is this proposed amendment, amend the language throughout the ordinance, reflect the site plan review authority, blah, blah, blah.

741
01:11:35,513 --> 01:11:41,896
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to recommend back to them an actual language for them to adopt.

742
01:11:44,357 --> 01:11:53,641
[SPEAKER_07]: The paragraph that's on their motion is not a legally accurate thing.

743
01:11:53,681 --> 01:11:56,763
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to say, replace this language with that language.

744
01:11:57,876 --> 01:12:02,160
[SPEAKER_07]: or replace this paragraph with that paragraph or these items?

745
01:12:05,403 --> 01:12:23,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so when we were basically that, you know, to de-conflict, you know, to implement that amendment to the whole ordinance required going through all of this and making some

746
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:40,497
[SPEAKER_12]: changes, so what I did was change, you know, instances where they specifically called out a board to rather switch it to SPGA, so Special Permit Granting Authority or Site Plan Review Authority.

747
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:44,019
[SPEAKER_12]: And pardon my scrolling, I'm just trying to go to where this track changes.

748
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:48,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I can make people dizzy.

749
01:12:48,081 --> 01:12:55,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So the three sections which

750
01:12:56,848 --> 01:13:11,878
[SPEAKER_12]: need some more consideration are these provisions for so 6.1.10, which is this special permit.

751
01:13:11,918 --> 01:13:17,522
[SPEAKER_12]: So the way it was written now was the SPGA or Community Development Board.

752
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:22,365
[SPEAKER_12]: It says as the case may be made by special permit or site plan review,

753
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,521
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, reduce away the requirements.

754
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:30,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that was confusing because the CD board could be the SPGA, so it wouldn't be SPGA or Community Development Board.

755
01:13:32,065 --> 01:13:35,367
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be, you know, SPGA or the site planning authority.

756
01:13:35,387 --> 01:13:40,991
[SPEAKER_12]: So just making that switch would reduce some confusion.

757
01:13:41,011 --> 01:13:51,617
[SPEAKER_12]: And any time that you switch who the permit branding authority is in the table of use categories table, you wouldn't have to go through and try to find everywhere

758
01:13:52,115 --> 01:13:53,715
[SPEAKER_12]: where a specific board was called out.

759
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:59,657
[SPEAKER_12]: You would just know, okay, the SPGA for this use, go to the table, figure out who it is.

760
01:13:59,717 --> 01:14:00,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, now we know who it is.

761
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:11,240
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was like a lot of that dropped throughout that wasn't updated when the recodification happened.

762
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:19,462
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the city board was given some uses to become the SPGA and also became a site plan review authority

763
01:14:21,848 --> 01:14:37,532
[SPEAKER_12]: for some uses because they used to be, for those of you who are on the board before the recodification, there were site plan review special permits, and the recodification corrected that and made them just site plan reviews.

764
01:14:37,552 --> 01:14:40,033
[SPEAKER_12]: You approve a site plan, it's not a special permit.

765
01:14:41,553 --> 01:14:44,994
[SPEAKER_12]: So now they're normal site plan review approvals.

766
01:14:46,735 --> 01:14:49,956
[SPEAKER_12]: But still there's confusion because you don't want to

767
01:14:52,763 --> 01:15:04,288
[SPEAKER_12]: put in language where we're giving authority to a planning board that the authority doesn't have, like you don't want to call something a waiver when it's really a variance.

768
01:15:04,849 --> 01:15:08,250
[SPEAKER_12]: So it just requires a little bit more study.

769
01:15:09,111 --> 01:15:21,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And talking this through with the legal counsel, because I think it needs to be explained a little bit better, what we're talking about in coming to

770
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:27,703
[SPEAKER_12]: of a time crunch and I don't want to rush anything through, that's going to be incorrect.

771
01:15:29,865 --> 01:15:48,639
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was for, so there was for signs, for landscaping and for parking and loading requirements, there is the same provision allowing the SPJ or the site plan review authority to

772
01:15:49,823 --> 01:16:17,653
[SPEAKER_12]: wave certain things so they're not waving it's not waving anything that's in the dimensional table so you're not waving you know percentage of landscaping or open space would be like how the landscaping is provided like so screening or whether you have that perimeter screening or a number of islands that kind of thing which i think makes sense in site plan review for a planning board to be able to waive some of those because it's very

773
01:16:19,568 --> 01:16:22,529
[SPEAKER_12]: site-specific, some things don't make sense.

774
01:16:22,929 --> 01:16:29,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Having to go to the zoning board for a variance where the standard are so high, I don't think makes sense.

775
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:40,512
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to really be careful with the language to enable your board to waive certain standards legally that you can.

776
01:16:41,973 --> 01:16:47,754
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to get into a situation where approvals are overturned and things like that.

777
01:16:49,193 --> 01:16:52,175
[SPEAKER_12]: And so 6.2.20, this is for signs.

778
01:16:53,575 --> 01:17:00,999
[SPEAKER_12]: There is currently a provision, as I was saying, special permit for site plan review to approve larger signs or additional signs.

779
01:17:03,721 --> 01:17:08,664
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to make sure that that power is still be there.

780
01:17:08,684 --> 01:17:16,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, just switching out CD board to site plan review authority.

781
01:17:20,004 --> 01:17:20,605
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout.

782
01:17:21,505 --> 01:17:24,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just kind of keeps going on and on.

783
01:17:29,089 --> 01:17:30,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody have any questions?

784
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:33,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to keep scrolling until I find something else substantive.

785
01:17:38,114 --> 01:17:46,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, if the city council was to vote on this, they would need to have each place that shows up

786
01:17:47,402 --> 01:18:00,693
[SPEAKER_07]: and say like in 94 dash, the one on the screen, 6.4.12 waiver of standards change, you know, replace community development board with site plan review authority.

787
01:18:01,234 --> 01:18:10,782
[SPEAKER_07]: In theory, you could list in these sections, all of the following sections, replace the phrase community development board with site plan review authority.

788
01:18:12,017 --> 01:18:20,980
[SPEAKER_07]: but we would need to make that recommendation to them because the way it was written on this paper wasn't that legally clear.

789
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:39,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, if you were, the difference between that and the DHCD one is the DHCD one is a wholesale, literally every time DHCD shows up, you're replacing with EOHL, sorry, Jackie, I can't get it right.

790
01:18:40,665 --> 01:18:44,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still getting into E-H-O-L-C.

791
01:18:45,147 --> 01:19:03,733
[SPEAKER_07]: It's literally find and replace throughout the whole document, where in this case, you're replacing the phrase community development board with the phrase site plan review authority in some sections, but not literally every time it shows up in the document, which is why you would actually have to list out every location.

792
01:19:03,753 --> 01:19:07,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's helpful or more confusing.

793
01:19:09,223 --> 01:19:19,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike a clarifying question for number 5 are so the board's not able to vote on that one side because you still have to parse it out with the legal counsel to make sure that it's being presented properly.

794
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:25,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you take out some of the information that you have there, it needs to be reviewed by legal.

795
01:19:26,054 --> 01:19:30,136
[SPEAKER_07]: 1st, correct do we Danielle?

796
01:19:30,336 --> 01:19:31,017
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we feel?

797
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:33,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it do we think that it needs to be reviewed again?

798
01:19:33,538 --> 01:19:36,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we've discussed it a few times with legal counsel.

799
01:19:41,501 --> 01:19:47,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, I'm not sure whether at this point we feel we need to go back to them.

800
01:19:51,929 --> 01:19:56,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there are, there's an option for the CD board to say

801
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:01,364
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we support the planning office's recommendation.

802
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:05,926
[SPEAKER_07]: When you determine exactly what those sections are, we support that.

803
01:20:06,387 --> 01:20:13,251
[SPEAKER_07]: The planning board could say, we don't want to like leave it so loose right now.

804
01:20:15,272 --> 01:20:26,398
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the recommendation to the city council would be to not take up this item at this time and to consider that in another round.

805
01:20:27,945 --> 01:20:42,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I, you could recommend that the city, that the city council table this item until there's a more concrete recommendation from the planning office, but I'm not really sure how that works with the public hearing.

806
01:20:42,835 --> 01:20:52,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how does it, can you, I think you have to, I think you have to close your public hearing to make a recommendation to the city council on all the other items.

807
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:54,803
[SPEAKER_07]: It is our recommendation that we,

808
01:20:55,918 --> 01:21:10,184
[SPEAKER_07]: do that tonight if we feel good with the other items, because some of them, like the one about the principal structures, is actually kind of really urgently important to, like, Walkling Court, for example, right now.

809
01:21:11,244 --> 01:21:17,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And there have been other things that have come up that are as well, like other multi-building, things like that.

810
01:21:19,788 --> 01:21:24,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're concerned about the auto uses and Mystic Ave.

811
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:36,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, like that's actually the reason that the city council took it up is because there are places trying and looking at and shopping for new places to locate car dealerships and parking lots.

812
01:21:37,011 --> 01:21:40,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we don't want them to be able to do that as of right now.

813
01:21:41,032 --> 01:21:51,135
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is our recommendation that the ones that you're comfortable with, you vote out tonight and have them and so they can vote on September 5th on them.

814
01:21:52,232 --> 01:21:55,214
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think that's the open question, is what to do about this one.

815
01:21:55,755 --> 01:22:00,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless, don't let me pressure you, if you are not comfortable with some of the others we've discussed, please say that.

816
01:22:01,699 --> 01:22:05,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, because of the nods and the yeses, I'm just assuming that you are, so.

817
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:19,252
[SPEAKER_03]: My only question, and that's for the board for deliberation, is that we understand that this is an interim step to hold over to zone revisions, and you want to get these administrative changes done.

818
01:22:21,013 --> 01:22:32,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me as one board member, I can definitely vote on the other ones, but number five, I thought that there was like a process legally that before we change anything, we just had to make sure we were okay with what we're changing.

819
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:37,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know that I've wrapped my full head around exactly what that is.

820
01:22:38,357 --> 01:22:48,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if the board has, but I would also be inclined to say that I could recommend approval once you figure it out, once the city staff figured it out.

821
01:22:50,107 --> 01:22:57,173
[SPEAKER_12]: because it's really, it's, it's language where one part of the ordinance will say this body approves this.

822
01:22:57,293 --> 01:23:00,615
[SPEAKER_12]: And then another part of the ordinance will say, no, it's another body that approves this.

823
01:23:01,096 --> 01:23:09,303
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and some of it is holdover language that wasn't updated, but you can't just like presume that.

824
01:23:09,323 --> 01:23:11,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

825
01:23:11,044 --> 01:23:13,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's like the CD board can't do this.

826
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:16,248
[SPEAKER_12]: What's like, well, the CD board is an SPGA for something.

827
01:23:16,348 --> 01:23:17,049
[SPEAKER_12]: So why.

828
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:20,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would you be saying city council or board of appeals?

829
01:23:22,554 --> 01:23:29,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So I see this as sort of like sometimes when we vote out a site plan review, there's a whole list of conditions.

830
01:23:29,841 --> 01:23:34,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's one that is, and you'll work this out with the city engineer.

831
01:23:34,665 --> 01:23:43,013
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll work this out with the planning office, but that's a condition, whatever you agree to with them is part of the condition of the site plan review.

832
01:23:43,053 --> 01:23:43,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

833
01:23:43,714 --> 01:23:46,635
[SPEAKER_07]: it's sort of delegating that piece of the authority.

834
01:23:47,175 --> 01:24:03,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I guess there is the art, you can consider this, if you're comfortable with this conceptually, that you're delegating it to the planning staff to come up with the exact legal language to reflect what we've discussed here.

835
01:24:03,921 --> 01:24:07,102
[SPEAKER_07]: And that that is what should go in the memo to the city council.

836
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:12,667
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're not comfortable, I don't know that it has to.

837
01:24:13,128 --> 01:24:19,051
[SPEAKER_07]: In theory, this board could say, we don't have comment on any of these.

838
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:25,295
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no recommendation and that could go to the city council and they can make zoning change.

839
01:24:25,815 --> 01:24:35,981
[SPEAKER_07]: If this board failed to take action for 45 days, then the city council has the right to move forward without any recommendation from the zoning board.

840
01:24:37,576 --> 01:24:46,502
[SPEAKER_07]: where I'm saying, you know, we could also say to them, we recommend that you don't, you know, the board could say, we recommend that you don't change the language.

841
01:24:47,502 --> 01:24:51,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And the council could say, oh, we want to change it anyhow.

842
01:24:51,985 --> 01:24:55,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, right, you're just making a recommendation to them.

843
01:24:56,648 --> 01:24:59,590
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably wouldn't though, but they legally could.

844
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:14,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll open it up to the board now for clarifying questions and just to see exactly the temperature of where we're going with this and to see if there's any other questions that the board may have of Daniel.

845
01:25:14,934 --> 01:25:17,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel, if you're finished with your presentation, that is.

846
01:25:18,835 --> 01:25:26,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, it's real like technical nerdy zoning stuff that we're just trying to like clean up, make our lives easier.

847
01:25:34,101 --> 01:25:35,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think all of it makes sense.

848
01:25:36,123 --> 01:25:45,490
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything you said, Danielle, and replacing definitions, none of it seems like, yeah, it all just seems logical based on everything you guys have said.

849
01:25:47,772 --> 01:25:50,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think I appreciated your

850
01:25:51,082 --> 01:26:00,391
[SPEAKER_11]: analogy with leaving a condition in a site plan review, because that really did clarify that kind of, we're not really leaving anything unaddressed.

851
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:09,320
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that we need to recommend that this process be carried out the way it's going to be carried out, but we need to say we recommend it.

852
01:26:13,972 --> 01:26:20,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed, I think this makes sense to me and I was a little hesitant about the things we didn't know yet.

853
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:23,560
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, that analogy of.

854
01:26:24,881 --> 01:26:29,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I think makes me feel okay about passing it and I agree that.

855
01:26:30,425 --> 01:26:37,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of the important elements are quite time sensitive, so I would like to err on the side of action rather than saying nothing.

856
01:26:42,567 --> 01:26:50,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle, on section five, is there like a rule of thumb on who should do what when you're making these changes?

857
01:26:53,296 --> 01:27:08,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Like whether it is the planning board or it is the CBD, like the way that you've explained the changes on the spreadsheets when it comes to the amendments previously, they're so clear.

858
01:27:09,411 --> 01:27:18,514
[SPEAKER_04]: But the only question would be on section 5, like, how, what's, what's your mindset and what are your ideas when changing who's doing what?

859
01:27:18,854 --> 01:27:21,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, whether it's a planning board, whether it is a CBD.

860
01:27:23,495 --> 01:27:24,956
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you making these changes?

861
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:29,457
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it wouldn't be actually, like, changing anything.

862
01:27:30,557 --> 01:27:31,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically.

863
01:27:33,538 --> 01:27:35,999
[SPEAKER_05]: It's clarifying, reducing the confusion.

864
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:36,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

865
01:27:39,668 --> 01:27:46,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, the new ordinance doesn't understand that not all uses need special permits now.

866
01:27:47,231 --> 01:27:54,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, they all did before, and that was one of the things that had to get fixed is you have to allow things by right.

867
01:27:54,893 --> 01:28:04,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was this quirky language in the ordinance that said, this is by right, and it's subject to a special permit.

868
01:28:05,007 --> 01:28:10,348
[SPEAKER_12]: or subject to site plan review, oh, and by the way, if it's subject to site plan review, now it needs a special permit.

869
01:28:10,428 --> 01:28:12,609
[SPEAKER_12]: It literally said something like that.

870
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:17,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, by like, regardless, it will now need a special permit.

871
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:19,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, wait a minute, I'm reading, I'm like, this is kind of nuts.

872
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:22,991
[SPEAKER_12]: But that, I mean, that was fixed and I was glad to see that that was fixed.

873
01:28:25,191 --> 01:28:33,553
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically these sections don't contemplate that a site plan review authority

874
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:45,409
[SPEAKER_12]: would be like reviewing, so now it's not, it's not an SPGA because when you're a site plan review authority, there's no special permit that you're granting.

875
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:53,076
[SPEAKER_12]: So it just, it starts to get kind of confusing.

876
01:28:53,116 --> 01:29:02,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's just, if the CD board is a site plan review authority that you would be the ones

877
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:17,765
[SPEAKER_12]: waiving certain things, but the question is, you know, how do we do that in a way that's more aligning, aligning roles, basically.

878
01:29:18,606 --> 01:29:21,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Aligning, yeah, okay, that makes sense.

879
01:29:39,517 --> 01:29:45,158
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's no more questions from the board, because this is still a public hearing, I'm going to open it up for public comment.

880
01:29:46,598 --> 01:29:49,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure that there's public on, but I will read.

881
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:53,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hands feature or message Amanda in the comments.

882
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:58,440
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

883
01:29:58,841 --> 01:30:01,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

884
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:06,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

885
01:30:08,393 --> 01:30:11,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything so there were no previously received comments.

886
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:14,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just refreshing our inbox.

887
01:30:15,315 --> 01:30:18,876
[SPEAKER_00]: But no new comments have come in and.

888
01:30:19,757 --> 01:30:25,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Give folks a moment, but I think I don't actually think there are other members of the public on the call.

889
01:30:26,799 --> 01:30:28,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm not seeing any hands.

890
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:36,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to close the public comment period.

891
01:30:37,675 --> 01:30:39,196
[SPEAKER_03]: and go back to board deliberation.

892
01:30:40,336 --> 01:30:50,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will just start by just, I will leave the floor open for the board members to add.

893
01:30:50,501 --> 01:31:04,207
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this point, I appreciate the city's, all of the work that Daniel and other city staff has done in trying to identify these potential misaligned uses slash rules and rectify for ease for the city and ourselves.

894
01:31:04,467 --> 01:31:04,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And

895
01:31:06,267 --> 01:31:11,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I ask for a motion, I will ask if there is anything that the board wants to add.

896
01:31:11,349 --> 01:31:18,933
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's any language or anything that you want to change or.

897
01:31:37,112 --> 01:31:47,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to ask for potential motion to recommend approval of the proposed proposed ordinance amendments to the city council with the condition of Amanda.

898
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:49,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you help me capture that language for a number 5?

899
01:31:50,281 --> 01:31:50,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

900
01:31:51,122 --> 01:31:51,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

901
01:31:51,482 --> 01:31:58,727
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were 3 things that I took notes on and there's little scratchy sloppy so we can refine them.

902
01:31:58,847 --> 01:31:58,987
[SPEAKER_00]: But.

903
01:31:59,635 --> 01:32:10,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just in concept, so, um, the, and again, disregard if this is not accurate, but, uh, for the item where it talks about adding definitions, um.

904
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:23,281
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in addition to the definitions included in the paper, um, to also include definitions for the marijuana uses and signs, uh, in section 12.0.

905
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:27,262
[SPEAKER_00]: As 1 of the recommendations.

906
01:32:29,339 --> 01:32:31,562
[SPEAKER_00]: 2nd, was that the.

907
01:32:32,403 --> 01:32:34,245
[SPEAKER_00]: S. P. G. A. for the adjusted.

908
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:40,251
[SPEAKER_00]: C2 uses be the CD board as opposed to city council.

909
01:32:42,326 --> 01:32:48,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And 3rd item, and I'm not entirely sure how to capture this, but 1 way forward would be.

910
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:55,435
[SPEAKER_00]: To delegate to PDF staff that they, they update the language.

911
01:32:56,296 --> 01:33:00,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Of item never number 5 to kind of reflect what was discussed.

912
01:33:01,599 --> 01:33:05,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And to include that in the recommendation to city council.

913
01:33:13,681 --> 01:33:14,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any objections?

914
01:33:15,062 --> 01:33:18,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have one clarifying question on the marijuana and signed definitions.

915
01:33:18,264 --> 01:33:20,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I didn't capture that one in my conditions.

916
01:33:20,806 --> 01:33:22,727
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that one that we discussed for that?

917
01:33:24,588 --> 01:33:29,992
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council in there, let's reinsert these definitions.

918
01:33:30,212 --> 01:33:33,174
[SPEAKER_07]: They listed all those ones that are on your document.

919
01:33:33,675 --> 01:33:40,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually went and found the sign ones in my paper copy and there are like,

920
01:33:40,725 --> 01:33:47,130
[SPEAKER_07]: four pages of definitions here that are no longer found in our zoning.

921
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:48,571
[SPEAKER_07]: What's a roof sign?

922
01:33:48,591 --> 01:33:50,333
[SPEAKER_07]: What's an outdoor advertising board?

923
01:33:50,793 --> 01:34:02,442
[SPEAKER_07]: So to also include the sign definitions from the former version of the zoning and to also include.

924
01:34:02,622 --> 01:34:09,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So you were recommending to them that in addition to the ones that they're suggesting we put back in, they also include these.

925
01:34:11,576 --> 01:34:15,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Clem, I hope we have some way to scan.

926
01:34:15,178 --> 01:34:20,521
[SPEAKER_07]: We must have an electronic, I'm sure I have an electronic version of this, but if you can help us with that.

927
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:23,122
[SPEAKER_12]: All I have is this thing.

928
01:34:23,803 --> 01:34:29,046
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's in front of me, but we may, at worst, we'll scan it in and do an OCR.

929
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:30,066
[SPEAKER_07]: You can help us with that.

930
01:34:30,086 --> 01:34:31,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

931
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:35,814
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the recommendation.

932
01:34:35,914 --> 01:34:52,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, honestly, there was so there was also the one about changing the so like with the use table to also change the uses that Danielle recommended in addition to the ones that the city council.

933
01:35:03,746 --> 01:35:07,328
[SPEAKER_07]: special permit granting authority rather than the city council.

934
01:35:09,089 --> 01:35:14,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may list out like these things and then they'll have to say, yes, we agree.

935
01:35:14,492 --> 01:35:14,973
[SPEAKER_07]: We agree.

936
01:35:15,033 --> 01:35:15,453
[SPEAKER_07]: We agree.

937
01:35:15,493 --> 01:35:16,894
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we don't agree on that one.

938
01:35:18,675 --> 01:35:19,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they'll agree on everything.

939
01:35:20,016 --> 01:35:22,677
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know until you ask.

940
01:35:28,441 --> 01:35:31,663
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be like making a motion to delete

941
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:39,944
[SPEAKER_12]: The existing table and replace with the proposed table is that we would recommend that they.

942
01:35:39,964 --> 01:35:49,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Delete the recommend the existing table and replace it with the recommended table from the CD board that would be the easiest.

943
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:07,361
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm going to.

944
01:36:07,381 --> 01:36:09,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to get more vehicle related uses table.

945
01:36:11,164 --> 01:36:11,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Is what we saw.

946
01:36:11,885 --> 01:36:11,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And.

947
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:22,474
[SPEAKER_12]: The recommendation would be all to add also to replace the miscellaneous commercial uses table.

948
01:36:22,494 --> 01:36:27,858
[SPEAKER_12]: Wholesale transportation and industrial uses table.

949
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And accessory uses table.

950
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:49,933
[SPEAKER_05]: As presented in this staff memo.

951
01:36:53,076 --> 01:36:54,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Dated in the wee hours of this morning.

952
01:37:00,544 --> 01:37:01,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Your hard work and planning staff.

953
01:37:39,088 --> 01:37:40,109
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the motions.

954
01:37:41,831 --> 01:37:50,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to try this again potential motion to recommend approval of the zoning ordinance amendments to City Council.

955
01:37:51,841 --> 01:37:52,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I so move.

956
01:37:55,997 --> 01:38:00,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to read the motions just for public record.

957
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:18,988
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to the definitions with the following conditions, in addition to the definitions included in the paper, to also include the marijuana and signed definitions from the former zoning ordinances in section 12.0, recommend that SBGA for the adjusted C2 uses be the CDB,

958
01:38:20,378 --> 01:38:28,600
[SPEAKER_03]: For item number five, delegate to the PDS to update the language reflecting what was discussed, included in the recommendation to the city council.

959
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:37,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommend that city council delete the existing tables and replace with the recommended table from the CDB as presented in the PDS staff meeting.

960
01:38:41,183 --> 01:38:41,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion.

961
01:38:44,784 --> 01:38:45,804
[SPEAKER_05]: For real this time.

962
01:38:48,765 --> 01:38:49,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Second motion.

963
01:38:50,902 --> 01:38:51,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Second second.

964
01:38:52,003 --> 01:38:57,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright roll call vice chair Emily had a minute.

965
01:38:58,786 --> 01:39:00,487
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to abstain from this unfortunately.

966
01:39:00,507 --> 01:39:03,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And.

967
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:07,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, were you at Peter?

968
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:09,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you read this or I?

969
01:39:09,752 --> 01:39:12,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I also need to abstain from this one, OK?

970
01:39:12,073 --> 01:39:16,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Fishman.

971
01:39:18,016 --> 01:39:18,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

972
01:39:19,677 --> 01:39:20,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Pam Marianski.

973
01:39:22,197 --> 01:39:24,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Sally Kiki.

974
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:27,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and myself, Jackie person.

975
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:34,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that is.

976
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:39,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Unanimously accepted for recommendations for the city council.

977
01:39:41,502 --> 01:39:44,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Daniel and Alicia and Amanda.

978
01:39:46,483 --> 01:39:46,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

979
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:52,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Next item, board elections.

980
01:39:54,981 --> 01:40:03,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is continued from 8 to 23, where we have re-established a chair, myself, as well as Emily Hederman is now the vice chair.

981
01:40:04,307 --> 01:40:11,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still have a clerk position open and a community preservation committee representative open.

982
01:40:11,312 --> 01:40:17,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were going to wait until we had full members to entertain those as of right now.

983
01:40:19,042 --> 01:40:23,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Ari Fishman is in is sort of in the.

984
01:40:23,725 --> 01:40:27,607
[SPEAKER_03]: CPA role, are you currently in that and you're.

985
01:40:28,227 --> 01:40:32,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking to probably, you're just holding it over until someone else is able to take it.

986
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:34,970
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those 2 positions are open.

987
01:40:35,971 --> 01:40:39,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda, can you give a little bit of background on both positions for the new board members?

988
01:40:41,465 --> 01:40:45,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so clerk position, I think we talked about this.

989
01:40:46,406 --> 01:40:49,547
[SPEAKER_00]: With a couple of members previously, so for those that are new.

990
01:40:50,187 --> 01:40:56,388
[SPEAKER_00]: The clerk would be responsible for reading and reviewing the minutes prior to the meeting.

991
01:40:56,869 --> 01:41:03,610
[SPEAKER_00]: They would not be responsible for generating the minutes that falls to us and in particular Clem are wonderful.

992
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:06,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Right hand person.

993
01:41:07,611 --> 01:41:09,051
[SPEAKER_00]: generating so many of these.

994
01:41:11,032 --> 01:41:17,253
[SPEAKER_00]: So reading and reviewing the minutes just to make sure, you know, for clarity and accuracy.

995
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:32,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a kind of new role, which we had sort of started talking about with the board would be, as you saw tonight, I was doing a little bit of note taking on, you know, as as board members were delivering over potential conditions and things for items.

996
01:41:32,997 --> 01:41:35,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it could be a best practice to

997
01:41:37,019 --> 01:41:42,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from staff, city staff doing some of that to have a clerk.

998
01:41:42,949 --> 01:41:50,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Be keeping notes on potential conditions for projects or approvals as well.

999
01:41:51,068 --> 01:41:57,473
[SPEAKER_00]: As sort of a check, you know, it's better to have 2 people on it than 1, I think, and to make sure that everything is covered.

1000
01:41:57,554 --> 01:42:01,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, that the framing may be for certain condition language.

1001
01:42:02,818 --> 01:42:06,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Is accurate reflects where the board was coming from.

1002
01:42:09,063 --> 01:42:11,365
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's the clerk position in a nutshell.

1003
01:42:13,786 --> 01:42:21,331
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, the community preservation committee representative would be responsible for.

1004
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:27,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Attending CPA community preservation act meetings, which happen roughly once a month.

1005
01:42:27,955 --> 01:42:33,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's the 1st, Tuesday of every month with some exceptions in the summer.

1006
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:36,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they meet a little less frequently at this time of year.

1007
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:44,271
[SPEAKER_12]: And during during funding round deliberations and voting there.

1008
01:42:44,931 --> 01:42:50,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Might be an extra meeting or 2, depending on the volume of applications so that.

1009
01:42:50,952 --> 01:42:58,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Using for the presentations and split between 2 meetings, so that's not so long and.

1010
01:43:00,714 --> 01:43:02,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Can digest it better and then.

1011
01:43:02,754 --> 01:43:07,735
[SPEAKER_12]: A meeting to vote, it's very, it's very, um.

1012
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:17,752
[SPEAKER_12]: important position, you have a lot of impact on what projects get funded with the CPA funds.

1013
01:43:21,035 --> 01:43:23,597
[SPEAKER_12]: The fund committee right now, they currently are still meeting remote.

1014
01:43:24,337 --> 01:43:25,238
[SPEAKER_12]: That could change.

1015
01:43:28,561 --> 01:43:31,563
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be a decision of the committee as well.

1016
01:43:33,024 --> 01:43:37,906
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say, I don't have the exact number, but I want to say the amount of funding that this committee.

1017
01:43:37,926 --> 01:43:46,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is responsible for allocating or making recommendations to allocate is something close to 2Million dollars.

1018
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:59,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's, it's gone to some very important and incredible projects, um, both from the city, but also, um, other entities beyond the city and organizations can apply for funds.

1019
01:44:00,296 --> 01:44:13,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's been some really cool restorative work for the Royal house and slave quarters, for example, um, a lot of funding going towards car park renovation, um, for the pickleball courts, which is a really, um.

1020
01:44:14,686 --> 01:44:17,708
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really robust community that's very excited about that.

1021
01:44:18,369 --> 01:44:20,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so just to kind of.

1022
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:27,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle a couple of projects for you all to get a sense of the kinds of things that are discussed by the committee.

1023
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:37,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, as housing, a lot of the funding goes towards affordable housing as well.

1024
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:43,980
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making me feel bad that I'm nervous about committing to it.

1025
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:48,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some personal stuff that I'm expecting this year.

1026
01:44:48,881 --> 01:44:56,363
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that I'm concerned about committing to two committees and being able to give them the effort that they deserve.

1027
01:44:57,390 --> 01:45:13,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if no one is in a better personal situation and no one can do it, then I can, but it, I did want to make sure that we have the opportunity to have someone with enough capacity to give it its due.

1028
01:45:15,842 --> 01:45:17,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope you don't think we're trying to guilt you.

1029
01:45:19,945 --> 01:45:21,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's partially your job.

1030
01:45:21,686 --> 01:45:23,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in no way mad about it.

1031
01:45:31,938 --> 01:45:37,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I, unfortunately, don't think I can commit to another night a week, but I would like to throw my hat for.

1032
01:45:42,307 --> 01:45:43,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Peter.

1033
01:45:49,092 --> 01:45:54,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anyone else that would want to throw their head in for Clark, or even CPA representative.

1034
01:45:58,534 --> 01:46:02,137
[SPEAKER_13]: I may have asked this last time, but is there any way the representative role could be rotating?

1035
01:46:04,078 --> 01:46:07,341
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little challenging because there's a funding round.

1036
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:20,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for 1 person to be at 1 meeting at the beginning of the funding round, and then for a new person to be evaluating those same projects later in the round, it might be tough.

1037
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:27,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for continuity's sake, it makes sense to have 1 person, but something that could be

1038
01:46:28,337 --> 01:46:38,243
[SPEAKER_00]: The case, which wasn't hasn't been done previously is, you know, instead of having someone for, like, their full CD board term commit to the.

1039
01:46:38,784 --> 01:46:42,166
[SPEAKER_00]: To being the representative, you could rotate someone in every year.

1040
01:46:57,367 --> 01:46:58,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I think you're muted.

1041
01:46:59,349 --> 01:47:03,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what if we can maybe do that?

1042
01:47:03,812 --> 01:47:05,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I can keep it for now.

1043
01:47:06,034 --> 01:47:15,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I start reaching capacity and I'm not able to continue it, could there be some flexibility about passing it on?

1044
01:47:16,943 --> 01:47:21,226
[SPEAKER_06]: With kind of doing my best to make a commitment for a full funding cycle.

1045
01:47:24,529 --> 01:47:25,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't see why not.

1046
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:32,844
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it'd be great to make it through a funding cycle, because that's really where the votes are important.

1047
01:47:33,585 --> 01:47:45,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of it, there's a lot of dead time where it's, let's approve the application, let's go over what our goals are and update the CPA plan.

1048
01:47:46,255 --> 01:47:55,603
[SPEAKER_12]: But the one thing I hesitate about making it just one person or one year terms is that we're trying to make sure that

1049
01:47:57,368 --> 01:48:00,852
[SPEAKER_12]: The, the terms are staggered, so it's not like.

1050
01:48:01,833 --> 01:48:11,604
[SPEAKER_12]: So many people turning off, like, the situation that we got with this board where so many people turned off at once, because the staggering got messed up somehow.

1051
01:48:12,805 --> 01:48:16,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's good to have some continuity and.

1052
01:48:18,285 --> 01:48:22,127
[SPEAKER_12]: some experienced folks and new folks coming in.

1053
01:48:22,168 --> 01:48:25,169
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's the institutional knowledge still.

1054
01:48:25,870 --> 01:48:27,391
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a very strong chair right now.

1055
01:48:27,571 --> 01:48:31,593
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's very, it's not a lot of work for any of the members.

1056
01:48:31,613 --> 01:48:39,759
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very, there's a full-time staff person in the chair and it really can be just a show up and vote role.

1057
01:48:40,759 --> 01:48:42,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, it's not, it's not a lot of work.

1058
01:48:45,002 --> 01:48:46,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll do it.

1059
01:48:48,249 --> 01:48:55,131
[SPEAKER_13]: And are even if continuity is the goal, like, you know, anything can happen to any of us at any point, whether it's this board or others.

1060
01:48:55,251 --> 01:48:57,512
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, the person always comes first.

1061
01:48:58,452 --> 01:48:59,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, absolutely.

1062
01:48:59,212 --> 01:49:08,635
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't think there's room in our ordinance in the community preservation ordinance that we have that says three year terms or else.

1063
01:49:09,775 --> 01:49:10,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1064
01:49:10,175 --> 01:49:12,916
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, it will will strive for that.

1065
01:49:13,296 --> 01:49:13,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1066
01:49:14,317 --> 01:49:14,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1067
01:49:16,714 --> 01:49:20,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it and you know, it's an important committee.

1068
01:49:20,496 --> 01:49:25,318
[SPEAKER_07]: They control so much money.

1069
01:49:25,338 --> 01:49:27,119
[SPEAKER_12]: So much.

1070
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:32,902
[SPEAKER_12]: If the CPC doesn't recommend approval, it doesn't make it to city council at all.

1071
01:49:33,922 --> 01:49:37,204
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't see what you don't recommend.

1072
01:49:37,824 --> 01:49:41,466
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not like we're going to ignore, like they can vote.

1073
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:45,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to fund something that you wanted funded.

1074
01:49:46,443 --> 01:49:50,306
[SPEAKER_12]: But they can't approve to fund something that you did not want to fund.

1075
01:49:51,446 --> 01:49:53,148
[SPEAKER_12]: So, there is some teeth there.

1076
01:49:58,492 --> 01:50:05,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm going to start with a motion to elect Peter cows as the clerk of the metric community development board.

1077
01:50:06,017 --> 01:50:06,438
[SPEAKER_03]: 2nd.

1078
01:50:08,366 --> 01:50:12,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm sorry, could someone make the motion besides Jackie?

1079
01:50:13,288 --> 01:50:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll make a motion.

1080
01:50:14,628 --> 01:50:16,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry and that I apologize.

1081
01:50:16,549 --> 01:50:17,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I misspoke.

1082
01:50:17,809 --> 01:50:18,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm open.

1083
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:19,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for a motion.

1084
01:50:20,670 --> 01:50:26,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and 1 thing that might help be helpful, like, in some of the clerk is the person who always makes the motions.

1085
01:50:26,452 --> 01:50:28,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, when I was on the zoning board, I was the clerk.

1086
01:50:28,853 --> 01:50:32,955
[SPEAKER_12]: I made the motions I made them all never like, who wants to make a motion?

1087
01:50:32,975 --> 01:50:33,495
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like.

1088
01:50:34,187 --> 01:50:38,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Like you there, you're prepared with your motion, you're prepared with the conditions.

1089
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:38,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1090
01:50:39,411 --> 01:50:40,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Goes very efficiently.

1091
01:50:40,211 --> 01:50:41,252
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if that wanted to be.

1092
01:50:41,272 --> 01:50:45,094
[SPEAKER_12]: With the clerk person, you're not the clerk.

1093
01:50:45,114 --> 01:50:45,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1094
01:50:45,755 --> 01:50:50,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we, we, we, we, we haven't, um, we got a good idea.

1095
01:50:51,018 --> 01:50:51,539
[SPEAKER_03]: We got it.

1096
01:50:51,559 --> 01:50:52,419
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to scare.

1097
01:50:54,177 --> 01:50:58,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you should have waited till after he got all that part.

1098
01:50:59,922 --> 01:51:06,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Amanda, what you were saying is someone else to make a motion or okay.

1099
01:51:07,608 --> 01:51:13,713
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make a motion to elect Peter Calvis as clerk of the Medford Community Development Board.

1100
01:51:15,455 --> 01:51:16,596
[SPEAKER_03]: A 2nd motion.

1101
01:51:17,256 --> 01:51:18,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Sally, I second.

1102
01:51:21,399 --> 01:51:23,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call, Vice Chair Emily Hederman.

1103
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:27,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I. It accounts for himself.

1104
01:51:28,353 --> 01:51:30,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I. Are you fishman.

1105
01:51:31,776 --> 01:51:36,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I. And marianne ski I. Sally key key.

01:51:44,307 --> 01:51:51,593
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself jackie mcpherson I. Is there a motion to make our fishman.

1108
01:51:52,575 --> 01:51:55,117
[SPEAKER_03]: The community preservation committee representative.

1109
01:51:55,757 --> 01:52:00,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they have only been sitting in it as a holdover, but now it's official.

1110
01:52:00,861 --> 01:52:04,904
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved 2nd.

1111
01:52:07,706 --> 01:52:10,047
[SPEAKER_03]: A roll call vice chair, Emily had a man.

1112
01:52:10,728 --> 01:52:19,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I. Peter cows I. Fishman for your for themselves.

1113
01:52:24,385 --> 01:52:24,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1114
01:52:25,526 --> 01:52:26,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Pam Mariansky.

1115
01:52:28,509 --> 01:52:28,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1116
01:52:29,731 --> 01:52:30,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Sally Akiki.

1117
01:52:32,994 --> 01:52:33,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1118
01:52:35,397 --> 01:52:37,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Chirag Bharachara.

1119
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:38,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

1120
01:52:39,341 --> 01:52:41,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1121
01:52:42,184 --> 01:52:42,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an aye.

1122
01:52:44,287 --> 01:52:45,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you both.

1123
01:52:48,653 --> 01:52:53,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now our next item is approval of minutes from 7523 and 719 23.

1124
01:52:53,735 --> 01:52:55,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we make a motion, I want to note to Amanda.

1125
01:52:55,976 --> 01:52:58,898
[SPEAKER_03]: On 719 23, I believe it's item 7 for board elections.

1126
01:52:58,918 --> 01:53:01,319
[SPEAKER_03]: The very last item was not completed.

1127
01:53:20,493 --> 01:53:21,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Very sorry about that.

1128
01:53:22,314 --> 01:53:24,596
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have, let me see.

1129
01:53:29,259 --> 01:53:30,700
[SPEAKER_00]: For item seven, you said?

1130
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:32,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for board elections.

1131
01:53:33,542 --> 01:53:34,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Board elections.

1132
01:53:34,723 --> 01:53:37,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shucks.

1133
01:53:37,304 --> 01:53:42,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Example where the clerk would have read it, made that edit, and then it would have gotten sent around.

1134
01:53:46,444 --> 01:53:50,045
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's so close to being finished because there were no votes.

1135
01:53:50,625 --> 01:54:01,649
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think, um, if there were no other major concerns with those minutes, um, there could be a motion to, you know, for staff to complete the phrasing.

1136
01:54:02,190 --> 01:54:05,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then to, and then to accept with that edit.

1137
01:54:09,558 --> 01:54:21,842
[SPEAKER_03]: A motion to approve 7523, the minutes of 7523, and then 719.23 with the edits as the staff finishes them, I mean edits them.

1138
01:54:23,163 --> 01:54:23,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

1139
01:54:27,444 --> 01:54:28,224
[SPEAKER_05]: A second motion?

1140
01:54:28,625 --> 01:54:29,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1141
01:54:31,506 --> 01:54:33,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I cede the second to the other person who spoke.

1142
01:54:34,207 --> 01:54:34,427
Okay.

1143
01:54:36,204 --> 01:54:37,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice chair, I sniped it for me Ari.

1144
01:54:39,466 --> 01:54:39,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1145
01:54:41,608 --> 01:54:43,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vice chair Emily Hedeman?

1146
01:54:43,690 --> 01:54:43,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1147
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:45,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Cowles?

1148
01:54:45,991 --> 01:54:46,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1149
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Ari Fishman?

1150
01:54:48,393 --> 01:54:48,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1151
01:54:49,334 --> 01:54:50,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Pam Mariansky?

1152
01:54:51,015 --> 01:54:51,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1153
01:54:52,036 --> 01:54:52,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Sally Akiki?

1154
01:54:53,557 --> 01:54:53,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1155
01:54:54,898 --> 01:54:56,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Shirag Barachara?

1156
01:54:57,119 --> 01:54:57,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1157
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, MNI.

1158
01:55:02,307 --> 01:55:08,352
[SPEAKER_03]: The final item on the board tonight is an update from the city staff on the status of the zoning.

1159
01:55:08,952 --> 01:55:13,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm inviting Daniel Evans again to provide an update to the board on status.

1160
01:55:14,116 --> 01:55:14,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Up the.

1161
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so a lot of this has been.

1162
01:55:20,081 --> 01:55:24,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Going on in the background, it was a lot of crunching numbers.

1163
01:55:24,445 --> 01:55:27,647
[SPEAKER_12]: We worked with as for Glenn, who was the.

1164
01:55:29,267 --> 01:55:34,773
[SPEAKER_12]: consultant provided by the state for free, thankfully, as they knew we all had our hands full with this.

1165
01:55:34,793 --> 01:55:38,877
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one of the handful of rapid transit communities.

1166
01:55:38,917 --> 01:55:41,540
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the tightest time frame to comply, just a year.

1167
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:46,285
[SPEAKER_12]: It's funny how the more complicated communities get the shortest timeline.

1168
01:55:46,845 --> 01:55:48,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Some have three years.

1169
01:55:48,947 --> 01:55:49,468
[SPEAKER_12]: We get one.

1170
01:55:51,345 --> 01:56:00,788
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically it's, as I was saying before, that the state is mandating that we create the zoning districts that allow housing by right, or multifamily housing by right.

1171
01:56:00,828 --> 01:56:19,673
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's units, three units or more at a very prescribed density, which I don't know off the top of my head, but I wanted to say it was like 6,000 something, something like that, which 75% of that has to be within the half mile radius of a transit station.

1172
01:56:21,602 --> 01:56:23,383
[SPEAKER_12]: and there's a lot of parameters around that.

1173
01:56:23,784 --> 01:56:44,200
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't count on excluded land, which, so some of the stations that we're looking at, because we actually have a lot of stations that could be eligible, but when you look at the surrounding land, like the Medford Tufts station, Tufts University owns so much of that, that there really wasn't, there was not enough land within the half mile to actually put a district over there.

1174
01:56:44,641 --> 01:56:45,721
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not gonna work.

1175
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:49,945
[SPEAKER_12]: We looked at, and then the other ones are,

1176
01:56:51,003 --> 01:57:00,286
[SPEAKER_12]: basically mostly in Somerville, so it would be a very small sliver of land and it would have to be kind of parsed about.

1177
01:57:01,766 --> 01:57:11,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, we landed on the Wellington Orange Line station is really the only feasible area that we could have create this district.

1178
01:57:12,109 --> 01:57:15,310
[SPEAKER_12]: So our approach is going to be an overlay.

1179
01:57:16,030 --> 01:57:18,471
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be an overlay which

1180
01:57:20,959 --> 01:57:24,361
[SPEAKER_12]: would, it wouldn't replace the underlying zoning.

1181
01:57:24,922 --> 01:57:33,328
[SPEAKER_12]: You could still do the underlying zoning, but the overlay would create this multifamily by right.

1182
01:57:35,470 --> 01:57:43,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the limitations are that we're not allowed to require ground floor retail or require deep affordability.

1183
01:57:44,056 --> 01:57:48,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Even our existing inclusionary housing provisions that we have now actually aren't allowed.

1184
01:57:50,277 --> 01:57:54,178
[SPEAKER_12]: we have to have an economic feasibility analysis to justify them.

1185
01:57:54,839 --> 01:58:00,601
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's currently being done right now, thankfully also for free by MAPC.

1186
01:58:00,621 --> 01:58:11,365
[SPEAKER_12]: And they are pretty certain that they will be fine, that we'll be able to allow our greater percentages than is allowed.

1187
01:58:11,385 --> 01:58:15,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the state, first they said, you can't have inclusionary zoning at all.

1188
01:58:15,947 --> 01:58:19,608
[SPEAKER_12]: And everyone threw a fit, including myself, like, what are you talking about?

1189
01:58:20,662 --> 01:58:41,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's viewed as some of the suburbs will use that as a barrier to creating affordable housing or multifamily housing by creating these such strict requirements that makes building just not feasible at all.

1190
01:58:42,869 --> 01:58:45,170
[SPEAKER_12]: They wanted to make sure that communities weren't

1191
01:58:45,965 --> 01:58:50,748
[SPEAKER_12]: including these inclusionary zoning ordinances or bylaws, like in bad faith.

1192
01:58:51,488 --> 01:58:58,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to prove that what we already have won't hurt development or slow it down.

1193
01:58:59,693 --> 01:59:06,397
[SPEAKER_12]: And while we're having them do this EFA, we wanted them to look at, well, we kind of wanted to make changes to it anyways.

1194
01:59:07,538 --> 01:59:11,880
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanted to have like, you know, different like tiers of affordability.

1195
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:12,901
[SPEAKER_12]: What if some of them were

1196
01:59:13,834 --> 01:59:18,417
[SPEAKER_12]: 60% area median income, some at 80, some at 100, rather than all at 80.

1197
01:59:19,618 --> 01:59:22,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Could that be something that we could do that could get approved?

1198
01:59:23,221 --> 01:59:25,923
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're also going to look at one or two alternatives.

1199
01:59:27,524 --> 01:59:31,566
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're hoping to have them finalize that.

1200
01:59:31,586 --> 01:59:33,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was going to be early fall.

1201
01:59:35,929 --> 01:59:39,852
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're operating under the assumption that it'll be allowed.

1202
01:59:41,427 --> 01:59:45,948
[SPEAKER_12]: But we won't know for sure until maybe a month or two.

1203
01:59:47,168 --> 01:59:51,909
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're going to hold a public input hearing on the 13th of September.

1204
01:59:51,929 --> 01:59:55,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And be great.

1205
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:57,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe we're going to do it on Zoom.

1206
02:00:00,291 --> 02:00:05,792
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to be getting a press release out shortly and spreading the word about that.

1207
02:00:07,052 --> 02:00:09,813
[SPEAKER_12]: And basically, the input that we're going to be seeking

1208
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:20,913
[SPEAKER_12]: is what kind of density bonuses that we could put into our zoning to incentivize some of our other goals.

1209
02:00:22,654 --> 02:00:36,998
[SPEAKER_12]: The MBTA zoning, the way it was is basically just production, production, production, without paying attention to some of the other goals, like some of our climate resiliency goals, affordability goals,

1210
02:00:38,315 --> 02:00:48,143
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, walkable, mixed use, neighborhood kind of goals that we have outlined in our comp plan that we can't require.

1211
02:00:48,743 --> 02:00:51,906
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll have our

1212
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:57,796
[SPEAKER_12]: Our overlay, which will allow by right this required density.

1213
02:00:58,536 --> 02:01:00,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is actually not that dense.

1214
02:01:00,976 --> 02:01:03,117
[SPEAKER_12]: We already do allow quite a bit of density.

1215
02:01:03,137 --> 02:01:04,657
[SPEAKER_12]: So, in some areas.

1216
02:01:05,397 --> 02:01:08,298
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll actually be down zoning, which seems odd.

1217
02:01:09,238 --> 02:01:11,058
[SPEAKER_12]: So, basically, it's okay.

1218
02:01:11,098 --> 02:01:13,739
[SPEAKER_12]: You're allowed to put a 4 story building by right.

1219
02:01:14,619 --> 02:01:20,800
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you want 6, then you need to provide ground floor retail or.

1220
02:01:23,017 --> 02:01:39,967
[SPEAKER_12]: deeper affordability, things like that, or a parking reduction if you provide this other provision that we would want to further some of our other goals.

1221
02:01:40,007 --> 02:01:41,908
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have some staff looking at that.

1222
02:01:41,949 --> 02:01:49,033
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a climate planner who is doing some research on incorporating

1223
02:01:50,375 --> 02:01:56,640
[SPEAKER_12]: those sorts of things into zoning anyways to give them teeth.

1224
02:01:56,700 --> 02:02:05,647
[SPEAKER_12]: We're hoping to use some of that and bring them as incentives and density bonuses.

1225
02:02:07,108 --> 02:02:14,494
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be looking for input from the public and from you all, what you think would be appropriate.

1226
02:02:17,116 --> 02:02:19,218
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do X, what is a proportionate,

1227
02:02:19,794 --> 02:02:20,714
[SPEAKER_12]: bonus from that.

1228
02:02:20,734 --> 02:02:23,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be doing a lot of research for that.

1229
02:02:23,355 --> 02:02:31,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And so then after the public input meeting, we'll actually then start the public hearings to men's zoning.

1230
02:02:31,738 --> 02:02:37,901
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first community development board meeting would be scheduled for October 18th.

1231
02:02:40,101 --> 02:02:45,743
[SPEAKER_12]: We left, we kept room in our timeline to allow for two CD board meetings if you need it.

1232
02:02:45,763 --> 02:02:45,823
[SPEAKER_12]: And

1233
02:02:47,935 --> 02:02:49,977
[SPEAKER_12]: to city council meetings if they need it.

1234
02:02:49,997 --> 02:03:01,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, are you recommending that if board members are available for the public meeting that it would help?

1235
02:03:02,828 --> 02:03:15,599
[SPEAKER_07]: By viewing that, they could both get a preview of everything that they're going to hear at the CD board meeting in less technical terms, and then they could hear directly any resident questions and concerns.

1236
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:27,674
[SPEAKER_07]: And that might help with only needing to have one CD board meeting, because it might be the first public hearing, but the board members would hear it at the public meeting.

1237
02:03:28,334 --> 02:03:41,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And if members did that, I would just recommend that board members reserve their comments for in private or at the public hearing in order to avoid

1238
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:51,949
[SPEAKER_07]: open meeting law violation right if like four of you showed up at that meeting, and one of you made a comment that's technically an open meeting law violation.

1239
02:03:53,137 --> 02:04:04,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're discussing a matter that is expected to be in front of you, right, without it being a publicly posted meeting that you would be doing that.

1240
02:04:05,446 --> 02:04:14,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas if any of you went to that meeting and had concerns or questions, we would really want you to come talk to us about them.

1241
02:04:14,612 --> 02:04:17,013
[SPEAKER_07]: in advance of waiting for this public hearing.

1242
02:04:17,934 --> 02:04:35,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going to say that if at any point, this is probably just a general good comment, there's something that's coming in front of you and you've looked at it or you have information and you're like, oh, I don't like this or I'm really concerned about this or I'm super confused about it.

1243
02:04:36,641 --> 02:04:42,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Reaching out to Amanda or myself or Danielle, more Danielle because Amanda is transitioning off this board,

1244
02:04:43,465 --> 02:04:45,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to keep saying that until it's true.

1245
02:04:48,128 --> 02:04:52,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And discussing it before the meeting, we absolutely welcome that.

1246
02:04:53,071 --> 02:04:58,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we'd love to address any real deep concerns, big concerns in advance.

1247
02:04:59,214 --> 02:05:03,056
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's like they need more trees, please just do a meeting, right?

1248
02:05:03,376 --> 02:05:05,458
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're like, why are they doing this project?

1249
02:05:06,465 --> 02:05:10,927
[SPEAKER_07]: at all, definitely reach out to us before the meeting.

1250
02:05:11,347 --> 02:05:12,567
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's with the zoning.

1251
02:05:12,707 --> 02:05:18,109
[SPEAKER_07]: When I'm saying, come to the public meeting, but don't comment, I'm not telling you you can't comment.

1252
02:05:18,209 --> 02:05:21,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying, please don't do it in the public meeting and violate open meeting law.

1253
02:05:24,291 --> 02:05:34,595
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also want to give a shout out to Clem, who's been also very helpful in picking up where Ezra's contract

1254
02:05:36,688 --> 02:05:44,914
[SPEAKER_12]: ended and helping us to verify that we meet all the density targets parcel by parcel.

1255
02:05:49,018 --> 02:05:49,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1256
02:05:55,382 --> 02:06:00,907
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you guys have any ideas or thoughts, please reach out to me at any time.

1257
02:06:00,927 --> 02:06:06,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we haven't wanted this to be

1258
02:06:07,536 --> 02:06:14,142
[SPEAKER_12]: this this process that was like happening like behind closed doors, but they're just there hasn't been anything really to present yet.

1259
02:06:14,722 --> 02:06:17,825
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of communities have kind of been in the same boat.

1260
02:06:17,885 --> 02:06:23,990
[SPEAKER_12]: They're like, well, we want to have public input, but we need to present them with something because a lot of it is.

1261
02:06:25,191 --> 02:06:35,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Not up for negotiation, it's mandated and very prescriptive and we're taking the approach of

1262
02:06:36,467 --> 02:06:50,933
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, making it work for Medford because, you know, we have a lot of other goals in addition to housing with much more robust affordability goals than the 3A even allows.

1263
02:06:51,573 --> 02:06:54,374
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel like we have been doing a really good job of producing housing.

1264
02:06:56,035 --> 02:07:04,379
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't want that housing underwater if we don't encourage things like electrification buildings,

1265
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:14,453
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're trying to kind of, I'm getting tired.

1266
02:07:16,474 --> 02:07:17,614
[SPEAKER_12]: My brain is stopping to work.

1267
02:07:21,216 --> 02:07:25,918
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just taking a very creative approach to do this.

1268
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:32,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Danielle.

1269
02:07:35,988 --> 02:07:40,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions before we go to the next item?

1270
02:07:40,469 --> 02:07:46,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I sort of was premature and saying that the previous that that item Danielle's item was the final 1.

1271
02:07:46,871 --> 02:07:50,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

1272
02:07:51,233 --> 02:07:51,893
[SPEAKER_06]: No, go right ahead.

1273
02:07:53,457 --> 02:08:04,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Wanted to thank Danielle planning staff for all their hard work on figuring out what's going on and how we can best do it and bringing that creativity.

1274
02:08:04,205 --> 02:08:05,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you all.

1275
02:08:05,225 --> 02:08:08,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's frustrating, but it's really great.

1276
02:08:13,454 --> 02:08:16,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that would be interesting with the MBTA zoning.

1277
02:08:16,975 --> 02:08:26,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, where I work, I work hand in hand with Chris Clutchman, who's behind the MBTA zoning law and how she sort of defines it and things like that.

1278
02:08:26,599 --> 02:08:35,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So when those questions come up for Grant Steer or somebody that's in my actual portfolio, I refer to Chris, like, Chris, you got this one?

1279
02:08:35,102 --> 02:08:36,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's now it's like, okay, now I'm in Medford.

1280
02:08:36,843 --> 02:08:37,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like.

1281
02:08:39,484 --> 02:08:49,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's like, I have to look at it as, you know, we have all these cities and towns coming to us to try to explain, have them explain it in the context of their communities.

1282
02:08:49,387 --> 02:08:52,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I have to try to figure out in the context of my own community.

1283
02:08:52,588 --> 02:08:55,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So very interesting, but I'm looking forward to it.

1284
02:08:56,029 --> 02:09:04,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know on the private consulting side, we're trying to, still trying to figure out how we, how we have to work through those kinds of projects as well.

1285
02:09:04,732 --> 02:09:05,973
[SPEAKER_11]: So good job.

1286
02:09:05,993 --> 02:09:06,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1287
02:09:08,848 --> 02:09:14,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, especially when you, especially with some of the communities as you said, it has to be community specific.

1288
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:20,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, they come in and they say, well, you know, you're taking away our ability to do like, like you said, ground floor retail.

1289
02:09:20,411 --> 02:09:21,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, we need this commercial base.

1290
02:09:21,992 --> 02:09:23,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why is it with this law?

1291
02:09:23,572 --> 02:09:25,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys, you did this, you did this.

1292
02:09:25,493 --> 02:09:27,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm sorry, I didn't do it.

1293
02:09:28,214 --> 02:09:32,595
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, so now I'll be that same person screaming back at the state, like, why'd you do this?

1294
02:09:38,461 --> 02:09:41,604
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so again, thank you Danielle.

1295
02:09:42,285 --> 02:09:44,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So, number 8 miscellaneous and other updates from the city.

1296
02:09:47,911 --> 02:09:49,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can jump in here.

1297
02:09:49,994 --> 02:09:55,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought I'd give a quick precursor to our next meeting, which is scheduled for September 6th.

1298
02:09:56,377 --> 02:10:04,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we are expecting to see a site plan review for a proposal at 421 high street with.

1299
02:10:04,963 --> 02:10:07,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, uh, residential units.

1300
02:10:10,247 --> 02:10:13,669
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will see the 1st.

1301
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:17,732
[SPEAKER_00]: PDD public hearing for walk in court.

1302
02:10:20,503 --> 02:10:23,785
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two upcoming items that are for sure.

1303
02:10:23,985 --> 02:10:36,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we will possibly also see the continued Bank of America special permit conversation that's for the project proposed in the Obeikman's Plaza.

1304
02:10:36,993 --> 02:10:43,116
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the main items.

1305
02:10:43,296 --> 02:10:43,837
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep it short.

1306
02:10:46,625 --> 02:10:47,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Amanda.

1307
02:10:48,048 --> 02:10:51,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I should mention something that's not on the agenda just as an FYI.

1308
02:10:53,741 --> 02:10:54,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop me if I.

1309
02:10:56,082 --> 02:11:02,666
[SPEAKER_07]: if you guys mentioned this while I was thinking about something else, Combined Properties, the hearing where they withdrew.

1310
02:11:02,686 --> 02:11:10,972
[SPEAKER_07]: They have actually submitted a draft life science park overlay proposal.

1311
02:11:11,512 --> 02:11:14,974
[SPEAKER_07]: They sent it to the City Council President and to the Mayor.

1312
02:11:15,775 --> 02:11:16,916
[SPEAKER_07]: They CC'd me.

1313
02:11:17,416 --> 02:11:20,318
[SPEAKER_07]: The City Council President and the Mayor have both said to me,

1314
02:11:21,178 --> 02:11:29,543
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we do, and so I have reached out to them to discuss it with them, but I just thought you all would want to know what they were thinking and.

1315
02:11:30,922 --> 02:11:36,804
[SPEAKER_07]: If I might, if you'll forgive me to do this at this moment, Clem, can you ask me about that too?

1316
02:11:36,904 --> 02:11:43,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a great exercise would be to compare this to the PDD they submitted, unless Danielle's already done it.

1317
02:11:44,666 --> 02:11:45,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I just haven't.

1318
02:11:45,906 --> 02:11:51,927
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be awesome to have you just tell me what's different between this and what they submitted before.

1319
02:11:51,947 --> 02:11:52,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, for sure.

1320
02:11:54,898 --> 02:11:58,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I didn't look at it too closely because I was like what is this.

1321
02:11:58,905 --> 02:12:08,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so they have told me I did reach out to them I said is this an official submission to the city council, and they said no it's a it's a draft for discussion.

1322
02:12:10,283 --> 02:12:14,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted you all to know they're still interested in the project, they're still talking about it.

1323
02:12:14,965 --> 02:12:31,793
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody, once we do know what's different from this and what the PDD that you saw, I would also welcome to hear like individually because this is not an agenda item for tonight, but if people have thoughts on that project that you had wished you had gotten to express at that meeting,

1324
02:12:32,633 --> 02:12:34,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle and I would like to hear them.

1325
02:12:34,974 --> 02:12:43,478
[SPEAKER_07]: You can reach out to us privately so that we can incorporate any thoughts into a conversation with combined properties on this.

1326
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:51,042
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, the first thing that jumped out to me was the was a sentence in there that the landscaping requirements wouldn't apply.

1327
02:12:51,062 --> 02:12:52,683
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would just.

1328
02:12:53,643 --> 02:12:54,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're not getting that.

1329
02:12:54,844 --> 02:12:57,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was just like I just closed my laptop.

1330
02:12:58,145 --> 02:12:58,786
[SPEAKER_12]: What is this?

1331
02:13:02,698 --> 02:13:18,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry to put in guys, I just had to thought that so city council had a meeting last night and they heard 243 mystic as well as 100 Winchester.

1332
02:13:18,021 --> 02:13:21,082
[SPEAKER_00]: 243 got referred back to CD board as part of our process.

1333
02:13:21,122 --> 02:13:27,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys will see that in the near future and 100 Winchester did get adopted the zoning.

1334
02:13:28,203 --> 02:13:28,403
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

1335
02:13:29,083 --> 02:13:31,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, first phase of that project done.

1336
02:13:32,364 --> 02:13:40,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much thanks to you all and we will likely see a special permit application from them in the future.

1337
02:13:42,026 --> 02:13:44,966
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, some fun news.

1338
02:13:45,547 --> 02:13:47,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1339
02:13:49,347 --> 02:13:52,948
[SPEAKER_07]: And just because you all will be interested, the 40, you know, the 40B was passed the

1340
02:13:58,490 --> 02:14:06,754
[SPEAKER_07]: sorry, the challenge date, the whatever that's called, passed a few days ago, the date by which somebody, the appeal date.

1341
02:14:06,794 --> 02:14:09,455
[SPEAKER_07]: The appeal date passed a few days ago with no appeals.

1342
02:14:10,335 --> 02:14:16,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were in front of Conservation Commission tonight, and they got their Conservation Commission approvals this evening.

1343
02:14:17,118 --> 02:14:22,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had some conservation, there were some old open orders of conditions that got cleared up as well for them.

1344
02:14:23,261 --> 02:14:27,564
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of the permitting for that project has now cleared.

1345
02:14:27,624 --> 02:14:34,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they can apply for their building permit, which now they can apply as of right because they went through the whole of all the variances and everything.

1346
02:14:35,649 --> 02:14:37,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So that'll be moving soon.

1347
02:14:51,079 --> 02:14:51,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

1348
02:14:55,973 --> 02:14:59,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hearing nothing else from the city, thank you all.

1349
02:14:59,875 --> 02:15:01,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.

1350
02:15:02,836 --> 02:15:03,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1351
02:15:05,378 --> 02:15:05,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded.

1352
02:15:08,659 --> 02:15:09,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

02:15:20,526 --> 02:15:20,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1361
02:15:21,326 --> 02:15:22,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Sally Akiki?

1362
02:15:23,007 --> 02:15:23,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1363
02:15:24,279 --> 02:15:29,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to try one more time because I've been remiss in pronouncing your name correctly, Sharad.

1364
02:15:30,501 --> 02:15:32,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharad Bajracharya.

1365
02:15:32,822 --> 02:15:33,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get it right?

1366
02:15:33,382 --> 02:15:34,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Bajracharya.

1367
02:15:36,043 --> 02:15:36,963
