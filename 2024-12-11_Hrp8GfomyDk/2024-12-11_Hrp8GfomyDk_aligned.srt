1
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,771
2, test 1, 2.

2
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:56,651
Justin.

3
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:58,432
Justin.

4
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,594
Councillor Singh.

5
00:05:01,954 --> 00:05:13,081
Councillor Singh, come on.

6
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:18,885
Is it in a mode where everybody can just turn on their own, or do I need to approve it?

7
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:21,406
Yeah.

8
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:22,287
OK.

9
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:23,148
Apparently not.

10
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:30,110
I'm trying to figure out how to, okay, wait, what do I need to press before we start the meeting too?

11
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:33,713
What?

12
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:35,594
No, no.

13
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:36,915
Okay.

14
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:41,998
Can you move it so that I can see if it's green?

15
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,479
All right, and.

16
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:51,403
All right, now it's on.

17
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,812
pull up the agenda real quick.

18
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:19,014
Thank you.

19
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:30,182
All right, I think we can get started.

20
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:37,808
Welcome to the meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

21
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:41,731
I don't believe we need to take a roll call for attendance because nobody is on.

22
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,610
Zoom right now.

23
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:55,195
The first paper that we will be considering tonight is 23055, offered by Councilor Sang, a resolution to consider the welcoming city ordinance.

24
00:06:56,575 --> 00:07:09,660
This was actually, this was an ordinance that was actually offered in one of the predecessor committees last year by my colleague, essentially,

25
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:22,205
It is an ordinance that officially codifies a policy of non-cooperation with federal authorities, specifically ICE on non-criminal matters.

26
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:35,890
Prior to this, I requested feedback from both the school committee, because it does contain some provisions relevant to the Medford public school system, as well as Chief Buckley.

27
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,891
I did hear some

28
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:42,306
Some pieces of feedback from members of the school committee.

29
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:58,333
So there were some concerns with the bargaining sessions, the bargaining sections with the police, as well as the potential enforceability within the Medford public school system.

30
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:06,377
But essentially, most members of the school committee did approve the current draft that

31
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:08,624
as it was written.

32
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:29,231
There is one issue with the ordinance, which is that the section numbers I outlined in this draft, and I'm just gonna share my screen really quickly to show everybody, were actually conflict with the CCOPS ordinance that will be considered tomorrow.

33
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,432
So I have here a,

34
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:41,105
version of it where I changed the section titles to fit into the municipal code a little bit better.

35
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:48,354
But other than that, I don't really see too many issues with it.

36
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:48,915
I will

37
00:08:49,929 --> 00:09:04,945
go ahead and let Councilor Sang speak on this, then my colleagues, if they would like to add anything, and then we can move on to a public comment period, if folks have anything to offer on it.

38
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,428
Councilor Sang, I'm going to turn your microphone on.

39
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:10,070
Thank you.

40
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:15,706
Um, this is an ordinance that, um, surrounding communities have passed.

41
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:30,010
Um, and what exactly it is is it's a codification of our non-cooperation, um, uh, policy with federal authorities when it comes to, um, non-criminal immigration matters.

42
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,891
We've seen, um, in years past, um,

43
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:49,944
really difficult situations where cities are forced to upend people's human rights, people's sense of dignity, people's right to an existence in the city where they live.

44
00:09:51,325 --> 00:10:03,634
And a lot of communities at the time, feeling under attack, feeling endangered during the first Trump presidency,

45
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,883
really wanted their local governments to protect their existence and their rights.

46
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:29,196
While Medford didn't pass a welcoming city ordinance at the time, we did pass an executive order under Mayor Burke that we would not cooperate, that our policy as a city was not to cooperate with ICE on non-criminal matters.

47
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:30,217
Now,

48
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:48,785
I put this I introduced this agenda item, a few years ago, to the General City Council, because I wanted to quantify that that agreement to make sure that as we move forward into the future that our residents have faith that

49
00:10:50,215 --> 00:11:08,650
a mayor can't just take that away, and I'm not saying that this mayor will, I'm not saying that any person in particular will, but I know the fear is out there, having talked to friends who belong to the undocumented community here in Medford, which is such an integral part of our own community, that that fear is out there, that a lot of folks

50
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,454
don't know that this policy even exists in the first place.

51
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:16,877
And it's not something that they find read readily searchable.

52
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:20,861
And when they look to see the laws of our city, they don't see it as a law.

53
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:21,602
And

54
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:41,058
This is our chance as a council, I think, to pass this, to codify it, to enshrine it as law, to make sure that they have that feeling of security, that we are able to announce as a city, that we are welcoming of all of our residents, that people don't have to have fear when they interact with people at City Hall.

55
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,303
I know that this ordinance draft has been

56
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:51,576
floating around the committee for a while.

57
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:59,039
I'm very grateful to our activist community and to Chair Lemming for bringing this back, for putting so much work into it.

58
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:05,902
I know Chair Lemming really put a lot of work into making sure we had the draft for this meeting.

59
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:08,003
And I worked with him a little bit on that draft as well.

60
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:18,408
But I know the activist community, our lawyers, especially in the activist community have helped us draft the multiple successive versions of this.

61
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:22,536
Look, this I think for me is about fundamental human rights.

62
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:28,861
Um, it's about making sure that our residents feel safe and a part of our community.

63
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:36,227
I'm very happy to introduce it to the floor tonight I'm very grateful for a trail I mean for

64
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:47,960
Acting on the prior motions, I think that this committee or the previous committee passed to reach out to the police chief and to reach out to the school committee and get feedback on the language.

65
00:12:48,820 --> 00:13:02,567
I'm really excited to see what we can get done on this because it is such an emergency at this point and because the challenges we face as a country in the next four years will be real and we'll have so much to deal with.

66
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:16,332
on the municipal level, especially, and every part that we can do as early as possible to mitigate the negative impacts of the incoming presidency, I think will be very, very crucial and very, very important.

67
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:19,114
So thank you for giving me this moment.

68
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:23,156
Thank you for bringing this chair lemming to the committee.

69
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:26,438
Councilor Lazaro.

70
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:28,944
Thank you.

71
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:33,428
Thank you, Councilor Singh and Councilor Lemming for bringing this forward.

72
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:52,824
I'm very eager to work on this ordinance and I think there are a lot of situations that can make our residents in Medford nervous about things happening at the federal level.

73
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,365
even some things that are happening at the state level.

74
00:13:55,645 --> 00:14:03,527
So when there are things that we can do at the local level to ensure the safety of our residents, I think we should absolutely take those steps.

75
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:13,149
And this is a great example of how we can do that in a way that may feel small, but to many people, I think it's not a small thing.

76
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:28,832
some experience with family members who have live in different states and have had experiences where they've been trying to access medical care and have had experiences where ice has been called.

77
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,773
This isn't in Massachusetts.

78
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:35,634
This is in Texas, and it's a very real situation.

79
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:43,635
The more that we can do to ensure our residents that they are not going to be subject to

80
00:14:46,637 --> 00:15:01,707
that sort of danger when trying to access medical care, I think is really critical and our residents deserve that kind of assurance that they are safe in Medford.

81
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:06,531
So thank you and I'm excited to get working on the specifics of this ordinance.

82
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,676
Thank you and I would also like to thank the many

83
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:23,443
folks in the activist community who put pressure on the Medford City Council to get this in front of us today.

84
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:31,651
I think it's a very particularly timely ordinance, much more so than we typically see in city council.

85
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:35,134
So I'm excited to see it pass.

86
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:37,316
We'll move on to public comment.

87
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:38,678
So if you

88
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:52,306
If anybody in the room has anything they'd like to say, either in person or on Zoom, please feel free to raise your hand on Zoom or line up at the podium.

89
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:55,208
And we would love to hear you.

90
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,331
Go ahead and press the thing.

91
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:00,651
OK.

92
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:00,951
Yep.

93
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,128
Now I can.

94
00:16:03,148 --> 00:16:04,109
Name and address for the record, please.

95
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,893
Okay, my name is Jennifer Yanko and I live at 16 Monument Street.

96
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:20,662
I think this Welcoming Cities Ordinance is an opportunity for our city to show moral leadership in this very precarious time.

97
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:27,087
We have been told that there are going to be massive deportations.

98
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,280
Some of us have said, well, that's impossible.

99
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,082
But I think we ought to take it seriously.

100
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:43,405
Almost a quarter of our residents, our neighbors, are immigrants that weren't born in this country.

101
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,606
And that puts a target on them.

102
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:50,689
And I think it's important that we let our neighbors know that we have their backs.

103
00:16:52,590 --> 00:17:10,621
And another thing that I think is important is that we protect our people who are serving as police officers who might be conscripted to go around up their neighbors, something that may put them in a very serious moral bind.

104
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:14,023
And I think that we should be thinking about them also.

105
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:19,366
So I think there are a number of reasons to support this ordinance, and I urge you to do so.

106
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:20,107
Thank you.

107
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:25,272
Thank you.

108
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,475
Good evening, Chair and members of the committee.

109
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:28,817
My name is Laura Rotolo.

110
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:39,330
I live at 14 Rita Drive, and I'm here both as a proud Medford resident and representing the American Civil Liberties Union, where I work as field director, and our 3,700 members live here in Medford.

111
00:17:42,973 --> 00:18:04,180
And I just want to proudly support this ordinance and say just a few words that, of course, this is a very important moment for cities and towns to stand up on behalf of immigrants, no matter who you voted for, for the presidential election, we know that the incoming administration will focus on deportations from day one and that that will create chaos on a very local level.

112
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,785
as we see families ripped apart and all sorts of chaos happening in our cities and towns.

113
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:14,567
And so we are really looking to municipalities to be those firewalls right now.

114
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:21,012
And at the ACLU, we've been working with cities and towns around the state for many years to pass ordinances like this one.

115
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:26,977
Just last week, the City Council of Boston unanimously reaffirmed its Trust Act.

116
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,658
Yesterday, the city of Cambridge did the same thing.

117
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:34,262
And I'm very proud that this ordinance is being submitted today here.

118
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:42,226
And I will also say that it is my understanding that the words in this ordinance are really just a codification of what is already a practice.

119
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:52,812
Back in 2018, we had the executive order and an order from the police chief Sacco at the time that really taken side by side are almost identical.

120
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:57,414
And I think it's important to know that this codification is just what's already a best practice.

121
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:59,716
Medford does not help in deportation.

122
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:03,979
won't assist immigration raids, won't assist immigration enforcement.

123
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:08,802
That's really what's the best for our communities to focus our resources where they're mostly needed.

124
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:18,249
And so I'm proud to support this ordinance and I'm here to answer any questions as we've been doing this in so many cities and towns and work with the committee.

125
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:18,689
Thank you.

126
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:22,601
Hi.

127
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,762
Name and address for the record, please.

128
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,443
I'm Maria Zo, Pilgrim Road, Medford.

129
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:29,664
I'm here because I'm an immigrant.

130
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:34,446
And actually, my grandmother came in 1906.

131
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:40,709
And my family's been going back and forth from Italy to this country for many, many years.

132
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,352
I actually lived out there in Italy and married Italian national.

133
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,272
We've been married over 40 years.

134
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:51,554
And during the last sort of

135
00:19:52,173 --> 00:20:00,923
The purge, whatever we want to call it whatever happened in this country in 2016, you know, we were like actually nervous about traveling.

136
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:06,489
And, you know, we had friends that were like green card holding legal residents.

137
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:17,879
being detained, and beyond the fact that, you know, our immigrants are our family members, our residents, our taxpayers, they work hard.

138
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:21,922
You know, they were in our schools, you know, all the statistics, we could talk about all this.

139
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,865
And I think Medford is a welcoming city.

140
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:28,568
And I'm just grateful that you guys are putting it on.

141
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:31,831
And we're going to stand behind our immigrants.

142
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:32,772
Thank you.

143
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:37,464
Thank you.

144
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:38,985
Name and address for the record, please.

145
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:40,686
Jean Zutter.

146
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,387
I'm at 36 Donner Street, Medford.

147
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:49,831
I want to thank Councilors Sangs and Leming for working on this ordinance really fast.

148
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:54,654
I remember when you came to Medford People Power like a year ago and wanted to codify this.

149
00:20:54,754 --> 00:21:01,998
And I appreciate City Council and this committee moving quickly on this ordinance.

150
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:03,659
It's an unprecedented moment.

151
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,805
And we need to move quickly before the new administration is in place.

152
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:09,047
So I really appreciate that.

153
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:14,114
As Laura said, this ordinance codifies what's already best practice in Medford.

154
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:17,639
The Medford Police Department has this policy since 2018.

155
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:27,487
What this policy, what the ordinance does is expands it to other departments, including the schools, protects our school children.

156
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:34,051
So while the police department was following it, it's expanding it to other departments in the city.

157
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:42,036
This ordinance restricts Medford from cooperating in mass deportations that have nothing to do with criminal behavior.

158
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:45,798
It does not interfere with criminal laws.

159
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:48,108
or judicial warrants.

160
00:21:48,728 --> 00:22:01,152
It only restricts cooperation with ICE on administrative detainers, and as Laura said, logistical support for raids, which is some of what the Trump administration has talked about using police for.

161
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:15,643
We think this is urgent because in coming up to the presidential election, Trump has said he wants to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants that are in the United States.

162
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:19,386
We don't know what this is going to look like on day one.

163
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:24,356
like we don't know what a lot of things will look like with the new administration.

164
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:29,478
We can look at the past Trump administration to have some sense of what that might be like.

165
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:40,163
We know that under the past administration, 5,000 children who were citizen children were separated from their immigrant parents who were deported from the country.

166
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:49,308
And 1,400 children are still without their parents and have never been able to be reunited.

167
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:53,031
Most of the immigrants here are not criminals.

168
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:56,072
They're working, and they have families.

169
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:59,274
Often, they have citizen children.

170
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:05,438
And so at that scale, the massive impact that it will have on families is going to be catastrophic.

171
00:23:07,728 --> 00:23:11,291
We don't know how or if there will be retaliation.

172
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:15,375
I've heard one of the concerns is that maybe Medford would lose funding because of this.

173
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:17,597
We don't know.

174
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:20,379
There's a ton of legal challenges that could happen to this.

175
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:29,847
I think Medford has to stand up and do what's right for Medford residents and not anticipate what would happen if that's how we operate.

176
00:23:30,187 --> 00:23:34,871
That's a slow sort of path to giving into that kind of,

177
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:39,296
fear and not be in a safe community for immigrants.

178
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:42,778
So it is a moral choice for Medford.

179
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,601
It's one that I think we can all make to keep people safe.

180
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:48,423
And I thank you so much for your time and acting on this quickly.

181
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:50,745
Thank you.

182
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:54,488
Name and address for the record, please.

183
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:57,450
My name is Reverend Wendy Miller Olopade.

184
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,351
I live at 105 Brooks Street.

185
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:13,668
And I stand here as an advocate for a beloved community, for making love and justice real in our very own city through our actions, our policies, and our laws.

186
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:21,913
I stand here as the president of the Medford Interfaith Clergy Association, and as the mother of two whose father is an immigrant.

187
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:31,480
I'm a proud resident of Medford and glad to be able to speak to you in support of this ordinance, primarily because I believe it's the right thing to do.

188
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:48,022
Across our diverse social and faith traditions, one message resonates clearly the call to welcome, protect and uphold the dignity of all human beings, especially the stranger, the immigrant, and the marginalized.

189
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:58,055
Becoming a welcoming city is not just an ordinance, it's a moral and spiritual imperative rooted in the shared values of all spiritual and faith traditions.

190
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:02,500
And I'd like to just give you a taste of what those are, in my experience.

191
00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:07,000
In Christianity, the call to hospitality is unequivocal.

192
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,522
The words of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew are clear.

193
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,463
I was a stranger and you welcomed me.

194
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:20,427
These words remind us that how we treat the stranger is a reflection of how we honor the divine.

195
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:33,094
Christians are taught to extend love and care, as Paul writes in Hebrews, do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that, some have entertained angels unaware.

196
00:25:34,338 --> 00:25:38,960
In Judaism, the command to welcome the stranger is foundational.

197
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,842
The Torah repeats it no fewer than 36 times, more than any other commandment.

198
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:50,104
You shall love the stranger as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

199
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:57,027
This teaching is not just about remembering history, but about cultivating empathy and justice in our communities today.

200
00:25:57,608 --> 00:26:01,029
It's a reminder that our humanity is bound together

201
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:04,230
by shared vulnerabilities and aspirations.

202
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,931
In Islam, the principles of hospitality and equity are deeply ingrained.

203
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:22,314
The Quran commands believers to act with compassion and justice, to do good to parents, relatives, orphans, the needy, the neighbor who's near, the neighbor who's a stranger, and the traveler.

204
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:32,525
The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, emphasized that no one's faith is complete until their desire for their sibling, what they desire for themselves.

205
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:39,047
This teaching urges us to ensure that everyone in our community feels safe, valued, and supported.

206
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:47,877
In Buddhism, the practice of meta or loving kindness teaches us to extend compassion to all beings without distinction.

207
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:52,643
The Buddha taught that just as a mother would protect her only child with her life.

208
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:57,749
So to should one cultivate boundless love toward all human beings.

209
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:06,617
This principle calls us to transcend fear and division, creating communities where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.

210
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:16,025
These shared spiritual values call us to act in every moment with every law, with every policy,

211
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:17,866
and in every interaction.

212
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:32,333
Becoming a welcoming city aligns Medford with the highest aspirations of these traditions, to be a place where every resident, regardless of origin, is treated with dignity and is free to live without fear.

213
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:41,378
It also reflects the very foundation of democracy and the history of America as a nation built on the ideals of equality, inclusion,

214
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:44,320
and the belief that all people are created equal.

215
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,664
This ordinance reflects the heart of all of our faith traditions and our shared humanity.

216
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:57,889
It strengthens our community by affirming that all are valued, all are welcomed, and all deserve safety and respect.

217
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,273
Let us live up to these sacred values and declare Medford a welcoming city.

218
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:04,314
Thank you.

219
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:07,096
Thank you very much for those

220
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:13,355
Thank you very much for your words.

221
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:17,460
Wendy, I see one hand on zoom.

222
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:25,810
Mister Matthew page Lieberman, I'm asking you to unmute please state your name and address for the record, please.

223
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:28,713
Yeah, my name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

224
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:30,554
I live in 15 Canal Street.

225
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:35,858
I very much appreciate everybody who's brought this forward, both the legislators and the activists.

226
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:42,383
I think this should be supported for some of the reasons that were brought up previously by some of our council members.

227
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:52,771
The state of it right now is it's effectively provisional as it can be left up to the discernment for as long as

228
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:58,908
they wish to, you know, maintain that it's at the police department, you're living up to the discernment of a police department.

229
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:06,795
And as far as Mayor Burke's previous executive order, yeah, I've lived here for 17, 18 years, I was not aware of that.

230
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:11,879
I think it's much, much better for the community to understand that this is a

231
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:14,057
Law that it's absolutely on the books.

232
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:22,287
We don't want to have perhaps you know immigrants saying, yeah, the state, the city doesn't have some of the books, but I've heard that the police will not Turn you into ice.

233
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,548
That's not a good situation.

234
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:30,997
I have some personal experience, although some of this may be no longer relevant today, you know, about a decade ago, my best friend was

235
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:34,388
deported for a traffic infraction.

236
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:36,269
It was pretty painful.

237
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:49,073
There's a lot of terror that's involved in this kind of stuff, trying to get a box of his belongings to a detention center in the middle of the state and not being able to give it to him, like his glasses that are broken, a pair of sneakers.

238
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,395
So then he was brought back to Brazil, who actually have some shoes on his feet.

239
00:29:54,287 --> 00:30:09,127
And, you know, I had to eventually go to some, walk out to some actual place to actually, fortunate enough that somebody was kind enough to accept the box, to give a box of his belongings, so it would be okay.

240
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:10,889
That was under the Obama administration.

241
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:18,586
There was a, this is not the kind of situation we want people, even though the undocumented today can get driver's licenses.

242
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:32,417
We still do not want to have any kind of situation where immigrants in any way feel that they have to flee, whereas they may be even coded as undocumented immigrants that have to flee because perhaps it's not the thing about a driver's license, perhaps it'd be something else.

243
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:38,142
I have another, I'm recalling that also during the Obama administration, there was a situation

244
00:30:38,697 --> 00:30:50,489
where people are bringing up the situation of women who have been in a trigger warning sexually assaulted, who are afraid to come forward to speak to the authorities because of their immigration status.

245
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,854
And there's a particular senator still actually in the State House who said, well, they should be scared.

246
00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:58,557
They should feel scared if they're undocumented.

247
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:17,587
This, if we maintain it, whereas kind of, well, on the discretion of the police department and stuff like this, we definitely leave this kind of open to this situation where people may not be aware that that's a police decision.

248
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,428
They might not know if the police department may change their mind.

249
00:31:21,218 --> 00:31:36,403
We don't know the kind of pressure that an incoming mayor will be in or a police department will be in by the federal state, especially under this guy under this ridiculous name of quote unquote borders are in the threats that he is making against communities around this country.

250
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:40,204
So yeah, we want, you know, when people are

251
00:31:41,482 --> 00:32:06,642
people are scared, they're terrorized, if they're victims, if they have information about any crimes, we want them to feel comfortable going to anybody in this community to report what they know, whether it's the police department, whether it's people in the school committee or the school, any kind of administration, we want to create that absolutely safe and welcoming environment so people that have decided to live here can feel free to collaborate and, you know,

252
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:13,389
because since this is this kind of criminal thing that's being engaged, we want people to be able to come forward also.

253
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:20,389
and testify and say without fear that they or their family members can be deported because of the kinds of threats.

254
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:34,852
We're also in this state with the governor as well has made a particular decree and the state house, there's a question of, well, can they be convinced to go back and go into formal session within this month or early next year to do something?

255
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:38,193
It's necessary that this is legislatively passed

256
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:42,796
and not just up to, you know, kind of discretion of what people are here or there.

257
00:32:43,156 --> 00:32:48,360
So those are my positions, and I'm really glad that everybody has brought this forward.

258
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,041
Thank you very much.

259
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:51,502
Thank you.

260
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:54,685
I see one more at the podium.

261
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:58,267
Eileen, can you name and address for the record, please?

262
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:02,190
My name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

263
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:10,322
For 20 years, I taught adult immigrants English.

264
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:17,105
The last 15 were at the YMCA International Learning Center on Huntington Avenue.

265
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:24,048
During those 15 years, I met some of the finest people in the world.

266
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:28,850
What they bring to our country is so needed.

267
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:32,545
an incredible amount of optimism.

268
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:42,954
That was the biggest thing I saw, that all of the immigrants who came to the United States were optimistic that they could make a better life.

269
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:52,062
And I think that optimism fueled their value of family and work.

270
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:57,647
Some of them worked like three jobs, three jobs to make it, you know?

271
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:02,514
And they were just amazing people.

272
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:05,035
I love meeting immigrants.

273
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:14,299
What they bring to our country is just beyond my capacity to explain to you.

274
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:20,441
I also stand here in the shadow of the Holocaust.

275
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:22,102
And

276
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:30,233
I'm so afraid now for others to be hunted like we were hunted.

277
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:35,036
We Jewish people, we Jewish people who value the stranger.

278
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:38,698
I was brought up with that value to value the stranger.

279
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:42,921
And I was also told, you have to pay attention.

280
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:49,306
You have to know what's going on because you have to know when you have to flee.

281
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:52,168
And I know that,

282
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:58,549
the immigrants, particularly the undocumented immigrants are feeling that same thing.

283
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:12,396
And I just want to tell you that when I was teaching, almost every class was half documented and half undocumented.

284
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:17,984
So there are so many people here that are undocumented.

285
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:19,665
What does that mean?

286
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:21,666
That means they don't have papers.

287
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:24,048
They don't have papers.

288
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,750
They need papers.

289
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,931
They need to be citizens.

290
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:30,432
They're paying taxes.

291
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:32,473
People say, oh, they don't pay taxes.

292
00:35:32,874 --> 00:35:36,216
They surely pay taxes and they don't get social security.

293
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:38,895
They pay taxes.

294
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:44,617
They contribute to our city, our state, our country.

295
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:50,879
How can we possibly consider letting them go?

296
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:53,800
And where are our workers gonna come from?

297
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:00,342
I mean, I've had several hip replacement, knee replacement.

298
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:04,783
Who takes care of older people in those kinds of situation?

299
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:05,924
Immigrants.

300
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,085
Immigrants take care of old people.

301
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:13,148
Immigrants, they are the ones who care.

302
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:23,413
They're the ones who are going to people's homes, you know, with home nursing services or, yeah, they just are incredibly valuable.

303
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:27,876
And I can't imagine not having them in our city.

304
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:29,857
And I commend everyone

305
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:37,573
who worked on the welcoming ordinance, and I hope that the city council will pass it.

306
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:38,613
Thank you.

307
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:40,235
Thank you.

308
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,203
Seeing no one else at the podium, and oh, one more hand on Zoom.

309
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:58,147
Penelope Taylor gonna ask you to unmute and please state your name and address for the record.

310
00:36:58,902 --> 00:36:59,562
Great, thank you.

311
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:02,123
Penny Taylor, 29 Martin Street, number one.

312
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:05,224
I just want to thank you for taking it up and express my support.

313
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:10,625
Impossible act to follow, but thank you for taking up this important issue.

314
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:15,746
Thank you.

315
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:17,967
Seeing one additional hand on Zoom.

316
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:22,068
Muneer Germanis, can I ask you to unmute and please state your name and address for the record, please?

317
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:25,308
My name is Muneer Germanis.

318
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:27,869
I live at 3 Summit Road.

319
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:33,660
My wife and I are both immigrants and have lived in Bedford for over 40 years.

320
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:47,970
I'm a previous member and past chair of the Human Rights Commission who had actually worked on a similar project with the previous chief of police.

321
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:58,177
And as has already been said, we already have a policy that does not waste the time of the police

322
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:03,272
work with ICE to deport immigrants.

323
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:26,552
Immigrants have become an integral part of our society, and we are, I, for one, feel at home, and I would really hear in Medford, and I would be devastated if I were to get a notice that, hey,

324
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:27,708
You're an immigrant.

325
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:28,688
You don't belong here.

326
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:29,669
Get out of here.

327
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:40,551
I mean, this is not only the morally correct thing to do, but in the judgment of most businesses, it is the right thing to do.

328
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:55,694
We are already seeing examples of businesses that are closing down because their immigrant workers are scared just of the rhetoric of this coming administration.

329
00:38:56,499 --> 00:39:06,605
So once again, I urge you to pass this ordinance as soon as possible and make Medford a safe place to live in.

330
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:07,385
Thank you.

331
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:09,807
Thank you.

332
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:17,091
All right, looking for any other public comments.

333
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:23,435
Going once, going twice, and oh, Mike Denton on Zoom.

334
00:39:24,836 --> 00:39:26,817
Please state you're asking you to unmute.

335
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:29,338
Please state your name and address for the record.

336
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,920
My name is Mike Denton.

337
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,941
I live at Bellevue Terrace in Medford.

338
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:47,287
There's so much wonderful stuff that has been said, so I would like to just echo the sentiments of many by saying, one, thank you for taking this up.

339
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:50,009
And as an immigrant in

340
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:57,452
and Medford resident, I would like to also say thank you to everyone for bringing this up.

341
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:13,465
There's a couple of quick thoughts that I wanted to share were one, there's a tricky thing in this discussion where so much of the discussion is about immigrants as other people.

342
00:40:13,965 --> 00:40:16,907
And the thing that I wanted to say is that immigrants are us.

343
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:31,567
And just to echo a lot of the sentiments that have been made here, this is an opportunity for us to stand up and say, this is who we would like to be in Medford or as Medford.

344
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:37,049
And I wholeheartedly agree that it's the morally right thing to do.

345
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:40,130
And I just wanted to briefly comment on

346
00:40:41,236 --> 00:41:08,984
some practical components to this, where there are so many, there's so many aspects to the way that it would amount to, if we're talking about police officers getting recruited, it would mean police officers being taken away from the job of public safety that we aim for them to do, especially since this whole discussion is about deporting non-criminal people who are living and contributing to our society.

347
00:41:10,024 --> 00:41:18,729
And then beyond the police department any other department or aspect of the city that has to be involved, that means that it's taking resources away from Medford becoming better.

348
00:41:19,189 --> 00:41:24,972
And I think that one thing we all have in common is that we would like Medford to be an ever better place for us to live.

349
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:27,674
And we would like to have a greater sense of community.

350
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:42,145
I think there are some huge practical economic impacts that this potential project of mass deportations will have that we're not paying attention to that will have a real impact on Medford.

351
00:41:42,485 --> 00:41:44,386
I can tell you one simple example.

352
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:57,477
As a business owner in Medford, the community of members at my gym, I've already encountered two people who have quietly expressed that they are afraid that they may have to leave.

353
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:11,180
And from a purely selfish standpoint, if those wonderful humans leave the country because they're afraid or get rounded up in some sort of a indiscriminate raid, then I lose money.

354
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:20,746
And these incredibly decent humans are now living in fear of having their lives upturned when there's no need for that.

355
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:23,487
So started to ramble a little bit there.

356
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:24,728
Thanks for doing this.

357
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:26,569
Keep it moving forward.

358
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,310
Thanks.

359
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,381
Yes, officially my thumbs up of support.

360
00:42:33,305 --> 00:42:33,705
Thank you.

361
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:35,027
All right.

362
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:38,491
Last few Zoom hands have been very last minute.

363
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:44,418
So going once, going twice and public comment is closed.

364
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:46,481
Councilor Lazaro.

365
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,643
I appreciate all the comments we've been hearing.

366
00:42:52,763 --> 00:42:57,467
I have an incredibly prosaic note that there is a typo.

367
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:03,872
Section 5083F employees is misspelled.

368
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:05,694
I just noticed when I was reading through it.

369
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:07,876
Whistleblower protections.

370
00:43:08,196 --> 00:43:09,157
There's just an extra A.

371
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:17,161
I did also have some thoughts about the reporting requirements for the police department.

372
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:26,127
I'm just curious about how easy or difficult that might be for the department.

373
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:37,055
If it's a non-participation, non-compliance, then it may be unnecessary to report out what they're not doing.

374
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:38,716
I'm curious about how

375
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:43,053
how that works, or if we can maybe, I'd be curious to hear.

376
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:46,535
Can you point out the word first that was misspelled?

377
00:43:46,995 --> 00:43:47,495
Employees.

378
00:43:48,415 --> 00:43:50,637
It's whistleblower protection subject to the blah, blah, blah.

379
00:43:50,717 --> 00:43:51,777
It's the second line down.

380
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,278
It says any city employees with an AS.

381
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:55,059
Do you see it?

382
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,541
Oh, yep, yep, yep.

383
00:43:58,801 --> 00:43:59,281
I see it.

384
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:00,582
Defined in section 185.

385
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:00,902
I gotcha.

386
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:01,182
OK.

387
00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:02,583
All right.

388
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:07,445
I have my little copy right there.

389
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:15,088
And for legal questions, I know we did bring Miss Rodolo.

390
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:16,309
Is she still here?

391
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:30,716
Just this is our representative from who works with the ACLU who agreed to come along to answer any of the more nitty gritty questions about the by the ordinance draft.

392
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:35,499
Sorry, can you can you repeat?

393
00:44:43,186 --> 00:44:45,608
Yeah, maybe counselor saying even did you draft it?

394
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:46,028
Yes.

395
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:48,910
Um, okay.

396
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:49,531
Okay.

397
00:44:49,971 --> 00:45:02,841
Yeah, especially because just because it says every six months and especially if it's ah, I'm just I am curious about how we would have how their department would have records if it's something that's non participation.

398
00:45:04,462 --> 00:45:05,623
I believe that in that case.

399
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:06,363
Okay.

400
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:08,044
Um, I believe in that case.

401
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:08,585
Um,

402
00:45:09,392 --> 00:45:18,144
The, the police department can just tell us they don't they don't have a request or anything to give more context about the reporting parts of this.

403
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:36,030
the reporting and the complaints enforcement part of this ordinance, a lot of the language is taken straight from the CCOPS ordinance and is language that the police department themselves have already dealt with.

404
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:40,931
So nothing should be completely new to the department.

405
00:45:41,511 --> 00:45:45,652
Nothing should be things that they haven't experienced or haven't done before.

406
00:45:47,733 --> 00:45:47,953
Yeah.

407
00:45:48,789 --> 00:46:01,633
My impression in speaking with folks at Medford People Power is that this is all fairly boilerplate language that has been replicated in other cities as well.

408
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:05,174
Did you have anything?

409
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,416
Thank you, Chair.

410
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:14,518
The only reason I, I would just, I thought it was a very,

411
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:25,545
the last speaker made about how when our police department is focusing on things that are not, you know.

412
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:30,346
Helping our residents, then it's taking time and energy away from helping our residents.

413
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:37,048
So and I wouldn't want to ask our police department to be doing things that's outside of the realm of their responsibilities.

414
00:46:37,748 --> 00:46:43,710
That being said, I do realize like and we'll be talking about this tomorrow because we're making some edits to the C cups ordinance and.

415
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:49,634
But that reporting requirement is already, you know, something that's happening in that committee.

416
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:55,298
And often it's like the report is there is no update.

417
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:56,539
That's fine, too.

418
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,822
So it's not, you know, a ridiculous ask.

419
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:08,107
So I just wanted to make sure we weren't, you know, without realizing it, putting too much on the plates of different departments in the city.

420
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:09,348
Okay.

421
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,351
Yeah, I think I think a report of

422
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:16,613
There is no update is also fine as well.

423
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:19,660
But noted.

424
00:47:20,742 --> 00:47:21,704
Councilor Callahan.

425
00:47:23,046 --> 00:47:23,947
Thank you.

426
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,971
Yeah, this ordinance seems very thorough.

427
00:47:29,452 --> 00:47:40,001
I do appreciate all the work that has been put in, both by the former administration of police chief, as well as by the activists, by Councillor Tsang, and everyone else who was involved.

428
00:47:41,503 --> 00:47:45,426
The one thing I noticed as I read through it is it is very thorough.

429
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,707
It has a lot of details.

430
00:47:48,789 --> 00:48:02,339
things that as a person who is not an expert in police ICE integration, you know, I am not an expert in whether these things are boilerplate or not.

431
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:18,130
So my main question is just, and I would love to hear either from Councillor Tsang or from the ACLU, just about whether there are details in here that are Medford specific,

432
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:23,574
if these are pretty standard boilerplate that have been passed in other cities.

433
00:48:24,514 --> 00:48:44,869
And then my final question would simply be to ask if this has been run by KP Law or if that's maybe our next step, just to see sort of what the next, in terms of the legalese, because I don't, being not super expert on this, there are lots and lots of details in here that I have not had a chance to research each one individually.

434
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:45,485
Yeah.

435
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:50,128
So I could answer one part of that.

436
00:48:50,148 --> 00:48:58,692
I have been told nicer, and I did a little bit of research on similar ordinances that have been passed in other cities at this point.

437
00:49:00,133 --> 00:49:03,495
Yes, the language is fairly boilerplate.

438
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:09,758
I did pass this by the mayor, who then referred it to KP Law.

439
00:49:09,818 --> 00:49:11,819
So I think that any and

440
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:22,442
My impression with that is that any specific legalese or whichever could very likely and pretty easily be dealt with in a regular meeting.

441
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:23,563
So yeah.

442
00:49:26,684 --> 00:49:36,806
But in terms of the context for other cities, I would like to let Laura here speak about that.

443
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:38,467
Go ahead and press the button.

444
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:39,347
Just wait for it.

445
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:43,466
I'm sorry.

446
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:44,347
It's a new system.

447
00:49:46,768 --> 00:49:49,149
Thank you, Councilor Callahan, and I can answer that question.

448
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:54,731
And just to be clear, I am a lawyer, but I'm not the city's lawyer, so I'm not here on behalf of the city.

449
00:49:55,351 --> 00:50:02,194
What I can say is that this language, very similar language, has been passed in many cities around the state and around the country.

450
00:50:02,735 --> 00:50:07,176
And the premise of this is that cooperation with immigration is wholly voluntary.

451
00:50:07,516 --> 00:50:10,878
It has to be wholly voluntary under the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution.

452
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:15,699
The federal government cannot force localities to do the work of the federal government.

453
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,406
And so this is all based on what is voluntary collaboration and the choices that cities make.

454
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:26,772
And it also very closely tracks the language that's already in the police order.

455
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:30,154
So none of this is brand new.

456
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:35,715
It is what I believe is still the protocols and the practice of the police department.

457
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:44,257
So it's things like not collecting, not asking about immigration status when you stop a person, you know, that is best practice around the state.

458
00:50:44,897 --> 00:50:47,638
And, you know, it's wholly legal.

459
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:55,580
It's, you know, it's everywhere around the country and not keeping information you don't need to keep and not volunteering resources where you don't need to volunteer those resources.

460
00:50:57,003 --> 00:51:02,631
And it's also very similar to other cities who have recently affirmed, just like Cambridge and Boston.

461
00:51:04,313 --> 00:51:04,633
Thank you.

462
00:51:04,954 --> 00:51:05,254
Thank you.

463
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:07,237
Does that answer all your?

464
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:07,978
Great.

465
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,621
OK.

466
00:51:11,282 --> 00:51:12,624
Any other comments?

467
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:19,497
Do we have a motion on the floor?

468
00:51:19,897 --> 00:51:21,358
Councilor Tang?

469
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:34,123
I would motion to refer this to the City Council and to accept the edits that you have with the section numbers.

470
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:41,947
Yes, as well as the edit so kindly pointed out by my colleague about the small typo.

471
00:51:42,907 --> 00:51:43,748
And that edit as well.

472
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,090
Thank you.

473
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,191
There's always something.

474
00:51:50,572 --> 00:52:03,779
On the motion to refer this to regular council pending the section edits and the typo, all those in favor?

475
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:03,859
Aye.

476
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:05,900
No.

477
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,781
No one's on the same, so we could just do it.

478
00:52:08,281 --> 00:52:08,981
It doesn't have to be rolled.

479
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:10,022
It does not have to be rolled.

480
00:52:10,402 --> 00:52:11,823
You can choose to do one, but you're not

481
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:14,798
All opposed?

482
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:16,639
Motion passes.

483
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:19,500
Thank you, everybody.

484
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:31,543
So, this... So, we'll be taking this up at a future regular meeting of the City Council.

485
00:52:31,563 --> 00:52:35,784
We'll likely have more discussions there, but it's out of committee.

486
00:52:37,485 --> 00:52:40,426
Now, for the real reason everybody's here, we're gonna edit the newsletter.

487
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:46,892
I know that y'all been waiting so patiently.

488
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:49,634
Come on, come on.

489
00:52:49,675 --> 00:52:52,357
We're gonna go out of order.

490
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,318
I just wanna get this done.

491
00:52:56,981 --> 00:53:02,767
Okay, I'm gonna really quickly.

492
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:13,813
Okay.

493
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:16,414
Thank you everybody so much for coming along.

494
00:53:43,078 --> 00:53:47,342
One moment, City Council newsletters.

495
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:49,043
Okie dokie.

496
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:53,006
Going to share my screen.

497
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:19,793
All right.

498
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:20,854
All right.

499
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:54,557
2, 4, 3, 5, 4, the resolution to publish this city council newsletter.

500
00:54:55,899 --> 00:55:02,804
I'd like to thank Councilor Sang for drafting this particular issue of the newsletter.

501
00:55:04,105 --> 00:55:10,851
We had, and do apologize that it was only sent out in the, wait,

502
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:15,576
Why that's there.

503
00:55:16,057 --> 00:55:27,011
That was only sent out in the middle of the day, but essentially the only real difference between this newsletter and previous ones is that they're first there is some.

504
00:55:29,484 --> 00:55:42,351
There is some tentative language on it, which we did last time, like keeping the future tense as well as the past tense and just kind of letting me edit that later when we go into review.

505
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:48,015
And there's also a nice little point by point breakdown because this is the end of year newsletter.

506
00:55:49,008 --> 00:56:02,297
the holiday edition of the most significant accomplishments of city council this year, which would be something nice to discuss as to whether we want to do that.

507
00:56:02,978 --> 00:56:03,218
Bye.

508
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:05,740
Thank you all for showing.

509
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:09,702
Yeah.

510
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:17,508
So essentially, the first bullet point goes over the override

511
00:56:18,035 --> 00:56:22,241
The second discusses progress on zoning.

512
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:29,752
The third bullet point talks about the establishment of the stabilization funds.

513
00:56:31,149 --> 00:56:54,958
Then the policies to fund the affordable housing trust as well as tax deferrals and the proposed rental assistance program for veterans, communications methods, wildlife feeding ordinance, and the solid waste ordinance, and the leaf blower ordinance, environmental, as well as the upcoming work on the charter committee.

514
00:56:56,858 --> 00:56:58,799
Counselor Callahan, if you can

515
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:01,979
Yep, Councilor Callahan.

516
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:03,000
Just a super quick question.

517
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,701
Did we this year maximize tax deferrals for seniors?

518
00:57:06,741 --> 00:57:08,362
I thought that had already been done in the past.

519
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:11,743
I believe that's referring to the HERO Act one.

520
00:57:12,823 --> 00:57:20,886
Perhaps a better thing, what we did this year was we tied them to state mechanisms to make sure that they're like tied to the cost of living.

521
00:57:20,986 --> 00:57:22,146
Yeah, we can specify that.

522
00:57:22,426 --> 00:57:23,347
Okay.

523
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:23,967
Yeah.

524
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:42,341
Yeah, I think I think I put it broadly because I think we re maximize it for seniors, and then we did the time for that that's, that's a really tricky one but I had an in depth discussion with the with Tim cost with Ted cost and about that.

525
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:51,031
We so technically passing one of the provisions of the Hero Act that we did pass was actually redundant.

526
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:53,994
And so it didn't like it didn't add up to.

527
00:57:54,014 --> 00:57:59,079
So if we hadn't already maximized deferrals for seniors, it would have maximized them itself.

528
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:08,768
But because we already had done that, it's like it didn't really, he said that there was some utility and actually passing it because then we could go on like a list of cities that had passed it and

529
00:58:09,328 --> 00:58:16,250
Yeah, but he said, but the more important one was the fact that we tied it was the fact that we end up tying it to inflation to an inflation.

530
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,951
So the deferrals would go up every year.

531
00:58:18,971 --> 00:58:21,311
And I think that's, that's, that's the important part.

532
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,492
Leave it as it's too confusing.

533
00:58:24,592 --> 00:58:26,853
Like, we don't need the super hyper detailed.

534
00:58:26,873 --> 00:58:27,833
Yeah, I was.

535
00:58:27,893 --> 00:58:30,354
Yeah, that was that was the internal debate in my mind.

536
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:30,694
Thanks.

537
00:58:31,554 --> 00:58:34,196
Yeah, I'm very happy to go.

538
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:45,826
Yeah, I am also disinclined from like putting out a very detailed legislative explanation of consumer price indexes and whatnot.

539
00:58:46,587 --> 00:58:48,669
But I think it, I think it captures

540
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,912
It's like, let's just have like a footnote or something like that.

541
00:59:07,598 --> 00:59:10,600
Yeah, it's it is it is a good thing that it was passed.

542
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:11,761
Okay.

543
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:26,273
And I guess my other thing is that some of these are sort of what we will do future work, the veterans rental assistance program is not technically passed yet.

544
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:28,174
But I mean, I think it's fine.

545
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:29,535
We have been working on these things.

546
00:59:29,575 --> 00:59:33,298
And I would say that these are the main bullet points.

547
00:59:33,338 --> 00:59:33,699
And then the

548
00:59:35,077 --> 00:59:40,664
normal, the kind of general business of what actually happened in December is here as well.

549
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:50,296
So yeah, pending the tenses here,

550
00:59:53,638 --> 00:59:58,300
Does anybody have any particular suggestions about things that should be changed?

551
00:59:58,980 --> 00:59:59,661
Councilor Callahan.

552
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:00,141
Thanks.

553
01:00:01,242 --> 01:00:12,747
I am super happy if we want to do these because maybe these are even more interesting to some people than other things, but like the Bedford Donuts Cafe, the Demets Donuts, the Buns House.

554
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:16,148
That might actually be really interesting to people.

555
01:00:16,228 --> 01:00:19,350
I thought we were not including them, but I'm happy if we want to.

556
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:33,875
Yeah, that was another conversation I had in my mind, because I saw that a lot of people online were talking about these two places in particular, and when I was going through the agenda, I was just thinking, okay, well, this might be a good place to get the word out.

557
01:00:35,155 --> 01:00:39,916
I think we can also just exercise our own discretion when it comes to it.

558
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:47,479
Councillor Lazaro.

559
01:00:48,721 --> 01:01:01,911
I would say that when it seems like something is changing hands, but staying pretty much the same, it seems less interesting to our residents.

560
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:13,901
But when it's something that's like changing over, like, I mean, I was a huge Chili Garden fan, love Chili Garden, very sad that they are changing hands, but interested to see what Buns House turns out to be.

561
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:15,602
I think that like,

562
01:01:16,142 --> 01:01:21,425
people are very interested in the businesses that open up in Medford because it changes the kind of cultural landscape of our city.

563
01:01:21,906 --> 01:01:30,010
So I do think that we should be kind of exploring, I think that's a way that the work of city council really translates directly into people's lives.

564
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:33,753
So I think we should be like, I think we should be including that stuff.

565
01:01:35,414 --> 01:01:37,555
When it Yeah, but I think you're right, like case by case.

566
01:01:38,335 --> 01:01:39,556
In this case, I think we should include it.

567
01:01:43,905 --> 01:01:47,628
I'm just deleting these spaces after the periods of the document.

568
01:01:47,668 --> 01:01:51,351
Counselor, feel free to just keep your mics on.

569
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:52,572
Okay, great.

570
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:59,999
Well, since we're already on the resident services one, I would just suggest

571
01:02:02,025 --> 01:02:06,328
policy of non-cooperation with ICE on non-criminal matters.

572
01:02:06,468 --> 01:02:08,890
I guess that's an important caveat to put in.

573
01:02:11,532 --> 01:02:19,399
And then we, I didn't write language about sending it to, referring it out of committee, just because I didn't want to be too tentative.

574
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,761
But maybe we can add in a sentence there.

575
01:02:23,362 --> 01:02:25,383
Met, met, or yeah.

576
01:02:26,004 --> 01:02:27,505
Oh yeah, yeah, that would be great.

577
01:02:29,057 --> 01:02:37,981
And then the other suggestion or the other kind of question I had for you all was on governance, which we also just held.

578
01:02:40,602 --> 01:02:46,525
I left a comment, I just left a comment that we defined what the charter review process was in a previous newsletter.

579
01:02:46,645 --> 01:02:52,027
I just realized that some folks might not see that and might not have seen that newsletter before.

580
01:02:52,247 --> 01:02:55,449
Should we just copy and paste it back in here?

581
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:57,109
Yeah, or yeah.

582
01:02:59,025 --> 01:02:59,445
We link it?

583
01:02:59,585 --> 01:03:00,046
OK.

584
01:03:00,766 --> 01:03:01,827
OK.

585
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:08,132
Explained, maybe?

586
01:03:12,275 --> 01:03:12,816
So wait.

587
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:13,176
OK.

588
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:19,381
Or in our, maybe, was it November?

589
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:20,682
Was it the November's newsletter?

590
01:03:21,602 --> 01:03:25,125
Yeah, it's in, oh, is it October?

591
01:03:26,986 --> 01:03:27,507
They're online.

592
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:33,564
I forget which one it is.

593
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,045
I like to be specific.

594
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,206
I'm pretty sure it was the November one.

595
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:38,547
OK.

596
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:42,088
But we can also let you.

597
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:48,511
We can approve pending on clerical changes.

598
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:49,532
Yes.

599
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:50,592
OK.

600
01:03:50,972 --> 01:03:51,253
OK.

601
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:52,053
Sounds good.

602
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:02,678
Anybody else have any suggestions?

603
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:16,503
Do we have a... Do we have any... A little gift for everyone who opens it.

604
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:19,184
That would be too difficult.

605
01:04:20,145 --> 01:04:22,305
That'd be too difficult to format in LaTeX.

606
01:04:22,746 --> 01:04:23,046
Sorry.

607
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:24,886
You can't do that in LaTeX?

608
01:04:25,347 --> 01:04:26,327
No, it's really hard.

609
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:39,889
motion to accept and publish the newsletter is motion to Publish the Proven publish the newsletter pending.

610
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:46,712
Uh, the events of December 11th because I think there is one.

611
01:04:46,732 --> 01:04:48,672
Yeah, December.

612
01:04:48,772 --> 01:04:56,515
Yeah, two committee meetings pending the December 11th many meetings and to receive and place on

613
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:01,530
Yes.

614
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:02,871
And I'm sorry.

615
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:08,435
On the motion by Councilor Bizarro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

616
01:05:08,975 --> 01:05:09,736
All those approve?

617
01:05:09,756 --> 01:05:10,436
Aye.

618
01:05:10,857 --> 01:05:11,417
Opposed?

619
01:05:11,697 --> 01:05:12,518
Motion passes.

620
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:26,188
And finally, okay, so that won't be going out until tomorrow because we still have the future to consider

621
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:30,443
those committee meetings haven't actually happened yet.

622
01:05:32,064 --> 01:05:46,735
Okay, lastly, 24073 offered by Councilors Callahan, Sangam, Lazaro, resolution to establish a City Council listening session.

623
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:47,476
So this is just a

624
01:05:49,065 --> 01:05:54,588
opportunity, if any of us have anything, to update folks about listening sessions.

625
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,410
City Councillor Callahan.

626
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:04,493
Yeah, just a little update, which is that the session that was supposed to be on the 7th got postponed, so that's going to be in January.

627
01:06:05,254 --> 01:06:07,915
January the, do you remember the date?

628
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:09,056
I can look it up.

629
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:16,580
The 4th or something, and because we changed the date, weren't sure if you could make it, but we just want to make sure there's going to be a second City Council.

630
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:21,413
Yeah, so.

631
01:06:24,296 --> 01:06:25,797
Just looking for the actual date right now.

632
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,583
Yeah, it is going to be the 4th at 1030, which is a Saturday, January 4th.

633
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:35,985
So if you're available, great.

634
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:42,050
If you're not available, then chair Leving, if you don't mind helping us to make sure that somebody can make

635
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:48,393
Okay, just the rescheduled West Medford Community Center listening session.

636
01:06:48,533 --> 01:06:52,534
And our community liaison, Stacey Moore, will be helping with outreach for that.

637
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:53,694
But it's great.

638
01:06:53,714 --> 01:07:01,396
I think the West Medford, we rescheduled because they misunderstood who was doing outreach for it.

639
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:07,098
And then once we were like, no, actually, it should be the venue that does outreach, and they said,

640
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:11,200
We're going to do it in January, which gives us enough time to fill the room.

641
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:17,984
So we can expect there to be 20 or more people, which I think is going to be probably our largest so far, which will be very exciting.

642
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:19,004
All right.

643
01:07:19,825 --> 01:07:20,185
Sounds good.

644
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:21,246
Thank you.

645
01:07:22,146 --> 01:07:27,309
I'll look into scheduling that and making sure folks are available for it.

646
01:07:27,849 --> 01:07:32,592
I know I personally won't be available on the 4th, but I'm sure that somebody will be.

647
01:07:35,434 --> 01:07:36,074
Any other updates?

648
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:40,967
Councilor Lazaro.

649
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:43,648
Motion to adjourn.

650
01:07:45,008 --> 01:07:49,809
Before, do we have anybody who wants to say anything publicly?

651
01:07:50,049 --> 01:07:50,789
Any public comment?

652
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:52,930
Going once, going twice.

653
01:07:53,810 --> 01:08:01,151
On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Lazaro, do we have a second?

654
01:08:02,432 --> 01:08:04,172
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

655
01:08:04,492 --> 01:08:05,332
All those in favor?

656
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:05,972
Aye.

657
01:08:06,152 --> 01:08:06,633
Opposed?

658
01:08:07,053 --> 01:08:07,913
Motion passes.

659
01:08:07,973 --> 01:08:08,733
Meeting is adjourned.
