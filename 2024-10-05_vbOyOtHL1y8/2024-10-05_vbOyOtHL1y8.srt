[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli appears to be absent.

[SPEAKER_05]: Present. 5 present, 2 absent, and the meeting is called to order.

16
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:41,714
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole on Tuesday, December 5, 2023 at 6 p.m.

17
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:45,377
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall via Zoom.

18
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:50,321
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss Paper 23-314, Private Ways in the City of Medford.

19
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:56,926
[SPEAKER_05]: The City Council has invited DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon and Attorneys Robin Stein and Sharon Everett of KP Law to attend this meeting.

20
00:00:57,387 --> 00:01:00,827
[SPEAKER_05]: For further information, aids, and accommodations, contact the City Clerk at 781-393-2425.

21
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:05,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely yours, Nicole Morell, Council President.

22
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:09,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So as the meeting notice states, this is actually from a paper from Councilor Scarpelli.

23
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:19,352
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a number of these papers over the years, honestly, usually multiple during the year, regarding questions that residents will have as far as services on private ways,

24
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:28,326
[SPEAKER_05]: some of it stemming from impetus as far as in saying they used to have a certain service on their private way, they no longer have it, or understanding why they don't have a service, things like that.

25
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:44,692
[SPEAKER_05]: We have had some subcommittee meetings on this where we've had Commissioner McGivern explain a lot of the role that the DPW takes on, but much of this actually enters the legal area as far as what is allowed under Massachusetts general law for practices on private ways.

26
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:45,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So as such,

27
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,940
[SPEAKER_05]: We have attorneys Everett and Stein from KP Law with us tonight.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have a number of questions.

29
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:55,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do my best to address Councilor Scarpelli's questions from my memory as we're here.

30
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:59,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, so we'll just kick things off.

31
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:03,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

32
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney Everett or Stein, can you hear us?

33
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:10,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

34
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:11,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

35
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:17,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney Everett can hear us at least, so.

36
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:26,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Before, I know I have a number of questions if counselors have any questions that they would like to ask.

37
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

38
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:30,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

39
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:40,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it might be helpful, I know this is kind of more for specific questions, but if possible, if Attorneys Everett and or Stein could give a

40
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:46,233
[SPEAKER_01]: general framework of what state law is around private ways and how that impacts the city.

41
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:59,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a good starting point just to understand maybe what we can do, what we can't do, and then what is more within our discretion as a city by policy or ordinance.

42
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:02,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Paris.

43
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:06,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney Stein, Attorney Everett, is that something you would be able to provide?

44
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Robin, do you want me to do it?

45
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:16,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you start and I can, you know, maybe from the real estate perspective more.

46
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,485
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's land use issues, I'll jump in.

47
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

48
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:20,866
[SPEAKER_02]: So good evening.

49
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:23,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us at your meeting tonight.

50
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:35,891
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important thing to know about private ways is that the city has very limited powers as to what it can do.

51
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,952
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few things that the

52
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:45,617
[SPEAKER_02]: that the city made due, and I'm going to go over the general laws respecting those provisions.

53
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:53,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city has the authority to appropriate public funds for the removal of snow and ice from private lanes.

54
00:03:55,103 --> 00:04:07,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I reviewed your file, the ordinances, and I see that that has not been accepted by the city, but if the city wanted to, it could accept the provisions of Chapter 14,

55
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:17,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Section 6C, which requires a valid question for which public funds may be used to allow private ways.

56
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:25,759
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council and the mayor have a lot of discretion in deciding which private ways to be allowed.

57
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:36,645
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a statute, which is Chapter 40, Section 6N, which allows public funds to be appropriated to make temporary repairs to private ways.

58
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:47,261
[SPEAKER_02]: that that provision is one could act on that provided there's an ordinance on that.

59
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:56,608
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see that the city does have some provisions with respect to temporary repairs to private buildings.

60
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:08,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city has flexibility in setting those standards and I see that the city has set some standards such as the way it must be open to the public for a period of five years

61
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:13,561
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sets forth all the temporary repairs that can be made, what's included and what's excluded.

62
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:26,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Section, Chapter 85, Section 6 allows the city to have a bylaw requiring sidewalks to be plowed by abutters.

63
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:34,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that that has been adopted, but that's a possible statutory provision regarding private ways.

64
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:49,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other authority of the city regarding private ways comes through its authority under Chapter 14, Section 22, to adopt ordinances respecting various things.

65
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:55,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a general matter, the city is responsible for private ways and for order and traffic.

66
00:05:56,571 --> 00:06:03,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, there are traffic regulations that the city can adopt with respect to private ways.

67
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:12,863
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also do that with respect to private ways if the city is requested by the owners of the private way.

68
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:32,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might get a request from a particular butter, but the statute requires that you get the consent of all the butters in order to regulate traffic in public or private ways, such as parking, speed limits, and other things.

69
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:41,229
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also prohibit parking in front of a residence if the person is not a resident.

70
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,973
[SPEAKER_02]: There are various regulations that the city could use on private ways.

71
00:06:50,914 --> 00:07:01,958
[SPEAKER_02]: The city can prohibit and regulate cars and vehicles that may be left with private ways that interfere with snow and ice.

72
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:08,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It can require vehicles to be moved for snow removal purposes.

73
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:19,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has noise restrictions that it can impose, such as horns and vehicles having excessive noise.

74
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all within the ambit of the city.

75
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:32,053
[SPEAKER_02]: The city could also regulate speed, as I said, on private base, provided that

76
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,480
[SPEAKER_02]: the cities are requested.

77
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:58,334
[SPEAKER_02]: And under the provisions of Chapter 260, Section 120D, anybody trying to tow a vehicle from a private way, there are certain standards that that person must meet in order to tow vehicles from a public way, most of which include prior notice to the police chief.

78
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:04,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Robin, do you want to add anything?

79
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,679
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, I think Shirin pretty much summed it up.

80
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:13,820
[SPEAKER_04]: The city has limited but some ability to regulate private ways.

81
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:20,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if you have specific questions, we probably can give more direct answers.

82
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

83
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:26,043
[SPEAKER_05]: One question I had I actually got from a resident.

84
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So you talked about, I think, the ability of

85
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,576
[SPEAKER_05]: all I think you said, it has to be every abutter on a private way has to agree.

86
00:08:32,656 --> 00:08:41,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Could residents on a private way, I'm not an abutter, but residents, could residents on a private way, if everyone on the street agreed, could they put like a speed hump on their road?

87
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Or does that exist in some other plane of regulation?

88
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I could not hear anything.

89
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:54,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, can you hear me now?

90
00:08:57,783 --> 00:08:57,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

91
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:06,205
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they can't hear us, Kevin.

92
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:09,626
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just faint.

93
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:11,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me now?

94
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:12,327
[SPEAKER_04]: That's better.

95
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:24,929
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so could I had a question from a resident that asked if they got everyone on their private way to agree, could they actually install a speed hump on their private way or does that exist under some other regulation?

96
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:35,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharon, the question is, if all the residents on the street agree, can they put a speed bump on a private way?

97
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:39,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you could do that.

98
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:45,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And private ways are controlled generally by the abutters.

99
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:51,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Private ways, as a general rule, it's owned by all the abutters that they own to the center line.

100
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:57,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And the abutters to a private way have responsibility and control of private ways.

101
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could, for example, put in gates.

102
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they wanted to put in speed bumps, they could do that.

103
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:12,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if the city has some traffic regulations that require it to be informed first, they could do that.

104
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:27,747
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my opinion, if they have control of private ways, they could put in speed bumps and reasonable traffic devices to control traffic and speed.

105
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:40,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only caveat that I would add to that is, you know, if it was a way that was developed through a subdivision approval, we may want to go back and look at what was approved by the planning board.

106
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:47,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if the speed bump was not part of the road improvement that was approved, they might need to come in and request a modification.

107
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:51,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would depend on maybe how old the private way is, we'd have to look at it.

108
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:53,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

109
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:53,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

110
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:55,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And not that anyone is asking this.

111
00:10:55,177 --> 00:11:05,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So just making sure I'm understanding that kind of the way that, you know, every level up from the city is what Trump's like MGL, Trump, you know, you follow MGL and then city law and federal kind of that thing.

112
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:10,469
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't, people couldn't suddenly say, we want our private way to have a 55 mile per hour speed limit.

113
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,813
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, you know, just making sure that the city regulations apply first.

114
00:11:14,913 --> 00:11:21,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if folks want to work within that city regulation to make some changes to their street, they can.

115
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,716
[SPEAKER_05]: or city ordinances apply first?

116
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:44,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, so I guess another way to phrase it is like, we can't make an ordinance in Medford that supersedes or goes, supersedes MGL.

117
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:48,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And MGL can't make a, you know, the state house can't pass a law that supersedes federal law.

118
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just saying that the-

119
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:58,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so private way folks can't make some law that is outside of or some regulation that is outside of city ordinances.

120
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,610
[SPEAKER_05]: All city ordinances still apply.

121
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

122
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:06,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

123
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:11,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think actually a lot of the questions we get are related to services.

124
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:14,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think regulation, I think that makes sense.

125
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:18,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I think where folks get confused, understandably so, is

126
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:29,533
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they're told they have a, they know they live on a private way and outside of the fact that we all pay the same taxes regardless of what type of street we live on, they get some city services.

127
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:38,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So the street may be plowed or there may be, you know, if sometimes when branches fall into the road, like large branches, they may be picked up, things like that.

128
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:40,919
[SPEAKER_05]: If folks request a stop sign, it gets installed.

129
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:47,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So where's the line there as far as services that cities with private ways

130
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:55,989
[SPEAKER_05]: can or do provide and then ones that would be going outside and would be deemed using public funds for private goods?

131
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to your ordinances, you may use public funds to make temporary repairs to private ways.

132
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:12,021
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, if there are trees falling, you could remove that, you know, because it's a safety hazard.

133
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:17,465
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a drainage issue, you could do drainage repairs to private ways.

134
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:30,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So under your ordinances, there are certain criteria that have to be satisfied before the city can consider whether to provide these repairs and services to private ways.

135
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:42,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So such repairs are determined by the mayor based on recommendations from the DPW director, and it sets forth the various kinds of repairs that could be made.

136
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:54,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and could you, you were hard to hear a little bit before, could you repeat back the section of MGL that was adopted, opted into for that?

137
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:02,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can make temporary repairs under the provisions of chapter 40, section 6N.

138
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:11,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And the city has adopted ordinance pursuant to that statute to allow for temporary repairs.

139
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:20,373
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could not, for example, make permanent repairs, because that would be outside the scope of the statute.

140
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:30,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody's looking for a full payment to the private way, then that would be arguably outside the scope of that authority.

141
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:43,010
[SPEAKER_05]: So an example for that, I have a very specific example, is that on a private way, it just has a catchment basin that, because of increased rain events, it's just overflowing.

142
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,826
[SPEAKER_05]: there wouldn't be really anything that the city could do to fix that, because that needs a complete overhaul.

143
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:52,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be likely tied into the city sewer to avoid that problem.

144
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would not be considered a temporary repair.

145
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:54,949
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a permanent.

146
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,610
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be correct.

147
00:14:57,991 --> 00:14:58,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

148
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:01,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to Commissioner Gabert.

149
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:10,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to add, from a standpoint of the DPW, we do things in the interest of public safety.

150
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:21,329
[SPEAKER_08]: There's when a limb falls down in a road that we're not doing that to maintain the tree, we're doing it to maintain public safety.

151
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:31,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also do things like plow the private ways, even though we haven't adopted that section of law, we do do that in the interest of public safety for emergency vehicles.

152
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:41,642
[SPEAKER_08]: We do things like fill potholes without charging the residents 50% or whatever the ordinance says in the interest of public safety and making sure that vehicles can get

153
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:44,044
[SPEAKER_08]: to the buildings on private ways.

154
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:46,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do do things like that.

155
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:57,862
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will say that some of these provisions, as the attorneys are mentioning, the city has to adopt, which is one of the maintenance ones, and anything that is

156
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:00,124
[SPEAKER_08]: a public safety route address.

157
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:03,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So your example of a drainage issue, that could be an issue of public safety.

158
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:15,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And we may go out and respond to that if it's creating an issue, regardless of the specifics of what we are allowed to do or not.

159
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:17,352
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll do it almost like it's an emergency.

160
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:23,455
[SPEAKER_08]: If a fire truck needs to get through, we're not going to just leave a giant puddle there, to put it simply.

161
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:26,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

162
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:29,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Councilor Scarpelli is on the call now.

163
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:32,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli, I know you had requested this meeting.

164
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:34,064
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have specific questions that you wanted to ask.

165
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give her a beat, assuming that's him.

166
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:53,458
[SPEAKER_05]: One question, again, a specific instance that we've had

167
00:16:55,242 --> 00:17:03,708
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of, I live on a private way, I have no idea why it's a private way or where the papers are, you know, I don't get anything like, I did not get anything like that when I, you know, I bought my house.

168
00:17:04,348 --> 00:17:19,398
[SPEAKER_05]: But folks have said, folks who have been in their home for a really long time, we had a specific example of someone saying that the city donated a tree, they planted a tree in front of my house on a private way before I was the owner of the house, I didn't ask for this tree, and now it's damaging the sidewalk in front of the house.

169
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:23,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So since the city planted the tree, isn't this the city's responsibility?

170
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is the legal opinion on something like that?

171
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens a few.

172
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,140
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happened more than once.

173
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:41,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the city usually has no responsibility for trees within private ways.

174
00:17:43,748 --> 00:17:46,830
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is proof that the city

175
00:17:50,462 --> 00:18:03,535
[SPEAKER_02]: and the tree is now impairing the sidewalks and damaging the sidewalks, the city could, under the repair statute, make some repairs to the sidewalks.

176
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:14,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure the extent of the city's liability if the tree is not impairing traffic or causing an obstruction.

177
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:26,232
[SPEAKER_02]: If the sidewalk is a danger to pedestrians, then I think the city, it would behoove the city to repair those sidewalks.

178
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:34,139
[SPEAKER_02]: But just generally, I think you'll have to establish that the tree was in fact planted by the city.

179
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:38,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

180
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:40,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Caraviello.

181
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

182
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,994
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talked about the trees, just about every tree that's been planted on a private way has been planted by the city.

183
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:52,496
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no residents that plant trees and, you know, get them that big.

184
00:18:52,916 --> 00:19:01,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've lived on a private way for 45 years and, you know, I get, you know, the same service as everybody else.

185
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:05,944
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all of a sudden, you know, we don't, we have a problem with the trees and small things.

186
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:08,066
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say these residents,

187
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:17,467
[SPEAKER_00]: pay the same amount of taxes that everybody else pays, and they're entitled to the exact same services that everybody else gets.

188
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:21,192
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't be picking and choosing who gets services and who doesn't.

189
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:24,676
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I live in a private way.

190
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:27,198
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like you like yourself, Madam President.

191
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,902
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this is what I was what I moved into 45 years ago.

192
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:43,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say that it's it's all part of the same city of Medford, one city, not not little sections and say, say, private ways, pay the same taxes, and they should get the same services.

193
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:47,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

194
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:51,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, attorney ever signed in your opinion, I mean, should there be

195
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:56,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we just got a few new street trees planted on my private way.

196
00:19:58,368 --> 00:19:58,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Big fan.

197
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:07,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, in your opinion, should there be something that folks are given notice or something now that this tree is on their private way?

198
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:10,501
[SPEAKER_05]: it becomes their responsibility.

199
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:10,921
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

200
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:15,265
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's, you know, going forward, if that's the case, we want what we want to do, then we should do it.

201
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:22,931
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I would probably guarantee that everyone that lives in on a private way, they didn't plant those trees.

202
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:30,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I say if that if that's what if that's going to be the policy going forward, then the residents should be made aware that we're putting a tree in front of the ocean.

203
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:31,018
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it.

204
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that as a question to Attorney Everett or Stein, is that something that would

205
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,207
[SPEAKER_05]: behoove the city to do.

206
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:41,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And Commissioner Ray, I don't know if you have anything to add.

207
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:44,586
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

208
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:44,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

209
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:46,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just go to Commissioner McGibbon just from the DP.

210
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:47,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

211
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:47,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

212
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:48,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll be quick.

213
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:51,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

214
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:58,231
[SPEAKER_08]: There are subdivisions that are built, and one recently, I think it's Macklin Road up in the Heights.

215
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:03,572
[SPEAKER_08]: The developer installs the trees or plants trees as part of the subdivision process.

216
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:08,654
[SPEAKER_08]: So when there's private ways and there's old trees on them,

217
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:16,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It's likely that the original developer that did the subdivision planted some trees.

218
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,537
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not all city planted trees.

219
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,018
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, that's what I had to add.

220
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:23,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

221
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go back to you, Attorney Everett.

222
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:33,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I mentioned, the city has responsibility for trees within the layout of public ways.

223
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:41,103
[SPEAKER_02]: The public laws do not give the city authority over trees in private ways.

224
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:58,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would expect that if this were, you know, brought to a court, it would be held that the abutters to private ways where such trees are located are responsible for the maintenance of those trees.

225
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

226
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:09,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask Commissioner McGovern, I guess, so in those instances, what does the official kind of DPW stand say?

227
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on a private way.

228
00:22:10,716 --> 00:22:11,836
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know who planted the tree.

229
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:17,350
[SPEAKER_05]: We think it was a city, we have a story that it was a city, and now it's bringing up my sidewalk.

230
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,711
[SPEAKER_05]: How does the DW approach that?

231
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:23,153
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we've been taking these situations case by case.

232
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:30,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And we always say that regardless of who planted the tree, trees run with the land.

233
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:34,478
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a very specific definition of what a public shade tree is.

234
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,138
[SPEAKER_08]: and what the city's jurisdiction is on trees.

235
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:45,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So just like if you go to your friend's house and plant a tree in their yard, that tree becomes a part of the yard, and it now is your friend's tree.

236
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,021
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't come back later on and say, well, that's my tree.

237
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:49,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I planted it there.

238
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:50,861
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's that.

239
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:53,842
[SPEAKER_08]: That's important to think about.

240
00:22:54,342 --> 00:23:01,964
[SPEAKER_08]: When you buy a piece of property, unless there's something written specifically in the agreement of the sale, the trees and the rocks and the dirt come with it.

241
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:12,371
[SPEAKER_08]: With that said, if we are aware that prior to me being the commissioner, our practices were different, as Councilor Caraviello is alluding to.

242
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:20,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, I have set things in a path that I believe is more in accordance with mass general law.

243
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:25,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that we're challenged with in the DPW is addressing those types of issues.

244
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:28,684
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll probably be around for a little while until we fully

245
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,005
[SPEAKER_08]: get on to the side of the law.

246
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:49,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So case by case, if we planted it within the last few years and it's causing a problem, we will help out the owner of the tree, acknowledging that we planted it, but at the same time, making sure that they acknowledge that the city doesn't have care and control of the tree.

247
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:53,274
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's lifting the sidewalk panel, yes, we may repair the sidewalk panel.

248
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:58,376
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's growing into the road and obstructing traffic or it's

249
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:02,060
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a limb that's about to fall into the road, things like that.

250
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:09,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of asking the owner to prune it and take care of it, if we know we planted it, we may do that pruning.

251
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:11,930
[SPEAKER_08]: We try to get permission from the owner when we do that.

252
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:20,656
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bit of an education process, and I think tonight is part of that education process.

253
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,957
[SPEAKER_08]: There's many categories of this.

254
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:30,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the chief of police has taken on the parking question and what can be done as far as parking in private ways.

255
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:32,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're tackling that as a city as well.

256
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:35,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

257
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions from councillors at this time?

258
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:44,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see Councilor Favelli is unfortunately unable to join us, but I do think we're

259
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:47,733
[SPEAKER_05]: covering the bulk of the kind of the recurring questions we do get.

260
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question, oh, go to Councilor Caraviello.

261
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:53,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

262
00:24:54,015 --> 00:25:08,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam President, if this is the course we're going to take, I think that the city should be sending a notice to everybody that lives on the private way, notifying them of the changes that are going to be happening going forward.

263
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:18,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I don't think most people even know we're having this meeting, but if we're going to start enforcing ordinances and changing ordinances for tonight,

264
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:25,889
[SPEAKER_00]: the residents on these private ways should be notified what they're responsible and what they're not responsible for.

265
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:29,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I say, many of them have lived there 40, 50, 60, 70 years.

266
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:37,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And just assume they lived on the street, they say, you know, that a private way got the same things that everyone else got.

267
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should be made aware of this.

268
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:42,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for sure, Gabriel.

269
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:46,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say the city has started this process.

270
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:49,434
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been public meetings regarding parking.

271
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:58,164
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually looking at making a webpage that's an informational webpage for residents similar to what Boston has.

272
00:25:58,284 --> 00:26:02,489
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to Boston's website, it has a very good breakdown of

273
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:18,811
[SPEAKER_08]: what private way owners and public way city is responsible for and it lists it out in a pretty simple manner so we are headed in that direction and there is more information to come but this is a part of it the public meetings that

274
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:28,159
[SPEAKER_08]: the chief of police and engineering had are part of it, and the information that is going out to the residents, the DPW is a part of it.

275
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:36,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know we'll just continue and, you know, any sort of recommendations on that communication and education campaign are welcome.

276
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:38,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

277
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:41,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

278
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:42,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

279
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:45,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two questions.

280
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:47,124
[SPEAKER_01]: One was along those lines.

281
00:26:48,265 --> 00:26:54,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like we're going to have a website where people can go, if I live on a private way, here's the law.

282
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,870
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the city does.

283
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,471
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the city doesn't do.

284
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:01,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the expectations I should have for service provision on a private way.

285
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,334
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the idea, yeah.

286
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:05,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had discussions with the mayor about that.

287
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:08,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in brainstorming sessions and trying to figure out the best way to do this.

288
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:11,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I've shared some examples, like Boston, for example.

289
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And anybody can go look at that.

290
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,081
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be similar to that.

291
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:15,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be great.

292
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:19,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be great to put links to the different various meetings that you mentioned.

293
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:21,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I know police have had some engineering.

294
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:22,317
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a few.

295
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:25,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I think linking out those would be great on that website.

296
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:35,171
[SPEAKER_01]: To Councilor Karibello's point, would maybe a one-page version of that eventually be mailed out to all the private residents that we have, that we know of?

297
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:38,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can keep it on the table and talk about it.

298
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:46,568
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of mailers, but it can be on the table, I believe, obviously beyond my capacity to make that decision.

299
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:49,191
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's something to talk about.

300
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:50,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

301
00:27:50,312 --> 00:27:53,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that would be, I do agree that that would be good.

302
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:55,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, it's not going to reach everybody even.

303
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,901
[SPEAKER_01]: if we do that.

304
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,443
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's some value there.

305
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:00,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

306
00:28:00,364 --> 00:28:02,666
[SPEAKER_08]: And it could reference a website which is more permanent.

307
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:03,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

308
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:04,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

309
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:06,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And lands in the recycling bin.

310
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it can be shared that way.

311
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:09,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

312
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:11,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially to real estate agents who are selling homes.

313
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:11,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

314
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:13,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really the key thing.

315
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:13,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

316
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:16,358
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what are the expectations of the people.

317
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:18,854
[SPEAKER_01]: who are purchasing properties.

318
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:24,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously you have people who live on the properties as Councilor Caraviello said for a very long time.

319
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:37,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing, but as properties turn over, I think it's important for residents or future residents who are purchasing those properties to understand that you're not getting the same level of service that you're getting on a public way.

320
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:41,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand the argument, everyone pays the same taxes, everyone should get the same thing.

321
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:43,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on a state road, right?

322
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:54,279
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of state roads in the city where we don't get the same level of service or comparable services as people on city roads.

323
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:59,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a specific gripe about big sweep that I'm going to come to you with later, which is.

324
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:05,674
[SPEAKER_01]: My zone and the DCR zone keep getting scheduled at the same time in the fall, so there's nowhere to park anywhere.

325
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,297
[SPEAKER_08]: We can fix that.

326
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:16,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just for me, but for the whole neighborhood, because I know the main idea of it is we don't do the main roads, we're doing the side roads, so people can move to the main roads and then move back.

327
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:24,789
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's just a great example of there are disparate levels of service because of who has jurisdiction over certain ways.

328
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:27,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's basically three levels of jurisdiction.

329
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,491
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of city-controlled public ways.

330
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:31,112
[SPEAKER_01]: There are state-controlled public ways.

331
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:38,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are private ways, which are, as our attorneys have noted, controlled by the abutters of those ways, the people who live on those ways.

332
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:39,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

333
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:40,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Just some important points.

334
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:45,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So the title owners to private ways don't pay taxes on those ways.

335
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:46,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's important.

336
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But they pay taxes on their building lot parcel, obviously.

337
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the taxes that go towards the network of public ways.

338
00:29:55,063 --> 00:29:57,464
[SPEAKER_08]: is the same network of public ways that we all share.

339
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:00,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're all paying taxes on the network of public ways.

340
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:05,027
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an important point to remember, too, because we don't spend equally on all of our public ways.

341
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:10,349
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't spend equally on the smaller public ways as opposed to an arterial.

342
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:17,231
[SPEAKER_08]: So the argument of unfair services needs to be looked at through the lens of our network of public ways.

343
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:20,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there are advantages to living on a private way.

344
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:23,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why sort of a process exists

345
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:36,063
[SPEAKER_08]: to either have the city, either the city takes the land or the private ways, you know, donate the land to become a public way, once it meets standards and things like that.

346
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:43,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a process all laid out for that if residents are interested in public way acceptance for their private way.

347
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to make sure that those points are put out there and understood.

348
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:49,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

349
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:52,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner Gibran, in that same thought,

350
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:57,036
[SPEAKER_05]: This might be a city engineer question, but I guess it's kind of all the same.

351
00:30:57,677 --> 00:31:08,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Has the city identified any streets that they would want to convert to public ways, or is it the position of the city that they're only looking at resident-driven desire to convert, understanding it's costly and involved?

352
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:11,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, both paths exist.

353
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:25,590
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now, we don't have a large appetite or capacity to do the city-driven approach with taking land, providing betterments, and doing that whole thing.

354
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,891
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty human resources intensive.

355
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:31,452
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, right now, our engineering division

356
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:41,736
[SPEAKER_08]: focusing all hands on deck basically on water systems and pavements and sidewalk systems for the public ways.

357
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:49,060
[SPEAKER_08]: So our public ways are in a state where our engineering resources need to be, and public money resources need to be really

358
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,320
[SPEAKER_08]: focused on that.

359
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:59,363
[SPEAKER_08]: There could very well be a time in the future, just like there was a time in the past, where the city identifies private ways that have a high public good.

360
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:07,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking of one right now, Fulton Spring Road, that sees a lot of traffic from Fells Way up to Fulton Street.

361
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be nice if it was public.

362
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:10,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So that could

363
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:24,984
[SPEAKER_08]: be a public road in the future if the city had the resources and the time to identify it, provide betterments, provide the taxes to the residents because they would have to pay for it either through taxes or with

364
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:28,027
[SPEAKER_08]: the, you know, the betterments to make it up to city standards.

365
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:30,990
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, that's important to remember, too.

366
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:42,680
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't a, it's not a free process, but it does exist for either the city to lead the charge and make it a public way, or the title owners of the private way to lead the charge and make it a public way.

367
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,360
[SPEAKER_08]: It can happen either way.

368
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:44,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

369
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:52,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to kind of go a little bit down that path, again, not that there's any specific plans, but thinking, again, I live in a private way, so

370
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:56,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I'd assume that to make those betterments, like we have a very narrow sidewalk.

371
00:32:56,604 --> 00:32:59,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think the sidewalk would have to be up to ADA standards.

372
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:04,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And would that be, it would involve some, you know, some taking of like front lawns or, or widening the road or things like that.

373
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:06,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Potentially, potentially.

374
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:07,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it depends.

375
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:09,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, so we have standards for width of right of way.

376
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:18,144
[SPEAKER_08]: We have standards for the cross section of a sidewalk, the width of a sidewalk, how crossings happen, the pedestrian ramps.

377
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:40,216
[SPEAKER_08]: the depth of the pavement, the depth of the utilities that we install, the materials that all those things are made out of, that even things as steepness of the road, sight lines, all of the things to go from a private way that just basically provides access to homes to a public way that is in the care and control of the public.

378
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:42,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

379
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello, did you have another question or is your hand still up?

380
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:46,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, I did.

381
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:51,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tim, you mentioned the advantages of living in a private way.

382
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:52,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they are.

383
00:33:54,858 --> 00:34:05,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, as you've stated before, Councilor Caraviellolo, some of them are outdated, but there are individuals who live on a private way and they don't want the city to provide betterments, make a sidewalk.

384
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:13,106
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to own the tree that's in front of their house on the, you know, in the right-of-way parcel.

385
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:15,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are advantages to it.

386
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are living on a private way, there's,

387
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:28,218
[SPEAKER_08]: advantages, I suppose, to owning the objects that are in the private way, the road, the sidewalk.

388
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people like that sort of stuff.

389
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:41,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I was involved when I was city engineer on a road where a resident told us to go away because they didn't want us to fix potholes because it's a private way.

390
00:34:41,761 --> 00:34:42,501
[SPEAKER_08]: It was their road.

391
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:48,623
[SPEAKER_08]: And our response was, well, we're fixing the potholes because we need fire trucks to be able to get down the street.

392
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,964
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes both ways.

393
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:53,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard both sides.

394
00:34:53,205 --> 00:35:00,672
[SPEAKER_08]: There's less people in favor of private ways today than decades ago, but they're still out there.

395
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I say, I didn't choose to live in a private way.

396
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:06,856
[SPEAKER_00]: When I bought my house, that was what it was.

397
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:11,719
[SPEAKER_00]: But 40 years ago, I also had to pay to pave my street.

398
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:24,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should maybe bring back that program where the residents paid half and the city paid half for some of these private ways like they did in prior years.

399
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that an option that we're looking at?

400
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:53,344
[SPEAKER_08]: The ordinance is still there, but I've recommended, and I will recommend it to this body too, at this time, with the limited amount of funding we get for roadways, I believe it's in my obligation to direct those funds towards the publicly accepted ways that are in the care and control of the city, and not ways that are under a different, you know,

401
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:56,485
[SPEAKER_08]: a different title holder, I think, or a different owner.

402
00:35:56,865 --> 00:36:03,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it is the right thing to do when it comes to public money and how we spend public money.

403
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:05,970
[SPEAKER_08]: These are very expensive things we're talking about.

404
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,272
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are obligated, as the city,

405
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:16,277
[SPEAKER_08]: to distribute the funds to the public waste, to repair public waste.

406
00:36:16,638 --> 00:36:28,830
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is a time in the future where we have extra money to spend on rebuilding roads, then I would definitely be in favor of that 50-50 program that we have.

407
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, those would only be temporary repairs.

408
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:34,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like a mill and overlay would be about as far as we could go.

409
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:40,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Because again, there are limitations when it comes to what we can and can't do in a private way.

410
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:54,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can't just go spend a whole bunch of public money building new roads and sidewalks in a private way unless we are planning on following the process to then take that land and

411
00:36:55,974 --> 00:37:01,297
[SPEAKER_08]: uh get it accepted uh by the city council and the under the recommendation of the planning board.

412
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:19,846
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean uh when I did my street some years ago that's all we did they did a mill and overlay they didn't uh you know they didn't put any sidewalks in uh but like I say you know now it's 40 years later and the road is you know is in my road is in need of repairs also but you know you talked about notifying the people uh all you got to do is uh put a letter in their tax bill

413
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:27,253
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the easiest way to make sure they get it, because they have to pay their taxes somewhere along, so they gotta open that up.

414
00:37:27,753 --> 00:37:33,838
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, again, we keep talking about people going on websites.

415
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,280
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't go on websites.

416
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:37,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.

417
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:46,248
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, putting the letter in the tax bill is the easiest way to do it, and you'll know everybody got it.

418
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:51,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

419
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:52,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Paris.

420
00:37:54,122 --> 00:37:55,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

421
00:37:57,284 --> 00:38:02,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in terms of the cost, I just, you know, since we talked about this last October, I want to just bring it up.

422
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:18,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're talking at least a couple miles of private ways in terms of length, but I think the number that we talked about was if not tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars would be needed to bring all the private ways up to the state necessary to be accepted by the public.

423
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:21,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, all the private ways, we're talking definitely in the hundreds of millions.

424
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:23,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Hundreds of millions, yeah.

425
00:38:23,697 --> 00:38:24,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

426
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:31,701
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're talking one or two, yeah, in the single digit millions, maybe if we're talking a couple of streets.

427
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:32,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

428
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I mean.

429
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,703
[SPEAKER_08]: These are big dollar figures that we're talking about.

430
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:44,828
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's important that as a steward of public money, myself, that that money is used in the things that we are obligated to spend public money on.

431
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:47,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are certainly not obligated to spend money on private ways.

432
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,191
[SPEAKER_08]: That type of money.

433
00:38:51,611 --> 00:39:01,396
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, too, in terms of things that could maybe go and I don't want to overload now this website that, you know, will eventually be created this page on the website.

434
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:07,920
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think also some sort of link to this is how you can organize your neighbors to try to bring your

435
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:19,694
[SPEAKER_01]: street up to the level, you know, if they want to spend the money so that they don't have to be responsible for it in the future, it seems like that may be the direction that maybe some folks are going.

436
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:31,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you'd ever get everybody on the street to agree, but it does seem like, given all of the discussion around this, that it could be possible for residents to organize themselves and pitch in the money to

437
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:34,807
[SPEAKER_01]: bring streets up to the standard to be accepted.

438
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:41,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we accepted them, then they would be public ways and then they would be streets that would be invested in by with public money.

439
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:43,312
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that that kind of.

440
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:47,219
[SPEAKER_01]: resource, just making sure that resource is available would be good.

441
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think there's limited information that we could give there.

442
00:39:52,262 --> 00:40:05,729
[SPEAKER_08]: It would really be up to the organization of the residents, however they decide to organize themselves into an entity, how they're going to get the funds together to do the work, they probably need an attorney, things like that.

443
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:08,611
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of nuances and details that would need to be covered there.

444
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:11,272
[SPEAKER_01]: But even just those three bullet points that you just said, right?

445
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:14,234
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do this, you're going to need to organize your neighbors.

446
00:40:14,274 --> 00:40:15,755
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to probably need an attorney.

447
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:18,096
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need to raise funds.

448
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:22,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just making it clear what the process is, if folks ever want to go down that road.

449
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:24,319
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of references to Mass General Law sections.

450
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:24,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

451
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Read this, read this, read this.

452
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:37,546
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of that, I think I have a question for Attorneys Everett and Stein, which is just how does the subdivision control law, or I don't know the exact term,

453
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:41,288
[SPEAKER_01]: play into what the city can do?

454
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:48,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems to me that there, you know, in certain neighborhoods, there were a lot of subdivisions and that's why a lot of our private ways were created.

455
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:55,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just wondering if that plays any specific legal role differently than the parts of mass general law that we've already talked about.

456
00:40:57,802 --> 00:41:05,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't necessarily play a different role, but the subdivision control law is the process by which new private ways get built.

457
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:17,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you own a whole parcel of private land and you want to be able to subdivide it and you need to create frontage so that you can create lots under zoning, the subdivision process is what you follow to build those roads.

458
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:27,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So any road that's created through the subdivision process is private unless it gets taken or laid out as a public way through the statutory process.

459
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

460
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:42,879
[SPEAKER_01]: On that front, does the city have the ability to require that private ways built through the subdivision process be built to the standard that they could be accepted as public ways?

461
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:50,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would have to compare your public waste standard to your subdivision rules and regulations.

462
00:41:51,053 --> 00:42:00,740
[SPEAKER_04]: The Community Development Board has the ability through a subdivision approval to require that streets be built to the standard that's in the subdivision rules and regulations.

463
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:09,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the standard in your subdivision rules and regulations is the same standard, for example, the city might look for before they take away or not.

464
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:10,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

465
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:15,416
[SPEAKER_04]: We had an engineering question, but it's tied to the subdivision rules and regulations.

466
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:16,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

467
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:17,338
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.

468
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:19,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it, there's not much land left to be subdivided.

469
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think it's going to be a huge problem, but it does.

470
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:33,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can just add on to what Attorney Stein said, is we typically, in the engineering office, when we're reviewing this, we go by the subdivision rules and regulations that we have.

471
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:38,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Steepness, width of the way, depth of pavement, sidewalk, stuff like that.

472
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:40,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do refer to those.

473
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:44,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Maplin Road, for example, is interested in becoming a public way.

474
00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:49,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're also encouraging the new road on Winthrop Street, Mary Kinney Way.

475
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,480
[SPEAKER_08]: to become a public way.

476
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:58,842
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, the city tries to work with the developers to do the next and last step.

477
00:42:59,082 --> 00:43:09,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you've built everything to the subdivision standards, engineering has provided all the inspections, then the last step is to submit your acceptance plan to the planning board for recommendation

478
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:13,966
[SPEAKER_08]: to the city council for acceptance as a public way.

479
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:20,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds to me, Tim, like you're saying that the subdivision rules and regulations meet the standards for acceptance for the public way.

480
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:23,109
[SPEAKER_08]: That is basically what we use for standards.

481
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:25,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't go into extreme detail.

482
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,731
[SPEAKER_08]: We use the engineering details, construction details for that.

483
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:34,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, the specification for the asphalt mix, for example.

484
00:43:35,753 --> 00:43:41,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, but we're not allowing people to subdivide and build substandard private ways at this point.

485
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:47,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, if you're going to subdivide your land and build a road, then you need to follow the subdivision rules and regulations.

486
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:47,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

487
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:59,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I just think, you know, obviously the last thing we want to be doing is compounding the mistakes that have, you know, not that it's the mistakes of any of us, it's mostly mistakes made by people who made choices 100 or 50 years ago.

488
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:01,699
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly don't want to keep doing it.

489
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:02,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Which way?

490
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:09,102
[SPEAKER_08]: And they weren't necessarily mistakes back then, because I don't have the history of the subdivision control law in front of me, but it always hasn't been that way.

491
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:10,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

492
00:44:10,503 --> 00:44:16,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the first iteration, and maybe the attorneys know, but in the 50s, maybe the first iteration, and then 70s, it was revamped.

493
00:44:16,886 --> 00:44:24,749
[SPEAKER_08]: So a long time ago, you could just subdivide your parcel and do whatever you wanted to get to your house.

494
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:25,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

495
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:25,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

496
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:27,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

497
00:44:28,116 --> 00:44:28,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

498
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:29,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

499
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:31,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other questions from Councilors at this time?

500
00:44:31,818 --> 00:44:35,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a resident or two on the call, so I want to make sure we get to them if they have questions.

501
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:41,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, if there's any folks on the Zoom who have a question, please raise your hand.

502
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:50,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any at this time, so I'll go back to one more very specific scenario.

503
00:44:52,371 --> 00:44:53,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably know the answer.

504
00:44:54,116 --> 00:45:03,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we have one of the trees that we think the city planted at some point on a private way, it comes down and it, you know, damages a piece of property on the private way.

505
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:08,845
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not the, our reading of the law is that that is not the city's responsibility.

506
00:45:08,865 --> 00:45:09,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

507
00:45:10,906 --> 00:45:11,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

508
00:45:12,387 --> 00:45:12,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

509
00:45:12,747 --> 00:45:13,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

510
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:14,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

511
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:17,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions at this time?

512
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

513
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:27,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a question, but I just wanted to thank you, pardon me, again for speaking to us about this topic.

514
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:41,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it, I think it speaks to the need for, you know, I know it's an ever-evolving project too, because protocols around private ways have been shifting for such a long time and there's been kind of a systemic lack of clarity.

515
00:45:41,712 --> 00:45:45,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not totally surprising that this comes up every six months or 12 months.

516
00:45:46,356 --> 00:45:47,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good that we're talking about

517
00:45:49,835 --> 00:46:14,326
[SPEAKER_03]: options for getting the word out to more residents within our capacity, like a mailing or, I mean, even just, I agree, even a really simple webpage, I think, would help folks in our position who, you know, kind of have to dole out information about private ways to residents when it comes up multiple times a year to try to, you know, over the long term, get more people on the same page throughout the city.

518
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:16,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's great to have a conversation about that.

519
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we're going to try to move the needle on that as we can.

520
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:42,752
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think it's to everybody's benefit, you know, to just be reminded of what we're working against here and the responsibilities that we have that govern that public funds overall and how unfortunately incredibly expensive it is to do what we really want to do, which is to, you know, have that full jurisdiction over all of the roads that all residents live on.

521
00:46:43,477 --> 00:47:12,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just helpful to get sobering as it may be, you know, and reminders of what a big task that is for the city to do comprehensively and what we need to do in interim steps to try to improve resident enjoyment and, you know, equal enjoyment of residential roads in the meantime as we try to keep our eye on the prize for what will it take to, you know, fully adopt private ways over the long term and what are the reasons for doing that and what can people do in the meantime.

522
00:47:13,284 --> 00:47:22,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate this conversation and for me it's helpful for communicating that to residents and I hope that it's helpful in our ongoing efforts to let residents know.

523
00:47:23,514 --> 00:47:25,196
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my favorite topics.

524
00:47:25,236 --> 00:47:26,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Folks can always call me if they want.

525
00:47:27,398 --> 00:47:29,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Residents can stop me in the halls and talk to me.

526
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:32,582
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a lovely topic to discuss.

527
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:35,625
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will say that we're not alone in Massachusetts.

528
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:38,727
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's plenty of resources out there.

529
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:40,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Folks want to do their own research.

530
00:47:40,749 --> 00:47:51,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I think MassDOT has a very good website that really dives in deep on the details on how a public way is laid out, the difference between private and public.

531
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,101
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a little resource of case law associated with it.

532
00:47:56,382 --> 00:48:05,104
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an excellent paper that was written by Mr. Smithers that goes into very good detail about public versus private ways.

533
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:09,545
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, as I mentioned, Boston has a very simple website that breaks it down.

534
00:48:09,945 --> 00:48:20,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, not to mention, every other town and city in the state has shared in this battle in the past and will continue to in the future.

535
00:48:21,718 --> 00:48:22,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

536
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:22,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

537
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:23,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

538
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:30,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I also just wanted to thank you, Commissioner McGivern, for coming and providing clarity on a lot of these issues.

539
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:41,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as we see from the questions and the conversation tonight, you know, once it's, you know, these questions come up every few months, but once you wait, it gets pretty deep.

540
00:48:43,114 --> 00:48:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's helpful to have this kind of

541
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:58,610
[SPEAKER_07]: this forum where we can answer those questions, but also see how those questions link into other questions about our capacities, our resources, our vision.

542
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:07,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I think your comments have provided a lot of clarity with regards to, I think, concrete examples of where we want our city to go in the next few years.

543
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's very helpful.

544
00:49:10,898 --> 00:49:14,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should be encouraged to hear that we're

545
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:17,329
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, trying to put out more information.

546
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:28,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's always room for cooperation there as well and figuring out how we can get those messages across to residents.

547
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:41,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think one note I love to put in is this idea of translating those documents as well to make sure residents who might not speak English who live on those streets have an idea of what's going on as well.

548
00:49:42,366 --> 00:49:44,107
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm very thankful for your work.

549
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:46,734
[SPEAKER_07]: for your presence here tonight.

550
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:48,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

551
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:51,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I also just want to echo the thanks.

552
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:56,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not always fun to give people the answer that maybe isn't the answer they want.

553
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate you being able to give the answers.

554
00:49:59,398 --> 00:49:59,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

555
00:50:00,058 --> 00:50:01,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I do it a lot.

556
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:02,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

557
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from counselors?

558
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

559
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:12,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to say thank you to attorneys Everett and Stein as well as Commissioner McGibbon for the meeting and to my colleagues.

560
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:12,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

561
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:13,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, likewise.

562

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Attorney Stein.

563
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:16,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney Everett, I appreciate it.

564
00:50:16,478 --> 00:50:24,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And although I feel like you are probably more well-versed and always happy to tell people answers that they don't want, but always welcome and appreciate the time and insight.

565
00:50:25,765 --> 00:50:26,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a motion?

566
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:27,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

567
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:29,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a motion to receive and place on file and adjourn.
