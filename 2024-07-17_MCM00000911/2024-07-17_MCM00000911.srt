1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:11,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everyone to the July 15th, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Ethics Subcommittee.

2
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:14,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard from David.

3
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:16,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully he'll join us.

4
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:17,877
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, we'll just move ahead.

5
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:20,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

6
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:24,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Eunice, do you want to lead?

7
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:26,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, sure.

8
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:32,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I've spent, uh, wait 1st, can we just accept the minutes from the last meeting?

9
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:33,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:34,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, motion to approve.

11
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:37,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I 2nd all in favor.

12
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:39,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, thanks.

13
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:40,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

14
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:42,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I can, I can send them in and have them posted.

15
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:43,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

16
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:43,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead units.

17
00:00:44,903 --> 00:01:11,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have spent the last couple of weeks since we last met looking at the charters and ordinances of a few other communities in no particular order, Cambridge, Framingham, Boston, Springfield, and Somerville, I think.

18
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:21,631
[SPEAKER_03]: As we learned early on, Framingham is the only one that has something actually in its charter.

19
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: All the others have something about ethics or financial filings in their ordinances.

20
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:40,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I reached out to Framingham, Cambridge, and Springfield.

21
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:47,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And thought I was going to be able to get in touch with somebody from Cambridge.

22
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:53,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I did do back and forth with a few people, but they misunderstood what I was asking.

23
00:01:54,642 --> 00:02:00,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time we finally figured out who I really needed to contact, and I reached out, I didn't hear back.

24
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:03,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Nor did I hear back from anyone from Springfield.

25
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:11,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a great discussion with a gentleman from Framingham, George King.

26
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:18,733
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an at-large city councilor and served on their

27
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:42,485
[SPEAKER_03]: uh first um charter commission uh uh charter commission uh framingham just recently became a city after having been a town forever um and when they were a town they didn't have a charter which i thought was odd um thought everybody had a charter but um needless to say so when they

28
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: became a city, they established a charter that was in 2017-ish.

29
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually undergoing a review now.

30
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,956
[SPEAKER_03]: We're recommending establishing the charter, five-year review, and then every 10.

31
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:00,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're doing their first review right now.

32
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great discussion with him.

33
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:11,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I put all of my notes in our drive and basically,

34
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,205
[SPEAKER_03]: The upshot was that they put it in the charter.

35
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:25,329
[SPEAKER_03]: He says it was well-intentioned to have something in the charter.

36
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,754
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the execution has not been as effective.

37
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:38,579
[SPEAKER_03]: They use the state form, which he says,

38
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:59,376
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it looks very intrusive and it is, but it doesn't really kind of get to the heart of what was sort of the spirit of what they were trying to get at, which was to ensure that everything's on the up and up in Framingham.

39
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:06,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really get to any potential shadiness or corruption or anything that could be going on.

40
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,081
[SPEAKER_03]: He thinks that

41
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:16,352
[SPEAKER_03]: a different form might have been more effective.

42
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:35,890
[SPEAKER_03]: As they're going through the review process, the current charter commission has submitted their report and he doesn't seem to see any changes in that particular section of the charter, which he found a bit strange.

43
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:49,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as how it operates, all candidates, all electeds fill out a statement of financial disclosure.

44
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:52,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

45
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:56,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Boards and commissions are not required.

46
00:04:57,878 --> 00:05:03,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Full and part-time city employees, superintendent, chief financial officer, department heads, basically.

47
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:14,010
[SPEAKER_03]: He hasn't heard anybody say that it's discouraged anybody from running or applying for a job or anything like that.

48
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,734
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, they use state form.

49
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,838
[SPEAKER_03]: City clerk administers it all.

50
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:30,945
[SPEAKER_03]: He hasn't heard anything about it being a burden for the clerk, but the clerk would probably say that it does.

51
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:37,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as transparency, which is a big thing that we were looking at was.

52
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:49,129
[SPEAKER_03]: The financial disclosure forms are not online, but anybody can go into the office and take a look.

53
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't require a FOIA or anything like that.

54
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,672
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just go in and ask about it.

55
00:05:54,432 --> 00:06:04,738
[SPEAKER_03]: They're done annually and they get disposed of in accordance to the regular records retention requirements.

56
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:14,561
[SPEAKER_03]: As I wrote in my notes, as I said, he thinks that it's well-intentioned, but ineffective.

57
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:21,485
[SPEAKER_03]: If they just recommended doing an ordinance, the city council probably wouldn't have done anything.

58
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:26,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommend is, as we know, just that, doesn't require.

59
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:33,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Putting it in the charter, he said, gave them the requirement that they must implement something.

60
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:50,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Then as I said, the state form doesn't have a lot that applies directly to Framingham, so it's not as effective at rooting out any possible corruption or shadiness that can occur on the local level.

61
00:06:50,708 --> 00:07:00,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get in touch with Cambridge or Springfield, but I did look through all of the info that I could find online.

62
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:12,389
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Cambridge has their own form that's only about five or six pages long, and it's specific to Cambridge.

63
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So you only have to list things if it has a Cambridge connection.

64
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:26,494
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Springfield, I couldn't find their form online at all.

65
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,834
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a link to it, but it went nowhere.

66
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:43,735
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, kind of as an overview, in terms of transparency, you know, in some cases, the clerk deals with these things, in other cases, the elections commission does.

67
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:53,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, if you want to look at one, you go into the office and ask.

68
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:59,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed that from what Mr. King said, and it's probably true in the other places,

69
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:09,084
[SPEAKER_03]: that filling these out and having them available is sort of, how do I put it?

70
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:18,952
[SPEAKER_03]: They only sort of rear their heads if somebody suspects something that's a little bit funny.

71
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:25,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise they just sort of, you know, get filed year after year and they just sort of sit there.

72
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:28,379
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases,

73
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:38,631
[SPEAKER_03]: In most cases, it's all candidates and electeds and department heads that are required to complete them.

74
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:47,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Somerville, it's once you're elected, not a candidate, as well as department heads and things.

75
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:52,224
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, boards and commissions are required.

76
00:08:52,244 --> 00:09:03,412
[SPEAKER_03]: In most cases, not unless it was a board or commission that had any sort of permitting or regulatory authority.

77
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:15,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wouldn't be required of the garden commission, but it would be required of the ZBA or the licensing commission or community development or something like that.

78
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,851
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's that's kind of what I got out of my research.

79
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:25,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it answered all of my questions or what.

80
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:28,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Janice.

81
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:30,293
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a lot of information.

82
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,674
[SPEAKER_01]: More you were potentially going to talk to some people, right?

83
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:40,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I had an opportunity to talk to 3 pharma.

84
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:44,436
[SPEAKER_00]: City councils both.

85
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:56,794
[SPEAKER_00]: and one former Planning Mayor, and one former department head of one of the first responders.

86
00:09:57,274 --> 00:10:09,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And they thought what we have on file right now is more than enough for local politics.

87
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And their feeling was it would

88
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:20,060
[SPEAKER_00]: discourage maybe some candidates from running one way or the other.

89
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:34,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So by what's on file, then you mean just what goes to, so candidates

90
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:42,659
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, anybody that's a candidate or elected files their, you know, campaign donations.

91
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes to the city, which in turn goes to OCPF.

92
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:52,525
[SPEAKER_03]: But department heads and things like that, as far as I can figure out.

93
00:10:54,266 --> 00:11:03,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slightly a little different for department heads than it is for elected officials or people, or potential candidates for

94
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:14,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, I'd say council, mayor, school committee, you know, and I believe mayor is different too, but the mayor I spoke to was a plan E mayor.

95
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:28,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, you know, it was kind of like a, you know, they were elected within the body of the council, but they seemed to think it was unnecessary and it possibly would discourage people from running.

96
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:45,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I just, I didn't really talk in depth with the Collins Center about it, but they also felt that it would basically duplicate because state law, this is all, they felt it was covered in state law.

97
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:49,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is the conflict of interest law that covers everything.

98
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:56,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think what we're talking about gives sort of an extra layer of information available to the public.

99
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:08,862
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess, I'm sorry, I'm losing my train of thought.

100
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:11,343
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too hot.

101
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:16,806
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this information that we collected.

102
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:23,130
[SPEAKER_01]: We only found one charter that, and Framingham just,

103
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:32,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Framingham's charter just, I'm trying to remember if it just says that they have to create an ordinance or if it lays out the details.

104
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, I've got it in front of me here.

105
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:47,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Every candidate for mayor, council, school committee, department heads, I'm sort of paraphrasing here, and any other municipal officers as may from time to time be

106
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:55,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Designated by ordinance shall file a statement of financial interest for the preceding year.

107
00:12:55,444 --> 00:13:00,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like they have it laid out there.

108
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I think basically what it's.

109
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:11,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it says framing and ethics reporting requirement and I think, you know, it basically says that if you're.

110
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:18,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a candidate for office, or you're a department head, or some sort of other designated.

111
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,660
[SPEAKER_03]: City official that a.

112
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:36,767
[SPEAKER_03]: an ordinance dictates that you have to file one of these statements of financial interest and that they're filed annually and city clerk manages it all.

113
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:39,928
[SPEAKER_03]: The cliff notes.

114
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:48,191
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, so we see Framingham is the only one that has it in the charter, then we have Boston, Somerville, and Cambridge, and Springfield.

115
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:51,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're all bigger than Medford.

116
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:52,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

117
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:52,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

118
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:53,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Springfield?

119
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:58,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something else to consider.

120
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,481
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all bigger.

121
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville.

122
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:04,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

123
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Springfield's way bigger.

124
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also are seeing this in bigger cities.

125
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:16,194
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still seems like it's an unusual step to take.

126
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:23,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are charged with deciding what to present to the entire committee.

127
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:34,415
[SPEAKER_03]: My feeling, my recommendation, and I think it may differ, is that I would like to see something in the charter.

128
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It could go one of two ways.

129
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:44,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Just simply requiring in a charter that

130
00:14:45,900 --> 00:15:06,161
[SPEAKER_03]: there be that and then we can designate the who part is required annually to fill out a statement of financial interest and submit it to whatever body we decide to, clerk, school, commit, elections, whoever.

131
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:30,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so it would be requiring the statement of financial interest, and we would need to decide the who, candidates or electeds or both, and who from the paid side, you know, full-time paid side, and who would manage it.

132
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,224
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think annually is pretty much a given.

133
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:42,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And just leave it at that and what sort of form, I guess, do they use the state form or.

134
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: If we didn't use the state form, then.

135
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:53,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Would we be dictating the form or with the.

136
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:54,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, uh.

137
00:15:57,352 --> 00:16:01,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Office that we designate to manage this would then have to.

138
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:06,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Decide which form to use state form, or they can they can do the research that we've done and.

139
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:09,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Or alternatively, um.

140
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,853
[SPEAKER_03]: We, and I guess I guess that can be done via.

141
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:22,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, requiring an ordinance that the city council require and.

142
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Establish an ordinance that statements of financial.

143
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:31,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Interest must be done, or we can do it such that.

144
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:57,354
[SPEAKER_03]: We require the city council to establish an ordinance within a certain period of time that will establish an ethics commission that will, you know, manage a code of conduct and a statement of, and, you know, do the statement of financial interest part.

145
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:03,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking through, Somerville has an ethics commission as well.

146
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's basically taken verbatim from Springfield or vice versa.

147
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know which one came first.

148
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:17,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Those could be used as models.

149
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:39,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as Mr. King said, when I talked to him, you know, and I said earlier that, you know, if you recommend something, it doesn't have to be done, you know, and we could put that recommendation in our final report, but, you know, that could go nowhere.

150
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:49,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more of the mind that we require something via the charter regarding ethics.

151
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm, I prefer,

152
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,686
[SPEAKER_03]: The ethics commission part, because I think it's stronger.

153
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:05,399
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'll settle for the statement of financial interest part and I think we need to put into the charter.

154
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:12,233
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we've talked about, it's not our job to invent an ordinance or anything like that.

155
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:22,457
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we need to put in the charter the very basics of what we want that will make them beholden to it.

156
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:33,322
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were to do an ethics commission, then I would want to see that the members cannot be elected officials.

157
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:37,375
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I go, I go back to the Fox guiding the hen house again.

158
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:42,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we can let them decide.

159
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:43,938
[SPEAKER_03]: We can let the city council decide.

160
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I would prefer to put everything in the charter, but that's not what we do.

161
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:54,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we can let them decide a lot, but I think we need to give some bare bones requirements.

162
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:58,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Of things that are kind of, at least in my mind, non negotiable.

163
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:01,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I'm going.

164
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:01,889
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

165
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:02,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Maury, what are your thoughts?

166
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:22,954
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what we originally thought, that just to put something in the charter that the city council, within a certain amount of period, put together an ethics committee or an ethics commission and let them establish the ground rules of what's going on, either to the left or the right with it.

167
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:27,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for us to sit here and dictate, I don't think that's what the charter is.

168
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:38,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the fact that we impose, that the charter imposes a stance that some at the commission or committee must be formed.

169
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:44,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with Eunice, it should not be elected officials or so forth, whether that goes in there or not, I don't know.

170
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:48,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, there's a lot more to ethics than just finance.

171
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:53,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this committee or commission, if there's an internal problem,

172
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:57,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they within departments or regarding ethics?

173
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:01,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that this commission or committee's role also?

174
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,782
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not entirely sure where we're going with this.

175
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:09,386
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big word, Ethics Commission, and it covers a lot of territory.

176
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:16,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, are we going to kind of micromanage it and say, oh, no, we just want to get finances?

177
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's fair myself.

178
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:44,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, you know, I think we need to emphasize that an ordinance, a city council must have an ordinance establishing an ethics commission or committee and let them hash it out on what the rules and regulations and the game and the playing field is for that committee or commission.

179
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:46,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go from there.

180
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, in five years they can review it too.

181
00:20:49,870 --> 00:21:00,415
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I feel like we have to put some, we have to say something about the purpose of such a commission, because as you say, Maury, it can mean anything.

182
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:01,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

183
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:14,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should at least think about the purpose or, you know, I mean, if we just say that it's an ordinance to form an ethics commission, it doesn't mean they're going to do financial statements, which is what we started with.

184
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:16,563
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our, you know, narrow.

185
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

186
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:18,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

187
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:19,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree fully.

188
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:22,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.

189
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:30,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Springfield that requires the city council units to establish an ordinance?

190
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:35,229
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an ordinance.

191
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:38,570
[SPEAKER_00]: The city council formed it and created it, right?

192
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:43,112
[SPEAKER_00]: The charter charged the city council with doing

193
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:44,957
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it didn't.

194
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Establishing the ordinance.

195
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:47,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

196
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just looking at Springfield.

197
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,681
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

198
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:52,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Framingham's the only one that has it in the charter.

199
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:56,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the others are just ordinances, but it's not mentioned in the charter.

200
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:57,908
[SPEAKER_03]: You're correct.

201
00:21:57,948 --> 00:21:59,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.

202
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:00,490
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

203
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:07,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something in the charter pertaining to that would, I'd be in favor of that.

204
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:12,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about the outlines of how far we want to go with it.

205
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:16,673
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you suggesting, Milva?

206
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:18,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not suggesting anything.

207
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:27,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm looking up to see if I can find the, I just want to look at some of the ordinances so we can see.

208
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:30,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think they're all.

209
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I put a lot of stuff in the drive.

210
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:34,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I I don't.

211
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:38,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I I maybe the Springfield ordinance.

212
00:22:39,498 --> 00:22:41,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's in there, maybe.

213
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,081
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Springfield.

214
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,262
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I have questions.

215
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:53,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.

216
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep talking while I look.

217
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the ordinance is in there under Springfield.

218
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's Boston ordinance.

219
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Springfield has its own subfolder.

220
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:12,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

221
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:15,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just, I'm not going to the subcommittee folder.

222
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:16,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking through stuff.

223
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:20,171
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my, uh, okay.

224
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:26,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Springfield ordinates.

225
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:27,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

226
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:33,823
[SPEAKER_01]: The ordinances are relatively detailed.

227
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:41,987
[SPEAKER_03]: There is established a Springfield Ethics Commission composed of three members.

228
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

229
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:46,029
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it right there.

230
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:46,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

231
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,390
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the ordinance.

232
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:54,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see what they say about the, this just lays out the composition.

233
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:59,723
[SPEAKER_01]: How it's run, duties and powers.

234
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:13,206
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like, yeah, so this commission creates the forms.

235
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Make them available for public.

236
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:23,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like they handle, so this way you bypass the city clerk.

237
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:35,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are submitted to the ethics commission.

238
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:48,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So far from what I'm seeing, it's mostly the financial statements, but they also look at

239
00:24:51,832 --> 00:25:02,881
[SPEAKER_01]: policy-making positions, so that's looking at the positions to decide who to send the form to, maybe.

240
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:10,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Publish rules and regulations to carry out this charter, including rules governing the conduct here under.

241
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:17,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Prepare and publish forms and statements, reporting,

242
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,564
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say really anything they do specifically other than the financial statements.

243
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:30,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm skimming it.

244
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:38,635
[SPEAKER_01]: But it looks to me like it's mostly to manage that.

245
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:46,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see anything different, Eunice?

246
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:53,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm looking at something else over here on my desktop about the ordinance.

247
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Purpose of the ethics ordinance.

248
00:25:57,652 --> 00:26:12,221
[SPEAKER_03]: The ethics ordinance establishes a local ethics commission for Springfield and a standard of conduct for city officials and employees as well as candidates and a standard of conduct for municipal agents and the lobbyists.

249
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:14,382
[SPEAKER_03]: They get into a lot of lobby stuff.

250
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:23,501
[SPEAKER_03]: The provisions of the city ethics ordinance supplement the conflict of interest provisions in the state ethics law.

251
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:28,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this seems to go over and above state ethics.

252
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:40,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Provisions are intended to ensure the public's trust and confidence that city officials are not contaminated by personal financial interests.

253
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:50,226
[SPEAKER_03]: MGL, the state ethics law, governs what public officials and employees may do on the job, what they may do after hours or on the side.

254
00:26:50,806 --> 00:27:00,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing in the state ethics law prohibits the city from establishing and enforcing additional standards of conduct.

255
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:10,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Rule of Ethics Commission, pretty much everything that you require, you know, we talked about inspects all statements of financial interest,

256
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:15,545
[SPEAKER_03]: How are members appointed?

257
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:16,826
[SPEAKER_03]: How long do they serve?

258
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:26,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Vacancy, commission governed, reporting requirements, staff, to whom does this ordinance apply?

259
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:34,114
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you got a great point, Maury, about ethics being more than finance.

260
00:27:41,378 --> 00:28:07,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to think, you know, I mean, the only thing that kind of comes to mind would be, you know, any sort of sexual misconduct would probably, would possibly come under ethics, or maybe that goes, I mean, that's clearly, you know, oh, if it's two sort of consenting adults, it's not necessarily criminal, but it could be ethical.

261
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:18,158
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, things are escaping me now, but yeah, there were other things besides finance that would come under ethics.

262
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:28,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have already a provision that if someone's convicted of a felony, they're automatically, well, that's for electeds, they're automatically vacated from their office.

263
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:29,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

264
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:40,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of criminal activity, I feel like, you know, this ethics commission can't really do anything about that.

265
00:28:41,577 --> 00:28:54,124
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but what about some sort of relationship where it's an inappropriate balance of power, a manager and a subordinate?

266
00:28:54,184 --> 00:29:01,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess what I'm concerned about is, let's say an ethics commission gets created.

267
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:06,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I assume we're talking about appointed volunteers.

268
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:12,743
[SPEAKER_01]: that have to make these kinds of judgments about people.

269
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:13,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

270
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:22,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I feel like that's, you know, that's getting into some, you know, I mean,

271
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a financial statement is a financial statement.

272
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:28,794
[SPEAKER_01]: It's straightforward.

273
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:30,694
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill out the form.

274
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:36,355
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if there's conflicts of interest, there's conflicts of interest or there isn't.

275
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:49,538
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't fall under the state ethics law, I mean, the state conflict of interest law, then nobody can really do anything about it, but the information is available to the voters, basically.

276
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:52,659
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I look at it.

277
00:29:55,531 --> 00:30:11,235
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know, I feel like we're getting into, I feel like an ethics commission, I mean, even if we put it in the charter, the city council would be writing the ordinance and they would define the role of the ethics commission, so.

278
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:14,296
[SPEAKER_03]: True, and they're gonna do the same research that we just did.

279
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:16,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and again.

280
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,718
[SPEAKER_00]: You hope they are.

281
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:23,679
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this ethics, I keep thinking, what is this ethics commission gonna do?

282
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,052
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree in that, and I don't think that's our place to come up and define it.

283
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:41,877
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the recommendation of it in the charter, asking the city council to do it, and let the owners fall on them, and who's going to be responsible.

284
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:49,560
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of course is going to say, I don't have time to watch this, I don't have enough staff in my office, and they're all going to pass the buck.

285
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:55,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's just, to me, it's a tough one.

286
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:58,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand where we're going with it.

287
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:02,005
[SPEAKER_00]: The state seems to cover all of it pretty good.

288
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:04,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, what are you gonna have?

289
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:11,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone that's on city time and he's at, someone's doing some work in a personal home, is that an ethics thing?

290
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:15,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the city equipment on private property.

291
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:19,653
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a boatload of stuff this could be.

292
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:26,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess, you know, looking at it and things that I've, you know, heard and talking to a couple of people is.

293
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:33,475
[SPEAKER_03]: People with some sort of interest in, you know, some of the development that's.

294
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:39,399
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in the pipeline here in Medford, so that would be in the financial statements though.

295
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:39,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

296
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:40,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

297
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:41,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That would come up, you know, right.

298
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:49,602
[SPEAKER_03]: if they're either, I don't know about campaign contributions, but- That's a whole different thing.

299
00:31:49,662 --> 00:31:51,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Campaign contributions, they are what they are.

300
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:56,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be- They're reported already on campaign fans.

301
00:31:56,587 --> 00:31:58,949
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a limit of what you can do and all that.

302
00:31:59,009 --> 00:31:59,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

303
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's $500, so it's not an exorbitant amount of money.

304
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:11,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the idea of an ethics commission sounds really good, but I just feel like it's sort of like very amorphous.

305
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:26,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you know, if we go back to what we started with was to discuss whether or not we were going to require these financial statements, I feel like that's... And the reason that we were considering it was transparency.

306
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:29,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, you would just have

307
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:47,700
[SPEAKER_01]: financial statements that would be made available to the public if they wanted to see it, and whoever reviews them, whether it's a clerk or an ethics commission, if there's a violation of the State Conflict of Interest Law, they immediately have to report it to the AG.

308
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:58,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody's going to put a violation of the State Conflict of Interest Law on one of these statements, but... If somebody wants to hide something, they will.

309
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:11,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but, you know, so really, to me, what we go back to, this would be just more information that we'd be making available to the public.

310
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:27,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I feel, like, comfortable saying in the charter that they have to form an ethics commission without really saying what it is or what it's for, unless it's for this specific purpose and that's what it exists for.

311
00:33:29,185 --> 00:33:29,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

312
00:33:30,346 --> 00:33:31,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it does.

313
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:35,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we can't tell them to do something without defining a purpose for it.

314
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:43,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the statement of financial interest, as you said, is, you know, pretty cut and dry.

315
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:46,138
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you require.

316
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:53,744
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cut and dry, except, so, Framingham put the whole thing in their charter, and that's probably why they use the state form, because

317
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:58,716
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, what are they going to do, create a form and put the form in the charter?

318
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:03,217
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so they use, they said use this form because it's available.

319
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:06,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but that doesn't work so well.

320
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,039
[SPEAKER_01]: For their purpose.

321
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they put it in, they have the requirement via ordinance.

322
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:15,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It's.

323
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:18,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could have, yeah, so they could have changed it in the ordinance.

324
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:21,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they had more details in their charter, but.

325
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:23,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

326
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:36,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, if it was going to just be the clerk, I don't think we could make the clerk create a form.

327
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:41,092
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

328
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:45,195
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really know where Cambridge, how they originated their form.

329
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:51,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm still hoping and maybe I'll try again, see if I can reach out to a couple of these.

330
00:34:57,212 --> 00:35:00,753
[SPEAKER_03]: people now that we're talking things through a little bit more.

331
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:09,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we need to bring something to the committee for August 1st, and let's see where the whole committee is.

332
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:14,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the committee is going to vote it down, then there's no point in going further.

333
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:20,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the other hand, if we had more information, to be persuasive in one way or another.

334
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:22,378
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean more information?

335
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:22,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

336
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:23,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So what other information?

337
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:30,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have to already, we have to consolidate something to bring to the whole committee.

338
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:38,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can do is we can say we're making a recommendation.

339
00:35:38,174 --> 00:35:41,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what you just said, Eunice, we can make a recommendation that

340
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:57,035
[SPEAKER_01]: The charter require that an ordinance be created to, that would, you know, that required, I mean, it's going to sound a little more eloquent than this, but to require annual statements of financial interest.

341
00:35:57,495 --> 00:36:03,078
[SPEAKER_01]: The other option is the Ethics Commission to administer annual statements of financial interest.

342
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Requiring that be formed by ordinance.

343
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:13,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't really have any other options for the charter, right?

344
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:22,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're not going to put the whole form in the charter and the whole process in the charter.

345
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:29,569
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think, well, if the only purpose of the ethics commission is to, you know,

346
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:34,583
[SPEAKER_03]: manage these forms, then.

347
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:37,085
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be just taking it out of the city clerk's hands.

348
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:39,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

349
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:44,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gives, you know, going back to what we said about, okay, so we established an ethics commission.

350
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,691
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this thing supposed to do?

351
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:55,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And if this, you know, entity is, you know, purpose is to administer the statement of financial interest, then that's great.

352
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:57,698
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives them a reason to exist.

353
00:36:58,678 --> 00:37:01,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then they can figure out, um,

354
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:13,635
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what what kind of form to to use and, you know, I mean, they'll do the research that we have is more.

355
00:37:13,675 --> 00:37:14,816
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, maybe, maybe not.

356
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:16,937
[SPEAKER_01]: They might use the state form.

357
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:21,519
[SPEAKER_01]: They might create like, a 1 pager that doesn't really give much information.

358
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:23,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what they would do.

359
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:33,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think if, if the ethics commission, if it's left up to, well, it also depends on what they put in the ordinance.

360
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:34,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

361
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:44,500
[SPEAKER_03]: And also I think who makes up the commission, if the commission is, you know, citizens, then there might be a bit more effort.

362
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:50,243
[SPEAKER_03]: To maybe, maybe not, I don't know.

363
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:53,285
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm thinking that maybe, you know,

364
00:37:54,324 --> 00:38:12,216
[SPEAKER_03]: If the electeds were to come up with the form, they may make it very, very bare bones so as not to discourage candidates and not to have to reveal too much, leaving the possibility for.

365
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,881
[SPEAKER_03]: untoward activity.

366
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:21,687
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have to reveal much, then there's more of a chance you could do something that's not on the up-and-up.

367
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:22,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're right.

368
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:28,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we say not on the up-and-up, we might not even be talking, I mean, what are we talking about?

369
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:33,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Because something's not on the up-and-up, you're talking about something illegal, right?

370
00:38:33,797 --> 00:38:37,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Illegal or just, you know, a little hinky.

371
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:51,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right, because there are maybe certain things that are not illegal and that don't violate the state conflict of interest law, but that some people might say, well, look, he has a financial interest in that.

372
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:52,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's cool.

373
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:58,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I keep going back to is that's all we would be doing.

374
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:04,189
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the only people that are going to see these are people who go to City Hall to look at them.

375
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:12,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, if somebody feels like, you know, if they've heard wind of somebody doing something that

376
00:39:13,422 --> 00:39:37,535
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, is even bad optics, then, you know, maybe not illegal, maybe not immoral, but just bad optics, then they can go down to, you know, City Hall, pull the form, you know, and blast it all over Facebook for all to see, you know, which is certainly perfectly okay.

377
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:58,025
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, I guess what I think is we should just go to the committee on August 1st and, you know, talk a little bit, you know, like five minutes about the research that we did, say that these are the communities that have, that, you know, Framingham has it in their charter.

378
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:07,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only other, the only communities that we found, Avedon, Springfield, Boston, Framingham,

379
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:14,624
[SPEAKER_01]: and Somerville and Framingham is the only one that has it in their charter.

380
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:33,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we did consider putting it in our charter, it would be in the form of a requirement that the city council create an ordinance to either create an ethics commission to oversee an annual financial state statement of financial interest or

381
00:40:35,305 --> 00:40:44,468
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates, elected officials, and or department heads, or that they create an ordinance that creates an ethics commission to do that.

382
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:54,711
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just maybe ask the committee to vote on who would be in favor of that and to find out.

383
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:58,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they vote in favor of it, then we'll sort of zero in.

384
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:02,554
[SPEAKER_01]: The Collins Center will be there and they'll be able to, I mean,

385
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:16,710
[SPEAKER_01]: If we did put it in the chart and we asked them to help us draft it, there's not standard language for it because it's not in charters, but they could probably come up with something.

386
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:21,754
[SPEAKER_01]: You did say that you talked briefly to them about it and what did they say?

387
00:41:21,774 --> 00:41:26,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we emailed about it and I asked them and they just said they think it would duplicate state law.

388
00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:38,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I just kind of go back to and I don't know state well, well enough.

389
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:42,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess that's, you know, my fault, but.

390
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:46,582
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't know why.

391
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:54,371
[SPEAKER_03]: 99% of the charters don't have this, maybe because they feel like it duplicates state law.

392
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:59,175
[SPEAKER_03]: But why is it that a handful of charters do have it?

393
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:07,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they feel like state law is deficient in some way in what they're trying to do?

394
00:42:07,803 --> 00:42:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

395
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:11,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when you talk to Mr. King, is that his name?

396
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:13,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't.

397
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:13,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

398
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:21,247
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, since it's in bigger cities, like I'm guessing like in Boston or Cambridge, maybe that has something to do with it.

399
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:35,972
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, could be more also people are, you know, it's less, I mean, when you look at even Somerville, like the bigger cities, I mean, these are actual, not to say that their elected officials have more power, but they're,

400
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:39,016
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're more high-powered positions.

401
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:42,697
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pulling big salaries.

402
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:48,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot more commercial development in the cities.

403
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:54,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be that maybe they feel like the potential for that is greater.

404
00:42:54,581 --> 00:42:59,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, here in Medford, you know, our elected officials

405
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:03,550
[SPEAKER_01]: they're part-time other than the mayor.

406
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,791
[SPEAKER_01]: They're part-time, they're not pulling a full-time salary.

407
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:18,273
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had questions about the developments and I feel like that's the biggest.

408
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:22,714
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at this issue of financial statements, that's the biggest thing that we're wondering about.

409
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:32,340
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody's pushing for development, is there a reason?

410
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they have a family member or something like that.

411
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:42,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's really what we would be trying to get at with this.

412
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:51,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, if you look at the department heads, I don't know, the superintendent, what would be

413
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:59,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that the superintendent would have some stops and some testing company or something, you know, that they were pushing.

414
00:43:59,126 --> 00:43:59,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

415
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:03,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we would just be looking at that kind of thing.

416
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:06,172
[SPEAKER_03]: The other 1.

417
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:09,815
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, not only is it to me, the city.

418
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:28,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm less worried about candidates so far, more about people who are actually sitting, but I'm also actually concerned about some of the boards requiring boards that have regulatory or permitting authority like the ZBA,

419
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:50,921
[SPEAKER_03]: community development board, licensing commission, liquor licenses, and so forth.

420
00:44:53,843 --> 00:45:01,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's also a place where some funny stuff could happen.

421
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:11,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you're saying the Ethics Commission, the reports could potentially include more than just, I mean, to me, if you're going to do it for electives, you do it for candidates.

422
00:45:13,063 --> 00:45:27,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, because if, you know, if you're trying to decide who to vote for and this is a potential tool to help decide that,

423
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:36,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're elected and they fill out their financial interest form, there's not really anything you can do about it.

424
00:45:36,578 --> 00:45:50,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to what you're saying, Melva, about how a lot of these communities are bigger than us, I'm looking at the Medford comparables that Collins Center gave us.

425
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:59,121
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have the 2020 population here, you know, now we're sitting smack dab in the middle of 2024.

426
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:01,922
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a set 58,000 people.

427
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:04,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I think we're more about 60.

428
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:05,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in the 60s.

429
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:11,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, so we're.

430
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,251
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're at 60.

431
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,572
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't from the call-in center, by the way.

432
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:24,055
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something that I created that I pulled from something I found on the Somerville charter.

433
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:27,156
[SPEAKER_01]: They must have had one of their staff members put that together.

434
00:46:27,176 --> 00:46:31,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to update it as much as I could, but that's where I got it.

435
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:32,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

436
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you then.

437
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:35,560
[SPEAKER_03]: God love you for doing that.

438
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,281
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, there's not that many.

439
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:39,762
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're over 60 now,

440
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:44,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

441
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Somerville's like in the 80s, I think.

442
00:46:48,302 --> 00:46:53,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville is, and again, this is 2020, so they're at 81.

443
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge has got to have more people than that.

444
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,752
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest in size is probably Framingham.

445
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:09,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, two-ish, maybe they're at 75 by now, who knows?

446
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know, they're probably the closest to us.

447
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:19,415
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like the others are, you know, pretty much, pretty, you know, significantly bigger.

448
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:30,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, they have more industry and business, you know, going on.

449
00:47:31,403 --> 00:47:34,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Cambridge has that's why their taxes are so.

450
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:41,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, but, I mean, well, I guess some of the future try to commission can address it.

451
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:42,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, where are we going?

452
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:44,317
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going larger.

453
00:47:44,337 --> 00:47:45,158
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, you know.

454
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:50,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we'd have to, I don't know how much more congested we're going to get.

455
00:47:50,296 --> 00:47:51,097
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.

456
00:47:51,297 --> 00:48:04,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if Mystic Avenue comes up with housing, if whatever's happening, I think what was it with the air rights over Wellington where there's some big development that's percolating.

457
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,631
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another 450 units I think going up.

458
00:48:12,096 --> 00:48:14,757
[SPEAKER_03]: On Mystic Valley Parkway down just past Wegmans.

459
00:48:16,718 --> 00:48:19,519
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another 300 units going up on the Fellsway.

460
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,541
[SPEAKER_03]: In another five years, we could be at 70.

461
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:25,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we could.

462
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:26,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

463
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:34,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if other communities are growing exponentially as well.

464
00:48:39,457 --> 00:48:47,259
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and it, I don't know where we're going with the biotech stuff and things, you know, but industry coming in, whatever else.

465
00:48:47,279 --> 00:48:48,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, you know, we're changing.

466
00:48:50,039 --> 00:49:00,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, what we put in the charter should address and, and this charter, you know, first of all, we're not done.

467
00:49:00,122 --> 00:49:04,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, even when we are done in three months, it could be, you know,

468
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:10,131
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple of, two, three years before this thing sees the light of day.

469
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:12,252
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be.

470
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:17,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would be 2027, I think.

471
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:19,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this have to go on a single ballot or anything?

472
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:24,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm saying with the, no, I take that back, not with the whole charter.

473
00:49:25,415 --> 00:49:29,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the election, like any new charter would affect the election of 2020s.

474
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:42,047
[SPEAKER_01]: But other things that aren't election related, like the composition of elected bodies might get put in before that.

475
00:49:42,527 --> 00:49:42,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

476
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:45,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, where are we five years from now?

477
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,910
[SPEAKER_03]: We could be a whole different ballgame.

478
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:49,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

479
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:53,333
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we said five years for the first charter review.

480
00:49:53,853 --> 00:49:54,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

481
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So Eunice, will you

482
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:05,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, first of all, how do you feel, how do you all feel about this idea of just taking it to the committee on August 1st and saying.

483
00:50:06,647 --> 00:50:10,971
[SPEAKER_01]: These are our options, which are really only 2, which is to.

484
00:50:13,453 --> 00:50:14,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it, you know, just put in.

485
00:50:16,669 --> 00:50:44,183
[SPEAKER_01]: a requirement that an ordinance be written to require annual or you would say annual statements of financial interest would be required, the administration of which will be detailed by ordinance or something like that, or an ethics commission will be created to administer this by ordinance.

486
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:46,459
[SPEAKER_01]: and just see where that is.

487
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:53,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say if people decide they want an ethics commission, then I would probably want to put a few more details in about it.

488
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:57,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying to bring both of those options to the committee?

489
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because the only other option is not to do it.

490
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:03,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

491
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:03,895
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

492
00:51:04,276 --> 00:51:05,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Something has to go in the charter.

493
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:18,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, that's why we want to bring that to the committee and see, because if the committee votes no, we don't want to put that in the charter, then that's where we are.

494
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

495
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that we've met, discussed this.

496
00:51:23,973 --> 00:51:29,977
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two or three different options we have that we want to bring back to the committee.

497
00:51:31,378 --> 00:51:32,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have some discussion on it.

498
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:34,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you want to go with it?

499
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:41,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we have enough, I think we've collected enough information that if people have questions we'll have, you know, answers.

500
00:51:41,854 --> 00:51:43,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

501
00:51:44,655 --> 00:51:54,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I don't want to take up too much time with it, like I'm thinking I'm going to budget 20 minutes and then maybe we'll only use 30.

502
00:51:55,749 --> 00:51:56,631
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't say that.

503
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:58,974
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the way to do it.

504
00:51:59,014 --> 00:51:59,634
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll move on.

505
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:00,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

506
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:02,758
[SPEAKER_03]: God love you, Milva.

507
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:07,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wrote... I'll make a motion for you, Milva, to end the conversation.

508
00:52:07,985 --> 00:52:08,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

509
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:10,268
[SPEAKER_01]: You always make sure we are all heard.

510
00:52:12,425 --> 00:52:14,366
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important thing for everybody.

511
00:52:15,746 --> 00:52:16,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

512
00:52:16,306 --> 00:52:19,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So Eunice, will you do that?

513
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:24,949
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just sort of present it to the committee in a nutshell, say.

514
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:35,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can think about like how, you know, how you want to spend no more than, I mean, actually three minutes doesn't sound like a lot, but it's actually a lot of information you can relay in three minutes.

515
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:38,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you repeat?

516
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're going to put this in the minutes, but.

517
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

518
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:58,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to sort of say that after research, this is what we discovered, you know, and, and maybe just say what the aim of the, you know, a financial statement would go above and beyond.

519
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:01,350
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the options that we came up with.

520
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are, yeah.

521
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, there are two, there's two possibilities.

522
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:06,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

523
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:18,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what people would be voting on then is, do we want to put such an ethics requirement in the charter?

524
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they say yes, then we can work out VJs.

525
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:29,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically- So you got to make your case.

526
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

527
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically my presentation, you know, and maybe what I'll do is, oh, I don't know.

528
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:42,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we don't want another meeting, but, um, uh, Of this committee.

529
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:47,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if, if, if it turns out that they want, that they want it, then maybe we could have another meeting.

530
00:53:48,608 --> 00:53:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I'm thinking between now and August 1st.

531
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Oh, what, what did you think of that you wanted to accomplish?

532
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, trying to.

533
00:53:57,422 --> 00:54:07,268
[SPEAKER_03]: put the, you know, put a presentation in my head and then finally put it down on paper and make sure it's something that we three are, you know, in agreement on.

534
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:08,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fine.

535
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,111
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think what, I don't know.

536
00:54:11,491 --> 00:54:12,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fine too.

537
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:12,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

538
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:12,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

539
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:14,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you, whatever you say.

540
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:15,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

541
00:54:15,574 --> 00:54:18,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's the whole committee is going to vote on it anyway.

542
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:18,395
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

543
00:54:18,495 --> 00:54:25,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically my presentation to the full group would be basically what I just said to you guys at

544
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,221
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 a.m.

545
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:27,182
[SPEAKER_03]: when we started out.

546
00:54:27,282 --> 00:54:27,842
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

547
00:54:27,922 --> 00:54:30,965
[SPEAKER_00]: It would include all of our discussion, not just what you all know.

548
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:31,326
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.

549
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:31,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

550
00:54:31,766 --> 00:54:32,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

551
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:43,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And just say that the subcommittee just wanted to take, you know, just take the question back to the whole committee that we didn't necessarily we didn't because we didn't vote on it.

552
00:54:43,338 --> 00:54:47,262
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just saying, you know, we think that this is something that the whole committee should look at.

553
00:54:47,362 --> 00:54:49,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're presenting the information.

554
00:54:50,770 --> 00:55:00,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question, the underlying question is, do we want to put something regarding ethics in the charter?

555
00:55:00,975 --> 00:55:06,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, do we want to say it that way, or do we want to just focus on the financial state?

556
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like Maury said, ethics is a big word.

557
00:55:12,121 --> 00:55:12,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

558
00:55:12,461 --> 00:55:13,102
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I mean.

559
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:18,689
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also like it's vague and include anything, right?

560
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:21,971
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I feel like.

561
00:55:23,652 --> 00:55:25,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be if, you know.

562
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:31,322
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I feel like we should just focus on the thing that we started focusing on.

563
00:55:31,342 --> 00:55:44,518
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to put something in just pertaining to financial disclosure for all candidates and department heads are required to fill out form X, Y, and Z.

564
00:55:46,528 --> 00:55:59,551
[SPEAKER_01]: on file, you know, because if, if the committee finances, if the committee says, yeah, we want to do this annual financial statement and we think the ethics commission is the best way to do it.

565
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:16,075
[SPEAKER_01]: The charter can say something like, um, an ordinance to establish an ethics committee to administer, uh, the, you know, annual statements of financial interest and any such other issues that, you know,

566
00:56:17,737 --> 00:56:20,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the question is to.

567
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:28,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The underlying question is, do we want to put something about a statement of financial disclosure in the charter and.

568
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:34,240
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be done by including in the charter.

569
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,721
[SPEAKER_03]: The requirement to establish an ordinance, the requirement by.

570
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:46,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I think it would be done that way or the CC to establish an ordinance.

571
00:56:48,473 --> 00:56:49,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't spell.

572
00:56:51,194 --> 00:56:53,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Ordinance, which would.

573
00:56:54,456 --> 00:57:00,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the administering body would either be the city clerk or an ethics commission created by ordinance.

574
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:09,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said Springfield has an ethics commission.

575
00:57:10,123 --> 00:57:15,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Somerville, do we know if they handle the forms?

576
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:15,686
[SPEAKER_01]: They must.

577
00:57:18,578 --> 00:57:19,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

578
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:26,327
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you know, because we know that in Springfield Ethics Commission does it in Framingham, it's a city clerk.

579
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:38,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville Ethics.

580
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:52,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Ethics commission composed of five members, two members appointed by mayor, one's a new and the elections commissioner.

581
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:55,428
[SPEAKER_03]: No member of the commission shall receive compensation.

582
00:57:55,448 --> 00:57:57,669
[SPEAKER_03]: No member shall hold office.

583
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it's part of the election.

584
00:58:02,953 --> 00:58:05,315
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically part of the election commissioner's job.

585
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:06,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

586
00:58:06,636 --> 00:58:08,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Ethics commission duties.

587
00:58:11,903 --> 00:58:14,744
[SPEAKER_03]: shall prepare and publish rules, forms?

588
00:58:19,586 --> 00:58:32,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, if we did it, I don't think there would really be, I think an ethics commission would almost be required to create a form unless the city council creates a form.

589
00:58:34,591 --> 00:58:38,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think the state form,

590
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:46,861
[SPEAKER_01]: is onerous and also, as we've heard, it's not really appropriate for this particular, so.

591
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:59,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the Cambridge form that I looked at, I couldn't find any of the other forms online, and that's why I tried to get in touch with Springfield and didn't get anywhere.

592
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:07,428
[SPEAKER_03]: The odd thing about Springfield is that you cannot find an email for the city clerk.

593
00:59:09,055 --> 00:59:12,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't find many emails online.

594
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:17,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I did find an email in the ethics commission for the clerk.

595
00:59:17,782 --> 00:59:23,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I Googled the guy, turns out that he's like, you know, retired years ago.

596
00:59:25,727 --> 00:59:41,931
[SPEAKER_03]: When I Googled City Clerk in Springfield, I found the name of who seems to be serving now, a woman, and then I looked for other e-mails in Springfield and just used the same naming convention.

597
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:46,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, municipal websites are notorious for being not.

598
00:59:52,995 --> 01:00:02,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to keep up with the technology and redo websites and all that requires time, it requires money.

599
01:00:03,984 --> 01:00:08,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of municipal websites just aren't necessarily up to speed.

600
01:00:08,528 --> 01:00:10,010
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be why.

601
01:00:10,585 --> 01:00:10,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

602
01:00:10,865 --> 01:00:13,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyhow, so I didn't, I didn't get too far with either of them.

603
01:00:13,886 --> 01:00:28,049
[SPEAKER_03]: So I couldn't, the only form that I could find online was Cambridge and it was only five pages and it was pretty specific that, you know, it's anybody, you know, if you have any financial interests, you know, with anybody doing business with Cambridge.

604
01:00:28,849 --> 01:00:29,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

605
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:31,629
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's, yeah.

606
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:39,251
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, that's what we would be concerned about, but it's also not just with Cambridge, but like with Medford, it's,

607
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:48,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, because some of the developers that were worried about it might not be in Medford, you know, based in Medford.

608
01:00:48,783 --> 01:00:51,006
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but they're doing business doing business.

609
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:53,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so that's what with Medford.

610
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:58,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so, in other words, you know, if you're working for, you know, whatever, you know.

611
01:01:01,613 --> 01:01:07,556
[SPEAKER_03]: widgets incorporated based in Foxborough that has absolutely nothing to do with Medford.

612
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:08,736
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to report that.

613
01:01:09,257 --> 01:01:13,198
[SPEAKER_03]: But if widgets incorporated has something before a Medford body.

614
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:21,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Cambridge's form also include if you have an immediate family member that has an interest in that?

615
01:01:21,622 --> 01:01:22,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it does, yeah.

616
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:25,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that would make a difference because otherwise, you know.

617
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:26,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

618
01:01:27,485 --> 01:01:28,706
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, you know,

619
01:01:30,763 --> 01:01:34,506
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interest is in a different way than the state form is.

620
01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:45,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it sounds like it's a little more useful for, because even if you had those state forms on file in the city clerk's office, they're not that easy to go through.

621
01:01:45,514 --> 01:01:46,715
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very long.

622
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:55,342
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to reference a shorter form that's more specific and targeted anyway.

623
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:57,924
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier for people to look at it.

624
01:01:59,010 --> 01:01:59,670
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier.

625
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:06,053
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better information for residents, which is what we're going for.

626
01:02:06,854 --> 01:02:07,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

627
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:09,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we want transparency for all.

628
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:32,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So so the the underlying question is, I'm kind of thinking this too, so I can, you know, talk about something intelligently is, you know, that do we want to put something, you know, in the charter that requires statements of financial disclosure and that would then in order to implement that.

629
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:42,854
[SPEAKER_03]: then that would require the city council to establish an ordinance that would require that.

630
01:02:42,914 --> 01:02:51,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that would be administered either by the clerk or the elections commission, as I think we saw could be done by them too.

631
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:58,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I would less put it with the elections because the elections is about, people already submit their,

632
01:03:00,682 --> 01:03:04,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's say you want to say you have a financial interest in a developer.

633
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:05,485
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really elections.

634
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:06,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?

635
01:03:06,045 --> 01:03:06,666
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's true.

636
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:12,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we already have the people submitting their campaign finance reports.

637
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:14,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are readily accessible to people.

638
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

639
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.

640
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:20,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I couldn't figure out why the Elections Commission was working with this stuff either.

641
01:03:21,095 --> 01:03:27,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would either be the clerk or an ethics commission that would be established

642
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, also by ordinance.

643
01:03:31,325 --> 01:03:31,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

644
01:03:32,326 --> 01:03:43,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we can send think about, like, I mean, we have a lot of material where we're not going to send it people already have the charter that they're reading that and the call and center memo.

645
01:03:43,557 --> 01:03:45,179
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to send out a couple of.

646
01:03:48,297 --> 01:03:59,764
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, documents that you ask people to look at beforehand, like maybe the Cambridge form or maybe, you know, even the Springfield Ethics Commission document was pretty long too.

647
01:03:59,804 --> 01:04:08,030
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I'm just saying if you feel like that there's something that people should, you know, that would help people if they looked at it beforehand.

648
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:18,795
[SPEAKER_01]: just tell me and when I send an email about the mass meeting, I'll include it as an attachment as materials for the meeting.

649
01:04:18,815 --> 01:04:19,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

650
01:04:20,937 --> 01:04:21,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

651
01:04:21,498 --> 01:04:21,818
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

652
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:26,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading the final charter and I'm sure Maury is too.

653
01:04:26,502 --> 01:04:26,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

654
01:04:29,004 --> 01:04:35,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I've committed to doing an article every couple of days for the next few weeks.

655
01:04:36,325 --> 01:04:39,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm just anticipating people would be like, well, what's going to be in this form?

656
01:04:40,028 --> 01:04:41,209
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they going to be asked?

657
01:04:41,309 --> 01:04:42,010
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of thing.

658
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:44,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this might be helpful.

659
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:48,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that people are going to have much time to look at it, but they might.

660
01:04:48,415 --> 01:04:50,717
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who are actually curious might.

661
01:04:51,217 --> 01:04:53,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

662
01:04:53,900 --> 01:05:00,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the presentation basically is, do we want to put something in about statement of financial disclosure?

663
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:11,526
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, that requires the city council to establish an ordinance and then the administration of it would either be via the clerk or the establishment of an ethics commission.

664
01:05:12,086 --> 01:05:22,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think a lot of our discussion, you know, over the last hour has talked about, you know, the ethics commission and what, what would it do?

665
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:29,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, sort of summarizing that, you know,

666
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:38,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for our purposes in the charter, we would basically just say the ethics commission would oversee the financial statements, right?

667
01:05:41,963 --> 01:05:43,584
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be created by ordinance.

668
01:05:43,864 --> 01:05:55,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So theoretically, the ordinance could say, like I said, if the charter said to administer the annual financial statements and any such other issues,

669
01:05:56,043 --> 01:06:00,925
[SPEAKER_01]: deemed relevant, you know, as instructed by ordinance or something.

670
01:06:01,785 --> 01:06:04,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it could be broader if you did it that way.

671
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:12,190
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like we're mostly, for our purposes now, for this committee, we're mostly focusing on the financial statements.

672
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:14,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

673
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:18,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this ethics commission can be formed without the charter, right, you know?

674
01:06:18,352 --> 01:06:24,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think, you know, if we want the financial statements, you know, we have to,

675
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that we want done has to go in the charter.

676
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:32,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it's optional for the city council.

677
01:06:32,704 --> 01:06:32,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

678
01:06:33,324 --> 01:06:33,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

679
01:06:34,565 --> 01:06:39,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We can just recommend it.

680
01:06:39,147 --> 01:06:41,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes sense.

681
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:42,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you all agree?

682
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:43,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

683
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:44,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

684
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:53,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Eunice, I'll send out minutes and you send me anything that you want the committee to get as materials.

685
01:06:55,014 --> 01:06:59,077
[SPEAKER_01]: before the meeting on the first.

686
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:00,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

687
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:03,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so send it to you a few days before that.

688
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:06,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I'll send it out to them.

689
01:07:06,763 --> 01:07:08,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have about two weeks to play around.

690
01:07:09,966 --> 01:07:10,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
