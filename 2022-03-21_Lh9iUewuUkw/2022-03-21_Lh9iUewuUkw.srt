00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,790

51
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:47,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, school committee members.

52
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:54,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So good evening, this is your proud superintendent sharing some updates for the week.

53
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,821
[SPEAKER_05]: For the previous two weeks that we haven't met the past two weeks.

54
00:04:58,822 --> 00:04:59,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So we meet tonight.

55
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:02,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, March 31.

56
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:07,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And today is World Down Syndrome Awareness Day.

57
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:17,233
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a global awareness day officially observed by both the United Nations and the World Health Organization.

58
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:30,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, being the 21st of the third month, it was selected to signify the uniqueness of the trisomy of the 21st chromosome, which causes down syndrome.

59
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:37,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The theme this year, which is selected by the United Nations is hashtag inclusion means.

60
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:50,737
[SPEAKER_05]: which empowers everyone to be able to advocate for equal rights for people with Down syndrome and reach out to stakeholders to bring about positive change.

61
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:54,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is being recognized globally today.

62
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:02,906
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I had shared in my communication last Friday, you can wear a brightly colored top.

63
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:07,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wearing a multicolored necklace and I have different socks on my feet.

64
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:12,633
[SPEAKER_05]: in support in collaboration of those who have down syndrome.

65
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:22,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, the theme of this year was inclusion means, and just for us to be able to take a moment to reflect on what does inclusion mean to us.

66
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:29,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

67
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:40,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wanted to share with our community that our parents and caregivers, this is an important announcement regarding your tax credits.

68
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:58,310
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't normally file a tax return, but you're eligible for the child tax credit, you can still claim the child tax credit on your 21 tax return, even if you had no income during the entire year of 2021.

69
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:07,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were advanced payments that were made in 2021, but they were not the full amount of the credit.

70
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:12,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 2021 child tax credit is 3600 for each qualifying child under the age of six.

71
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:22,401
[SPEAKER_05]: and 3000 for each child between the ages of six and 17.

72
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:34,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So for further information, you can go to the IRS website, which is irs.gov slash child tax credit for more information.

73
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:39,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to celebrate today, one of our students, Valentina Burke.

74
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:46,416
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a fifth grader at the Miss attack school, and she is the student who created the new logo.

75
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:50,821
[SPEAKER_05]: She was interviewed by the network transcript.

76
00:07:51,722 --> 00:08:06,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Her design was voted the favorite by students, teachers, and parents of about 50 who submitted 50 submissions to the art teacher as part of a competition to fashion a symbol for the school.

77
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:11,105
[SPEAKER_05]: The design evokes the endless flow of water.

78
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,008
[SPEAKER_05]: The color speaks of serenity.

79
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:19,774
[SPEAKER_05]: The words embody the ethos of the newly named Missittuck School.

80
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:24,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Respectful, responsible, and safe.

81
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Students voted blind.

82
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:34,602
[SPEAKER_05]: The names of the artists were replaced by a letter, so that no one knowingly voted for a friend's submission.

83
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:37,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Even parents had a say.

84
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:42,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Kaye said Valentina was so surprised to hear her name.

85
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Valentina was assisted by her art teacher, Ms.

86
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Maseka, and Mr. Platti.

87
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:50,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, Valentina.

88
00:08:51,862 --> 00:09:01,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'd like to recognize some students who have been outstanding winter athletes, and they are our GBL All-Stars for the winter season.

[SPEAKER_05]: I want to just recognize that Medford is continuing to show support for Ukraine.

115
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:11,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Last Friday, the McGlynn Middle School CCSR students led the school in wearing blue and yellow in an effort of solidarity with Ukraine.

116
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:20,566
[SPEAKER_05]: The students collected items that will be shipped to refugee organizations on the ground in Ukraine and Romania.

117
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:29,493
[SPEAKER_05]: These items included bandages, gauze, ibuprofen, flashlights, toothpaste, and toothbrushes.

121
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:55,081
[SPEAKER_05]: We are proud of our Mustang students seeing a need and extending their hands to help.

122
00:12:56,867 --> 00:13:05,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, this Wednesday, March 23rd, is School Crossing Guard Appreciation Day in Massachusetts.

125
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

126
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

127
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:32,214
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a budget update, Mr. David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.

128
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:36,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor.

129
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening members of the school committee.

130
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:48,878
[SPEAKER_00]: I said in my email to the committee earlier today that I was anticipating a relatively brief budget update based on where we are in the budget process today.

131
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,278
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know

132
00:13:51,380 --> 00:14:04,253
[SPEAKER_00]: more typically I provide a little more documentation ahead of this discussion but as we'll be having a multitude of discussions related to the budget over the course of the next month or so it seemed appropriate to try to to keep this update relatively concise.

133
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:08,478
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all now responded to the budget survey

134
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:23,607
[SPEAKER_00]: that was part of the budget process that we had discussed in January as we tried to find a way in which we could develop a process that would both keep the community informed, but also keep the process moving at hopefully what will be a somewhat expeditious pace.

135
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:28,790
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to thank the committee for making those submissions.

136
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:35,254
[SPEAKER_00]: As we said at the time, those are obviously a public record and not a discussion themselves, but that will help

137
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:48,607
[SPEAKER_00]: inform the administration as we develop our recommendations to you, which will then lead to the request that the school committee will make to the municipal government, most likely in late April or early May.

138
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:58,114
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of most significant shift in the structure of the public presentations, which again we discussed in January, is moving away from

139
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:13,246
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of somewhat repetitive process of each administrator explaining not frankly not explaining each line item because that's not something we've ever subjected the community to and I wouldn't given that it's a 67 and some odd million dollar budget I wouldn't recommend that we do subject the community to that.

140
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,602
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of teasing out department by department.

141
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:35,697
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've tried to do is structure a process that will have what I would describe as four cornerstones of the budget, and within those cornerstones you will receive all of the information related to each department each school, all of the content that would typically be presented will still be made available, but the focus of our public discussions

142
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:59,276
[SPEAKER_00]: will be consistent both with the goals and priorities of the strategic plan that you adopted last spring, as well as the priorities that you yourselves have identified and what we hear from, from a community perspective, in terms of what the priorities are for the organization in order to advance those goals and I think that's sort of the important nexus that we're trying to establish is that we want to highlight

143
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:05,258
[SPEAKER_00]: the components of the budget that are in fact going to advance the organization organizations goals.

144
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:19,865
[SPEAKER_00]: So those four cornerstones and what at this point we'd recommend the for public hearings would be focused on first, how the budget advances our equity goals, and particularly with regard to supports for high need and most vulnerable students.

145
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:24,328
[SPEAKER_00]: The second piece would be on technology integration and utilization.

146
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,891
[SPEAKER_00]: The third would be our organizational structure.

147
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,396
[SPEAKER_00]: We've said here many times that, like most school districts the vast majority of our budget, our personnel expenses.

148
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:38,079
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true for any school system that's that's the nature of the work.

149
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:42,022
[SPEAKER_00]: But for that reason our organizational structure matters and we know that that

150
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:53,512
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the goal of making sure that the budget process allows the community to see inside the Medford public schools and see how we're organized, how we're spending taxpayer dollars, and how we're seeking to advance those goals.

151
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,735
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the sort of the objective of that hearing.

152
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:07,865
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a fourth one, similar to what we did last year, where we would typically present the operating budget goals and then talk about specifically the goals that we had with respect to the COVID related funding.

153
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:20,248
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically the answer funding which is the funding air marked specifically for school districts, coming from federal legislation allocated through the state, and unlike the opera funding which is allocated at the city level.

154
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:29,442
[SPEAKER_00]: to support goals across the municipal government, including the schools, the answer funding is specific to the public school district and so in our case the public school district.

155
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:39,769
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would be the fourth of those hearings we would then present that information similar to how we have and all the other budget presentations and talk about how the investments connect to the

156
00:17:40,269 --> 00:18:03,225
[SPEAKER_00]: advancement of those goals, take the feedback from the committee and the community, and then return to you toward the end of April, or as I said, early May, with a final recommendation with the superintendent's budget, which you then, as again, we've talked about this timeline many times in the past, but just for community members who might be watching and hearing about this for the first time, that leads to the school committee's request to the municipal government.

157
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:06,748
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a number that is based on the needs and priorities of the school department.

158
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:18,212
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a concurrent responsibility to develop contingency plans so that we're able to put a budget into operation that works for students, that works for our individual school communities.

159
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:27,315
[SPEAKER_00]: And that next process would play out at the municipal level with the mayor and the city council, and then return to the school committee for a final vote of adoption, most likely in June.

160
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:35,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's sort of the timeline in the sequence, the timeline pursuant to your vote has been posted on our website for some time.

161
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:38,234
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few TBDs in that timeline.

162
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:41,715
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was hoping to solicit some of your feedback.

163
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:49,400
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to pose those questions to you now, but I just want to pause and see if there's anything I can answer with respect to this information so far.

164
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Kreatz.

165
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:55,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

166
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:57,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

167
00:18:57,305 --> 00:19:02,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the, did you say there's a timeline posted on the website for with some TBDs?

168
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:06,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the timeline posted, is that including the

169
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,446
[SPEAKER_02]: feedback session from community.

170
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:12,847
[SPEAKER_00]: The feedback session is one of the TBDs that's in the budget tab in the website.

171
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:28,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is this, if I could, I had initially scheduled four separate sessions on four separate evenings on those four major components of the budget.

172
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:35,865
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurred to me after developing that tentative timeline that I think it would be a better service to the community.

173
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:47,017
[SPEAKER_00]: If we condense those days, and essentially did 60 to 90 minute hearing on one of the cornerstones, and then take a 15 minute break and do another one.

174
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:52,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I think folks who want to follow this process start to finish line by line.

175
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:58,649
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more burdensome to ask them to block out four evenings in their month of April than it is to block out two.

176
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,553
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, Frank, gives us a little more time and I think will improve the quality of the information that you receive.

177
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:11,722
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we were to do that, then I would also be, I think the listening session, we'd have just a little more flexibility on when the listening session

178
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:13,382
[SPEAKER_00]: would be scheduled.

179
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plan right now is to do a virtual listening session.

180
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:29,388
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could certainly do one in person if that's what the committee would like, but basically we're just trying to open up a little more access to give folks an opportunity to comment and raise questions if they have them about our fiscal year 23 priorities.

181
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:41,593
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm really asking, I guess, is if the committee is receptive to my suggestion of condensing those hearings into two days rather than four, that will position us to schedule the virtual listening session from that point.

182
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:45,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

183
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:48,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Democrats, yes, I had a similar question.

184
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:58,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just went to the website and where are those meetings on the website, I must have missed a communication in the there's a budget tab under the about button.

185
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:03,630
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click about budget information, it'll it'll come up and show you the timeline.

186
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:05,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

187
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:07,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think as we go in, we'll move that to the front page.

188
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:08,132
[SPEAKER_00]: But

189
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on the main page.

190
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you looking for the dates?

191
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they could be emailed to us tomorrow from the admin.

192
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:15,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be great.

193
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:22,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just curious, we are, like, I'm sorry, we are on the, like, so if I'm on the Medford Public Schools main page.

194
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,694
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Dr. Cushing is demonstrating for us now on the main page there.

195
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:32,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So main page about, there's a budget information tab, and then a budget development timeline.

196
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:38,237
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our historical budget if folks wanna look through previous year's budgets, and that's the tentative timeline that was,

197
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:41,079
[SPEAKER_00]: that we posted in February.

198
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:47,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I think those that does have tentative dates for those hearings.

199
00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:54,533
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I said, I, I think we'd be, I think it would be a better service from a transparency information perspective, if we were to condense them.

200
00:21:55,005 --> 00:22:09,091
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question is if, you know, I've shared with the committee previously that these are the four components that we think are worth highlighting and think are sort of reflective of the totality of the goals and advancing the strategic plan.

201
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:19,916
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are other areas that the committee feels think deserve a focal point, then that's something I'd also like to know so we can, that will have an impact on the rest of the schedule.

202
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:23,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I respond?

203
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:23,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

204
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:24,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz?

205
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:25,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

206
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:27,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

207
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:29,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

208
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was going to ask.

209
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:34,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So would there be like a miscellaneous night if possible?

210
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:42,099
[SPEAKER_02]: If we need it, obviously we don't want to say that we have it, but just have a hold on a miscellaneous night in case there are any overflow items.

211
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:48,702
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that, I believe, although I will check it, in that there are multiple nights that are booked.

212
00:22:49,082 --> 00:22:50,902
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not have made it onto that list, but it is booked.

213
00:22:52,918 --> 00:23:01,501
[SPEAKER_00]: in the, for the budget hearings themselves, that can be expanded to include a focal point.

214
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:07,724
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's a good idea because part of the point of some of these public discussions is to flesh out issues.

215
00:23:07,764 --> 00:23:17,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are ones that come up that we decide the community could benefit from a more formal sort of spotlight being shined on it, then I think that would be

216
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:19,069
[SPEAKER_00]: a good opportunity to do that.

217
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:26,073
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, it's certainly no problem to just sort of have a placeholder and use that for what we think we need to at that time.

218
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:41,261
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, as I said, if there's something that I, we based those four off of our previous discussions and sort of the priorities that the committee had identified and also wanting topics that were sufficiently broad to encompass the totality of the $67 million budget.

219
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:46,724
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's, if there are other topics that there's a consensus now could be a focal point then I think

220
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:48,835
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think we should do that.

221
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:56,139
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think your point is well taken, Mr. McLaughlin, that we might know what we need to drill down on more after we have some further discussion.

222
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:58,020
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might make the most sense.

223
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham?

224
00:24:05,564 --> 00:24:08,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I think to try to answer the two questions I think you posed.

225
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:16,670
[SPEAKER_14]: One is, there's nothing that jumps out at me immediately, personally, that we would have to add to that list of four, but I agree we could

226
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:22,027
[SPEAKER_14]: find something along the way that we would want to dedicate time for.

227
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:33,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And then in terms of like four sessions versus two sessions, I am in favor of two sessions over like the extended short four session approach.

228
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:38,894
[SPEAKER_14]: April is the April calendar is already starting to escalate.

229
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:40,915
[SPEAKER_14]: So I and I think

230
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,541
[SPEAKER_14]: I definitely, I hadn't seen those states before, so I just need to look at them and I will let the superintendent know if there's any.

231
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:49,301
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a tentative timeline that we posted.

232
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:55,863
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna issue it as we normally do a doodle poll to make sure that we have a quorum in the committee and then we'll move on from there.

233
00:24:57,303 --> 00:25:04,986
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do think trying to organize around two nights makes sense for the people who are interested in following the budget from end to end.

234
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:09,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I think coming up with like four nights across one month

235
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,811
[SPEAKER_14]: with school vacation right in the middle of it would be hard.

236
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:13,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it doesn't.

237
00:25:13,932 --> 00:25:15,633
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I looked at it, the more it seemed like a bad idea.

238
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:20,117
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it was my idea, I wanted to run it by a few more folks before confirming that.

239
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:22,639
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that makes sense then.

240
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:24,561
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there'll be two nights each.

241
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:31,787
[SPEAKER_00]: If the committee has strong feelings about how we pair the two and two, I just be honest with you, I don't have strong feelings about it.

242
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:36,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than I will say, there's probably some value

243
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:57,329
[SPEAKER_00]: in if tech and the sort of COVID impact mitigation hearings were scheduled on the same evening, there'll be more of a focus on this sort of external funds that we have at our disposal, both because some of the tech pieces are capital expenditures and some are grant related and specifically ESSA and ARPA related.

244
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:02,332
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might have, there's a little bit of a correlation there that might make sense.

245
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:06,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as an example, if we were, you know,

246
00:26:06,714 --> 00:26:16,139
[SPEAKER_00]: the bucket of equity and supporting most vulnerable students is a very broad bucket, clearly.

247
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:20,601
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an organizing principle of essentially everything else that we're doing.

248
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:27,964
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we tease that out, it's entirely possible, I would even say likely, that there may be some facets of it, some of which you're going to hear about this evening.

249
00:26:29,817 --> 00:26:34,818
[SPEAKER_00]: that we may want to drill down on more in terms of counseling and mental health support and things of that nature.

250
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:36,419
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have flexibility.

251
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the committee's contributions to sort of developing this.

252
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:55,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's an opportunity to both position you to advocate zealously on that path of the school system, but also to really sort of provide a tremendous amount of information to the community as to what we plan to do with their money over the course of the next fiscal year.

253
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you, Mr. Murphy.

254
00:26:59,531 --> 00:26:59,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

255
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:13,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody will get those dates from the website or by email and then let the administration know which ones you're available for and hopefully coordinate accordingly.

256
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:17,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, number three, we have report on mental health supports, Ms.

257
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:21,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Stacey Shulman, Director of Counseling and Behavioral Health and Ms.

258
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Joan Bowen, Director of Pupil Services.

259
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:24,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

260
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:32,501
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to start off the presentation tonight just going over our staffing throughout the district as well as their responsibilities.

261
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:45,126
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you take a look at the slide deck, we will go through each one of the positions in our behavioral supports and let you know what their responsibilities are.

262
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:49,248
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we'll also give you the breakdown of the buildings that they're located in.

263
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:49,788
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Ms.

264
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:54,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Shillman will go more in depth into what is provided throughout the district.

265
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:58,393
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have school adjustment Councilors and school social workers.

266
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,715
[SPEAKER_13]: These providers,

267
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:05,179
[SPEAKER_13]: are the main staff that provide counseling.

268
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,122
[SPEAKER_13]: They do both individual and group counseling.

269
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:11,867
[SPEAKER_13]: They perform our functional behavioral assessments.

270
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:20,056
[SPEAKER_13]: They also do consults to the general education team, to parents, and they're also part of our community liaisons.

271
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:32,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Our school psychologists also provide counseling, both individual and group, but they also complete our psychological evaluations for special education.

272
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:38,479
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is for any student who is having an initial evaluation or is being re-evaluated.

273
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:44,544
[SPEAKER_13]: So those psychological evaluation, the WISC, that's performed by our school psychologists.

274
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:48,747
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have our school Councilors slash guidance Councilors.

275
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Staff members provide classes and lessons throughout the district.

276
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:59,119
[SPEAKER_13]: They also provide some counseling, both individual and group.

277
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:05,421
[SPEAKER_13]: They also look at academic transition and post secondary planning for all of our students.

278
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:09,403
[SPEAKER_13]: They oversee the five or fours throughout the building.

279
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:13,208
[SPEAKER_13]: They coordinate and facilitate parent meetings.

280
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:22,038
[SPEAKER_13]: If a student is having difficulty in school, they will coordinate to have a progress meeting, make sure the specific teachers are involved.

281
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:26,523
[SPEAKER_13]: And if an assistant principal or Councilor needs to be there, they'll all work together to do that.

282
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:29,827
[SPEAKER_13]: And they also provide academic support to our students.

283
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:35,240
[SPEAKER_13]: And the next slide, there are additional staff who may also assist.

284
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And this consists of our BCBAs, which is our Board Certified Behavior Analysts.

285
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:44,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Cushing, next slide please.

286
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,725
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have four total in the district.

287
00:29:48,806 --> 00:29:53,808
[SPEAKER_13]: The BCBAs in the district conduct observations and write up support plans for our students.

288
00:29:54,448 --> 00:29:56,669
[SPEAKER_13]: They consult with faculty and staff.

289
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:59,030
[SPEAKER_13]: They also provide trainings.

290
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:13,575
[SPEAKER_13]: We spoke about one of the trainings that our BCBA provided during our professional development day with our paraprofessionals, and they're also part of the team or members that can conduct FBAs as well.

291
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:17,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Within the district we also have our behavior specialists.

292
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,002
[SPEAKER_13]: There are five district wide.

293
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,001
[SPEAKER_13]: and they're also at the elementary level.

294
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:27,464
[SPEAKER_13]: They assist with any support plans that our students may have.

295
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:30,366
[SPEAKER_13]: They support students in crisis.

296
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:37,250
[SPEAKER_13]: They also support our BCBAs and Councilors with our functional behavioral assessments.

297
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,952
[SPEAKER_13]: And then lastly, we have our re-engagement specialists.

298
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:45,835
[SPEAKER_13]: They also assist with attendance and they also provide resources for our families.

299
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:53,250
[SPEAKER_13]: On the next slide, we start the staffing by building and by level.

300
00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:06,274
[SPEAKER_13]: So at the elementary level, at the Missittuck, next slide please, we have 1.6 school adjustment Councilors, and we have one school psychologist.

301
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:13,817
[SPEAKER_13]: At the Roberts, we have 1.4 school adjustment Councilor, and we have 0.5 school psychologists.

302
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:23,512
[SPEAKER_13]: At the McGlynn Elementary, our school adjustment Councilors is 1.6, and that asterisk means we're in the process of hiring an additional staff person.

303
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:28,153
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also have a .5 school psychologist.

304
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:35,494
[SPEAKER_13]: At the Brooks, our school adjustment Councilor, we have one, and we also have one school psychologist full-time.

305
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:37,895
[SPEAKER_13]: At the McGlynn Middle,

306
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:42,181
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a school Councilor slash guidance Councilor.

307
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:46,044
[SPEAKER_13]: We have two staff members in that position.

308
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:52,729
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a 1.4 school adjustment Councilor, and we have one school psychologist.

309
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Andrews Middle School, we have our school Councilor, guidance Councilor, there are two.

310
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:03,337
[SPEAKER_13]: We have two school adjustment Councilors and one school psychologist.

311
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:15,084
[SPEAKER_13]: At Medford High School, I'm sorry, yeah, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School, we have six school Councilors slash guidance Councilors.

312
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:20,008
[SPEAKER_13]: We have four school adjustment Councilors and two school psychologists.

313
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:24,292
[SPEAKER_13]: At the Curtis Tufts, we have two school adjustment Councilors.

314
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:32,858
[SPEAKER_13]: If you look in your packet, we have provided you a listing of the staffing and who is the 0.6, who's the 1.4, that sort of thing.

315
00:32:38,964 --> 00:32:41,589
[SPEAKER_11]: What does an average day for a school Councilor look like?

316
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:48,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I did an analysis of everyone's schedule, where they spend their time, and this is how it turned out.

317
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:51,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what I will tell you is that there is no average day in school counseling.

318
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:58,328
[SPEAKER_11]: So I might say 60% in direct counseling services, but based on student needs that fluctuates throughout the day.

319
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:15,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So typically they're spending 60% in direct counseling services for students, 15% in consults or staff meetings, and 25% of their work is paperwork, contact with service providers in the community, parent outreach, work with building administrators or crisis response.

320
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Elementary services, supports focus heavy on groups.

321
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:25,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Lunch and social skills groups are based on need.

322
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:30,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Those needs and groupings typically are friendships, anxiety, communication.

323
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:32,905
[SPEAKER_11]: We also offer a bounce back trauma group.

324
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:39,627
[SPEAKER_11]: They also offer individual counseling, behavior specialist support, resources and parent support.

325
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:43,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And we added the nexus class this year, which focuses on social emotional learning.

326
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:58,170
[SPEAKER_11]: An average caseload for an elementary Councilor, there are 18 students who are on IEPs, seven students on 504s, and they're typically connected to around 26 general education students.

327
00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:09,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Middle school services, this is when you start to have school Councilors or what's typically seen as guidance Councilors for every student.

328
00:34:09,787 --> 00:34:12,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Every student is connected with a school Councilor and secondary.

329
00:34:12,948 --> 00:34:20,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Lunch and social skills groups are also based on need, similar groupings, friendships, anxiety, communication, and trauma.

330
00:34:20,953 --> 00:34:26,497
[SPEAKER_11]: They also offer individual counseling, resources and parent support, and guidance advisory classes.

331
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:42,053
[SPEAKER_11]: In middle school, the average caseloads for school Councilors are 236 general education students, because you have two school Councilors for every middle school, 15 students on 504s.

332
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:50,295
[SPEAKER_11]: School social workers are typically seeing 27 students on IEPs, and school psychologists see 18 students on IEPs.

333
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:51,536
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an average.

334
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:59,118
[SPEAKER_11]: High school services, again, every student is connected to a school Councilor.

335
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:03,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Group supports are available, again, by subject.

336
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:07,778
[SPEAKER_11]: We offer generalized support, anxiety, there's a grief group, and trauma support.

337
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:11,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of individual counseling, resources, and parent support.

338
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,622
[SPEAKER_11]: In the high school is where we have the STEPS program, that's a hospital reentry program.

339
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:22,065
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have a community Councilor based inside the high school, and we offer advisory classes.

340
00:35:24,186 --> 00:35:28,948
[SPEAKER_11]: The average caseload in high school is 200 general education students for every school Councilor.

341
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,261
[SPEAKER_11]: about they're seeing about 12 students on 504s.

342
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:39,987
[SPEAKER_11]: School social workers are seeing 37 students on IEPs, eight students on 504s and about 10 gen ed students.

343
00:35:40,748 --> 00:35:43,790
[SPEAKER_11]: School psychologists typically see 15 students on IEPs.

344
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:58,202
[SPEAKER_11]: When to see your Councilor, either for academics, typically managing homework, stress with academics, ongoing schoolwork challenges or organization schoolwork,

345
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:06,647
[SPEAKER_11]: or for social emotional needs, mental health that impacts school, friendships or school event activities that you need assistance with.

346
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:13,751
[SPEAKER_11]: School Councilors offer lots of referrals for increased supports.

347
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:25,738
[SPEAKER_11]: So Councilors can help identify community or school supports for students such as mental health, food insecurity and assistance with free reduced lunch, tutoring information, community engagement opportunities and scholarships.

348
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:35,892
[SPEAKER_11]: This year, starting in February, we partnered with Care Solace to assist students, families, and staff with accessing mental health care.

349
00:36:36,472 --> 00:36:44,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Care Solace works to make mental health care appointments for those we refer, taking the large burden off of making dozens of phone calls off the shoulders of school Councilors and families.

350
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:48,955
[SPEAKER_11]: They can also assist with finding supports in creative ways.

351
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:56,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Since February 2021, 2022, that should say, in just one month, we have connected 45 students with services for mental health.

352
00:36:57,517 --> 00:37:01,279
[SPEAKER_11]: School Councilors, nurses, or administrators in the building can process referrals.

353
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Families can also search on their own for additional privacy.

354
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:12,084
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a couple of questions you asked for in the report that are not listed here in the presentation that I will address.

355
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:19,047
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the questions was the approximate number of non-IEP referrals that are on a wait list for school-based counseling.

356
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:19,587
[SPEAKER_11]: That is none.

357
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:21,748
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not have wait lists for school-based Councilors.

358
00:37:21,808 --> 00:37:23,069
[SPEAKER_11]: We meet the needs of students.

359
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:30,695
[SPEAKER_11]: The number of students at each level who are referred for contract and mental health services outside of MPS, that is also none.

360
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,158
[SPEAKER_11]: And the number of posted positions that remain unfilled, that is one.

361
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,921
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the McGlynn position where you see an asterisk of 0.6 and 0.4.

362
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:40,982
[SPEAKER_11]: We are currently working with the candidate.

363
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:46,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, may I ask a question?

364
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:46,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

365
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:47,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

366
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:53,871
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to elaborate on the wait list, there's no wait list for the care referrals, is that right?

367
00:37:54,614 --> 00:38:01,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for care solace referrals for the care program for the outside support for counseling supports, you know,

368
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:08,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Care Solace connects our students and families with care providers.

369
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,711
[SPEAKER_11]: They typically try to get the shortest waitlist as possible.

370
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:13,831
[SPEAKER_11]: This was a reference to our in-school counseling.

371
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:19,652
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're, you know, student school Councilors operate in a similar way that school nurses do.

372
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:22,713
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're seeing students constantly triaging as they come in.

373
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:27,414
[SPEAKER_11]: If they have a preventive mental health problem, we're connecting them to a provider in the community to oversee their care.

374
00:38:27,754 --> 00:38:27,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

375
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:47,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess just following up on that for the provider in the community, I know that you know there's a huge mental health deficit obviously for lots of folks providers and I'm wondering if if a student is referred for outside mental health supports and services, but is not able to get them for because of a wait list.

376
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,666
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, so then what's the next step?

377
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:54,350
[SPEAKER_11]: This is exactly why we partnered with Care Solace, because they haven't been able to meet that need.

378
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:54,950
[SPEAKER_08]: They have?

379
00:38:55,111 --> 00:38:55,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

380
00:38:55,651 --> 00:39:03,077
[SPEAKER_11]: And they might say, you have a wait time in six weeks for care, and then we piece together and triage and support students in the meantime.

381
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:06,139
[SPEAKER_11]: But they have not come back to me and said, we cannot find care for somebody.

382
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:12,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a few questions.

383
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:13,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

384
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:15,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a few questions.

385
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:24,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the original intent of this resolution really was to try to tease out, especially given the pandemic, obviously,

386
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:38,203
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of what we have in the schools to meet the needs of kids who come up during the time, you know, not kids who are already identified for it may have it on their IEP, some kind of counseling service.

387
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:43,205
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, what do we have beyond that for kids who come up at any point?

388
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:48,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we know, I'm sure that's already happened this year.

389
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:50,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, you know, based on what you read from the

390
00:39:52,297 --> 00:40:00,827
[SPEAKER_06]: experts out there, it's going to be a continuing, in fact, possibly a snowballing effect as this keeps going on, and as other things happen in the world.

391
00:40:01,328 --> 00:40:11,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm still trying to understand I think some of the, like, so the additional staff when we look at some of the additional staff that you went over.

392
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:20,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless I'm misunderstanding, a lot of that staff is more focused on kids who have services on their IEPs.

393
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:21,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

394
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a behavior specialist.

395
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they just available for any?

396
00:40:25,314 --> 00:40:26,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they are.

397
00:40:26,436 --> 00:40:26,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

398
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:27,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

399
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:31,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, all all staff is available for whenever there's a need.

400
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:42,240
[SPEAKER_13]: There are certain services that staff need to provide for students on their 504 I, I, but these staff members are available to all of our students.

401
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,562
[SPEAKER_13]: So there may be a student that comes in crisis.

402
00:40:45,123 --> 00:41:04,072
[SPEAKER_13]: We look at who's available school psychologist school adjustment council they'll work with the student work through whatever crisis, and then try to get them back to class if not they may call the parents and then may try to connect with an outside Councilor that sort of thing so there is a lot of triage that goes on on a daily basis.

403
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:08,053
[SPEAKER_13]: But we would never say, oh, you can't see this Councilor.

404
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:11,093
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not identified as someone who requires it.

405
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:15,494
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a continuous ebb and flow of students coming in.

406
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they require it, we make sure that they get to see someone.

407
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:21,735
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we try to connect them with outside agencies as well.

408
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:26,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So I understand, I guess, that they would be available.

409
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:30,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the question I was trying to, again, one of the questions I was trying to tease out

410
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:34,076
[SPEAKER_06]: how much of their time is available for that.

411
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:39,860
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at someone like a school psychologist, they're generally pretty tied up with testing in most places.

412
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:43,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And the behavior specialist, I'm just not clear.

413
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:49,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I was trying to get some really specific details and maybe, I know it's constantly changing.

414
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:51,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I do understand that.

415
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:57,874
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's hard to know from a, you know, when we start looking at the budget, what more might we need?

416
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:10,572
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're constantly analyzing and looking at that and looking at the numbers we've added a great deal of supports this year, starting from elementary with the nexus classes we've also offered one behavioral specialist to every elementary building this year.

417
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:15,418
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've increased substantially group counseling at the secondary level.

418
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So far, we feel comfortable that we're meeting the needs of students.

419
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:25,728
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always an undercurrent of students who are not identifying their needs to the school, and that's certainly their right and their privacy.

420
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:31,610
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also working with the Safe and Supportive Schools Network for universal screening.

421
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:38,872
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're increasing our universal screening of students to make sure that we understand the challenges that they're having and we're meeting those needs.

422
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:44,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have some of the specific information, the more school-based information about

423
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:50,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we know that our, especially at our elementary level, we have different, very different demographics at different schools.

424
00:42:50,405 --> 00:42:51,466
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

425
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:55,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of looks like we have similar supports at each school.

426
00:42:56,027 --> 00:42:59,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And is that, you know, how is that working out?

427
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:01,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there certain schools that might need more?

428
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping to get a little more specific school as opposed to an average.

429
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:10,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess I'm also curious about at the elementary level, what does

430
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:21,012
[SPEAKER_06]: average caseload referred to is that the adjustment Councilors average load is that average load across the schools of.

431
00:43:22,794 --> 00:43:29,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't quite sure what the average caseload referred to, given that there's a school there's social workers and their school psychologists.

432
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:34,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is all like second nature to you, but all these different positions.

433
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all school psychologists see students for counseling.

434
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:39,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Some do, some do not.

435
00:43:39,963 --> 00:43:50,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also being very careful to protect the privacy of our students without giving every very detailed information while giving you a complete picture of our services, which is why the presentation is formatted in this manner.

436
00:43:51,273 --> 00:43:54,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So at the elementary level, we have school adjustment Councilors, school social workers.

437
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:56,117
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the same position.

438
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:02,635
[SPEAKER_11]: They're referred to in different ways, which is why I have this lash in there, similar to school Councilor guidance Councilor at the secondary level.

439
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:11,338
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the number of students, they have on their caseload, it does not signify the amount of time they're spending with with students.

440
00:44:11,998 --> 00:44:18,840
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is an average so some may have more some may have less we look at the needs of students within that building so specific.

441
00:44:19,315 --> 00:44:24,099
[SPEAKER_11]: programming in the building or specific needs that we've seen trending across time.

442
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:25,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how we allocate staff.

443
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:26,902
[SPEAKER_11]: We're constantly readjusting that.

444
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:32,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a sense, or can you give us a general idea of the behavior specialists?

445
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:42,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I saw in terms of new positions that were added at the elementary level that I think that really was it this year, was the new, and not that that's not a lot, but I mean, the behavior specialists were it.

446
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:49,453
[SPEAKER_06]: There weren't new adjustment Councilors or social workers, that it really was just the behavior specialists.

447
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:50,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I don't mean just.

448
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:55,315
[SPEAKER_06]: but how are they really providing a lot of direct counseling?

449
00:44:55,355 --> 00:44:56,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't clear to me.

450
00:44:56,636 --> 00:44:58,596
[SPEAKER_11]: So behavior specialists do not offer counseling.

451
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:01,077
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't have the certification to provide that amount of support.

452
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:10,639
[SPEAKER_11]: What they're offering is students for in the moment support for guiding them back into the classroom or assisting them with making sure they can attend to their learning environment.

453
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:13,880
[SPEAKER_11]: So they might be assisting with behavior plans that a Councilor or a BCBA

454
00:45:14,482 --> 00:45:18,503
[SPEAKER_11]: has provided, they might be coaching a student to come in the building if they're feeling anxious.

455
00:45:19,023 --> 00:45:24,724
[SPEAKER_11]: We targeted the elementary school for behavioral specialist support because elementary students tend to externalize their feelings.

456
00:45:25,365 --> 00:45:30,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas once you get higher for middle and high school, those are more internalized and they can have those communications.

457
00:45:30,886 --> 00:45:35,627
[SPEAKER_11]: But for our younger students, they may show that with behavior.

458
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:43,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're leaving the classroom or they might experience something else that provides an educated staff member in the moment, but not necessarily a school social worker.

459
00:45:44,472 --> 00:45:56,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of the in school kind of if they needed more than that, that would be the school social workers that would provide an ongoing that's right, and they might have in conjunction they may have more than one provider working with them based on their needs.

460
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:01,698
[SPEAKER_13]: And also the type of counseling or check in they get varies from.

461
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:03,262
[SPEAKER_13]: from student to student.

462
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:10,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have students that just check in with their, not just, but they check in with their school adjustment Councilors in the morning and then they start the day.

463
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:13,325
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have students that work with staff for 30 minutes.

464
00:46:13,745 --> 00:46:16,385
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not everyone gets an hour of counseling.

465
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:23,667
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really based on individual student needs and what is gonna work best for them so we can get them back into the classroom setting.

466
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:26,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And how are they referred for those services?

467
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:31,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, if other people are going on and on, but how are they- In a variety of ways.

468
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:36,797
[SPEAKER_11]: A parent may call and say, my child is coming home, saying they're feeling anxious about their math exam.

469
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:41,699
[SPEAKER_11]: We may, a teacher may refer and say, this student looks like they need support.

470
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Every school has a student support team where they're looking at student needs.

471
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,560
[SPEAKER_11]: And once you get to the higher grade level, students self-refer.

472
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,981
[SPEAKER_11]: They come to their Councilor and say, I need more, I need more.

473
00:46:51,831 --> 00:46:56,475
[SPEAKER_11]: So it comes from this different area, self-refer, parent-refer, in-school referral.

474
00:46:57,796 --> 00:46:58,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

475
00:46:58,456 --> 00:46:58,937
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

476
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:00,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Ma'am?

477
00:47:00,978 --> 00:47:01,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

478
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:03,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham has a comment.

479
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

480
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:06,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

481
00:47:06,943 --> 00:47:20,314
[SPEAKER_14]: When we talked earlier this year about some of the challenges that we were seeing at the high school, I asked you whether students knew how to access services, and you said,

482
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,310
[SPEAKER_14]: it sort of seems like they don't.

483
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:27,852
[SPEAKER_14]: So what has changed about that, if anything?

484
00:47:28,552 --> 00:47:33,713
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've offered an entire advisory lesson on who to see and how to see Councilors.

485
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:40,755
[SPEAKER_11]: We're constantly also sending out emails as far as supports in school and recruiting students for groups.

486
00:47:41,595 --> 00:47:42,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And that continues.

487
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:47,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've seen a little bit of progress in that area, but we're always working towards more.

488
00:47:48,623 --> 00:48:08,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And after that presentation, I actually got some feedback from members of the community about whether group support is really the right kind of support for our teenagers, given that they're teenagers.

489
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,885
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the first thing that middle schoolers and high schoolers really want to do is sort of expose

490
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:18,263
[SPEAKER_14]: what's challenging them in a group setting.

491
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:31,006
[SPEAKER_14]: So what, like when we think about how we're supporting students, do we have mechanisms in place beyond inviting them to come to groups that may make them feel uncomfortable enough not to engage?

492
00:48:31,426 --> 00:48:33,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Every student is connected with their school Councilor.

493
00:48:33,707 --> 00:48:38,188
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're welcome to go make an appointment, email them, say, can I come and check in with you on an individual basis?

494
00:48:38,308 --> 00:48:41,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also might be appropriate for out of school supports as well.

495
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,629
[SPEAKER_11]: So we look at every student with individual needs.

496
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:55,111
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the other question that we had as we were thinking about wanting this information is, is there enough to meet the need?

497
00:48:55,411 --> 00:49:05,337
[SPEAKER_14]: And all I continue to hear from anybody who works in a school right now is that this is worse than any other year of the pandemic.

498
00:49:05,918 --> 00:49:07,619
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very hard work.

499
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:08,780
[SPEAKER_14]: It's exhausting.

500
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Students are really struggling.

501
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,483
[SPEAKER_14]: So do we have enough to meet the need?

502
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:15,638
[SPEAKER_14]: is my question.

503
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,443
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will be addressing this in budget at the budget hearings.

504
00:49:22,784 --> 00:49:35,294
[SPEAKER_13]: We do feel that there needs to be an increase and we're in the process of working as a special education team to look at what those numbers are going to look like and then what additional staff members will be necessary for next school year.

505
00:49:36,035 --> 00:49:38,317
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's definitely a high priority for us.

506
00:49:38,757 --> 00:49:39,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

507
00:49:44,445 --> 00:49:45,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you, yes.

508
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:45,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

509
00:49:45,906 --> 00:49:47,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

510
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:54,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the report and all the hard work that I know our behavioral health team does.

511
00:49:54,333 --> 00:50:00,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been really trying for everybody, families and caregivers and staff and everyone.

512
00:50:00,979 --> 00:50:02,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for the hard work.

513
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:04,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple of quick questions.

514
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:07,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any behavioral health supports for the MEEP program?

515
00:50:09,538 --> 00:50:09,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

516
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:10,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

517
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:19,003
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have at the meet program, depending on needs, they have school adjustment Councilors, they have BCBAs involved, behavior specialists.

518
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:23,085
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, whatever the need is, they also are provided the same services.

519
00:50:23,526 --> 00:50:23,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

520
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:25,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do they tap into that?

521
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know they're not on this for like allocated.

522
00:50:27,468 --> 00:50:29,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they just use this high school?

523
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:30,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

524
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:32,711
[SPEAKER_13]: So they would access the same sort of referrals.

525
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:36,713
[SPEAKER_13]: The teacher may make a referral saying I'm having a student that seems like they're in crisis.

526
00:50:37,544 --> 00:50:44,167
[SPEAKER_13]: A school adjustment council will check in with them if they require one-to-one or small group or a lunch bunch.

527
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:47,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they're a new move-in student, they're having difficulty.

528
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:52,271
[SPEAKER_13]: All the services that are available to all students are available to our MEEP students.

529
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

530
00:50:54,052 --> 00:51:02,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the access to care referral, I'm wondering, is that available also for out-of-district families?

531
00:51:03,156 --> 00:51:03,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

532
00:51:03,997 --> 00:51:04,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

533
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:15,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the services, obviously, if out-of-district placements don't have the particular services that the child needs, obviously the district provides the in-person, I mean, in the instead services.

534
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you tell us a little bit about the NEXUS classes?

535
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you expand on that just a bit?

536
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

537
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:28,035
[SPEAKER_11]: So every student in elementary school has NEXUS once a week, and we focus on social-emotional learning, executive functioning.

538
00:51:28,776 --> 00:51:30,637
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also the Michigan model curriculum in there.

539
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:41,200
[SPEAKER_03]: For Nexus, are you asking the kids how they enjoy it or like going to it every week?

540
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:48,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think we're looking towards a stronger evaluation in the coming months to see how we're going forward next year.

541
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:49,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

542
00:51:49,763 --> 00:51:58,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just one other, the average caseload, is that based on a week or is that yearly?

543
00:51:58,127 --> 00:52:04,389
[SPEAKER_11]: That's their total roster of students who they are meeting with, and that ebbs and flows over time.

544
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:06,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

545
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:08,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the presentation.

546
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:09,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham.

547
00:52:10,466 --> 00:52:25,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Just as you think about the budget and the requests that you're going to make, it's sort of surprising, although maybe it's not in the counseling world, that we have a huge slew of part-timers on our roster.

548
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:31,474
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it works, it's fine, but I do question whether

549
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:36,821
[SPEAKER_14]: we're like meeting the needs of the staff or we're meeting the needs of the students by having all these part timers.

550
00:52:36,962 --> 00:52:41,125
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want the budget to reflect what we need to meet the needs of students.

551
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:44,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we can make that also work for staff, that is great.

552
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,909
[SPEAKER_14]: But we are looking at that as well.

553
00:52:47,169 --> 00:52:47,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.

554
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:47,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

555
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:50,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

556
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:50,972
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

557
00:52:51,052 --> 00:52:51,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

558
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:51,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

559
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:57,297
[SPEAKER_03]: We have number four report on athletic

560
00:52:57,968 --> 00:53:02,369
[SPEAKER_03]: user fees, Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of secondary education.

561
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:03,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing.

562
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:08,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Madam Mayor.

563
00:53:09,072 --> 00:53:10,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, members of the school committee.

564
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:16,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for this opportunity to present to you a mid-year update on where we are with our athletics users fees.

565
00:53:16,754 --> 00:53:19,995
[SPEAKER_01]: You recall last year we presented at the beginning of the year

566
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:24,549
[SPEAKER_01]: to request a suspension of the user fees for that one year.

567
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:33,772
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can remember, the sports are $175 per sport with the exception of hockey and football.

568
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:39,715
[SPEAKER_01]: The equipment and facility usage on those sports requires a little bit more

569
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:44,209
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still exceptionally reasonable compared to other schools at $200.

570
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:50,091
[SPEAKER_01]: The user fees for hockey are quite significantly higher in many other districts.

571
00:53:50,111 --> 00:53:53,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really great that Medford can help our students in that area.

572
00:53:54,393 --> 00:53:56,654
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a family cap of $500 per year.

573
00:53:57,354 --> 00:54:01,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also don't charge students on free and reduced lunch.

574
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:04,841
[SPEAKER_01]: and families can also apply for a hardship waiver.

575
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus far this year, we've collected $37,925.

576
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:11,087
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 52 students on hardship, four family caps at this point.

577
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:18,053
[SPEAKER_01]: That number will go up.

578
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:22,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Spring sports started today, so we don't have accurate data on that.

579
00:54:23,616 --> 00:54:36,804
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also saw, based on the numbers that I'm looking at, and I want to confirm with our athletic staff, but just based on the numbers, we've seen a jump in our athletic participation this year, which I think is really great coming out of the pandemic.

580
00:54:36,964 --> 00:54:43,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Athletics is a really great opportunity for students to participate, be involved, be connected with an adult outside of the classroom.

581
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:46,070
[SPEAKER_01]: and to build lasting relationships with peers.

582
00:54:47,311 --> 00:55:00,800
[SPEAKER_01]: We are continually looking at adding different programs, especially at our middle school program, to really support students and to have that feeder pipeline up to Medford High School for their secondary experience.

583
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:10,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to take any questions you may have at this time, and we'll provide you at least a report at the end of the year on the total numbers for spring sports.

584
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

585
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:15,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

586
00:55:17,075 --> 00:55:17,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Three questions.

587
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:19,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there fees at the middle school level?

588
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:23,619
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, sorry.

589
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:29,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I was having, my kids woke me up a lot last night, so I was having a brain moment on that.

590
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:30,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

591
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:32,386
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not.

592
00:55:33,386 --> 00:55:34,047
Okay.

593
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:41,012
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I think the other thing that sort of stands out to me is like, this is all athletics, but we have,

594
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:48,179
[SPEAKER_14]: other extracurricular activities at the high school level where there are substantial costs associated with the programming.

595
00:55:48,199 --> 00:56:03,342
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking of like the band, the marching band and orchestra, all of those programs where the band parents in particular raise oodles of money or they're kind of constantly out there doing that.

596
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:06,903
[SPEAKER_14]: So have we considered

597
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:13,697
[SPEAKER_14]: looking at moving to a universal user fee and what would that look like?

598
00:56:14,362 --> 00:56:19,126
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not, I know other districts have, and it's really a twofold argument.

599
00:56:19,346 --> 00:56:27,993
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it could limit other people from participating, even though we offer the hardship waiver, we offer family caps, various things like that.

600
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:36,980
[SPEAKER_01]: But as members of the community and members of the board have mentioned, a lot of times people don't wanna ask to not have to pay, even though there's a hardship.

601
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:41,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, if that's something the committee would like us to look into, we're happy to do that.

602
00:56:42,484 --> 00:56:43,405
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also then,

603
00:56:44,355 --> 00:56:54,763
[SPEAKER_01]: In previous experiences, having gone down this road, I remember that it was to participate in theater, it was $100, which was significantly less than the athletics user fee.

604
00:56:55,423 --> 00:57:01,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the participation was like $50 and $25 based on free and reduced lunch.

605
00:57:04,726 --> 00:57:08,649
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not an overburden, but there was a question of where do you stop that?

606
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:16,173
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a child's participating in the after school art club, does everything involve a user fee or is it just certain things?

607
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:17,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

608
00:57:18,254 --> 00:57:22,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And my understanding is we're the only school in the GBL that charges user fees at all.

609
00:57:22,357 --> 00:57:22,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that true?

610
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:29,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot 100% confirm that, but I believe from our conversations last year, that is true.

611
00:57:30,254 --> 00:57:38,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to check with our athletic director just to be, we've also invited in a lot more communities to the GBL and we're looking to onboard some more.

612
00:57:39,738 --> 00:57:42,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something that I'd like to research further.

613
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

614
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:52,244
[SPEAKER_14]: And then my last question is about the distinction between the students who have complete fee waiver

615
00:57:52,892 --> 00:57:57,514
[SPEAKER_14]: versus the folks who are in this separate financial hardship bucket.

616
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:06,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I've sort of philosophical question about like why those two things are separate.

617
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:17,383
[SPEAKER_14]: But then also, is there a process with sufficient oversight to ensure that we are giving out hardship waivers in a consistent

618
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:18,878
[SPEAKER_14]: manner.

619
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:34,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So hardship waivers differ from the free and reduced lunch, whereas free and reduced lunch is more of a consistent people actually fill out the paperwork, submit the paperwork, it goes through the state and federal processes for a person to be registered on our rolls.

620
00:58:35,295 --> 00:58:49,585
[SPEAKER_01]: as free and reduced lunch versus say a family who approaches the school district and has recently lost a job or is in transition or perhaps I know this happened in a previous year, a house burns down, God forbidden.

621
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the types of things that are

622
00:58:52,847 --> 00:58:57,331
[SPEAKER_01]: more I would say transitory for a family in that moment.

623
00:58:58,071 --> 00:59:02,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can definitely work with there is an oversight process.

624
00:59:02,654 --> 00:59:12,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I would say that it's very open and forgiving for families, that if a family comes to us with a hardship, we generally speaking, take them on their word.

625
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:23,810
[SPEAKER_01]: and work with the family to make sure that not only is a fee waived, but if there's athletic equipment that's needed, whatever is needed, our athletic staff really does a good job helping to support the family and the student.

626
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:42,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I think as we think about this financial hardship category, like this also came up as we talked about the before and after school program in terms of establishing like a mechanism internally to deal with folks who have like interim

627
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:45,116
[SPEAKER_14]: that we can help address.

628
00:59:46,037 --> 01:00:01,445
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just want to make sure that there's some consistency about like how this is evaluated across all the various places where we're issuing hardship waivers across the district so that we don't find ourselves in a situation where the athletic staff is

629
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:07,897
[SPEAKER_14]: applying some amount of judgment that's completely like a different set of variables than would be applied elsewhere.

630
01:00:08,117 --> 01:00:08,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

631
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:15,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on the guidance that we issued to principals and assistant principals previously, that's the guidance that people are following.

632
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:20,907
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, we're also not looking to put an undue burden on families who are going through the hardship.

633
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:21,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

634
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:21,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

635
01:00:22,048 --> 01:00:22,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

636
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:26,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

637
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:27,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

638
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:28,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night.

639
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, Member Ruseau.

640
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:33,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

641
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:36,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the presentation.

642
01:00:37,022 --> 01:00:38,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a couple of questions.

643
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:47,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I was happy to see that the funds in the revolving account are used to offset transportation, uniform costs, game officials, etc.

644
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:52,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we offset transportation and other costs for any other

645
01:00:53,644 --> 01:00:55,285
[SPEAKER_09]: for band, for field trips?

646
01:00:55,345 --> 01:00:57,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I think PTOs are still paying for that stuff.

647
01:00:58,007 --> 01:01:00,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we offset for any other group of students that you're aware of?

648
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly would have to do more research on that to really be able to give a full and complete answer.

649
01:01:07,313 --> 01:01:08,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am happy to do that.

650
01:01:10,155 --> 01:01:14,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, I really can't give you an accurate answer on that.

651
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:16,920
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a bus line item budget for the Machi band.

652
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,241
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that.

653
01:01:19,502 --> 01:01:19,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

654
01:01:20,402 --> 01:01:21,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, you know, when we talk about

655
01:01:23,728 --> 01:01:28,452
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the fact that we charge a user fee which obviously I'm in favor of getting rid of user fees.

656
01:01:31,114 --> 01:01:39,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think we have to look at the things that we not only don't have a user fee for, but we don't even do any coverage at all on right now.

657
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:45,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean the PTO is still raising money to send kids on official school field trips.

658
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:49,977
[SPEAKER_09]: is sort of mind blowing to me still.

659
01:01:50,818 --> 01:02:00,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'd be nice to know that I feel like I might know the answer, but I'd like to hear it out of an official from an official perspective.

660
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:02,902
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you for the report.

661
01:02:03,222 --> 01:02:04,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

662
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:09,586
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Member Graham brought up universal user fees.

663
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:17,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Cushing, you mentioned limiting students, and I was a little unsure how that would happen.

664
01:02:17,249 --> 01:02:34,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I just feel like if we had one user fee, and if a student wanted to participate in band or hockey or, well, frankly, anything else, they'd pay the one fee for the year, and they could participate in all of the things.

665
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:49,114
[SPEAKER_09]: The only way I can see how that could limit would be as if participation rates went through the roof and we couldn't figure out how to have enough coaches and transportation.

666
01:02:49,534 --> 01:02:58,556
[SPEAKER_09]: If the band was tripled in size overnight, I'm sure that the band folks would be more than thrilled, but we have to acknowledge that would also cost an awful lot more money.

667
01:02:58,676 --> 01:03:05,238
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure what you meant by limiting when you referenced the idea of getting rid of user fees or universal user fees.

668
01:03:06,436 --> 01:03:33,673
[SPEAKER_01]: So in thinking about a universal user fee, I think that if you're saying charge one fee for students all year, if I'm hearing you correctly, that if a student only participates in one sport or one activity, and they're paying the same as someone who participates in three activities or does three sports and band or does multiple,

669
01:03:34,272 --> 01:03:36,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just making sure that there's pay equity there.

670
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:52,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, another great thing would be is if any community members would like to endow the athletics program and other programs with lasting gifts or things like that, that then can really help support these in perpetuity.

671
01:03:53,505 --> 01:03:56,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean by limiting, by restricting any access for students.

672
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

673
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:01,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I certainly, when I was talking about a universal fee was,

674
01:04:04,322 --> 01:04:21,269
[SPEAKER_09]: one fee, like you pay once, you know, when you go to college, as many of us remember, or have seen, if we have kids that we're enrolling and you compare tuition, you'll get a very, very, you'll be in for a shock when you discover that most of what you're paying is called fees.

675
01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:25,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how they sort of hidden that stuff.

676
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:30,412
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, in my mind, like if students want to participate in anything and they pay

677
01:04:31,092 --> 01:04:36,520
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever it is, whether it's $100 for the year, then they can participate in anything.

678
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:41,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just feel like that that would encourage kids to try out for things that they may not truly

679
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:43,337
[SPEAKER_09]: have an aptitude for already.

680
01:04:44,678 --> 01:04:50,219
[SPEAKER_09]: If my son comes home and says, I wanna do hockey and he's never skated and he's never played hockey.

681
01:04:50,679 --> 01:05:02,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you tell me it's $200, I'm probably gonna be a little bit like, well, we need to really think this through and not be the most encouraging parent on earth, especially if $200 is a lot of money for me.

682
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:10,545
[SPEAKER_09]: So lowering the barriers, but also keeping the students on free and reduced lunch, not paying anything.

683
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:18,770
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think that that could open the door to a heck of a lot more participation by students, but I'll stop talking.

684
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

685
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:23,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

686
01:05:25,452 --> 01:05:26,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

687
01:05:26,413 --> 01:05:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

688
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:32,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Number five, we have an update on MSBA application process.

689
01:05:32,835 --> 01:05:36,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.

690
01:05:36,797 --> 01:05:37,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Murphy.

691
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:38,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor.

692
01:05:39,655 --> 01:05:59,011
[SPEAKER_00]: In January, I believe on January 24th, we presented to the committee information related to the opening of the Massachusetts School Building Authority application window, which is an annual process that happens with the state agency, the MSBA, that is responsible for school construction projects.

693
01:05:59,231 --> 01:06:06,777
[SPEAKER_00]: And the committee will recall that when we presented the information, we said that there were two application processes that the MSBA offered.

694
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:13,301
[SPEAKER_00]: One was called the Accelerated Repair Program, focusing on windows, boilers, and roofing projects.

695
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:20,224
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is the core program that takes on more extensive construction and rehabilitation projects.

696
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:31,748
[SPEAKER_00]: So the committee that evening voted to direct the administration to research these options and to come back to you with an update this evening related to which, if either of the applications

697
01:06:32,803 --> 01:06:33,644
[SPEAKER_00]: we would be pursuing.

698
01:06:33,704 --> 01:06:50,715
[SPEAKER_00]: So, excuse me, since that time, we've consulted with a variety of entities, vendors, and other districts that have pursued MSBA projects to seek their counsel as to put forth the most strategically prudent application.

699
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:59,080
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the pieces that was stressed to us throughout that process was that the MSBA has a stated, explicitly stated,

700
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:03,964
[SPEAKER_00]: preference for applications to be conducted in the district's own voice.

701
01:07:04,205 --> 01:07:17,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while conferring with and utilizing and capitalizing on the professional expertise that is available was something that certainly a number of the districts that were successful.

702
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:22,235
[SPEAKER_00]: in their applications advised would be a strategically prudent thing to do.

703
01:07:23,317 --> 01:07:34,970
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that ultimately the responsibility is on the district to make the determination as to which application to pursue and ultimately to submit that both before you and before the municipal council for an endorsement prior to submission.

704
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:58,089
[SPEAKER_00]: The update this evening is a short one in that, based on the timelines that are incorporated into the accelerated repair program and the current useful lifespan of many of the pieces of infrastructure that are included in the accelerated repair program, it is more advantageous for us to consider the core program

705
01:07:58,536 --> 01:08:12,988
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a deadline of April 28 and maybe April 29 I think it's April, April 28 for a submission and so I'm updating you to let you know that sometime in the course of the next month will come before you with a draft statement of interest and ask for you to endorse it.

706
01:08:13,649 --> 01:08:19,614
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a statement of interest, explaining the infrastructure challenges that we have at our flagship school Medford High School.

707
01:08:20,315 --> 01:08:42,788
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an announcement tonight that we are building a new high school I won't be very clear about that this is just updating you to let you know that we are going to explore the prospect of submitting a statement of interest, which is a very very preliminary step of keeping our options as a community open down the road, regardless of what happens with this application or frankly potentially subsequent applications.

708
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:52,476
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a process that is years long, but one that we have a responsibility based on the age of the building and the age of the infrastructure in the building to pursue.

709
01:08:53,197 --> 01:09:03,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll be doing that over the next several weeks and then returning to you with an update on the statement of interest for Medford High School with regard to the core program in the MSBA.

710
01:09:03,566 --> 01:09:06,088
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm happy to take any questions that you might have.

711
01:09:08,648 --> 01:09:24,257
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting, but our excitement is tempered because we want to make very clear that the scope of this project is not yet determined, and it's a years-long process that we have a tremendous amount of due diligence to do to make sure that we're exploring every potential option and the most cost-effective means possible for the community.

712
01:09:24,918 --> 01:09:25,898
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree, Ms.

713
01:09:25,919 --> 01:09:33,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith-Stone, that it is exciting and something that we have a responsibility both to our current students and future students of Medford High School to explore.

714
01:09:35,118 --> 01:09:45,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanna thank you, Mr. Murphy, for, I know you've worked with a number of different companies to try to get them in to evaluate the high school to make this closer to a reality.

715
01:09:45,285 --> 01:09:48,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So we appreciate all your hard work along with superintendent schools.

716
01:09:50,308 --> 01:09:51,429
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll all be working on this.

717
01:09:51,469 --> 01:09:57,773
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be asking the city council for support and we have a number of community members that are excited and helping however they can.

718
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yep, we're gonna make it happen, hopefully.

719
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:23,201
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we understand I said this in my email to you earlier, this is a big, it's a important first step, but also one that it's one of many, many steps to go before we sort of really have a sense as to what our options are as a community and we don't want to prejudge any of those we want to look at this as objectively as possible so that ultimately, when it comes time to make a recommendation to the community if that moment

720
01:10:24,325 --> 01:10:37,199
[SPEAKER_00]: we can stand behind that recommendation knowing that we've really looked at every single angle and we're putting forth what is both the best possible option from an educational perspective and also the most fiscally responsible option within that context.

721
01:10:39,422 --> 01:10:39,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

722
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:40,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

723
01:10:40,243 --> 01:10:41,004
[SPEAKER_03]: First up of many.

724
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:41,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

725
01:10:47,188 --> 01:10:51,269
[SPEAKER_03]: At number six, we have presentations of the public not to begin before 7 p.m.

726
01:10:51,609 --> 01:11:00,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Regular meetings of the Medford School Committee include this presentations of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

727
01:11:01,071 --> 01:11:03,272
[SPEAKER_03]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

728
01:11:03,772 --> 01:11:10,074
[SPEAKER_03]: These presentations and an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not an opportunity for dialogue with the committee.

729
01:11:10,554 --> 01:11:15,735
[SPEAKER_03]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that

730
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:19,421
[SPEAKER_03]: The item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

731
01:11:19,941 --> 01:11:26,905
[SPEAKER_03]: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public.

732
01:11:27,425 --> 01:11:36,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Pursuant to policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

733
01:11:37,191 --> 01:11:41,013
[SPEAKER_03]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

734
01:11:41,553 --> 01:11:42,474
[SPEAKER_03]: The speaker must begin

735
01:11:43,648 --> 01:11:47,631
[SPEAKER_03]: their comments providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

736
01:11:48,111 --> 01:11:52,634
[SPEAKER_03]: A welcoming, inclusive committee is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

737
01:11:53,094 --> 01:11:56,256
[SPEAKER_03]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

738
01:11:56,977 --> 01:11:59,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven, continued business.

739
01:11:59,878 --> 01:12:06,002
[SPEAKER_03]: 2022-9 offered by member Ruseau at the January 24th, 2022 school committee meeting.

740
01:12:06,763 --> 01:12:11,186
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules of the Medford School Committee have traditionally been passed down through the experience of members.

741
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:12,987
[SPEAKER_03]: While this has served us in the past,

742
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:36,404
[SPEAKER_03]: not best practice to have rules that are not written down for many reasons, such as the ability to bring new members into the committee efficiently, to ensure compliance and enforcement with our rules, agreement on what the rules are, provide transparency to the public on how we operate, to allow us to evolve our rules to improve over time and provide a clear mechanism to respond to changes in the law that have an effect on our rules.

743
01:12:36,424 --> 01:12:40,425
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a multi-year effort to discover best practices from other

744
01:12:41,246 --> 01:12:43,967
[SPEAKER_03]: communities throughout Massachusetts.

745
01:12:45,248 --> 01:12:52,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Document the rules we have been operating under, even when not written down, and bring these together to create a set of rules for the Medford School Committee.

746
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: With this rules document, we will have a place to begin.

747
01:12:57,815 --> 01:13:05,699
[SPEAKER_03]: These rules should not be thought of as immutable, but rather offer us a common ground to improve the functioning of the Medford School Committee.

748
01:13:06,545 --> 01:13:14,689
[SPEAKER_03]: for favorably after four hours from March 9th, 2022 committee of the whole, the rules of the school committee are recommended for adoption.

749
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:18,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have a question?

750
01:13:19,212 --> 01:13:20,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that by member Graham?

751
01:13:20,773 --> 01:13:21,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

752
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

753
01:13:23,954 --> 01:13:28,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have member Hays, then member Rousseau, then member McLaughlin.

754
01:13:30,258 --> 01:13:33,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a motion to replace the text for rule number 88.

755
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:38,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to go about this.

756
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:47,329
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a joint effort with member McLaughlin and member Rousseau on rule number 88 about creating a tracking system.

757
01:13:49,511 --> 01:13:53,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And they do have copies of the new, the proposed new text.

758
01:13:53,133 --> 01:13:57,637
[SPEAKER_16]: So a copy in our packet is not correct.

759
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:09,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a proposal for a new text to replace the text that's already in the current rules.

760
01:14:10,091 --> 01:14:15,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you provide us all a copy, or do you want to read it?

761
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:18,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I can read it, and I can provide a copy for everyone.

762
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:20,221
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's pass them around, and then we'll have you read it.

763
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:29,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So the proposed new rule number 88, the original rule really focused on items that were sent to subcommittee.

764
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:36,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So this broadens that a little bit to any or a lot to any action item that we propose.

765
01:14:36,871 --> 01:14:50,562
[SPEAKER_06]: It says the superintendent will maintain a tracking system to be made available to the public on the school committee page of the NPS website and containing the following information.

766
01:14:52,390 --> 01:15:19,050
[SPEAKER_06]: A, item number, B, date of meeting, C, date completed, D, when applicable, the respondent, superintendent or subcommittee, E, text of item, F, when applicable, date, if specified, response to be returned to the school committee, G, type of response requested,

767
01:15:19,696 --> 01:15:23,058
[SPEAKER_06]: for example, a verbal update, written report, or a presentation.

768
01:15:23,078 --> 01:15:27,480
[SPEAKER_06]: H, when applicable, subcommittee name.

769
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:35,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I, when applicable, meeting date or dates of subcommittee where the item has been on the agenda.

770
01:15:36,946 --> 01:15:41,148
[SPEAKER_06]: J, one or more status information containing the following information.

771
01:15:42,429 --> 01:15:44,210
[SPEAKER_06]: One, date of status entry.

772
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, status indicator.

773
01:15:46,912 --> 01:15:49,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Underneath that is one, pending action.

774
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:52,373
[SPEAKER_06]: two in progress or three completed.

775
01:15:55,795 --> 01:15:58,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

776
01:15:58,576 --> 01:15:58,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

777
01:16:06,021 --> 01:16:07,722
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the addition we have?

778
01:16:07,922 --> 01:16:08,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we just?

779
01:16:10,223 --> 01:16:13,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the man there, member McLaughlin.

780
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:15,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so if you guys are looking at page 12,

781
01:16:19,053 --> 01:16:45,727
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 on the rules document that was provided in the packet and you align them you'll see that there's a hij added and then maybe the member haze can elaborate if there's more but you know if you just put the two items side by side on your page 13 of your rules and member haze document it might help clarify.

782
01:16:46,547 --> 01:16:47,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Also the beginning text

783
01:16:48,648 --> 01:17:00,540
[SPEAKER_06]: The current one, not the replacement text that we're looking at, says the superintendent will maintain a tracking system identifying the items sent to subcommittee containing the following information.

784
01:17:01,661 --> 01:17:08,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So the current one, again, broadens that, or takes out that specific, that it's only things sent to subcommittee.

785
01:17:08,988 --> 01:17:11,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It's any action item that we would present.

786
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,765
[SPEAKER_03]: was trying to evaluate in my head how much staff time it would take to do the rest of this.

787
01:17:24,892 --> 01:17:30,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my wondering is where you're saying an action item and this, the original

788
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:40,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, do you feel they're saying the same thing?

789
01:17:40,716 --> 01:17:46,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there are some items that we request or actions we request that don't necessarily get sent to subcommittee.

790
01:17:48,283 --> 01:18:01,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, I actually had a parent ask me today about an item from early in the year, actually more like September before I was even on committee, about getting left-handed desks for the classrooms.

791
01:18:01,954 --> 01:18:03,676
[SPEAKER_06]: That didn't get sent to subcommittee,

792
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:11,034
[SPEAKER_06]: but it was an action item in the sense that we were expecting an action to happen, the left-handed desks.

793
01:18:11,874 --> 01:18:22,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So following up on that, this would allow for, this would create a way for that to be able to be followed up and also for the community to be able to see how things get followed up on.

794
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:30,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that clarify?

795
01:18:32,114 --> 01:18:42,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's clarifying, but I'm just more concerned about the manageability of adding more and more.

796
01:18:43,449 --> 01:18:43,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

797
01:18:43,989 --> 01:18:45,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Weiss is raising her hand.

798
01:19:21,327 --> 01:19:24,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Susie, the folks on Zoom can't hear you.

799
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you talk into the microphone?

800
01:19:28,993 --> 01:19:29,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

801
01:19:33,036 --> 01:19:35,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you can right at the desk there if you want.

802
01:19:40,948 --> 01:19:42,929
[SPEAKER_03]: The red light goes on.

803
01:19:43,089 --> 01:19:51,415
[SPEAKER_15]: So currently the document, the tracking document already lists all of the resolutions from fiscal year 2022.

804
01:19:52,196 --> 01:19:58,060
[SPEAKER_15]: It does not list any other item that might be brought up during the school committee that somebody has a request for.

805
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:04,245
[SPEAKER_15]: I do keep a list separately of things that come up during meetings, but it's not an official document.

806
01:20:04,645 --> 01:20:07,447
[SPEAKER_15]: But both of these items are found in the school committee drive

807
01:20:08,116 --> 01:20:11,078
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm concerned about whether it needs to be on the website.

808
01:20:11,258 --> 01:20:14,700
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not know that this was something that was going to be on the website.

809
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:19,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Does your resolution include that it's on the website?

810
01:20:19,343 --> 01:20:30,230
[SPEAKER_06]: It does, yes, with the intent of making it more transparent for the community to be able to see how we follow up on things and what the resolution has been.

811
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:37,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there is a sense in the community that there are things requested that they don't ever hear the resolution to.

812
01:20:40,597 --> 01:20:40,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor.

813
01:20:41,918 --> 01:20:42,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

814
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:58,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it be possible to simply put a link to the document on the website so that way the document can continue to be the one place you maintain and the people who want to see can go to the website.

815
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:00,271
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same way.

816
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:01,171
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a problem.

817
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:01,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

818
01:21:01,411 --> 01:21:07,836
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not it's not a clean, you know, beautiful document that has that

819
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:11,287
[SPEAKER_15]: because things are always pending and whatever.

820
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:25,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, it's not, I think it's a working document that the way that I had built the document was a working tracking document, not as a public statement, but it can be linked at any time.

821
01:21:25,771 --> 01:21:27,951
[SPEAKER_15]: It just isn't what it was built for.

822
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:32,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also have the, always have the minute, the agenda and the minutes as well.

823
01:21:33,304 --> 01:21:36,925
[SPEAKER_03]: to track what is taking place at meetings.

824
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:45,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, so there was also the original this is this is not extremely different from the original rule that we already, I think, discussed.

825
01:21:45,748 --> 01:21:55,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I think part of the question is having a having a tracker that's more user friendly for people to be able to see you know what

826
01:21:56,507 --> 01:22:02,832
[SPEAKER_06]: what we've asked for, how we get, again, I feel like I'm being redundant, but I think it's an accountability measure too.

827
01:22:02,892 --> 01:22:16,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the one you're talking about is probably, like you said, it's not necessarily what this is referring to in the sense that yours is more of a, was meant to be more of an internal tracking.

828
01:22:16,183 --> 01:22:24,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're trying to look for a way, I believe, to make things clearer for everyone and to hold us all accountable, not just

829
01:22:24,929 --> 01:22:47,740
[SPEAKER_06]: the administration, but I think, you know, we share the school committee members share some responsibility in this and making sure that we're clear when we're asking for something, something to be done or resolution for a new process, whatever it is that we're clear about what response we're expecting when we're hoping to get that response.

830
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we follow up on it at a meeting.

831
01:22:50,781 --> 01:22:52,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone knows that it has been

832
01:22:53,744 --> 01:22:54,524
[SPEAKER_06]: followed through on.

833
01:22:56,065 --> 01:22:59,027
[SPEAKER_04]: It was looking for really a more defined process for that.

834
01:23:07,018 --> 01:23:09,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel like it is an additional layer.

835
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:13,361
[SPEAKER_05]: We've changed the agenda.

836
01:23:14,081 --> 01:23:20,384
[SPEAKER_05]: We now list the meeting date requested, the date that a document was submitted.

837
01:23:21,065 --> 01:23:22,766
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have an internal form.

838
01:23:22,786 --> 01:23:27,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I am concerned if Ms.

839
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Weiss feels that it's something that she can handle.

840
01:23:31,908 --> 01:23:41,652
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just feel it's another added layer of keeping all the documents, keeping them, the school committee records, everything.

841
01:23:42,332 --> 01:23:44,713
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to keep it recorded and documented.

842
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:45,973
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the minutes.

843
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:50,095
[SPEAKER_05]: The minutes would say if something is being done.

844
01:23:50,175 --> 01:23:54,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, again, there is an internal document, which she talked about.

845
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:57,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a clean document that was

846
01:23:58,835 --> 01:24:04,377
[SPEAKER_05]: It's shared on your drive but not with the public, so it will have to be revamped.

847
01:24:05,797 --> 01:24:12,900
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to go on the website and I just, I just feel like the amount of when you keep saying accountability.

848
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:29,599
[SPEAKER_05]: We have put so many systems and structures in place additional systems and structures in place that did not exist before, that it's going to get to the point that you spend so much time focusing on systems and structures that you can't get the actual work done.

849
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:36,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was trying to go back and forth to see what the difference was.

850
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:44,108
[SPEAKER_05]: between what was originally proposed in 88 and this revised version.

851
01:24:44,988 --> 01:25:02,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a fine line between what's realistic and what ends up becoming burdensome because there's so many layers, so much paperwork that it's gonna slow down the productivity of what we wanna be able to do.

852
01:25:03,193 --> 01:25:10,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just saying that, to be, you know, fully transparent and honest, we're not trying to hide anything we do have left handed desks.

853
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:24,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if certain things there's a specific ask or request, and community members reach out to you, you guys have access to to it within the drive to be able to see if it's being done.

854
01:25:25,448 --> 01:25:30,832
[SPEAKER_05]: and or just put a resolution to say, you know, we need an update on something.

855
01:25:31,412 --> 01:25:38,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just, I'm nervous that we keep putting in so many systems and structures that it's going to be overwhelming.

856
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:53,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And the quality of the work that really should be done is going to be diminished because we are trying to item number, date of meeting, date completed, when applicable, who's the respondent, text of item, the date,

857
01:25:53,908 --> 01:26:00,090
[SPEAKER_05]: response to be returned, type of response requested, verbal update, written report, presentation.

858
01:26:01,231 --> 01:26:02,971
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot.

859
01:26:03,251 --> 01:26:05,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanna be honest and say that it's a lot.

860
01:26:08,573 --> 01:26:09,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ms.

861
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:10,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Stone.

862
01:26:10,834 --> 01:26:19,537
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand it's a lot when you just read it out loud, but I also know that since I've been on for six years, we have been asking to have a system like the city council.

863
01:26:19,577 --> 01:26:21,958
[SPEAKER_12]: So we know, just thinking right now,

864
01:26:22,535 --> 01:26:24,997
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about the McGlynn roof that kindergarten classroom.

865
01:26:25,297 --> 01:26:31,102
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm imagining it got fixed because we haven't heard from parents or teachers, but we never got an official response back from that.

866
01:26:31,902 --> 01:26:34,184
[SPEAKER_12]: We had students here about the bathrooms at the high school.

867
01:26:34,264 --> 01:26:35,465
[SPEAKER_12]: We hear that they're getting built.

868
01:26:35,825 --> 01:26:36,866
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't had an update.

869
01:26:36,946 --> 01:26:41,890
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no way to look for me to say to parents when they reach out to me, oh, yep, the bathrooms are coming in May of 2022.

870
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:47,276
[SPEAKER_12]: We had the girls locker room that parents emailed regularly.

871
01:26:47,716 --> 01:26:56,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, the students at the high school is still telling me that the locker room has not had a great facelift that it's still looking similar to that it looked in September.

872
01:26:57,026 --> 01:27:03,794
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I understand when you read it out loud but I feel like those are quick entries of a date.

873
01:27:04,577 --> 01:27:15,703
[SPEAKER_12]: the person who said it, the meeting time for the subcommittee, but it is frustrating as a school committee member that parents email us repeatedly and we don't have answers for them.

874
01:27:16,123 --> 01:27:18,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's just almost getting into the habit.

875
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:20,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything is hard at the beginning.

876
01:27:21,146 --> 01:27:23,347
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we kind of get into a flow with school committee.

877
01:27:23,367 --> 01:27:24,827
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll say the things more clearly.

878
01:27:25,168 --> 01:27:27,789
[SPEAKER_12]: So the minutes can be more clear for the,

879
01:27:30,031 --> 01:27:30,672
[SPEAKER_12]: minute takers.

880
01:27:32,317 --> 01:27:34,684
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do think this is something that's very necessary.

881
01:27:34,704 --> 01:27:37,331
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if there was a first if I can be the second.

882
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,381
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a motion on the floor.

883
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:41,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a motion on the floor at the end of the second.

884
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:45,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, Member Ruseau, did you want to speak on this as well?

885
01:27:46,025 --> 01:27:47,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

886
01:27:47,266 --> 01:27:48,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Just real quick, I did want to also speak.

887
01:27:48,927 --> 01:27:49,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

888
01:27:50,108 --> 01:27:56,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly understand how many steps are involved with a lot of things is something that can be burdensome.

889
01:27:56,893 --> 01:27:59,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't, for a second, want to disagree with that.

890
01:28:00,295 --> 01:28:04,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to say that my interest in this actually was about holding us accountable.

891
01:28:05,539 --> 01:28:06,920
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my fifth year.

892
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:14,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And I keep my I have my own tracker for the things that I put forward but I do not track the things that other members put forward.

893
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:25,060
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, if I didn't write it, and somebody says to me as member of my stone just said, you know, what about that thing, I can remember the conversations I can remember the vote.

894
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:38,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any way to, I mean, do we want to fill the agenda up every week with the 20 or 30 things that we've all thought of as wait, didn't we vote on that three years ago, let's get an update.

895
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:43,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the number of reports that will show up to give us updates to things for which, you know,

896
01:28:45,365 --> 01:28:51,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Murphy wasn't even here, we've asked for things that didn't get fulfilled from before he was here.

897
01:28:52,128 --> 01:28:57,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't know we don't have a clean list of outstanding things and the council does.

898
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:03,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the council's spreadsheet which looks to me like a Google Doc is.

899
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:23,006
[SPEAKER_09]: is the way to go, and short of buying some kind of software to make it an easier, but I understand that it is in fact additional tedium, really, I mean it's just additional tedium but I agree with my room of stone that we just, we have to have this for ourselves.

900
01:29:24,407 --> 01:29:27,528
[SPEAKER_09]: above and beyond accountability with the administration.

901
01:29:27,668 --> 01:29:31,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I just can't, I can't personally be tracking what every member writes.

902
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:34,869
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just not my job or role.

903
01:29:34,949 --> 01:29:38,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So I look forward to voting on this, hopefully.

904
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:41,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, motion on the floor.

905
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:47,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was seconded, and that is to approve with this amendment.

906
01:29:48,973 --> 01:29:49,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So roll call, please.

907
01:29:55,373 --> 01:29:55,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

908
01:29:56,874 --> 01:29:57,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

909
01:29:58,374 --> 01:29:58,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays.

910
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:00,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

911
01:30:01,015 --> 01:30:01,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Krebs.

912
01:30:03,876 --> 01:30:05,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have one quick question.

913
01:30:05,257 --> 01:30:09,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So are we voting to accept the whole rule policy or to vote on the motion?

914
01:30:09,959 --> 01:30:11,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, as amended with that one amendment to 88.

915
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:13,260
[SPEAKER_05]: No, ma'am.

916
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:14,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

917
01:30:16,021 --> 01:30:19,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to say no, because I'm not happy with that amendment.

918
01:30:20,703 --> 01:30:23,944
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess I'm a no, because I'm voting on the whole policy.

919
01:30:25,066 --> 01:30:25,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

920
01:30:26,667 --> 01:30:28,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau.

921
01:30:29,168 --> 01:30:33,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, I thought we were voting just on this, and if we're not, we wanted to split the decision.

922
01:30:33,131 --> 01:30:36,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to split the motion, because I thought we were just voting on the amendment at this point.

923
01:30:37,673 --> 01:30:48,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I would make a motion to, if we need to, to split the motion so that it's a motion singularly for the Rule 88 amendment.

924
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:54,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to sever the amendment from the full rules document

925
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:59,282
[SPEAKER_03]: by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays.

926
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:00,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

927
01:31:02,104 --> 01:31:02,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

928
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:07,526
[SPEAKER_09]: We never had a motion to approve the rules at all yet.

929
01:31:08,087 --> 01:31:11,328
[SPEAKER_09]: We were just doing the Rule 88 amendment.

930
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:14,910
[SPEAKER_09]: So one second while I clean up my notes here.

931
01:31:16,031 --> 01:31:18,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

932
01:31:19,092 --> 01:31:19,873
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have a motion.

933
01:31:19,913 --> 01:31:20,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have a second.

934
01:31:22,326 --> 01:31:23,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just pending.

935
01:31:23,507 --> 01:31:24,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham made a motion.

936
01:31:25,088 --> 01:31:26,930
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's make a motion to sever.

937
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:34,916
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like there's a motion to sever on the floor, seconded roll call on the motion to sever, and then we'll take the amendment first.

938
01:31:37,098 --> 01:31:37,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

939
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:38,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

940
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays.

941
01:31:41,061 --> 01:31:41,281

945
01:31:46,566 --> 01:31:46,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:31:47,486 --> 01:31:48,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Rossell, yes.

947
01:31:48,827 --> 01:31:49,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Longo, correct.

948
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:52,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

949
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:54,352

01:32:10,703 --> 01:32:11,203

960
01:32:16,827 --> 01:32:17,107

[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

965
01:32:23,462 --> 01:32:26,363

966
01:32:26,963 --> 01:32:28,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The amendment has been approved.

967
01:32:29,464 --> 01:32:31,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up we have a motion to approve.

968
01:32:32,285 --> 01:32:33,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau.

969
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:34,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I have.

970
01:32:38,115 --> 01:32:39,356
[SPEAKER_09]: a few amendments.

971
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:40,936
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could offer them all together.

972
01:32:40,976 --> 01:32:43,598
[SPEAKER_09]: They are all corrections after having gone through it.

973
01:32:44,578 --> 01:32:48,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And none of them are changes to rules other than the fact that they're changes to language.

974
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:53,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it's okay, may I just read these and see if we can accept them as a group?

975
01:32:54,963 --> 01:32:55,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, members.

976
01:32:55,623 --> 01:32:57,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so, um,

977
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:04,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Rule number nine in your packet says that the meeting will be at 6.30.

978
01:33:04,594 --> 01:33:07,275
[SPEAKER_09]: We had agreed in other rules that it will be six o'clock.

979
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:11,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is to change rule number nine to say six o'clock.

980
01:33:13,758 --> 01:33:17,219
[SPEAKER_09]: The current language of rule number nine

981
01:33:19,157 --> 01:33:28,499
[SPEAKER_09]: 2020 says that the chair will schedule one annual meeting with the city council but it doesn't say the school committee isn't part of that language.

982
01:33:28,759 --> 01:33:39,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So, the language that I have written down as to replace that as the chair will schedule one annual joint meeting of the school committee and the city council, which is clearly what we intended when we were speaking.

983
01:33:42,002 --> 01:33:47,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Rule 47 presently has a reference to the work to rule 74 but it should say rule 75 and rule 75 has a reference to rule 47, but it said should say 46 and rule 87.

984
01:34:00,492 --> 01:34:04,835
[SPEAKER_09]: has, again, another number that's just the wrong number, because we had removed and added some rules.

985
01:34:04,915 --> 01:34:08,977
[SPEAKER_09]: So it will say rule 86 will be applied to new members upon a vacancy of the school committee.

986
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:12,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the items.

987
01:34:12,339 --> 01:34:14,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if there's a motion to approve those.

988
01:34:15,461 --> 01:34:16,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

989
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:17,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

990
01:34:17,982 --> 01:34:18,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion.

991
01:34:19,963 --> 01:34:26,727
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so there's a motion to approve the amendments made by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

992
01:34:26,968 --> 01:34:27,428

[SPEAKER_03]: 2022-27 offered by Member Hays, Member McLaughlin, and Member Mustone.

1051
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:17,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the school committee appropriated funds to purchase the NWEA map assessment, and MPS is now completing the first year of system-wide implementation, be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools Administration provide an update on the implementation as outlined in the ad hoc report request below.

1052
01:37:18,505 --> 01:37:20,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Title, update on implementation of

1053
01:37:21,425 --> 01:37:22,746
[SPEAKER_03]: NWEA map.

1054
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:23,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions.

1055
01:37:23,707 --> 01:37:29,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, how are teachers using map data from the program to inform their instruction?

1056
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:34,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Please provide examples from our teachers K through two, three through five, six through eight, nine through 12.

1057
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:38,716
[SPEAKER_03]: What does the report the teachers received look like?

1058
01:37:39,477 --> 01:37:47,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Are teachers receiving ongoing professional development and or provided time to meet and grade level teams to collaborate on how to analyze the use and use the data?

1059
01:37:48,389 --> 01:37:54,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Are the NWEA map results matching teachers' perceptions of their students' current performance level?

1060
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:59,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Are map results being analyzed and used for other purposes and to inform classroom instruction?

1061
01:38:00,852 --> 01:38:04,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents are expressing confusion about how to interpret the map report for families.

1062
01:38:05,253 --> 01:38:10,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Metro Public Schools planning to provide additional information, videos, Zoom information sessions, et cetera?

1063
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:18,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Our special education teachers able to use map results to inform their IEP goals and objectives, specific examples.

1064
01:38:19,241 --> 01:38:23,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Our teachers of English language learners finding they can use map results to inform their instruction.

1065
01:38:24,742 --> 01:38:32,604
[SPEAKER_03]: How long is it taking students to complete the assessment at each grade level and how are our students responding emotionally as they take the test?

1066
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:39,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Data expected presented at or before the June 6th school committee meeting and it was requested on March 21st, 2022.

1067
01:38:40,727 --> 01:38:41,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Their motion for approval.

1068
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:44,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays.

1069
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:52,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval by Member Hays, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1070
01:38:52,351 --> 01:38:53,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call, please.

1071
01:38:53,192 --> 01:38:54,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a question?

1072
01:38:54,093 --> 01:38:55,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham, before the roll is called.

1073
01:38:56,915 --> 01:39:03,921
[SPEAKER_14]: So as I was looking at this, it felt like sort of two things were trying to happen.

1074
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:08,485
[SPEAKER_14]: One is we were trying to be responsive to the questions that I think we're all hearing from parents.

1075
01:39:08,505 --> 01:39:11,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I got a question last week about the

1076
01:39:11,785 --> 01:39:21,133
[SPEAKER_14]: The feature on the website that allows you to look at like how scores are tracking towards various colleges and whether that implies or means or doesn't mean that.

1077
01:39:22,895 --> 01:39:33,584
[SPEAKER_14]: score these scores would be reported to colleges, I think there's a lot of questions in the parent community about what's going on, and then there were a couple of questions specifically for for five.

1078
01:39:34,981 --> 01:40:04,275
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe just four and five or maybe five a um that were really more about the implementation that would pertain to us and I just wondered if it would be even better to have to ask the administration to do like a recorded zoom of some kind for the community so that there's something lasting that can be posted that can live past the immediate questions that we have this year that can help

1079
01:40:04,632 --> 01:40:06,292
[SPEAKER_14]: parents come in next year, etc.

1080
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:21,797
[SPEAKER_14]: versus like having them come and present at a meeting that is attended roughly like this one, where there aren't that many folks involved and people may or may not want to weed through a whole meeting to try to get to the to the piece that they're looking for.

1081
01:40:21,817 --> 01:40:25,438
[SPEAKER_14]: But then also, questions four and five

1082
01:40:26,212 --> 01:40:36,688
[SPEAKER_14]: In particular, were to me more about the implementation and things that this committee would be like more uniquely interested in talking about in terms of like, how is this going, how is it aligning.

1083
01:40:37,249 --> 01:40:38,130
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the thing.

1084
01:40:41,628 --> 01:40:51,832
[SPEAKER_14]: it seems missing a really important element, which is we should be receiving aggregated information at the school committee every time this test is handed out.

1085
01:40:51,952 --> 01:41:01,697
[SPEAKER_14]: And we haven't received any data about what's happening at a district wide level, essentially, to know are our students where we expect them to be?

1086
01:41:01,897 --> 01:41:02,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there growth?

1087
01:41:03,297 --> 01:41:08,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it sufficient growth, et cetera, which I think are the questions that this group is particularly interested in answering.

1088
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:09,580
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess I would just,

1089
01:41:10,757 --> 01:41:22,185
[SPEAKER_14]: have a couple of questions for the folks who put this forward about whether those possibilities are interesting, agreeable, and what thoughts you all have on those things as you put this together.

1090
01:41:25,367 --> 01:41:26,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hays?

1091
01:41:28,169 --> 01:41:39,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think in terms of the aggregated data, I think what we've been hearing from the administration is that this first year of implementation, especially immediately post-COVID, that that data may not be

1092
01:41:41,018 --> 01:41:44,621
[SPEAKER_06]: fully accurate or useful at this point in some ways.

1093
01:41:45,301 --> 01:42:03,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the teachers, I guess my understanding when it was presented to, and this predated me too, but that the hope for the NWEA map was to really provide data that teachers could use to inform their instruction rather than just broad data like the MCAS might give us.

1094
01:42:04,155 --> 01:42:07,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Now there is some broad data that I'm sure over time would be used too.

1095
01:42:08,767 --> 01:42:21,362
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess my thought was more looking at, at this moment, is it really serving to inform instruction, especially because we are getting questions about the time that it takes versus its usefulness.

1096
01:42:21,562 --> 01:42:27,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it can be hard to, on the one hand, explain to parents

1097
01:42:28,949 --> 01:42:37,533
[SPEAKER_06]: that this one test doesn't decide your child's whole future, but it does provide information that teachers can use.

1098
01:42:38,013 --> 01:42:46,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to get, as the phrase goes, drill down into that a little bit, because I thought that was the main purpose really of the map.

1099
01:42:49,159 --> 01:42:55,902
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the part that I wasn't really clear what you were suggesting in terms of the part for the parents, I definitely think it would be good to have

1100
01:42:56,907 --> 01:42:59,349
[SPEAKER_06]: something, as you said, that parents can look back to.

1101
01:42:59,369 --> 01:43:13,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I was just suggesting that the vast majority of these questions are really questions that I've heard from members of the community that parents would have an interest in in a continuing way.

1102
01:43:14,059 --> 01:43:22,144
[SPEAKER_14]: And rather than asking the administration to prepare a report to us, which is fine, but

1103
01:43:23,408 --> 01:43:36,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it could be more useful if it was instead an information session available and geared towards parents, because I think it's going to have a slightly different level of information if that audience is catered to appropriately.

1104
01:43:36,432 --> 01:43:48,916
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems like we could get what we need from that, and parents could be better served in that way, versus having a report here amongst a really thin audience.

1105
01:43:52,760 --> 01:44:03,142
[SPEAKER_14]: know, then that getting lost in the shuffle of school committee meeting recordings, where something about MAP could be on the website, parents could look at it from year to year, it could evolve over time.

1106
01:44:04,803 --> 01:44:16,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, my question about that would be if we don't do it as part of a school committee meeting, would we have the opportunity to ask questions if we need clarification or want to have a better understanding of how it's being utilized?

1107
01:44:18,822 --> 01:44:22,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there are still questions that are school committee worthy here.

1108
01:44:22,184 --> 01:44:29,867
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just suggesting that there are two different masters we're trying to you know, achieve.

1109
01:44:29,907 --> 01:44:39,332
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to get to two completely different audiences and trying to use one presentation to do that may or may not be as effective.

1110
01:44:39,852 --> 01:44:46,315
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think we certainly would, I would certainly be interested in a presentation that

1111
01:44:47,227 --> 01:44:50,529
[SPEAKER_14]: talks about like, how is this matching teacher perception and number four?

1112
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:57,154
[SPEAKER_14]: And like, are they, are the map results being analyzed and used for purposes other than to inform classroom instruction?

1113
01:44:57,234 --> 01:44:58,275
[SPEAKER_14]: And if so, what are they?

1114
01:44:59,256 --> 01:45:13,186
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, again, the school committee reporting, I'm fine with taking data, knowing that it's the first year and that it's a pandemic and it's all those things, but I still want to see the data of how our schools are performing.

1115
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:16,752
[SPEAKER_14]: which I think is perfectly appropriate for this meeting.

1116
01:45:16,772 --> 01:45:25,297
[SPEAKER_14]: It just feels like there's two different things happening in here, and maybe there are two different ways to deliver that information so that they get to the audiences that they need.

1117
01:45:31,141 --> 01:45:35,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to offer anything as a specific amendment, Member Graham?

1118
01:45:36,524 --> 01:45:38,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just looking for some feedback, that's all.

1119
01:45:38,686 --> 01:45:43,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, seeing Member Hays, you thought maybe the video recording for parents was a good idea?

1120
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:45,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a fine idea.

1121
01:45:45,740 --> 01:46:01,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that there's any questions in here that I don't think that would also be appropriate for us to have the opportunity to hear as part of a school committee meeting, though I'm not quite sure which questions member Graham is referring to that would be part of the video as opposed to the school committee meeting.

1122
01:46:02,685 --> 01:46:12,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like one, two, three, five, B, six, seven, and eight are all questions that in my mind would be of interest to families.

1123
01:46:13,134 --> 01:46:27,358
[SPEAKER_14]: where that information could be delivered to families versus the stuff about truly the implementation that's time limited, it's time sensitive, really does belong here.

1124
01:46:28,458 --> 01:46:40,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could have a presentation on this and whatever we have in writing, the superintendent can add to a Friday update, even if it's just a link to our website with a report.

1125
01:46:42,854 --> 01:46:44,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure, I'm confused, are we still going?

1126
01:46:44,995 --> 01:46:48,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine, it's fine, I'm fine, just vote.

1127
01:46:50,017 --> 01:46:55,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, motion for approval by Member Hays, seconded by... Second.
