 La reanudación de la consideración de la petición de DIV Fellsway LLC, The Davis Company, es para un permiso integral de conformidad con las Leyes Generales de Massachusetts, Capítulo 40B, para un desarrollo de apartamentos multifamiliar de seis pisos ubicado en aproximadamente 3,4 acres de terreno en 970 Fellsway, ID de propiedad 7-02-10.
 Esta propuesta se desarrollará como aproximadamente 289 unidades que constan de 278 unidades de vivienda multifamiliar y 11 casas adosadas, de las cuales 73, 25% del total de unidades serán designadas como vivienda asequible para hogares de ingresos bajos o moderados.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=126.577s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Excelente.
 Gracias, Dennis.
 Muy bien amigos, para aquellos que no están familiarizados con el proceso 40B, esta es una audiencia de varias sesiones.
 La junta se ha estado reuniendo sobre este asunto desde finales del año pasado.
 Contamos con sesiones temáticas.
 El tema de la sesión de hoy es el diseño.
 Entonces sé que la junta recibió actualizaciones del paquete de diseño recientemente.
 Por eso creo que la intención es analizar eso hoy.
 Veo que tenemos varios representantes para el solicitante.
 Se lo entregaré a Pat Noon.
 Bienvenido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=163.161s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Gracias, señor presidente, miembros de la junta.
 Gracias por invitarnos esta noche.
 Hay varios miembros del equipo aquí listos para presentar.
 Le pediré a Eric Samuelson del cubo 3 que comparta su pantalla y realice la mayor parte de la presentación esta noche.
 Esperaré a que mencione eso y le daré una introducción rápida y le daré la vuelta.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=198.291s">[Unidentified]</a>: Todo el mundo debería poder ver eso ahora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=203.452s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Excelente.
 Gracias.
 Así que, como dije, nos complace estar aquí esta noche.
 Gracias a todos nuevamente por tomarse el tiempo para tenernos en la agenda.
 Esta noche presentaremos con un enfoque en el avance del diseño y los diversos elementos de la arquitectura.
 Solo como una actualización de nuestra última audiencia, hemos seguido avanzando con respecto a nuestra audiencia anterior de enfoque de diseño en febrero.
 El equipo de diseño se reunió con Cliff y miembros del personal de planificación y realizó un seguimiento.
 Sesión de revisión por pares y comentarios recopilados e incorporarlos a nuestra presentación de esta noche.
 Por lo tanto, esperamos presentar varios elementos de los planos de planta de diseño, elevaciones y una actualización del estudio de sombra con un cierre como revisión y actualización del plano general del sitio y los beneficios públicos relacionados con eso.
 Entonces, Eric, te dejaré la palabra para que intervengas y.
 presente de aquí en adelante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=277.86s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  That's good.
 Thank you, Pat.
 Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.
 So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.
 So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.
 I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.
 So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.
 This is our current landscape plan.
 This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.
 So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.
 More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.
 uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.
 And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.
 We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.
 Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.
 So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.
 You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.
 So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.
 So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.
 So here you'll see our ground floor plan.
 This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.
 Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.
 We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.
 This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.
 In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.
 This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.
 So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.
 This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.
 We have our bike storage.
 We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.
 In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.
 The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.
 Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.
 This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.
 We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.
 Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.
 We'll probably have some fitness located up here.
 So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.
 The units are all encapsulated here.
 The yellow would be your studio units.
 The purple would be your one bed units.
 The green would be your two bed units.
 And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.
 So moving up a floor plan.
 So this would be our typical floor three through five.
 And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.
 That's our most typical plan for three floors.
 One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.
 you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.
 So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.
 And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.
 And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.
 So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.
 The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.
 We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.
 So jumping into the concept design image.
 So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.
 This is conceptual design.
 So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.
 So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.
 This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.
 In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.
 So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.
 So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.
 And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.
 And part of the reason for that is one,
 from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.
 You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.
 So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.
 But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.
 So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.
 So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.
 And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.
 So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.
 There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.
 Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.
 One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.
 You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.
 This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor
 gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.
 Here you can see we have the five-story piece.
 You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.
 Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.
 This north elevation is the elevation that's
 most facing Myrtle Street.
 So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.
 You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.
 Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.
 And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.
 You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.
 and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.
 We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.
 There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.
 And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.
 you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Fellsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.
 So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.
 And then just briefly the townhome elevations.
 So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.
 Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.
 And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.
 So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.
 You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.
 So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.
 Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.
 And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.
 We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.
 And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.
 And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.
 So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.
 And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.
 And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.
 So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
 All right, so shadow study.
 So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.
 So we're going to show three items here.
 We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.
 The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.
 And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.
 And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.
 And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.
 So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.
 And this is the 9 a.m.
 condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.
 So this is the existing condition at those times of year.
 And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.
 And so we also looked at it
 as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.
 So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.
 And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.
 and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.
 So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.
 And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.
 That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.
 on those adjacent properties.
 So it's not that until 10 a.m.
 you are in a cloud of darkness.
 There's a lot of space between the buildings.
 There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.
 There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.
 And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.
 So here you'll see the 9 a.m.
 condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.
 This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.
 So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.
 and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.
 And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.
 And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.
 For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.
 And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.
 The sun's a lot higher in the air.
 So you'll see a lot less shadow.
 And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.
 So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.
 summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.
 So it's about only a 15 minute difference.
 In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.
 From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.
 So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.
 So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.
 Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.
 Three, the potential rail trail connection here.
 Four, we have our internal courtyards.
 One's
 potentially a little bit more active with the pool.
 Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.
 Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.
 Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with
 you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.
 I think we've been improving that each step along the way.
 I think
 where we are now is much better than where we started.
 And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.
 And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.
 But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.
 And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.
 So that is all.
 I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1314.237s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Gracias.
 Entonces, tal vez tenga sentido ir a ver a Cliff Bomer a continuación, solo para conocer tus pensamientos generales, Cliff.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1328.783s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: ¿Puedes oírme?
 Está bien.
 Fantástico.
 Hola a todos.
 Y la última sesión que tuvimos que incluyó al personal de la ciudad fue hace apenas seis días, el día 20.
 He visto la mayor parte de lo que se mostró.
 Hay algunas diferencias, pero menores.
 Y creo que, sólo quiero enfatizar que creo que
 Probablemente se habrá dado cuenta de que la mayoría de mis comentarios han estado relacionados con la planificación del sitio hasta este momento, lo que para mí es el lugar correcto para comenzar.
 No tiene sentido hablar en detalle sobre la masa de los edificios, etcétera, y ciertamente sobre los materiales de ubicación, incluso los planos de planta, hasta que haya una masa.
 son hasta que la huella realmente funciona, lo que realmente se trata principalmente del compromiso del edificio con las calles vecinas.
 Y he apoyado mucho el avance de este proyecto desde esa perspectiva.
 Y creo que ahora estamos viendo el puente hacia la arquitectura misma.
 Es importante.
 Estos son realmente conceptuales.
 dibujos, pero creo que reflejan, desde mi perspectiva, que el proyecto avanza en la dirección correcta.
 Ciertamente el importante retroceso de ese último piso es realmente crítico.
 Y volví a hacer un pequeño recorrido por Google Street View, sólo para recordar la escala de los edificios en Amaranth.
 hasta qué punto ese escalón hacia abajo en la elevación larga de norte a sur del edificio funcionó en relación con la escala de los edificios al otro lado de la calle.
 Y creo que sabes por estar allí o como lo sabes a través de Google o por estar allí, esos edificios
 En realidad, creo que funciona muy bien porque los edificios al otro lado de la calle tienen menos pisos ocupables, pero en realidad tienen una línea de puente bastante alta en los edificios e incluso algunos de los edificios vecinos muy cercanos.
 Subes para llegar al primer piso.
 A menudo hay tres pisos habitables y luego un techo inclinado.
 Así que creo que ese paso hacia abajo, en lo que respecta a la escala,
 está funcionando muy bien.
 Repasaré algunas de las cosas que aún estaban pendientes después de nuestra sesión de la semana pasada y que creo que son muy buenas pistas sobre cómo avanzar en el diseño del edificio en sí.
 Creo que una cosa de la que hablamos fue
 Es un edificio grande.
 Y ahora mismo, todas las elevaciones son similares.
 Creo que los movimientos en el lado norte son muy efectivos para acentuar la pieza de entrada justo al lado del camino de entrada, lo cual funciona muy bien para mí.
 Pero tenga en cuenta que el resto del lado este de esa elevación norte también es espacio común.
 y creo que vale la pena estudiar si una mayor diferenciación de ese espacio sería útil o no.
 Creo que otro punto fueron los aspectos de sostenibilidad del edificio.
 Hablamos de tratamientos de ventanas similares en todo el edificio.
 Y creo que sería,
 Realmente vale la pena seguir teniendo la actitud hacia la sostenibilidad reflejada en las elevaciones del edificio.
 Y realmente hay tipos muy diferentes de tratamiento que creo que se pueden considerar dependiendo de si estás mirando una elevación orientada al norte o hacia el oeste.
 Puede que tenga que ver con qué tan lejos están las ventanas.
 empotradas en la pared, ya sean pequeñas brisas colocadas que ayudan con el control del sol.
 Pero en cualquier caso, animé a buscar formas de enriquecer las elevaciones del edificio a través del reconocimiento y, como dije, de alguna manera poder leer una actitud hacia la sostenibilidad en las elevaciones del edificio.
 Sin embargo, revisé las 27 páginas de estudios de la sombra.
 Y le informaría a la junta que creo que estaban correctamente, lo mejor que puedo decir, que estaban preparados con precisión.
 Y aprecio el análisis del tipo de análisis de antes y después y reducirlo incluso a un tema diferente.
 perspectiva, que es el marco temporal de cuáles son las horas reales donde hay una diferencia mensurable en las sombras.
 Creo que eso ayuda a poner las cosas en perspectiva.
 Creo que por ahora, estoy
 Estoy contento con el resultado del plano del sitio.
 No está completamente resuelto en detalle.
 Creo que esta imagen muestra todo el trabajo que se realizó en el lado oeste del edificio y que creo que realmente transformó Amaranth Street.
 Hay muchas imágenes que aún nos faltan por ver sobre la arquitectura.
 Y desde mi perspectiva, creo que el foco de lo que estaría viendo ahora es realmente la materialidad del edificio, cómo se aborda la escala.
 empezando a centrarse en el edificio en sí.
 Todavía no he escrito nada más que un pequeño memorando solicitando pruebas adicionales.
 La razón por la que no he escrito nada es porque está cambiando.
 El proyecto realmente ha cambiado significativamente y no pensé que tuviera mucho sentido concretar mis opiniones hasta
 Hubo consenso en que las cosas estaban relativamente estables y se hizo algún tipo de acercamiento a una presentación final.
 Entonces verán más comentarios míos en cuanto a la arquitectura del edificio, pero también en cuanto a dónde se encuentra y dónde se encuentra en el sitio en este momento y las ideas preliminares sobre paisajismo y amortiguación y público.
 Un espacio o espacio abierto que sea de usos múltiples, tanto para el público como para los residentes, para mí está en un buen lugar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1773.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Y ciertamente, puedo responder cualquier pregunta.
 Está bien.
 Gracias por la actualización.
 Y entonces, Sr. McCord, simplemente... Sí, suena bien.
 Entonces, una cosa que quiero dejar clara antes de abrirlo a las preguntas de la junta directiva es... Entonces, ¿estoy entendiendo correctamente eso?
 Si el resultado de esta reunión de esta noche no resulta en cambios materiales al plano del sitio, entonces en ese momento, las exhibiciones que ya solicitaron y tal vez algunas exhibiciones que solicitarán en breve, ese sería el siguiente paso.
 Los solicitarías y luego los revisarías.
 Y luego, en una reunión futura, recibiremos sus comentarios detallados sobre otros elementos de la arquitectura.
 ¿Es así?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1819.794s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Para mí, eso tiene sentido.
 Tengo comentarios, e hice algunos de los comentarios la semana pasada sobre la expresión del edificio.
 Pero realmente depende de ustedes en la junta directiva.
 Por eso aprecio este tipo de enfoque rítmico.
 hacerlo, pero sí, mis próximos pasos, asumiendo que la masa general, el concepto de masa, si eso funciona para su gente, eso ayudará a informar mi próximo nivel de análisis, que, como dije, en realidad se trata de la materialidad y otros, hice algunos otros comentarios sobre cómo son las cosas,
 Para mí, expresado en la elevación, pero creo que es más importante que ustedes opinen, y ahí es donde comenzaría, nuevamente, simplemente buscando formas que creo que ayudarán.
 Creo que, ya sabes, en un edificio de esta escala, realmente vale la pena hablar sobre formas de hacer que esa escala tenga sentido para el lugar donde se encuentra ese edificio.
 Si la masa es más o menos correcta y la ubicación en el sitio es más o menos correcta, creo que realmente has reducido las variables.
 No sé si respondí eso claramente o no.
 Pido disculpas si no lo hice.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1918.027s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Lo suficientemente claro para mí, así que lo aceptaremos.
 Gracias.
 Está bien.
 Con eso, lo abriré a las preguntas de la junta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1928.413s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sí, Mike, este es Andre.
 Pregunta para Cliff.
 Estoy mirando este edificio.
 Es un bloque enorme y un amaranto largo.
 Es sólo un muro sólido e indiferenciado de cinco pisos.
 Es muy largo, y realmente creo que se podría hacer mucho más para dividirlo un poco para que no parezca un gran muro.
 Me pregunto si tienes alguna idea al respecto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1975.908s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Lo hago y estoy completamente de acuerdo.
 Creo que una de las razones por las que mencioné la idea de diferenciar el tratamiento de las elevaciones en función de la orientación es una ruta para ayudar a romper el gran bloque indiferenciado.
 Hay otros
 Estrategias que tienen que ver con introducir elementos más verticales que pueden ser menores entresijos a lo largo de la fachada, algunos cambios de material.
 Pero estoy de acuerdo.
 Creo que sería de gran ayuda elegir un ritmo que divida la longitud del edificio y que ayude de otra manera a vincularse con el desarrollo al otro lado de la calle.
 Por eso, para mí, este es el bloque con el que empiezas.
 Si los fundamentos funcionan en cuanto a qué tan lejos está de la calle y, en general, su altura, entonces comienza a tallar esa cuadra para lograr el equilibrio correcto.
 Siempre será un edificio grande y no hay forma de evitarlo.
 Pero hay maneras de hacer que esa escala funcione para usted.
 Pienso en, ya sabes, bahías, huecos, como dije, tal vez algunas bandas.
 No dije bandas, es más una diferenciación horizontal, pero estoy de acuerdo.
 Y tenga en cuenta también que este edificio sí tiene, por lo que creo que es muy importante que esa entrada se acentúe y cambie de
 Una especie de aberturas perforadas para acercarse más a un escaparate en el nivel más bajo en esa esquina norte y moverse hacia el oeste.
 Eso ayuda mucho, pero en realidad no es suficiente para ayudar a desglosar la escala general del resto.
 Es un lindo movimiento.
 Creo que es una pieza con una bonita forma para tenerla en ese lado del edificio.
 Estoy de acuerdo.
 Creo que la semana pasada hubo cierta discusión sobre cómo equilibrar una especie de apariencia industrial.
 Quiero decir, este edificio todavía está unido a la instalación de almacenamiento al este, y esa es la historia del sitio, es un uso industrial.
 Pero al mismo tiempo,
 Si nos fijamos en ese edificio actual, en realidad, el edificio actual es una estructura agregada.
 Está como dividido en pedazos más pequeños.
 Pero de todos modos, para mí, eso es algo que recomendaría que se analice ahora, veamos algunas formas de descomponer la escala del bloqueo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2163.382s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sí, y quiero decir, Eric, no creo que hayas mostrado una imagen de algunos de tus otros proyectos.
 No sé si quieres volver a esa diapositiva, pero.
 Entonces.
 Ya sabes, el.
 Al igual que Modera Medford, hay mucho más.
 Se lee como edificios casi diferentes, ¿verdad?
 Y entonces pienso algo de eso.
 La estrategia sería realmente útil aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2195.203s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Seguro.
 No quiero decir que necesariamente esté contrarrestando esto, pero una cosa que sí quiero mencionar es que con la casa pasiva, es más difícil hacer una mayor diferenciación dentro de sus edificios.
 Mientras más entradas y salidas haga dentro de su edificio, básicamente cada pie cuadrado de pared exterior que agregue a su edificio, será más difícil cumplir con el requisito de casa pasiva.
 Así que es algo que tenemos en mente y algo que hemos estado discutiendo y, ya sabes, habíamos hablado de ello incluso la semana pasada con la junta de planificación, Alicia y Danielle y el resto del personal, que es un
 algo por lo que Medford optó, es un código especializado.
 Y es algo a lo que estamos prestando mucha atención.
 Y es una especie de futuro del código energético aquí en Massachusetts.
 Entonces, algo a tener en cuenta es que cada vez más proyectos tendrán menos articulación y menos desglose para cumplir con los requisitos del código energético.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2251.474s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Y ¿puedes aclararme cuál es el código extensible?
 Eso no es lo mismo que el estándar de casa pasiva, ¿verdad?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2261.774s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: No lo es.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2262.635s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Entonces crees que estás yendo más allá de eso, ¿verdad?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2265.457s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Bueno, Medford optó por el código de energía especializado, que es un requisito previo de la casa pasiva.
 En Medford, no se puede hacer nada más que una casa pasiva para el código de energía.
 Y ese es un nuevo requisito y algo que todos los proyectos futuros deberán cumplir.
 Bien.
 Y eso es algo que es nuevo para mucha gente.
 Ya existe desde hace algún tiempo, especialmente en Europa, pero se está abriendo camino aquí y mucha gente está empezando a familiarizarse con él, pero requiere
 ya sabes, mayor aislamiento, ya sabes, aislamiento continuo en los edificios exteriores, mayor eficiencia, ventanas de mayor eficiencia, mejores sistemas MEP.
 Muchas veces, para aprobar una casa pasiva, generalmente verá un ahorro del 90%, hasta un 90%, en costos de energía.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2320.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Una cosa que quería agregar y, como mencionó Eric, tienen
 tres proyectos de casas pasivas activas en su oficina.
 Pero haría una sugerencia, por ejemplo, porque también hacemos muchas construcciones de casas pasivas.
 Y, ya sabes, si observas cómo son, es un sistema muy basado en el rendimiento.
 Por lo tanto, es posible que se modelen ventanas y se modele rigurosamente la energía.
 Entonces, si tienes ventanas realmente grandes de las que es mucho más difícil obtener un excelente rendimiento térmico, si llegas a ese punto de cuánta articulación puedes hacer, gran parte de la articulación que se realiza es en paredes sólidas.
 Y esas paredes son fáciles de aislar y obtener un buen rendimiento.
 Sabes, por ejemplo, creo que una forma de abordar esto sería no necesariamente necesitar ventanas tan grandes como las que estás mostrando.
 Entonces, si reduce un poco el tamaño de la ventana desde una perspectiva de modelado, puede obtener más en un área envolvente bien aislada.
 Así que estoy de acuerdo contigo, la Casa Pasiva tiene algunos aspectos realmente difíciles.
 Modelado continuo que debe realizarse a lo largo de todos los documentos de construcción.
 Pero no creo que lo hayamos hecho, y creo que hemos construido alrededor de 18 o 19 edificios de casas pasivas en este momento.
 Creo que puedes darte más libertad de articulación volumétrica y aun así mantenerte dentro de los requisitos de la casa pasiva.
 Lo hemos hecho y lo hemos hecho con muchos edificios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2439.664s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Quiero decir, la otra cosa que simplemente agregaría es que siempre soy un gran defensor de que la mayor cantidad posible de unidades tengan acceso a su propio espacio al aire libre y a la mayor cantidad de balcones posible.
 Eso es algo que sin duda estaría analizando.
 Y yo, de nuevo, miro esto, la foto de Modera Medford.
 Sabes, creo que tienes los porches allí, los balcones allí, que se leen mucho más articulados de lo que realmente están.
 Y tal vez piense un poco en eso, cómo podría usarlos para hacer eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2480.297s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Si pudiera agregar una cosa.
 Aprecio que Andre haya mencionado esto.
 Creo que la articulación del edificio es otra forma de ayudar a vincularlo con el contexto existente.
 No literalmente, pero es una buena manera de ayudar a reconocer las diferencias en las distintas elevaciones del edificio.
 que ya has hecho en el lado norte.
 Sí, tenemos balcones que se muestran a lo largo del borde oeste y que también están empotrados.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2517.24s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Entonces Pat Newton, ibas a hablar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2520.463s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Lo siento, solo quería intervenir.
 Gracias.
 Sólo quería aclarar una cosa para que no haya confusión en el futuro para la junta directiva cuando entremos en la discusión sobre la casa pasiva.
 Sólo para aclarar algo que Eric mencionó en términos de vías de cumplimiento del código de energía especializado.
 no estamos colectivamente
 Expertos en códigos de energía, existen otras vías para los edificios comerciales.
 El camino al que Eric se refiere específicamente en términos de ser casas pasivas para uso residencial.
 Entonces, simplemente no quería que la junta llevara nuestros comentarios a otras audiencias y que hubiera confusión en el futuro.
 Sólo quería aclarar eso para todos.
 Así lo somos.
 Para reiterar lo que dice Eric, francamente, estamos entusiasmados con esto.
 Este es un proyecto para las empresas de Davis, para el tercer trimestre, que se encuentran en la frontera del diseño y construcción de edificios de casas pasivas en Massachusetts.
 Esperamos con ansias esta oportunidad y continuaremos informándonos más y utilizando este proceso de diseño como una oportunidad para hacerlo.
 Pero sólo quería aclarar que era específico del sector residencial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2593.618s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Ese es un buen punto.
 Anotado.
 Gracias.
 Abogado Tam, adelante, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2600.157s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Gracias, señor presidente.
 Y simplemente para aprovechar lo que dice Pat, creo que si la preocupación y el enfoque del miembro LaRue están realmente en la elevación del amaranto, creo que ciertamente podemos centrar nuestros esfuerzos en eso porque creo que los otros
 Esta elevación que todos estamos viendo es obviamente una gran cantidad de tiempo que se ha dedicado a esto.
 Pero si la preocupación del Sr. LaRue es el lado del amaranto, no veo ninguna razón por la que no podamos dedicar más tiempo a los puntos que tanto Eric como Cliff han estado planteando para tratar de articular mejor ese lado.
 Esto pretende ser una prueba de concepto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2653.145s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bien, gracias.
 Andre, ¿dirías que es el lado de Amaranto el que más te preocupa, o esto también se aplica al frente del edificio, el lado norte?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2665.248s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Bueno, quiero decir, me gustaría ver más trabajo en ello, como mencionó Cliff, ya sabes, en todas las elevaciones.
 Creo que el lado de Amaranth me llama particularmente la atención porque hay propiedades residenciales al otro lado de la calle, y es simplemente,
 ya sabes, y en cierto modo se lee en el alzado como una pared indiferenciada.
 Entonces, ya sabes, obviamente hay lo mismo en el lado este, hay otra pared que da al edificio de almacenamiento.
 Entonces creo que
 Probablemente necesite su propio tipo de tratamiento.
 También será lo que puedas ver desde la carretera.
 Así que creo que todas las elevaciones probablemente merecen algo de trabajo adicional.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2719.771s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Está bien, gracias.
 ¿Otras preguntas o comentarios de la junta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2728.738s">[Mary Lee]</a>: ¿Hay un componente solar en este edificio?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2739.42s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: No sé, Pat, si quieres ese.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2741.942s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sí.
 Sí.
 Sí.
 Lo siento.
 Puedo intervenir en este punto.
 No hemos estudiado eso específicamente.
 Creo que es algo que hemos discutido.
 Um, poder incorporar eso al proyecto, pero no es algo que estemos mostrando todavía.
 No es algo que hayamos podido analizar específicamente.
 Ya sabes, en términos de su viabilidad, ya sea arquitectónicamente desde una perspectiva espacial en el techo o en cualquier otro lugar del sitio, o desde cualquier tipo de.
 Ya sabes, otros impactos en el proyecto, ya sea costo o diseño o de otro tipo, así es.
 Una respuesta abierta, ha sido un tema de discusión para nosotros.
 Simplemente aún no tenemos una respuesta definitiva sobre si planeamos o no tener energía solar en el proyecto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2797.862s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Y para continuar con lo que Mary estaba diciendo, creo que en algún momento también se mencionó algo como un área en la azotea o un techo verde.
 Sería bueno ver cómo será el tratamiento en la azotea, especialmente porque hay algunas, ya sabes, de cinco pisos y otras de seis pisos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2821.773s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sí, creo que podemos seguir evolucionando el diseño e incorporar elementos para reflejar lo que habría en el techo.
 Creo que tal vez para aclarar algo de la confusión, creo que los espacios del techo a los que nos hemos referido como verdes hasta la fecha estarían en los patios en el nivel 2 que se ven visibles en algunos de nuestros planos de sitio en la parte superior de la plataforma de estacionamiento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2856.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Muy bien, gracias.
 ¿Otras preguntas o comentarios de la junta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2868.589s">[Mary Lee]</a>: Entonces tengo entendido que esto es sólo un borrador preliminar del plan, ¿verdad?
 ¿O estamos, quiero decir, en qué etapa se encuentra este plan, está este plan completo en un 90%, en un 70% o?
 porque tiendo a estar de acuerdo con Andre, porque la primera impresión cuando miro esta foto es que me da esa impresión de un almacén en lugar de un apartamento residencial.
 Esa es la primera impresión.
 Pero creo que, obviamente, si este no es el plan completo, entonces probablemente haya espacio para,
 hacer modificaciones.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2922.696s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sí, lo entiendo.
 Oh, adelante, por favor, abogado Tim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2928.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bueno, sólo quería responder cuando escuché la pregunta de los miembros.
 Los planes a continuación y su consejo también pueden asesorarlo, pero sé que esta junta ha pasado por esto con varios de estos permisos integrales.
 En términos de porcentaje completado, la ley de permisos integrales requiere que presentemos un diseño preliminar.
 Creo que en esta etapa, estos cumplen con creces ese estándar básico.
 Creo que su personal y usted mismo comprenden que podemos perfeccionar y brindar detalles adicionales.
 Por ejemplo, cuando el Sr. LaRue preguntó sobre el tratamiento del techo, podemos indicar, al menos conceptualmente, dónde creemos que habrá diferentes instalaciones ubicadas en el techo, al menos a nivel conceptual.
 Si hay detalles específicos que le gustaría ver,
 podemos adelantarlos.
 Pero otros elementos en los que puede ser apropiado proporcionar condiciones que anticipen el diseño y los detalles futuros son elementos en los que nos gustaría trabajar con usted.
 Por lo tanto, nunca obtendrá, en este nivel de permiso integral, dibujos de diseño 100%.
 Y así, pero la idea de una mayor articulación con un enfoque en aquellas áreas de sensibilidad, como el amaranto.
 Eso es algo en lo que realmente podemos concentrarnos, pero permanecerá en un nivel preliminar.
 Sólo en el momento en que obtenga un permiso de construcción tendrá un diseño final asegurado y su decisión lo reflejará.
 Sólo quería ser muy directo sobre cuán específicos podemos ser.
 En muchos municipios y con muchos proyectos, y creo que con otros proyectos aquí en Medford, este nivel de diseño conceptual es adecuado para la revisión y aprobación de un permiso integral.
 Obviamente, queremos abordar las preocupaciones de la junta en cualquier comentario del público y continuaremos haciéndolo.
 Pero, por ejemplo, los planos de distribución del edificio que revisó Eric son más que adecuados en esta etapa para su aprobación.
 Realmente estamos hablando de impresiones subjetivas y estética del diseño a partir de las cuales vamos a tomar la iniciativa en términos de lo que podemos hacer en esta etapa.
 Pero no lo habrá, ya sabes, este es el nivel de plan que obtendrás.
 Si hay elementos y elementos de diseño sobre los que le gustaría ver más detalles, haremos todo lo posible para proporcionárselos.
 Sí, no tendremos documentos de construcción como parte de esto.
 El otro punto, supongo, es la impresión de que se trata de un edificio industrial.
 Bueno, hay un edificio industrial existente y su huella.
 Es un distrito industrial.
 Hay una nave industrial al lado.
 Como indicó Eric, tomamos este diseño a partir de esas señales.
 Creo que cada uno va a tener su propia opinión.
 Mi opinión personal es que se parece a otros 40 B que la ciudad ha aprobado y se han construido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3166.823s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Está bien.
 Gracias.
 Tengo una pregunta aclaratoria para Cliff Bohmer.
 Sólo quiero asegurarme de que lo difundamos todo esta noche para que, si hay alguna discusión de ida y vuelta, todos podamos estar en la misma página.
 Entonces hemos hablado de materialidad.
 Hemos hablado de articulación.
 Hemos hablado de detalles adicionales en la vista de la azotea.
 Sr. Bomer, ¿qué esperará específicamente en términos de detalles que actualmente no están disponibles para completar su revisión?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3210.995s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Bueno, esa es una buena pregunta.
 No voy a poder responderla con gran detalle.
 Déjame relajarme un poco.
 Creo que el punto del abogado Tam es legítimo, creo, en el sentido de que el estatuto mismo habla de planes preliminares.
 Y creo que lo que hemos visto en este solicitante es la voluntad de
 Creo que todas las partes acordaron en última instancia que eran mejoras al edificio.
 Entonces, desde mi perspectiva, creo que es un poco más donde quizás tendría algún problema con el abogado Tam, para mí, la forma en que el edificio responde al contexto existente y encaja en el patrón de desarrollo está relacionado con lo que se puede clasificar como estético.
 Creo que en las elevaciones primarias que miran al ámbito público, hay una obligación.
 Y de hecho me gusta mucho ese concepto de prueba de concepto que mencionó el abogado.
 Estoy completamente de acuerdo con eso. Creo que lo que la junta necesita saber es que las imágenes que están viendo son
 en un buen lugar y demuestran que algo va por buen camino.
 No van a producir niveles elevados de detalle.
 Eso no es en absoluto lo que se les exige hacer, ni tampoco es necesario hacerlo, en realidad.
 Creo que desde mi perspectiva, los planos del techo y la ubicación del equipo mecánico son importantes.
 ¿No estamos viendo el equipo mecánico?
 ¿Es lo suficientemente
 protegido del ámbito público.
 Me gustaría ver más información sobre el nivel de planta baja, que es donde está el estacionamiento que está en el nivel de planta baja, y que está relacionado con la elevación oeste del edificio.
 Entonces es
 Es algo así como, me gustaría ver, lo que realmente me gustaría ver es de la misma manera que creo que cada vez que han presentado, han demostrado que realmente han escuchado lo que usted ha dicho.
 Y entonces esperaría otra ronda analizando más
 la estética del edificio, pero cómo ayudan al edificio a vincularse con eso o encontrar el equilibrio adecuado entre el aspecto industrial, pero aún así conectando tal vez con algunos de los ritmos y la escala del contexto circundante.
 Así que no puedo, es difícil para mí resumir todo eso en uno, si tuviera algo de tiempo para escribir una nota, lo que esperaría ver,
 Además, al menos a un nivel que veo en muchas comunidades, y particularmente cuando hay solicitantes que han estado dispuestos a trabajar con usted.
 Creo que sería una oportunidad perdida si no continúan con ese espíritu y analizan algunas de estas ideas sobre cómo acabar con la masa.
 además de proporcionar algunas exhibiciones más fundamentales.
 Como dije, los planos del techo son muy importantes en este caso porque necesitamos saber qué es visible desde la calle.
 Si este punto de vista no es exacto, entonces no lo hago, no alentaría a una junta a tomar una decisión basada en eso hasta que realmente, creo que el solicitante tiene una obligación.
 presentar imágenes que sean precisas.
 Realmente representan algo muy parecido a lo que la junta directiva y el público verían si esto realmente se construyera.
 Así que hay un par de ellos que realmente necesitamos concretar.
 Y luego los animo a que regresen con algunas ideas sobre cómo trabajar.
 en un detalle más, ya sabes, de grano más fino con la masa del edificio.
 En cuanto a los planos de planta, estoy de acuerdo en que son bastante parecidos, pero como dije al principio, no lo he hecho, porque realmente me he centrado en la planificación del sitio, no he examinado con gran detalle los planos de planta, pero están en un nivel que normalmente veo, creo que a partir de este punto, en el tipo.
 Los comentarios que esperaría de mí serían si veo violaciones flagrantes del código.
 Ya sabes, las cosas en ese nivel también serían una especie de verdad al empaquetar que lo que ves para los planos esquemáticos es realmente factible según los códigos, y me gustaría tener la oportunidad de comentar sobre eso.
 Señalaré, y sé que el arquitecto lo sabe,
 También estoy bastante seguro de que Pat Newton sabe esto, que en el tejado existen requisitos reales del código de construcción que garantizan que los edificios puedan hacer la transición a la energía solar en el tejado en el futuro, incluso si no lo están haciendo ahora, existen requisitos de que el tejado se diseñe estructuralmente para recibir
 paneles, y creo que hoy en día todos los desarrolladores se aseguran de tener suficientes canales hasta las salas eléctricas para acomodar los paneles solares, incluso si no se instalan en la construcción inicial.
 Así que he deambulado un poco, pero estoy feliz de prepararme.
 un memorando de cosas que eran fundamentales y que creo que pueden faltar para promover esta noción de prueba de concepto.
 Sólo me gustaría asegurarme de haber tenido un momento para pensar en ello en función de los nuevos materiales.
 Pero por lo demás, recomendaría realizar más estudios que avancen aún más en esa noción de cómo equilibrar
 articulación, y como dije antes, sí, hay una ciudad empresarial comercial a lo largo de los Emiratos en este momento, pero en realidad es una forma bastante compleja que es interesante, variada y articulada.
 Este es un paisaje urbano mucho mejor.
 Creo que tienes la oportunidad de tener un paisaje urbano realmente superior, pero creo que es
 Si analizamos algunas de las preocupaciones que hemos escuchado esta noche, hacer otra ronda realmente haría avanzar su propia causa.
 Así que lo siento si eso es un poco tortuoso, pero realmente no puedo, ya sabes, en una declaración, ¿cuál es la otra declaración?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3669.292s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: Y señor presidente, voy a intervenir muy rápido.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3690.346s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: El diseño es un aspecto importante y creo que Cliff tiene un excelente y capaz evaluador por pares que está haciendo una revisión y él está haciendo una revisión exhaustiva y el solicitante parece estar respondiendo a sus comentarios.
 Um, la obligación de la junta es asegurarse de que el diseño sea aceptable, pero lo más importante es que, bajo una solicitud de permiso integral, debemos analizar más los aspectos técnicos del proyecto.
 Estamos hablando de impactos en los servicios públicos de tráfico, aguas pluviales y diseño civil.
 Y estoy seguro de que la junta lo sabe.
 Estoy seguro de que el solicitante lo sabe.
 Y solo menciono que la junta no se involucra demasiado en tener una discusión muy larga y muchas audiencias sobre diseño.
 Y, ya sabes, estamos bajo una línea de tiempo.
 Empezamos a centrarnos en más aspectos técnicos del proyecto.
 Creo que hemos avanzado mucho con el diseño, así me parece.
 Y creo que ahora, si la junta directiva es algo, ya sabes, es posible que desee ver algo,
 modificaciones al diseño y tal vez algunas actualizaciones basadas en los comentarios adicionales de Cliff, entonces puede que sea el momento de decir, está bien, necesitamos revisar lo civil, necesitamos revisar las aguas pluviales, necesitamos revisar el tráfico.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3770.168s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sí, gracias, abogada Elfin.
 Mi intención con la reunión de esta noche es que la junta directiva aclare cualquier elemento de diseño restante en el que les gustaría ver detalles o cambios adicionales.
 Hemos tenido noticias del Sr. Bowmer con sus detalles.
 coincido con el general
 También agradecería ese memorando en un futuro próximo.
 Así que, por favor, si pudieras enviarnos uno, Cliff, te lo agradeceríamos.
 Pero lo que ya escuché es, ya sabes, más detalles sobre el techo, detalles sobre la materialidad, una solicitud de los miembros de la junta, y de, ya sabes,
 Bowmer sobre estrategias justas para acabar con la masa.
 También escuché detalles adicionales en la planta baja.
 Creo que esas fueron las áreas principales que me llamaron la atención.
 Y sí, como dijo el Sr. Bowmer, los comentarios sobre los planos
 son próximos.
 Parece que tiene la mayoría de los detalles que necesitaría, pero simplemente nos gustaría considerarlos.
 Entonces creo que tenemos un caso de uso para otra sesión sobre diseño, quizás a la luz de todo esto.
 Pero estoy de acuerdo con el abogado Alfin.
 No podemos permitir que esto sea un diseño sin fin.
 En el calendario, tal vez tengamos
 Tenemos margen para una sesión más de reunión sobre diseño, y luego tendremos que tomar algunas decisiones para cumplir con el cronograma.
 Actualmente, en la próxima reunión programada dentro de dos semanas, la intención, salvo cualquier
 Uh, los cambios solicitados o los problemas que producen la documentación requerida son para que realmente se centren más en la ingeniería.
 Um, entonces podemos discutir si cambiar eso a la luz de la discusión de hoy, pero sí, necesitamos lograr que el diseño converja para que también podamos, um,
 dar suficientes detalles a los elementos técnicos para que la junta evalúe todo lo que se espera que evalúemos en el cronograma legal.
 Entonces esa es mi intención.
 Por favor, adelante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3927.624s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: No, solo iba a, ya sabes, agregar una cosa sobre, um,
 uh, planos de planta.
 Son importantes, y es bueno que Cliff los esté revisando, pero realmente bajo una solicitud de permiso integral, esos planos de planta podrían modificarse después de la decisión, ya sea bajo, um, um, el acuerdo regulatorio que es revisado por el estado, o, uh, los planos tal como están construidos, podrían potencialmente modificarse, y si no son modificaciones importantes, y generalmente no lo son,
 Se consideran modificaciones importantes, que generalmente se pueden realizar a partir de 40B.
 No deberíamos dedicar demasiado tiempo a cosas como planos de planta y tamaños de unidades.
 Hay un número de unidades con dormitorios y cosas así, pero ese es sólo un aspecto que puede ser manejado por las condiciones.</p>

 Créanme, si empezara de cero no diseñaría un rectángulo gigantesco en medio de un barrio.
 Pero creo que tenemos la obligación de hacer todo lo que podamos para asegurarnos de que este proyecto.
 De escala realmente significativa se integra lo mejor que puede.

 ¿Existe la intención de analizar esto con mayor detalle en una audiencia futura?
 ¿O está buscando que la junta le haga preguntas específicas y luego las abordaremos de esa manera?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4150.809s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Señor presidente, puedo hablar en nombre de las empresas de Davis.
 creo que
 Creo que los escuchamos alto y claro, a partir de la próxima sesión, además de lo civil, podemos hablar sobre algunas de estas cuestiones operativas y podemos cuantificarlas.
 O identificar el estándar que estamos cumpliendo para el estacionamiento de cargos por arte público en términos de ubicación, al menos en términos de almacenamiento de bytes.
 Podemos informarle sobre el plan de paisajismo y podemos hablar sobre algunos de estos problemas operativos.
 Puede haber un estándar que propongamos si algo no está completamente conceptualizado.
 Ya sabes, ya sea una proporción, un tamaño o una aproximación, eso podría convertirse en parte de una condición.
 Eso es apropiado en este nivel de diseño.
 Pero, y no lo ignoramos en absoluto, creo que estaremos ansiosos por revisar el memorando de Cliff y dar seguimiento a más detalles de diseño basados ​​en sus comentarios y recomendaciones.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4220.455s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bien, gracias.
 Andre, ¿eso alivia al menos parcialmente tu preocupación?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4227.229s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sí, solo quería rechazar un poco la idea de que vamos a saltarnos una revisión exhaustiva.
 Y sé que tenemos sesiones próximas en las que vamos a hablar sobre algunos de estos otros temas, pero esas son algunas cosas que me preocupan y quiero asegurarme de que hablemos sobre ellas y, si es necesario, sobre las condiciones.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4254.242s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: solo para responder.
 Sólo para responder, para ser claros, intentaremos abordar cada uno de esos puntos.
 Los hemos escuchado antes.
 Hemos abordado algunos de ellos y, como usted señala, el estacionamiento ha sido un tema que creo que hemos detallado en sesiones anteriores.
 Y no esperamos más que una revisión exhaustiva.
 Creo que hemos estado experimentando y beneficiándonos de los inicios de una revisión exhaustiva.
 Pero lo hago...
 Yo diría que en varios casos habrá elementos.
 Me viene a la mente la idea del arte público.
 No necesariamente vamos a conocer ese nivel de detalle en el momento en que esta decisión esté ante la junta.
 Pero ciertamente podemos ponerle algunos estándares.
 Y creo que eso es lo que sugiere el Sr. LaRue.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4315.214s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bien, gracias.
 En este punto, voy a consultar con los miembros de la junta si hay otras preguntas o comentarios.
 Una vez que hayamos revisado las preguntas y comentarios de la junta, tengo la intención de abrir la puerta a comentarios públicos sobre estos diseños conceptuales.
 Pero primero, quiero asegurarme de que si hay algún miembro de la junta que tenga preguntas o comentarios adicionales, tenga la oportunidad de escucharlos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4345.665s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: No tengo una pregunta.
 Solo tengo un comentario de que apoyo plenamente lo que Andre ha hablado y mencionado.
 Y no es sólo él.
 Así que sólo quiero asegurarme de que estemos claros.
 Creo que la mayoría de la junta estaría de acuerdo con él.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4364.47s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sí.
 Y yo también estaría de acuerdo.
 Mi expectativa era que la mayoría de esos elementos serían de ingeniería civil.
 El otro elemento que agregaré a esa lista es obviamente el plan de iluminación.
 pero también los puntos técnicos que planteó el otro abogado.
 Ese es el objetivo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4385.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sí.
 Gracias por aclarar eso.
 Comparto esa expectativa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4390.872s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: ¿Puedo preguntar si el panorama es algo para hoy o para una reunión futura?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4398.054s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Si entendí correctamente, la intención sería presentar algunos de esos detalles en nuestra próxima sesión.
 Gracias.
 Está bien.
 ¿Otras preguntas o comentarios de los miembros de la junta?
 Al no ver ninguno, el presidente espera la moción para abrir comentarios públicos sobre el diseño conceptual de este proyecto.
 Me muevo.
 Segundo.
 ¿Tengo un segundo?
 Segundo.
 Bien, vamos a pasar lista.
 ¿Jamie?
 Sí.</p>

 Sí.
 Muy bien, la parte pública de esta sesión de la audiencia ya está abierta.
 Ahora estamos aceptando comentarios públicos.
 sobre el diseño conceptual que se presentó hoy.
 Si es un miembro del público que desea hablar sobre este asunto, no dude en levantar la mano en Zoom, encender la cámara, levantar la mano y escribir algo en el chat.
 También puede enviar un correo electrónico a DennisDMcDougall a Medford-MA.gov.
 lo haré
 espere unos momentos, y luego si hay un miembro del público que, bueno, veo a un miembro del público que levantó la mano.
 Entonces iremos a ellos primero.
 Veo a Allison D. Indique su nombre y dirección para que conste.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4499.191s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Hola a todos.
 Buenas noches.
 Sí, Allison D'Agostino.
 Represento al D'Agostino Trust, los propietarios del 1022-1024 Fellsway.
 Solo quería comenzar nuevamente, gracias siempre por la oportunidad de hablar y ver esto.
 Francamente, he aprendido mucho a lo largo del proceso.
 Así que realmente aprecio la presentación y el tablero.
 Sólo un par de cosas rápidas.
 De hecho, seré más técnico.
 Sólo quiero aceptar que
 Ya sabes, y creo que el abogado Tam lo dijo mejor.
 Es un espacio industrial.
 Entonces, si bien aprecio que sea un diseño de edificio de aspecto industrial, ¿por qué no simplemente construir un edificio industrial similar a otros proyectos que Davis Company ha realizado con Amazon Warehouse en Chelsea?
 Eso se ve hermoso.
 Esa es la intención diseñada para el espacio, pero lo dejaré en un comentario.
 con respecto a los aspectos técnicos en cuanto a utilidad, algo que se mencionó una y otra vez en la última reunión, estuve muy agradecido por la
 Concesiones Davis Company ha dicho que ampliará la calle de Myrtle.
 Una cosa que realmente no tocamos aquí fue el aspecto de utilidad.
 Hay muchos postes de servicios públicos, postes eléctricos justo en la acera a lo largo de Myrtle.
 Ampliar la calle, mi preocupación realmente, ya que el otro día paseaba con mis perros,
 donde llegas a la empresa de plomería, que en realidad está, nuevamente, en una especie de intersección de Myrtle y Fellsway.
 el límite de su propiedad está justo contra la acera.
 Entonces, supongo que solo hay un par de preguntas, y tal vez aún no conozcan los detalles, y lo aprecio, pero cuando se habla de curvar la calle, ¿cuál es la planificación preliminar en cuanto a electricidad y todos esos servicios públicos, y luego, ¿cómo exactamente se podrá ampliar la calle en la intersección real de Fellsway y Myrtle con esa propiedad?
 Paz donde no eres dueño de ese pequeño cuadrado, por así decirlo.
 Entonces, nuevamente, creo que los materiales son muy consistentes con los otros proyectos.
 Realmente pienso en calle comercial ese proyecto y pido disculpas por el nombre, creo que río algo.
 Creo que el material se ve bien.
 Estoy de acuerdo en que es un edificio grande y cuadrado que no encaja en un vecindario.
 Así que esos fueron sólo mis comentarios.
 Y nuevamente, gracias por el tiempo.
 Realmente siempre lo aprecio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4672.525s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Gracias.
 Así que tomé nota y tengo la intención de asegurarme de que cubramos eso en la sesión civil de la audiencia.
 Porque ese no era realmente el enfoque aquí.
 Quiero decir, si el solicitante quiere hablar brevemente sobre ello, ciertamente es bienvenido, pero no necesariamente espero que tenga esa respuesta lista.
 Pero creo que eso es algo que planearemos cubrir en la sesión civil de la audiencia.
 Y luego
 Sé que es sólo un comentario.
 Por supuesto, no es competencia de la junta recomendar usos alternativos para la tierra.
 Así que sí, comentario anotado.
 Está en el registro público.
 Pero no nos involucraremos con eso directamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4721.002s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Puedo intervenir, señor presidente, y ofrecer al menos una breve respuesta para que no estemos
 hacer que la gente sienta que estamos pateando la lata de las preguntas a medida que surgen.
 Podemos, y ciertamente lo haremos, dar más detalles sobre la cuestión específica en nuestra próxima audiencia.
 Sra. D'Agostino, si no puede asistir, el plan actual contempla ampliar Myrtle después, por lo que mientras baja por Myrtle hacia la intersección de Emirates Street, proponemos ampliar Myrtle en nuestro lado de la calle después de la línea de propiedad del edificio de plomería.
 Entonces, desde el límite de la propiedad hacia afuera, sí, es difícil verlo aquí.
 No fue, realmente no fue el foco de la presentación de esta noche.
 Pero, sí, desde ese punto hasta las colinas, la línea de la acera esencialmente permanecería como está y hacia abajo.
 Uh, el plan se fue hacia el oeste, estamos proponiendo ensanchar Myrtle Street en la propiedad que tenemos y que controlamos con respecto a los postes de servicios públicos.
 Lo que podemos mostrar con mucho mayor detalle en la próxima audiencia y este fue un mensaje recibido también de la última audiencia, solo que las personas no pudieron ver el plano del sitio con claridad.
 Esa no era nuestra intención.
 Así que planeamos presentar esto con mucho mayor y mayor detalle, pero, um.
 Los grupos de servicios públicos que existen, estamos planeando dejarlos en su lugar.
 Se conectan con propiedades al otro lado de Myrtle Street y no queremos hacerlo.
 No planeamos reubicarlos ni interrumpir ningún servicio con ellos.
 Entonces la curva.
 El plan de reubicación que tenemos funciona alrededor de ellos y realmente crea hendiduras en Myrtle Street para que los autos se estacionen fuera del área de conducción, pero también mantiene ese espacio en la acera que permite que los postes de servicios públicos permanezcan en su lugar.
 Entonces esa es la respuesta corta nuevamente.
 Sólo quería ofrecer algo.
 Entonces no sentiste que lo fuéramos.
 Navegando aquí, y nosotros, podemos entrar en esto con mucho más detalle en 2 semanas.
 Entonces, todos tienen una comprensión clara de lo que estamos proponiendo sobre myrtle y.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4856.667s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Gracias, sólo quiero decir, gracias.
 Sé que no debería volver a interrumpir, pero gracias.
 Eso ayuda a aclarar algunas de esas preguntas.
 Así que lo agradezco.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4866.834s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Gracias.
 Entonces, veo que otro miembro del público levanta la mano para atrapar a Christina.
 ¿Podría indicar su nombre y dirección para que conste en acta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4875.96s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Hola, Christina Katch, 130 Myrtle Street, Medford.
 Tengo una pregunta de aclaración rápida y luego tengo una pregunta sobre diseño.
 ¿El estudio de contaminación lumínica y acústica formaría parte de la ingeniería civil o del diseño?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4898.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Así que creo que, bueno, los estudios sobre contaminación lumínica y contaminación acústica no estoy seguro de si se realizan habitualmente.
 exhibiciones requeridas.
 Entonces, creo que un plan de iluminación estaría bajo ingeniería.
 ¿Estás buscando algo en particular?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4919.395s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Bueno, sí.
 Vas a construir un edificio enorme frente a mi apartamento.
 Habrá muchos más residentes, ruido, animales, luces.
 paisajismo, farolas que antes no existían aquí en esta calle que se impregnarán en nuestro día a día, especialmente aquellos de nosotros que trabajamos desde casa.
 Y además de la noche, si nos acostamos temprano, habrá contaminación lumínica de esas unidades, no solo del mirto, sino del amaranto en las casas.
 Por eso tengo que creer en la contaminación acústica y en la contaminación lumínica habría que realizar un estudio.
 para la calidad de vida de los residentes existentes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4964.733s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Veo.
 Gracias por aclarar.
 Así que sí, estos temas se dividen en algunas categorías.
 Entonces, lo civil incluiría el plan de iluminación, que podría dar una idea de dónde están las luces y qué áreas podrían resultar en una
 ya sabes, luces que impactan las propiedades vecinas.
 Y eso es algo que ciertamente podríamos considerar.
 Creo que la posición de las ventanas y cosas de esa naturaleza, eso es más importante
 la arquitectura, y luego, ya sabes, si hay insonorización y demás, lo cual sé que hay un código que rodea esto, pero eso sería, supongo, civilizado.
 Entonces, sí, está cubierto en algunos de estos, pero para que quede muy claro, y el solicitante puede corregirme si me equivoco, no lo creo.
 Habrá exhibiciones que detallarán específicamente un estudio de la contaminación lumínica y un estudio de la contaminación acústica.
 En lugar de ello, se hablaría de iluminación y de insonorización, etc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5038.389s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Señor Presidente, eso es correcto.
 Los planos de iluminación que revisará el ingeniero civil incluirán finalmente un plano fotométrico.
 que muestra el cumplimiento y la minimización del traspaso de luz para la iluminación exterior.
 Y con respecto al ruido, además de los requisitos del código, está obviamente la ordenanza sobre ruido de la ciudad.
 Y si hay emisores de sonido específicos
 que son motivo de preocupación, como los equipos en los tejados, a menudo pueden ser el foco de una revisión arquitectónica y civil para mitigar esos impactos.
 Pero esas son las consideraciones típicas que tendría una junta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5097.163s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Gracias.
 Christina, ¿eso respondió a tu pregunta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5103.393s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Respondió mi pregunta.
 Estoy un poco decepcionado.
 No habrá un estudio más profundo sobre esas cosas, pero guardaré más comentarios al respecto hasta después de Civil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5115.72s">[Unidentified]</a>: Si tengo ese diseño.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5118.462s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sí, también tenía una pregunta específica del diseño.
 Supongo que esto es para el Cube 3.
 Mencionaste eso
 Tiene las cuatro propiedades que existen en Medford, tiene una cartera de trabajos por venir para otros proyectos.
 Y entonces me preguntaba, dado que sus cuatro propiedades de cobertura tienen varias unidades desocupadas.
 Incorpore en su diseño de este edificio, algunas de las deficiencias que tuvo en sus diseños anteriores para asegurarse de que no vuelvan a suceder en esta nueva propiedad.
 Así que estoy observando cómo utilizó sus revisiones posteriores a la acción de edificios anteriores para informar una mejor toma de decisiones en esta unidad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5166.021s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Gracias.
 Entonces, en ese caso, simplemente voy a intentar
 mantenerlo dentro del ámbito de competencia de la junta.
 Voy a reinterpretar esa pregunta porque, ya sabes, ¿hay elementos específicos detallados en estos planes para este proyecto que estén incorporando mejores prácticas y aprendizajes de otros proyectos en el área?
 Entonces, si el solicitante quiere hablar sobre alguno de esos detalles, continúe.
 Seguro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5188.814s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sí.
 Quiero decir, obviamente siempre estamos aprendiendo continuamente y tratando de aprovechar las lecciones aprendidas de proyectos anteriores.
 Creo que una cosa a tener en cuenta es que estamos trabajando con un desarrollador diferente aquí que en esas otras propiedades.
 Entonces, algunas de las cosas que hicimos en propiedades anteriores no se aplican a lo que estamos haciendo aquí según el cliente y la ubicación con quien estamos trabajando.
 Pero siempre tratamos de aprovechar las lecciones aprendidas de las cosas que hicimos mal y de las cosas que hicimos bien y tratamos de llevarlas al siguiente proyecto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5222.194s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sólo una cuestión de información, señor presidente.
 ¿Podría ser realmente explícito con los residentes de Butters que están hablando y escuchando esta noche? Si tienen sugerencias específicas sobre cómo gestionar, por ejemplo, la luz o el ruido u otros elementos del paisaje, ¿podrían
 Infórmeselo a la ciudad, o a nosotros, para que podamos asegurarnos de que sea parte de las condiciones o, ya sabes, parte de nuestra revisión.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5255.977s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sí, pero quiero decir, soy ingeniero industrial, no ingeniero civil.
 Entonces necesito que los ingenieros civiles me den algo con qué trabajar primero.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5265.004s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sí, bueno, para profundizar en el punto de Andre, creo que en general, la junta directiva,
 agradece tanto las preguntas como los comentarios del público.
 Y como han visto en estas sesiones, al menos espero que esto sea por lo que me estoy esforzando, la junta está tratando de asegurarse de que si plantean una pregunta o algo que la junta no haya considerado o preguntado, en última instancia estamos trabajando con el solicitante y el solicitante está respondiendo y brindando esos detalles y el solicitante ha estado respondiendo hasta ahora.
 Entonces sí, al punto de Andre, creo,
 Donde un comentario, ya sea que se haga directamente a la ciudad o en una audiencia pública o cualquier otra cosa, incluso si no proviene de un lugar de experiencia, podría ayudar es si se tiene una idea.
 usted podría, en forma de comentario que conste en acta, compartir esa idea.
 Y luego eso podría inspirar una discusión o una revisión que incluya a un experto en esa área en particular que incorpore el espíritu de esa idea.
 Entonces sí, creo que si te entendí correctamente, Andre, querías dejar claro a los residentes que
 Las ideas son bienvenidas y hay foros, ya sea hablando aquí o hablando con la ciudad, donde los residentes pueden dar a conocer esas ideas.
 Y especialmente si usted da a conocer esas ideas en un cronograma similar o antes de una discusión focal relacionada con eso, entonces podría ser algo que la junta discuta con el solicitante y realice una lluvia de ideas.
 ¿Es eso justo, André?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5367.772s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sí.
 Y podría ser tan simple como, no quieres que las luces del edificio brillen al otro lado de la calle, ya sabes, en tus edificios, o tal vez quieras más luces porque eso sería mejor para la seguridad pública.
 No sé.
 Cosas así.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5381.754s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bien.
 Gracias.
 Otros comentarios de miembros del público actualmente ven a otros miembros del público que quisieran hablar, pero yo soy.
 Esperaré unos segundos solo para asegurarme.
 Está bien.
 Al no ver ninguna, el presidente espera una moción para cerrar la parte pública de esta sesión de la audiencia.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5416.007s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Y vamos a pasar otra lista.

 Está bien.
 Así que los comentarios públicos para esta sesión ya están cerrados.
 Aceptaremos comentarios públicos sobre otros temas centrales en futuras sesiones de la audiencia.
 Está bien.
 Sólo quiero volver a consultar con la junta una vez más.
 ¿Otras preguntas o comentarios sobre lo que hemos visto hoy u otros temas que han surgido hoy?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5463.805s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Um, viendo, uh, sí, adelante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5467.25s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: ¿Por qué no?
 Entonces, solo una cosa, mientras el arquitecto está mirando esto, realmente me encantaría ver qué es.
 El plan o programa es para el primer piso que rodea el edificio.
 Sabes, nuevamente, miramos más el.
 Lado, pero.
 Todo el primer piso está en blanco.
 Me pregunto si esa podría ser un área para murales, otro arte público, algún muro verde.
 Me gustaría saber qué va a pasar allí para que no sea sólo una pared en blanco.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5528.08s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Veo algunos movimientos de cabeza.
 ¿Es eso algo que podríamos abordar en una audiencia futura?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5532.502s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sí, ciertamente lo investigaremos y planearemos responderlo en audiencias futuras.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5538.944s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Excelente.
 Señor Presidente, lo único que agregaré es que podemos, creo que para responder al Sr. LaRue, ciertamente podemos ofrecer algunas ideas y posibles alternativas para que la junta las considere sobre esos tipos de elementos de diseño a este nivel.
 puede ser representativo y luego informar al consejo sobre lo que podrían reflejar los planes finales como condición detallada.
 Por lo tanto, tendría un objetivo de diseño sobre lo que desea lograr en términos de detección, mitigación o provisión de alguna activación, ya sean murales o, ya sabes, en los planos finales.
 No estoy seguro de que vayamos a tener, nuevamente, un concepto similar al de arte público, ya sabes, un porcentaje X del muro se dedicará al arte público.
 Pero ciertamente podemos ofrecer una norma y algunas ideas para que sean consideradas por la junta directiva.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5606.611s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sí, creo que la representación ayuda, al menos permite una discusión tangible, que luego informaría el diseño final.
 Está bien.
 Lo apreciamos.
 Ahora bien, genial.
 Pasemos ahora a la logística.
 Así que se confirmó indirectamente, pero sólo quiero confirmarlo doblemente.
 Entonces, en dos semanas, el área de enfoque planificada era civil, y parece que estamos en camino de revisar eso, así como el plan paisajístico, así como
 Cualquier actualización de la discusión de hoy, tal vez no se refleje en forma de plan, sino solo una actualización general sobre los temas discutidos hoy en dos semanas.
 Estamos en camino de lograrlo.
 ¿Estoy entendiendo correctamente?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5666.923s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sí, señor presidente, ese es el plan para que regresemos en dos semanas para dar seguimiento a nuestra discusión civil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5675.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Está bien.
 Y luego, Sr. Bowmer, ¿tiene una estimación de cuándo podría tener ese memorando para que la junta y los solicitantes lo revisen, solo en términos de las cosas adicionales que le gustaría ver?
 Probablemente como el lunes, algo así, uno o dos días, así que la próxima semana.
 Excelente.
 Suena bien.
 Gracias.
 Hablaré con el solicitante si desea ser más específico ahora.
 Mi inclinación actual es que seamos un poco flexibles por el momento con la agenda de las audiencias dentro de cuatro semanas, más o menos en función de cómo se desarrolla el proyecto y la discusión en dos semanas.
 ¿Parece razonable?
 ¿O existe el deseo de especificar ahora lo que ocurrirá dentro de cuatro semanas?
 agenda sería.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5736.39s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Creo que podemos ser flexibles.
 Creo que, obviamente, dependiendo de cómo vaya la audiencia dentro de dos semanas, si hay cosas a las que darles seguimiento, ciertamente nos gustaría poder darles seguimiento así como también darles seguimiento a los elementos arquitectónicos de esta noche.
 Entonces creo que con ese fin, si es posible, si hay cosas que deben limpiarse en múltiples temas, tal vez podría ser una especie de audiencia de utilidad en la que podamos cubrir múltiples temas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5766.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Está bien, gracias.
 Solo quería informar a los miembros del público, por lo que el próximo calendario es, lo siento, solo estoy verificando esto en mi calendario.
 Entonces hay una audiencia el 11 de abril.
 Ése es en el que vamos a discutir lo civil.
 así como el plan de paisajismo y algunas actualizaciones basadas en esta audiencia.
 Y luego la audiencia posterior es el 23 de abril.
 Y ahí es donde mantenemos la agenda flexible, pero esperamos que uno de los temas que se discutirán sea más detallado.
 actualizaciones del diseño basadas en lo que la junta y el público mencionaron hoy, así como el memorando del Sr. Bowmer.
 Así que sí, eso es lo que podemos esperar a continuación, amigos.
 Está bien.
 Creo que hemos cubierto las cuatro áreas temáticas de esta reunión.
 Sólo quiero volver a consultar con el solicitante si hay algo más.
 ¿Esperas que hablemos esta noche?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5855.69s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Nosotros no, señor presidente.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5861.274s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sí, gracias.
 Agradezco los detalles y el tiempo también.
 Es realmente genial ver el progreso continuo aquí.
 Así que esperamos con ansias nuestra sesión dentro de dos semanas.
 Y así,
 En este punto, un presidente espera una moción para continuar con este asunto hasta el 11 de abril a las 6:30 p.m.

 Así que estaré fuera el próximo lunes, miércoles o jueves, dependiendo de la hora de regreso.
 Entonces, si llega algo, me aseguraré de que recibas todo lo que llegue.
 Entonces, ya sabes, como Cliff y Beta y todos los demás, te los reenviarán, ya sabes, mientras estoy fuera y se actualizarán en el sitio web.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5952.552s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Entonces, está bien.
 Y entonces, hay un plan para que alguien, um, sea,
 disponible para ayudarnos a enviarnos eso mientras estás fuera, ¿o deberíamos esperarlo una vez que regreses?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5967.744s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: No, no.
 Mi plan es conseguir a alguien.
 Entonces, cuando lleguen cosas, me aseguraré de que, ya sabes, creo que el plan, este plan generoso estará vigente cuando me vaya, probablemente sea más preciso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5980.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bueno.
 Suena bien.
 Pero gracias por la actualización.
 Y luego el siguiente punto creo que fueron las actas de la reunión.
 Y te envié uno.
 Hace unos días.
 Sí, espera.
 Veo que la directora Haas tiene la mano levantada.
 Por favor adelante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5998.488s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Aprovecharé cada oportunidad para recordarles que estamos trabajando con un consultor de zonificación en actualizaciones de zonificación.
 Si alguien quisiera reunirse individualmente con ella o con alguien de su personal, podríamos organizarlo.
 Me gusta si tienes ideas de pensamientos que te gustaría ver.
 O si desea que ella asista a una reunión para poder hacerlo en una sesión pública como
 Piense en cosas que le gustaría ver en los cambios de zonificación.
 Solo quería recordarles que ese proceso está avanzando porque Danielle y yo nos reunimos con el consultor casi semanalmente y el concejo municipal se reúne en una reunión de comité.
 aproximadamente cada dos semanas aproximadamente también en una reunión pública.
 Así que solo quería que todos tuvieran eso en su radar para agregar cosas.
 Y vamos a comenzar con cosas de tipo administrativo.
 Entonces, si hay algo que le molesta administrativamente en relación con la zonificación, este es un buen momento para decírnoslo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6063.775s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vale, sí, gracias, director Hunt.
 Y para que quede claro, los miembros de la junta que quieran aprovechar esa oportunidad, deben comunicarse con ustedes directamente para programar ese tiempo.
 Bueno.
 Sí, creo que ciertamente podemos, como junta directiva, en una de nuestras audiencias regulares, discutir si queremos llevar a cabo alguna acción colectiva de la junta.
 No, creo que mi inclinación personal está en este punto del proceso,
 Tal vez si los miembros de la junta ya saben cosas sobre las que tienen opiniones, deberían trabajar directamente con usted y el consultor.
 Y luego, sí, podemos, cualquier miembro de la junta puede presentar una moción en una audiencia futura si desea tener una discusión colectiva más centrada en público sobre eso.
 Mmm, suena bien.
 Gracias por la actualización.
 Bueno.
 Entonces, Dennis, estabas empezando a decir las actas de la reunión.
 Sí, sé que enviaste... sé que enviaste las actas de la reunión.
 Sólo estoy comprobando dos veces ahora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6127.072s">[Unidentified]</a>: Um, no, hay separado para el, para el regular, tengo el.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6148.938s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: El del 14 de marzo, sé que se los han enviado a todos y solo estoy tratando de regresar.
 Pensé que los había enviado todos, pero estaba enviando muchas cosas, así que no estoy seguro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6164.845s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sí, tengo 314.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6173.509s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: El 30 de enero les fue enviado a todos, lo sé.
 Simplemente estoy volviendo a mis correos electrónicos enviados.
 Y hay mucho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6187.912s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vale, bueno, voy a consultar con la junta.
 Entonces tenemos las actas de la reunión del 30 de enero y luego del 3 al 14 de enero. ¿Han tenido los miembros la oportunidad de revisarlas?
 Estoy recibiendo algunos movimientos de cabeza.
 Muy bien, Jamie, vi tu cabeza asintiendo.
 Entonces, sí, después de revisarlas, ¿cómo encontraste las reseñas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6218.416s">[Unidentified]</a>: Fueron los días 14 de enero y marzo.
 Ambos me parecieron bien.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6225.443s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vale, sí, también tuve la oportunidad de revisarlos.
 Parecían precisos.
 Dennis, quiero asegurarme de que, si nos faltan actas de reuniones, nos las envíen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6239.775s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Rachel los ha hecho todos, así que sólo es cuestión de que te los envíe.
 Antes de irme, sí, tal vez podamos ponerlos todos en una carpeta y luego puedas enviarnos todo. Sí, en realidad son todos en Google Drive, solo para esos y habré aprobado y no aprobado en dos carpetas diferentes. Y simplemente te enviaré el enlace de Google Drive de Google Drive y podrás ingresar allí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6260.557s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: En realidad, eso funcionará. Creo que sí, sería bueno porque no puedo encontrar el de marzo.
 Tengo el 11 de enero, 25 y 30.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6271.473s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Pero no veo el otro marzo cuando os envié a todos el último viernes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6276.139s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sí, eso fue más reciente.
 Ibas a decir algo.
 No, solo estaba de acuerdo.
 Sí, está bien.
 Bueno, ahora mismo estamos discutiendo el 30 de enero y el 14 de marzo.
 Así que sí, parece que varios miembros de la junta consideraron que las actas de la reunión estaban en orden.
 Entonces el presidente espera una moción para aprobar las actas de las reuniones del 30 de enero y 14 de marzo.
 ¿Tengo un segundo?
 Muy bien, vamos a pasar lista.
 ¿Jim?
 ¿André?
 Sí.
 ¿Jamie?
 Sí.
 ¿Yvette?
 Sí.
 ¿Micro?
 Sí.
 Muy bien, las actas de la reunión están aprobadas y gracias de antemano, Dennis.
 Estaremos atentos al resto y podremos ocuparnos de ellos en nuestra próxima sesión.
 Vamos a ver.
 Amigos, sólo como recordatorio de que estaré ausente en nuestra audiencia del jueves.
 Jamie se ha ofrecido voluntario para presidir.
 Jamie, tengo algunos detalles para ti, que te comentaré sin conexión.
 Pero sí, por lo demás, espero que todo vaya bien el jueves.
 Y luego los veré a todos el 11 de abril.
 Bien, creo que eso es, oh, adelante, Andre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6371.794s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sí.
 Sí, solo una pregunta, y tal vez sea para Alicia o Dennis.
 Es el consultor 40B de la ciudad, no lo he visto, y no creo que alguna vez nos hayamos reunido con él, ¿verdad?
 Y supongo que mi pregunta es, debido a que esto surge en términos del diseño del que hablamos hoy, ¿qué es?
 ¿Podemos hacer algo para darle mejor forma a estos proyectos 40B que están surgiendo y para que no sean simplemente los mismos viejos proyectos de bloques masivos que seguimos viendo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6413.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Andre, creo que hubo un par de audiencias en las que el abogado Haverty no pudo unirse, pero su colega que se unió hoy, Chris,
 es parte de la misma oficina.
 Así que no los tenemos actualmente, pero se han estado uniendo.
 Entonces recomendaría que haya un par de opciones.
 La junta podría programar una sesión ejecutiva con nuestro consultor 40B para hablar sobre eso con mayor detalle, o cualquier miembro de la junta puede comunicarse directamente
 a nuestro consultor 40B con este tipo de preguntas para obtener esas aclaraciones.
 Lo único que no podemos hacer es discutirlo con un grupo grande en privado.
 Sí, recomendaría que tal vez para esa pregunta se comunicara directamente con el abogado Haverty y luego podríamos discutirlo en público en una reunión.
 en una audiencia futura.
 También podríamos preguntarlo en público.
 Esa es la otra opción.
 Supongo que no necesariamente calificaría como sesión ejecutiva.
 Entonces podría ser, podríamos confirmar que el abogado Haverty o uno de sus colegas estará presente en la próxima audiencia.
 Creo que han estado asistiendo y podríamos preguntarles directamente en público.
 Esa sería la otra opción.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6508.835s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Vale, estoy feliz con cualquiera de los dos.
 Estoy feliz tal vez a la luz del público.
 Quiero decir, quiero decir, aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6516.687s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Así que sí, tal vez a la luz de su curiosidad y de las dos semanas que faltan para nuestra próxima audiencia, tal vez haga la pregunta.
 en privado, usted mismo, obtenga una respuesta.
 Y luego, basándose en eso, podrías volver a preguntarlo en público o podrías decirme que te gustaría que hubiera una discusión pública sobre eso.
 Simplemente expresaré lo que entiendo.
 Creo que existe un equilibrio delicado y existen algunos límites en términos de lo que la junta puede y no puede hacer.
 Y por eso sería mejor, si hay incertidumbre sobre
 Lo que realmente podemos hacer, creo que sería mejor que el consultor del 40B lo dijera en público.
 Creo que, en general, el equilibrio entre preocupaciones locales y algo que podría hacer que el proyecto sea antieconómico, especialmente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6576.456s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Bien.
 Sólo porque tengo curiosidad, ¿cómo conseguimos
 ya sabes, toda la negociación, como la cantidad de unidades para la cantidad de tamaño del terreno y todo eso.
 Quiero decir, siento que sería bueno que todos lo entendieran mejor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6594.821s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Claro, sí, tal vez podamos comenzar ya que es una pregunta más general.
 Lo planearé como uno de los temas de apertura.
 Para nuestra próxima sesión, podemos comunicarnos con el consultor de 40 B y pedirle que proporcione un breve resumen al público.
 tipo de consideración de la junta como parte del proceso 40B.
 ¿Eso funciona para ti?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6619.358s">[Unidentified]</a>: Seguro.
 Vale, genial.
 Otro aspecto a tener en cuenta es que una vez que estos proyectos estén completos, y creo que lleguen a los tribunales, nos pondrán en un 10%.
 Entonces, con los dedos cruzados, en teoría no deberíamos ver entrar otros 40B.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6639.593s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Y no me importan 40 Bs y quiero apoyar la vivienda.
 Simplemente me gustaría que así fuera. Quiero verlos al nivel del 50%.
 Me encantaría que tuviera un diseño con sensibilidad y tal vez en lugar de estos megabloques, pudiéramos tener edificios más pequeños o de diferentes alturas y cosas así.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6660.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Entonces veo que el abogado Hunt quiere decir, lo siento, el director Hunt, vaya, quiere decir algo.
 Entonces, en solo un segundo, Director Hunt, solo quiero decir que estamos siguiendo una línea.
 No estamos hablando de este proyecto específico, pero como si ya hubiéramos continuado con las cosas.
 Así que realmente
 Recomiendo que no profundicemos demasiado en los detalles aquí.
 Pero Director Hunt, ¿qué iba a decir?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6688.304s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Bien.
 Entonces, en términos de obtener otra solicitud 40B, porque ahora tenemos Safe Harbor por dos años,
 No veremos uno que sea controvertido como discutible argumentativo.
 Les diré que estamos hablando con otros desarrolladores de viviendas sobre cómo llevar proyectos a Medford y zonificación y cómo funcionan las cosas.
 Entonces, lo que podríamos ver sería un 40B amistoso, pero esa sería una situación muy diferente porque no tendrían derecho a presentárnoslo y bloquearlo.
 Tendrían la capacidad de entregárnoslo y pasar por el proceso 40B en lugar de variaciones de zonificación.
 cierto, porque aceptamos dejarlos pasar por el proceso 40B porque estamos interesados en el 20% de viviendas asequibles o el 25% o 20% más profundamente asequibles, eso es algo que podríamos, y diré que es algo que hemos discutido potencialmente con algunos desarrolladores de viviendas,
 Y es una pregunta interesante para ellos si esa cantidad de viviendas asequibles aumentará demasiado sus costos para que el proyecto específico en el que están pensando no sea asequible en lugar de solicitar variaciones, que usted podría decidir conceder, pero tendrían pruebas legales y.
 podrían ser cuestionados, cierto, podrían ser apelados más fácilmente que un 40B amistoso.
 Entonces solo quería darles un poco de contexto.
 Sería una situación muy diferente.
 Creo que el tercer 40B, no me queda claro si pueden simplemente regresar o cuál es su plazo de prescripción porque habían suspendido ese caso en espera del resultado de la HLC.
 Y no han vuelto a nosotros en los últimos seis, han pasado unos cinco o seis meses desde que se resolvió ese caso.
 Entonces, en realidad, esa es una pregunta legal que probablemente deberíamos obtener una respuesta.
 Así que sólo quería que tuvieras ese contexto mientras piensas en estas cosas.
 Lo que Andre plantea es una cuestión a largo plazo.
 No es algo que vaya a suceder en los próximos seis meses o años.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6835.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sí, eso es correcto.
 Según tengo entendido, Safe Harbor simplemente aumenta dramáticamente los tipos de razones que el tribunal de apelaciones aceptaría para denegar un proyecto.
 Entonces simplemente cambia la dinámica de poder.
 Pero, en principio, alguien podría aplicar un puerto seguro de 4 dB.
 Con Safe Harbor, hay una
 normalmente son amigables porque la junta podría rechazarlo por una amplia variedad de razones.
 Sí, de todos modos.
 Así que el presidente espera una moción para levantar la sesión.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6880.275s">[Unidentified]</a>: Moción para aplazar la sesión.
 Segundo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6882.656s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Segundo, está bien.
 Vamos a pasar lista.
 ¿Jim?
 Sí.
 ¿André?
 Sí.
 ¿Jamie?
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6893.147s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Oportunidad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6894.089s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mike, sí.
