 A consideração retomada da petição da DIV Fellsway LLC, The Davis Company, é para uma licença abrangente de acordo com as Leis Gerais de Massachusetts, Capítulo 40B, para um empreendimento de apartamentos multifamiliares de seis andares localizado em aproximadamente 3,4 acres de terreno em 970 Fellsway, Property ID 7-02-10.
 Esta proposta será desenvolvida em aproximadamente 289 unidades compostas por 278 unidades habitacionais multifamiliares e 11 sobrados, das quais 73,25% do total de unidades serão designadas como habitação a preços acessíveis para famílias de baixa e moderada renda.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=126.577s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Excelente.
 Obrigado, Dennis.
 Certo pessoal, para quem não está familiarizado com o processo 40B, esta é uma audiência com várias sessões.
 O conselho vem se reunindo sobre esse assunto desde o final do ano passado.
 Temos sessões temáticas.
 O tema da sessão de hoje é design.
 Portanto, sei que o conselho recebeu atualizações no pacote de design recentemente.
 É por isso que acho que a intenção é analisar isso hoje.
 Vejo que temos vários representantes do candidato.
 Vou entregá-lo a Pat Noon.
 Bem-vindo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=163.161s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Obrigado, senhor presidente, membros do conselho.
 Obrigado por nos convidar esta noite.
 Existem vários membros da equipe aqui prontos para apresentar.
 Pedirei a Eric Samuelson do Cube 3 para compartilhar sua tela e fazer a maior parte da apresentação hoje à noite.
 Vou esperar que você mencione isso e faça uma introdução rápida e mude o assunto.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=198.291s">[Unidentified]</a>: Todos deveriam ser capazes de ver isso agora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=203.452s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Excelente.
 Obrigado.
 Então, como eu disse, estamos felizes por estar aqui esta noite.
 Obrigado a todos novamente por reservarem um tempo para nos incluir na agenda.
 Esta noite apresentaremos com foco no avanço do design e nos diversos elementos da arquitetura.
 Apenas como uma atualização da nossa última audiência, continuamos a fazer progressos em relação à nossa audiência anterior do Design Focus, em fevereiro.
 A equipe de design se reuniu com Cliff e membros da equipe de planejamento e fez o acompanhamento.
 Sessão de revisão por pares e feedback coletados e incorporados em nossa apresentação desta noite.
 Portanto, esperamos apresentar vários elementos do projeto de plantas baixas, alçados e uma atualização do estudo de sombra com um encerramento como revisão e atualização da planta geral do local e dos benefícios públicos relacionados a isso.
 Então, Eric, vou lhe dar a palavra para intervir e.
 presente a partir de agora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=277.86s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  That's good.
 Thank you, Pat.
 Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.
 So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.
 So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.
 I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.
 So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.
 This is our current landscape plan.
 This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.
 So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.
 More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.
 uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.
 And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.
 We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.
 Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.
 So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.
 You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.
 So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.
 So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.
 So here you'll see our ground floor plan.
 This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.
 Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.
 We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.
 This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.
 In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.
 This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.
 So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.
 This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.
 We have our bike storage.
 We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.
 In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.
 The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.
 Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.
 This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.
 We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.
 Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.
 We'll probably have some fitness located up here.
 So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.
 The units are all encapsulated here.
 The yellow would be your studio units.
 The purple would be your one bed units.
 The green would be your two bed units.
 And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.
 So moving up a floor plan.
 So this would be our typical floor three through five.
 And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.
 That's our most typical plan for three floors.
 One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.
 you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.
 So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.
 And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.
 And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.
 So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.
 The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.
 We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.
 So jumping into the concept design image.
 So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.
 This is conceptual design.
 So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.
 So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.
 This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.
 In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.
 So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.
 So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.
 And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.
 And part of the reason for that is one,
 from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.
 You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.
 So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.
 But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.
 So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.
 So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.
 And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.
 So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.
 There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.
 Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.
 One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.
 You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.
 This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor
 gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.
 Here you can see we have the five-story piece.
 You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.
 Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.
 This north elevation is the elevation that's
 most facing Myrtle Street.
 So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.
 You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.
 Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.
 And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.
 You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.
 and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.
 We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.
 There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.
 And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.
 you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Fellsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.
 So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.
 And then just briefly the townhome elevations.
 So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.
 Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.
 And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.
 So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.
 You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.
 So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.
 Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.
 And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.
 We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.
 And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.
 And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.
 So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.
 And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.
 And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.
 So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
 All right, so shadow study.
 So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.
 So we're going to show three items here.
 We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.
 The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.
 And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.
 And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.
 And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.
 So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.
 And this is the 9 a.m.
 condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.
 So this is the existing condition at those times of year.
 And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.
 And so we also looked at it
 as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.
 So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.
 And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.
 and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.
 So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.
 And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.
 That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.
 on those adjacent properties.
 So it's not that until 10 a.m.
 you are in a cloud of darkness.
 There's a lot of space between the buildings.
 There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.
 There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.
 And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.
 So here you'll see the 9 a.m.
 condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.
 This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.
 So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.
 and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.
 And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.
 And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.
 For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.
 And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.
 The sun's a lot higher in the air.
 So you'll see a lot less shadow.
 And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.
 So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.
 summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.
 So it's about only a 15 minute difference.
 In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.
 From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.
 So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.
 So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.
 Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.
 Three, the potential rail trail connection here.
 Four, we have our internal courtyards.
 One's
 potentially a little bit more active with the pool.
 Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.
 Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.
 Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with
 you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.
 I think we've been improving that each step along the way.
 I think
 where we are now is much better than where we started.
 And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.
 And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.
 But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.
 And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.
 So that is all.
 I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1314.237s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado.
 Então talvez faça sentido ir ver Cliff Bomer a seguir, só para ter uma ideia geral, Cliff.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1328.783s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Você pode me ouvir?
 Tudo bem.
 Fantástico.
 Olá pessoal.
 E a última sessão que tivemos com funcionários municipais foi há apenas seis dias, no dia 20.
 Eu vi a maior parte do que foi mostrado.
 Existem algumas diferenças, mas pequenas.
 E eu acho que, só quero enfatizar que acho que
 Você provavelmente notou que a maioria dos meus comentários foram relacionados ao planejamento do site até agora, o que para mim é o lugar certo para começar.
 Não faz sentido falar em detalhes sobre a massa dos edifícios, etc., e certamente sobre os materiais de localização, até mesmo sobre as plantas baixas, até que haja uma massa.
 são até que a pegada realmente funcione, o que é principalmente sobre o envolvimento do edifício com as ruas vizinhas.
 E tenho apoiado muito o avanço deste projeto nessa perspectiva.
 E penso que agora estamos a ver a ponte para a própria arquitectura.
 É importante.
 Estes são realmente conceituais.
 desenhos, mas acho que refletem, na minha perspectiva, que o projeto está caminhando na direção certa.
 Certamente o retrocesso significativo desse último andar é realmente crítico.
 E fiz novamente um pequeno tour pelo Google Street View, só para lembrar a escala dos edifícios em Amaranth.
 até que ponto aquele degrau na longa elevação norte-sul do edifício funcionava em relação à escala dos edifícios do outro lado da rua.
 E eu acho que você sabe por estar lá ou pelo Google ou por estar lá, aqueles edifícios
 Na verdade, acho que funciona muito bem porque os prédios do outro lado da rua têm menos andares ocupáveis, mas na verdade eles têm uma linha de ponte bastante alta nos prédios e até mesmo em alguns dos prédios vizinhos muito próximos.
 Você sobe para chegar ao primeiro andar.
 Freqüentemente, há três andares habitáveis ​​​​e um telhado inclinado.
 Então eu acho que essa redução, no que diz respeito à escala,
 Está funcionando muito bem.
 Vou repassar algumas das coisas que ainda estavam pendentes após a nossa sessão da semana passada e que considero serem pistas muito boas sobre como avançar com o projeto do edifício em si.
 Acho que uma coisa sobre a qual conversamos foi
 É um edifício grande.
 E neste momento, todas as elevações são semelhantes.
 Acho que os movimentos no lado norte são muito eficazes para acentuar a entrada logo ao lado da entrada, o que funciona muito bem para mim.
 Mas note que o resto do lado leste dessa elevação norte também é espaço comum.
 e penso que vale a pena estudar se uma maior diferenciação desse espaço seria útil ou não.
 Acho que outro ponto foram os aspectos de sustentabilidade do edifício.
 Estamos falando de tratamentos de janela semelhantes em todo o edifício.
 E eu acho que seria,
 Realmente vale a pena continuar a ter a atitude em relação à sustentabilidade refletida nas elevações do edifício.
 E realmente existem tipos de tratamento muito diferentes que eu acho que podem ser considerados dependendo se você está olhando para uma elevação voltada para o norte ou para uma elevação voltada para o oeste.
 Pode ter a ver com a distância das janelas.
 embutidos na parede, ou pequenas brisas colocadas que auxiliam no controle solar.
 Mas em qualquer caso, incentivei a procura de formas de enriquecer as elevações do edifício através do reconhecimento e, como disse, de alguma forma ser capaz de ler uma atitude de sustentabilidade nas elevações do edifício.
 No entanto, revisei todas as 27 páginas de estudos de sombras.
 E eu informaria ao conselho que acho que eles estavam corretamente, pelo melhor que posso dizer, eles foram preparados com precisão.
 E eu aprecio o tipo de análise antes e depois e restringo-a até mesmo a um tópico diferente.
 perspectiva, que é o período de tempo das horas reais em que há uma diferença mensurável nas sombras.
 Acho que isso ajuda a colocar as coisas em perspectiva.
 Acho que por enquanto estou
 Estou feliz com o resultado do plano do site.
 Não está completamente resolvido em detalhes.
 Acho que esta foto mostra todo o trabalho que foi feito no lado oeste do prédio que realmente transformou a Amaranth Street.
 Há muitas imagens que ainda não vimos sobre arquitetura.
 E da minha perspectiva, acho que o foco do que vocês estariam vendo agora é realmente a materialidade do edifício, como a escala é abordada.
 começando a se concentrar no próprio edifício.
 Ainda não escrevi nada além de um breve memorando solicitando provas adicionais.
 A razão pela qual não escrevi nada é porque está mudando.
 O projeto realmente mudou significativamente e não achei que fizesse muito sentido dar corpo às minhas opiniões até
 Houve um consenso de que as coisas estavam relativamente estáveis e algum tipo de abordagem foi feita para uma apresentação final.
 Então vocês verão mais comentários meus em termos da arquitetura do prédio, mas também em termos de onde ele está localizado e onde está no local no momento e ideias preliminares sobre paisagismo e proteção e público.
 Um espaço ou open space multiuso, tanto para o público como para residentes, para mim é um bom local.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1773.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: E certamente posso responder a qualquer pergunta.
 Tudo bem.
 Obrigado pela atualização.
 E então, Sr. McCord, apenas... Sim, isso parece bom.
 Então, uma coisa que quero deixar claro antes de abrirmos para perguntas do quadro é... Então, estou entendendo corretamente?
 Se o resultado desta reunião desta noite não resultar em mudanças materiais no plano do local, então, nesse momento, as exposições que vocês já solicitaram e talvez algumas exposições que vocês solicitarão em breve, esse seria o próximo passo.
 Você os solicitaria e depois os revisaria.
 E então, em uma reunião futura, receberemos seu feedback detalhado sobre outros elementos da arquitetura.
 É assim mesmo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1819.794s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Para mim, isso faz sentido.
 Tenho comentários, e fiz alguns comentários na semana passada sobre a expressão do edifício.
 Mas depende realmente de você no conselho.
 É por isso que aprecio esse tipo de abordagem rítmica.
 faça isso, mas sim, meus próximos passos, assumindo que a massa geral, o conceito de massa, se funcionar para o seu pessoal, isso ajudará a informar meu próximo nível de análise, que, como eu disse, é realmente sobre materialidade e outros, fiz alguns outros comentários sobre como as coisas são,
 Para mim, expresso em elevação, mas acho que é mais importante que vocês opinem, e é aí que eu começaria, de novo, apenas procurando maneiras que eu acho que vão ajudar.
 Acho que, num edifício desta escala, vale mesmo a pena falar sobre formas de fazer com que essa escala faça sentido para o local onde o edifício está localizado.
 Se a massa estiver certa e a localização no site estiver certa, acho que você realmente reduziu as variáveis.
 Não sei se respondi isso claramente ou não.
 Peço desculpas se não o fiz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1918.027s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Claro o suficiente para mim, então vamos aceitá-lo.
 Obrigado.
 Tudo bem.
 Com isso, abrirei para perguntas da diretoria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1928.413s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim, Mike, este é o André.
 Pergunta para Cliff.
 Estou olhando para este prédio.
 É um bloco enorme e um longo amaranto.
 É apenas um muro sólido e indiferenciado de cinco andares.
 É muito longo, e eu realmente acho que muito mais poderia ser feito para quebrá-lo um pouco e não parecer um grande muro.
 Eu estou querendo saber se você tem alguma opinião sobre isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1975.908s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Eu faço e concordo plenamente.
 Acho que uma das razões pelas quais apresentei a ideia de diferenciar o tratamento de elevação com base na orientação é um caminho para ajudar a desmembrar o grande bloco indiferenciado.
 Existem outros
 Estratégias que têm a ver com a introdução de elementos mais verticais que poderão ter menos entradas e saídas ao longo da fachada, algumas alterações materiais.
 Mas eu concordo.
 Acho que seria útil escolher um ritmo que quebrasse a extensão do edifício e ajudasse a se conectar com o desenvolvimento do outro lado da rua.
 Então, para mim, este é o bloco com o qual você começa.
 Se os fundamentos funcionam quanto à distância que você está da rua e, geralmente, à sua altura, comece a esculpir esse bloco para obter o equilíbrio certo.
 Será sempre um edifício grande e não há como contornar isso.
 Mas existem maneiras de fazer essa escala funcionar para você.
 Eu penso, você sabe, baias, lacunas, como eu disse, talvez algumas bandas.
 Não falei bandas, é mais uma diferenciação horizontal, mas concordo.
 E tenha em mente também que este edifício tem, então acho muito importante que essa entrada seja acentuada e mude
 Uma espécie de aberturas perfuradas para se aproximar de uma montra no piso inferior daquele canto norte e deslocar-se para oeste.
 Isso ajuda muito, mas não é suficiente para ajudar a quebrar a escala geral do resto.
 É uma boa jogada.
 Acho que é uma peça com um formato bonito para ter naquele lado do prédio.
 Concordo.
 Acho que houve alguma discussão na semana passada sobre como equilibrar uma espécie de visual industrial.
 Quer dizer, esse prédio ainda está anexo ao depósito a leste, e essa é a história do local, é um uso industrial.
 Mas, ao mesmo tempo,
 Se você olhar para o edifício atual, na verdade, o edifício atual é uma estrutura adicional.
 É como se fosse dividido em pedaços menores.
 Mas de qualquer forma, para mim, isso é algo que eu recomendaria analisar agora. Vejamos algumas maneiras de analisar a escala do bloqueio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2163.382s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim, e quero dizer, Eric, não acho que você tenha mostrado uma foto de alguns de seus outros projetos.
 Não sei se você quer voltar àquele slide, mas.
 Então.
 Você sabe, o.
 Assim como Modera Medford, há muito mais.
 Parece edifícios quase diferentes, certo?
 E então eu penso um pouco disso.
 A estratégia seria realmente útil aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2195.203s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Claro.
 Não quero dizer que estou necessariamente contrariando isso, mas uma coisa que quero mencionar é que com a casa passiva é mais difícil fazer uma maior diferenciação dentro dos seus edifícios.
 Quanto mais entradas e saídas você fizer dentro do seu prédio, basicamente cada metro quadrado de parede externa que você adicionar ao seu prédio, mais difícil será atender aos requisitos de casa passiva.
 Então é algo que temos em mente e estamos discutindo e, você sabe, conversamos sobre isso na semana passada com o conselho de planejamento, Alicia e Danielle e o resto da equipe, o que é um
 Algo que Medford optou foi um código especializado.
 E é algo em que estamos prestando muita atenção.
 E é o futuro do código energético aqui em Massachusetts.
 Portanto, uma coisa a ter em mente é que cada vez mais projetos terão menos articulação e menos desagregação para cumprir os requisitos do código energético.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2251.474s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: E você pode me esclarecer o que é o código extensível?
 Isso não é o mesmo que o padrão da casa passiva, certo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2261.774s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Não é.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2262.635s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Então você acha que está indo além disso, certo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2265.457s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Bem, Medford optou pelo código de energia especializado, que é um pré-requisito para uma casa passiva.
 Em Medford, não se pode fazer nada além de uma casa passiva para o código energético.
 E esse é um novo requisito e algo que todos os projetos futuros terão de cumprir.
 Bom.
 E isso é algo novo para muitas pessoas.
 Já existe há algum tempo, principalmente na Europa, mas está chegando aqui e muita gente está começando a se familiarizar com ele, mas exige
 você sabe, maior isolamento, você sabe, isolamento contínuo em edifícios externos, maior eficiência, janelas de maior eficiência, melhores sistemas MEP.
 Muitas vezes, para aprovar uma casa passiva, você normalmente verá uma economia de 90%, até 90%, nos custos de energia.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2320.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Uma coisa que eu queria acrescentar e como Eric mencionou, eles têm
 três projetos de casas passivas ativas em seu escritório.
 Mas eu faria uma sugestão, por exemplo, porque também fazemos muita construção passiva de casas.
 E, você sabe, se você observar como eles são, é um sistema muito baseado em desempenho.
 Portanto, é possível modelar janelas e modelar energia com rigor.
 Então, se você tem janelas realmente grandes, das quais é muito mais difícil obter um ótimo desempenho térmico, se você chegar ao ponto de quanta articulação você pode fazer, grande parte da articulação que é feita é em paredes sólidas.
 E essas paredes são fáceis de isolar e têm um bom desempenho.
 Você sabe, por exemplo, acho que uma maneira de abordar isso seria não necessariamente precisar de janelas tão grandes quanto as que você está mostrando.
 Portanto, se você reduzir um pouco o tamanho da janela do ponto de vista da modelagem, poderá obter mais em uma área circundante bem isolada.
 Então concordo com você, a Casa Passiva tem alguns aspectos realmente difíceis.
 Modelagem contínua a ser realizada em todos os documentos de construção.
 Mas acho que não, e acho que construímos cerca de 18 ou 19 edifícios residenciais passivos neste momento.
 Acho que você pode ter mais liberdade de articulação volumétrica e ainda ficar dentro dos requisitos da casa passiva.
 Fizemos isso e fizemos isso com muitos edifícios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2439.664s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Quer dizer, a outra coisa que gostaria de acrescentar é que sou sempre um grande defensor de que o maior número possível de unidades tenha acesso ao seu próprio espaço exterior e ao maior número possível de varandas.
 Isso é algo que eu definitivamente estaria investigando.
 E eu, novamente, olho para esta foto de Modera Medford.
 Você sabe, eu acho que você tem as varandas ali, as sacadas ali, que parecem muito mais articuladas do que realmente são.
 E talvez pense um pouco sobre isso, como você poderia usá-los para fazer isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2480.297s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Se eu pudesse acrescentar uma coisa.
 Agradeço que Andre tenha trazido isso à tona.
 Penso que a articulação do edifício é outra forma de ajudar a ligá-lo ao contexto existente.
 Não literalmente, mas é uma boa forma de ajudar a reconhecer as diferenças nas várias elevações do edifício.
 o que você já fez no lado norte.
 Sim, temos varandas expostas ao longo do extremo poente que também são recuadas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2517.24s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Então Pat Newton, você ia falar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2520.463s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Desculpe, eu só queria intervir.
 Obrigado.
 Eu só queria esclarecer uma coisa para que não haja confusão futura para a diretoria quando entrarmos na discussão da casa passiva.
 Apenas para esclarecer algo que Eric mencionou em termos de vias especializadas de conformidade com códigos de energia.
 não estamos coletivamente
 Especialistas em códigos de energia, existem outros caminhos para edifícios comerciais.
 O caminho ao qual Eric se refere especificamente em termos de casas passivas para uso residencial.
 Então, eu simplesmente não queria que o conselho levasse nossos comentários a outros públicos e causasse confusão no futuro.
 Eu só queria esclarecer isso para todos.
 É assim que somos.
 Para reiterar o que Eric está dizendo, francamente, estamos entusiasmados com isso.
 Este é um projeto do terceiro trimestre para empresas de Davis que estão na fronteira do projeto e construção de casas passivas em Massachusetts.
 Estamos ansiosos por esta oportunidade e continuaremos a nos educar mais e a usar este processo de design como uma oportunidade para fazê-lo.
 Mas queria apenas esclarecer que era específico do setor residencial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2593.618s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Esse é um bom ponto.
 Observado.
 Obrigado.
 Advogado Tam, por favor, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2600.157s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Obrigado, Sr. Presidente.
 E só para desenvolver o que Pat está dizendo, acho que se a preocupação e o foco do membro LaRue for realmente na elevação do amaranto, acho que certamente podemos concentrar nossos esforços nisso, porque acho que os outros
 Este aumento que todos estamos vendo é obviamente uma enorme quantidade de tempo gasto nisso.
 Mas se a preocupação do Sr. LaRue é o lado do amaranto, não vejo razão para que não possamos dedicar mais tempo aos pontos que Eric e Cliff têm defendido para tentar articular melhor esse lado.
 Isto pretende ser uma prova de conceito.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2653.145s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 André, você diria que é o lado do amaranto que mais te preocupa, ou isso vale também para a frente do prédio, o lado norte?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2665.248s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Bem, quero dizer, eu gostaria de ver mais trabalhos nisso, como Cliff mencionou, você sabe, em todas as elevações.
 Acho que o lado do Amaranth se destaca particularmente para mim porque há propriedades residenciais do outro lado da rua, e é só,
 você sabe, e de certa forma parece uma parede indiferenciada na elevação.
 Então, você sabe, obviamente há a mesma coisa no lado leste, há outra parede voltada para o prédio de armazenamento.
 Então eu acho que
 Você provavelmente precisa de seu próprio tipo de tratamento.
 Também será o que você poderá ver da estrada.
 Então acho que todas as elevações provavelmente merecem algum trabalho extra.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2719.771s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tudo bem, obrigado.
 Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2728.738s">[Mary Lee]</a>: Existe um componente solar neste edifício?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2739.42s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Não sei, Pat, se você quer esse.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2741.942s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim.
 Sim.
 Sim.
 Desculpe.
 Posso intervir neste momento.
 Não estudamos isso especificamente.
 Acho que é algo que discutimos.
 Hum, poder incorporar isso ao projeto, mas não é algo que estamos mostrando ainda.
 Não é algo que conseguimos analisar especificamente.
 Você sabe, em termos de viabilidade, se é arquitetonicamente a partir de uma perspectiva espacial no telhado ou em qualquer outro lugar do local, ou de qualquer tipo.
 Você sabe, outros impactos no projeto, seja custo, design ou outro, isso mesmo.
 Uma resposta aberta, tem sido um tema de discussão para nós.
 Só não temos uma resposta definitiva ainda sobre se planejamos ou não ter energia solar no projeto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2797.862s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: E para continuar o que Mary estava dizendo, acho que algo como uma área de telhado ou telhado verde também foi mencionado em algum momento.
 Seria bom ver como será o tratamento do telhado, especialmente porque há uns cinco andares e uns seis andares.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2821.773s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, acho que podemos continuar evoluindo o design e incorporando elementos que reflitam o que seria no telhado.
 Acho que talvez para esclarecer um pouco da confusão, acho que os espaços de telhado que chamamos de verdes até agora estariam nos pátios do nível 2, que são visíveis em algumas de nossas plantas no topo do deck de estacionamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2856.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Muito bem, obrigado.
 Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2868.589s">[Mary Lee]</a>: Então, meu entendimento é que este é apenas um anteprojeto do plano, certo?
 Ou estamos, quero dizer, em que estágio está esse plano, esse plano está 90% concluído, 70% concluído ou?
 porque tendo a concordar com o André, porque a primeira impressão quando olho para esta foto é que me dá aquela impressão de um armazém em vez de um apartamento residencial.
 Essa é a primeira impressão.
 Mas penso que, obviamente, se este não for o plano completo, então provavelmente haverá espaço para,
 fazer modificações.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2922.696s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim, eu entendo.
 Ah, vá em frente, por favor, advogado Tim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2928.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bem, eu só queria responder quando ouvi a pergunta do membro.
 Os planos abaixo e o seu conselho também podem aconselhá-lo, mas sei que este conselho já passou por isso com várias dessas licenças abrangentes.
 Em termos de percentagem concluída, a lei de licenças abrangente exige que apresentemos um projeto preliminar.
 Penso que, nesta fase, estes mais do que cumprem esse padrão básico.
 Acho que você e sua equipe entendem que podemos refinar e fornecer detalhes adicionais.
 Por exemplo, quando o Sr. LaRue perguntou sobre o tratamento do telhado, podemos indicar, pelo menos conceitualmente, onde pensamos que haverá diferentes instalações localizadas no telhado, pelo menos conceitualmente.
 Se houver detalhes específicos que você gostaria de ver,
 podemos ultrapassá-los.
 Mas outros elementos onde pode ser apropriado fornecer condições que antecipem projetos e detalhes futuros são elementos nos quais gostaríamos de trabalhar com você.
 Portanto, você nunca obterá, neste nível de permissão abrangente, desenhos de projeto 100%.
 E assim por diante, mas a ideia de uma articulação maior com foco nessas áreas de sensibilidade, como o amaranto.
 Isso é algo em que podemos realmente nos concentrar, mas permanecerá num nível preliminar.
 Somente no momento em que você obtiver a licença de construção você terá o projeto final garantido e sua decisão refletirá isso.
 Eu só queria ser muito direto sobre o quão específicos podemos ser.
 Em muitos municípios e com muitos projectos, e penso que com outros projectos aqui em Medford, este nível de concepção conceptual é adequado para uma revisão e aprovação abrangentes de licenças.
 Obviamente, queremos abordar as preocupações do conselho em quaisquer comentários públicos e continuaremos a fazê-lo.
 Mas, por exemplo, os planos de layout do edifício que Eric revisou são mais do que adequados nesta fase para aprovação.
 Na verdade, estamos falando de impressões subjetivas e estética de design a partir das quais assumiremos a liderança em termos do que podemos fazer nesta fase.
 Mas não haverá, você sabe, este é o nível de plano que você obterá.
 Se houver elementos e elementos de design sobre os quais você gostaria de ver mais detalhes, faremos o possível para fornecê-los a você.
 Sim, não teremos documentos de construção como parte disso.
 O outro ponto, suponho, é a impressão de que se trata de um edifício industrial.
 Bem, existe um edifício industrial e sua pegada.
 É um distrito industrial.
 Existe um armazém industrial ao lado.
 Como Eric indicou, tiramos esse design dessas dicas.
 Acho que cada um terá sua própria opinião.
 Minha opinião pessoal é que se parece com outros 40Bs que a cidade aprovou e foram construídos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3166.823s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tudo bem.
 Obrigado.
 Tenho uma pergunta esclarecedora para Cliff Bohmer.
 Eu só quero ter certeza de que divulgaremos tudo esta noite para que, se houver alguma discussão, possamos todos estar na mesma página.
 Então falamos sobre materialidade.
 Já falamos sobre articulação.
 Já falamos sobre detalhes adicionais na vista do telhado.
 Sr. Bomer, o que especificamente você espera em termos de detalhes que não estão atualmente disponíveis para completar sua revisão?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3210.995s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Bem, essa é uma boa pergunta.
 Não poderei responder detalhadamente.
 Deixe-me relaxar um pouco.
 Acho que o argumento do advogado Tam é legítimo, no sentido de que o próprio estatuto fala sobre planos preliminares.
 E acho que o que vimos neste candidato é a vontade de
 Acho que todas as partes concordaram que se tratava de melhorias no edifício.
 Então, do meu ponto de vista, acho que é um pouco mais onde talvez eu teria algum problema com o advogado Tam, para mim, a forma como o edifício responde ao contexto existente e se encaixa no padrão de desenvolvimento está relacionado ao que pode ser classificado como estético.
 Acredito que nas elevações primárias que enfrentam a esfera pública há uma obrigação.
 E eu realmente gosto daquele conceito de prova de conceito que o advogado mencionou.
 Concordo plenamente com isso. Acho que o que o conselho precisa saber é que as imagens que estão vendo são
 em um bom lugar e mostrar que algo está no caminho certo.
 Eles não produzirão altos níveis de detalhes.
 Não é isso que eles são obrigados a fazer, nem é realmente necessário fazê-lo.
 Acho que, do meu ponto de vista, as plantas do telhado e a colocação de equipamentos mecânicos são importantes.
 Não estamos olhando para o equipamento mecânico?
 É o suficiente
 protegido da esfera pública.
 Gostaria de ver mais informações sobre o nível térreo, que é onde fica o estacionamento no nível térreo, e que está relacionado ao alçado oeste do edifício.
 Então é
 É tipo, eu gostaria de ver, o que eu realmente gostaria de ver é da mesma forma que acho que toda vez que eles se apresentaram, eles mostraram que realmente ouviram o que você disse.
 E então eu esperaria mais uma rodada analisando mais
 a estética do edifício, mas como eles ajudam o edifício a se vincular a isso ou a encontrar o equilíbrio certo entre a aparência industrial, mas ainda assim conectando-se talvez com alguns dos ritmos e escalas do contexto circundante.
 Então não posso, é difícil para mim resumir tudo isso em um, se eu tivesse algum tempo para escrever uma nota, o que esperaria ver,
 Além disso, pelo menos a um nível que vejo em muitas comunidades, e particularmente quando há candidatos que estão dispostos a trabalhar convosco.
 Acho que seria uma oportunidade perdida se eles não continuassem com esse espírito e analisassem algumas dessas ideias sobre como encerrar a missa.
 além de fornecer algumas exposições mais fundamentais.
 Como eu disse, as plantas do telhado são muito importantes neste caso porque precisamos saber o que é visível da rua.
 Se esta visão não for correta, então eu não encorajaria um conselho a tomar uma decisão com base nisso até que eu realmente acredite que o candidato tem uma obrigação.
 apresentar imagens precisas.
 Eles realmente representam algo muito próximo do que o conselho e o público veriam se isso fosse realmente construído.
 Portanto, há alguns deles que realmente precisamos definir.
 E então eu encorajo você a voltar com algumas ideias sobre como trabalhar.
 em detalhes mais refinados com a massa do edifício.
 Quanto às plantas, concordo que são bem próximas, mas como falei no início, não o fiz, porque estou muito focado no planejamento do local, não olhei detalhadamente as plantas, mas estão em um nível que eu normalmente vejo, acho que a partir deste ponto, em tipo.
 O feedback que você esperaria de mim seria se eu visse violações flagrantes do código.
 Você sabe, as coisas nesse nível também seriam uma espécie de verdade na embalagem de que o que você vê nos planos esquemáticos é realmente viável de acordo com os códigos, e eu gostaria de ter a oportunidade de comentar sobre isso.
 Vou salientar, e sei que o arquiteto sabe,
 Também tenho quase certeza de que Pat Newton sabe disso, que no telhado existem requisitos reais de código de construção que garantem que os edifícios possam fazer a transição para a energia solar no telhado no futuro, mesmo que não o façam agora, existem requisitos para que o telhado seja estruturalmente projetado para receber
 painéis, e acho que todos os desenvolvedores hoje se certificam de que tenham canais suficientes para as salas elétricas para acomodar painéis solares, mesmo que não tenham sido instalados na construção inicial.
 Então, andei um pouco, mas estou feliz em me preparar.
 um memorando sobre coisas que foram críticas e que acho que podem estar faltando na promoção dessa noção de prova de conceito.
 Eu só gostaria de ter certeza de que tive um momento para pensar sobre isso com base nos novos materiais.
 Mas, caso contrário, eu recomendaria mais estudos que avançassem ainda mais esta noção de como equilibrar
 articulação, e como eu disse antes, sim, neste momento existe uma cidade de negócios comerciais em todos os Emirados, mas na verdade é uma forma bastante complexa, interessante, variada e articulada.
 Esta é uma paisagem urbana muito melhor.
 Acho que você tem a oportunidade de ter uma paisagem urbana realmente superior, mas acho que é
 Se olharmos para algumas das preocupações que ouvimos esta noite, fazer outra ronda realmente promoveria a sua própria causa.

 Hum, a obrigação do conselho é garantir que o projeto seja aceitável, mas o mais importante é que, sob um pedido de licença abrangente, precisamos analisar mais os aspectos técnicos do projeto.
 Estamos falando de impactos em serviços públicos como trânsito, águas pluviais e projeto civil.
 E tenho certeza que o conselho sabe disso.
 Tenho certeza que o candidato sabe disso.
 E só estou mencionando que o conselho não se envolve muito em discussões muito longas e em muitas audiências sobre design.
 E, você sabe, estamos dentro de um cronograma.
 Passamos a focar em aspectos mais técnicos do projeto.
 Acho que avançamos muito no design, é o que me parece.
 E eu acho que agora, se o conselho for alguma coisa, você sabe, você pode querer dar uma olhada em alguma coisa,
 modificações no projeto e talvez algumas atualizações com base nos comentários adicionais de Cliff, então talvez seja hora de dizer, ok, precisamos revisar o civil, precisamos revisar as águas pluviais, precisamos revisar o tráfego.</p>

 No calendário, talvez tenhamos

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4130.222s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem, ok, acho que até esse ponto.
 Certamente podemos abri-lo para perguntas sobre isso.
 Existe alguma intenção de discutir isso com mais detalhes em uma audiência futura?
 Ou você está procurando que o conselho faça perguntas específicas e então as abordaremos dessa forma?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4150.809s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Senhor Presidente, posso falar em nome das empresas Davis.
 eu acho
 Acho que ouvimos vocês em alto e bom som, a partir da próxima sessão, além da questão civil, podemos falar sobre algumas dessas questões operacionais e podemos quantificá-las.
 Ou identifique o padrão que estamos cumprindo para estacionamento público com cobrança de arte em termos de localização, pelo menos em termos de armazenamento de bytes.
 Podemos falar sobre o plano de paisagismo e conversar sobre algumas dessas questões operacionais.
 Pode haver um padrão que propomos se algo não estiver totalmente conceituado.
 Você sabe, seja uma proporção, um tamanho ou uma aproximação, isso pode se tornar parte de uma condição.
 Isso é apropriado neste nível de design.
 Mas, e não ignoramos isso, acho que estaremos ansiosos para revisar o memorando de Cliff e acompanhar mais detalhes de design com base em seus comentários e recomendações.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4220.455s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 Andre, isso alivia pelo menos parcialmente sua preocupação?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4227.229s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim, eu só queria recuar um pouco na ideia de que pularemos uma revisão abrangente.
 E sei que teremos sessões em breve onde falaremos sobre algumas dessas outras questões, mas essas são algumas coisas que me preocupam e quero ter certeza de que falaremos sobre elas e, se necessário, sobre as condições.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4254.242s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: apenas para responder.
 Só para responder, para ficar claro, tentaremos abordar cada um desses pontos.
 Já os ouvimos antes.
 Abordamos alguns deles e, como você destacou, o estacionamento tem sido um problema que acho que detalhamos nas sessões anteriores.
 E não esperamos nada mais do que uma revisão abrangente.
 Acho que temos experimentado e nos beneficiado desde o início de uma revisão abrangente.
 Mas eu faço...
 Eu diria que em vários casos haverá elementos.
 A ideia de arte pública vem à mente.
 Não necessariamente saberemos esse nível de detalhe no momento em que essa decisão for apresentada ao conselho.
 Mas certamente podemos estabelecer alguns padrões para isso.
 E acho que é isso que o Sr. LaRue está sugerindo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4315.214s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 Neste ponto, verificarei com os membros do conselho se há outras dúvidas ou comentários.
 Depois de analisarmos as perguntas e comentários do conselho, pretendo abrir a porta para comentários públicos sobre esses projetos conceituais.
 Mas, primeiro, quero ter certeza de que, se houver algum membro do conselho que tenha perguntas ou comentários adicionais, eles terão a oportunidade de ouvi-los.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4345.665s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Eu não tenho nenhuma pergunta.
 Só tenho um comentário que apoio totalmente o que Andre falou e mencionou.
 E não é só ele.
 Então, só quero ter certeza de que estamos claros.
 Acho que a maioria do conselho concordaria com ele.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4364.47s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sim.
 E eu também concordaria.
 Minha expectativa era que a maioria desses elementos fosse de engenharia civil.
 O outro item que acrescentarei a essa lista é obviamente o plano de iluminação.
 mas também os pontos técnicos que o outro advogado levantou.
 Esse é o objetivo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4385.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim.
 Obrigado por esclarecer isso.
 Compartilho essa expectativa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4390.872s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Posso perguntar se as perspectivas são para hoje ou para uma reunião futura?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4398.054s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Se entendi bem, a intenção seria apresentar alguns desses detalhes em nossa próxima sessão.
 Obrigado.
 Tudo bem.
 Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário dos membros do conselho?
 Não vendo nada, o presidente aguarda a moção para abrir comentários públicos sobre o desenho conceitual deste projeto.
 Eu me movo.
 Segundo.
 Eu tenho um segundo?
 Segundo.
 Ok, vamos fazer a chamada.

 Sim.</p>

 Sim.
 Tudo bem, a parte pública desta sessão de audiência já está aberta.
 Agora estamos aceitando comentários públicos.
 sobre o projeto conceitual que foi apresentado hoje.
 Se você é um público que gostaria de falar sobre esse assunto, fique à vontade para levantar a mão no Zoom, ligar a câmera, levantar a mão e digitar algo no chat.
 Você também pode enviar um e-mail para DennisDMcDougall em Medford-MA.gov.
 eu farei isso
 espere alguns momentos, e então se houver um membro do público que, bem, eu vejo um membro do público que levantou a mão.
 Então iremos até eles primeiro.
 Vejo Allison D. Forneça o nome e endereço dela para registro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4499.191s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Olá pessoal.
 Boa noite.
 Sim, Allison D'Agostino.
 Represento o D'Agostino Trust, os proprietários do 1022-1024 Fellsway.
 Eu só queria começar de novo, obrigado sempre pela oportunidade de conversar e ver isso.
 Francamente, aprendi muito ao longo do processo.
 Então, eu realmente aprecio a apresentação e o painel.
 Apenas algumas coisas rápidas.
 Na verdade, serei mais técnico.
 Eu só quero aceitar isso
 Você sabe, e acho que o advogado Tam disse isso melhor.
 É um espaço industrial.
 Então, embora eu aprecie que seja um projeto de construção com aparência industrial, por que não apenas construir um edifício industrial semelhante a outros projetos que a Davis Company fez com o Amazon Warehouse em Chelsea?
 Isso parece lindo.
 Essa é a intenção desenhada para o espaço, mas vou deixar em comentário.
 Em relação aos aspectos técnicos de usabilidade, algo que foi mencionado repetidas vezes na última reunião, fiquei muito grato pela
 A Davis Concessions Company disse que ampliará a Myrtle Street.
 Uma coisa que realmente não abordamos aqui foi o aspecto da utilidade.
 Há muitos postes de eletricidade e postes de eletricidade bem na calçada ao longo de Myrtle.
 Alargar a rua, minha preocupação mesmo, já que outro dia eu estava passeando com meus cachorros,
 onde você chega à empresa de encanamento, que na verdade fica, novamente, no cruzamento da Myrtle com a Fellsway.
 A linha da sua propriedade fica bem encostada na calçada.
 Então, acho que há apenas algumas perguntas, e talvez você ainda não saiba os detalhes, e eu aprecio isso, mas quando você está falando sobre curvar a rua, qual é o planejamento preliminar no que diz respeito à eletricidade e todos esses serviços públicos, e então como exatamente você será capaz de alargar a rua no cruzamento real de Fellsway e Myrtle com aquela propriedade?
 Paz onde você não é dono daquele quadradinho, por assim dizer.
 Então, novamente, acho que os materiais são muito consistentes com os outros projetos.
 Eu realmente penso naquele projeto como uma rua comercial e peço desculpas pelo nome, acho que rio um pouco.
 Acho que o material parece bom.
 Concordo que é um prédio grande e quadradão que não cabe em um bairro.
 Então esses foram apenas meus comentários.
 E mais uma vez, obrigado pelo tempo.
 Eu realmente sempre aprecio isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4672.525s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado.
 Então tomei nota e pretendo garantir que cobriremos isso na sessão civil da audiência.
 Porque esse não era realmente o foco aqui.
 Quer dizer, se o candidato quiser falar brevemente sobre isso, certamente será bem-vindo, mas não espero necessariamente que ele tenha essa resposta pronta.
 Mas acho que isso é algo que planejaremos abordar na sessão civil da audiência.
 e então
 Eu sei que é apenas um comentário.
 É claro que não é responsabilidade do conselho recomendar usos alternativos para a terra.
 Então, sim, comentário anotado.
 Está no registro público.
 Mas não nos envolveremos diretamente com isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4721.002s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Posso intervir, Senhor Presidente, e oferecer pelo menos uma breve resposta para que não fiquemos
 fazendo as pessoas sentirem que estamos chutando a lata no futuro com as perguntas que surgem.
 Podemos, e certamente iremos, aprofundar a questão específica na nossa próxima audição.
 Sra. D'Agostino, se você não puder comparecer, o plano atual prevê a ampliação da Myrtle em seguida, então, conforme você desce a Myrtle em direção ao cruzamento da Emirates Street, propomos alargar a Myrtle do nosso lado da rua, após a linha da propriedade do prédio de encanamento.
 Então, do limite da propriedade, sim, é difícil ver aqui.
 Não foi, realmente não foi o foco da apresentação desta noite.
 Mas, sim, daquele ponto até os morros, a linha da calçada permaneceria essencialmente como está e desceria.
 Uh, o plano foi para o oeste, estamos propondo alargar a Myrtle Street em propriedades que possuímos e controlamos em relação aos postes de serviços públicos.
 O que podemos mostrar com muito mais detalhes na próxima audiência e essa foi uma mensagem recebida da última audiência também, só que as pessoas não conseguiram ver claramente a planta do local.
 Essa não foi a nossa intenção.
 Portanto, planejamos apresentar isso com muito mais detalhes, mas, hum.
 Os grupos de utilidades que existem, estamos planejando deixá-los no lugar.
 Eles se conectam a propriedades do outro lado da Myrtle Street e não queremos fazer isso.
 Não planejamos realocá-los ou descontinuar quaisquer serviços com eles.
 Depois a curva.
 O plano de realocação que temos funciona em torno deles e na verdade cria reentrâncias na Myrtle Street para os carros estacionarem fora da área de circulação, mas também mantém aquela lacuna na calçada que permite que os postes permaneçam no lugar.
 Então essa é a resposta curta novamente.
 Eu só queria oferecer algo.
 Então você não se sentiu como se estivéssemos.
 Navegando aqui, e nós, podemos entrar nisso com muito mais detalhes em 2 semanas.
 Para que todos tenham uma compreensão clara do que estamos propondo sobre a murta e.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4856.667s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Obrigado, só quero dizer, obrigado.
 Eu sei que não deveria interromper novamente, mas obrigado.
 Isso ajuda a esclarecer algumas dessas questões.
 Então eu agradeço.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4866.834s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado.
 Então vejo outro membro da audiência levantar a mão para pegar Christina.
 Você poderia indicar seu nome e endereço para registro?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4875.96s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Olá, Christina Katch, 130 Myrtle Street, Medford.
 Tenho uma pergunta de esclarecimento rápido e depois uma pergunta de design.
 O estudo da poluição luminosa e sonora faria parte da engenharia civil ou do design?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4898.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Então eu acho, bem, estudos sobre poluição luminosa e poluição sonora, não tenho certeza se eles são feitos rotineiramente.
 exposições obrigatórias.
 Então acho que um plano de iluminação estaria em fase de engenharia.
 Você está procurando algo em particular?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4919.395s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Bem, sim.
 Você vai construir um prédio enorme na frente do meu apartamento.
 Haverá muito mais moradores, barulho, animais, luzes.
 paisagismo, iluminação pública que antes não existia aqui nesta rua que vai permear o nosso dia a dia, principalmente de nós que trabalhamos em casa.
 E além da noite, se dormirmos cedo, haverá poluição luminosa dessas unidades, não só de murta, mas de amaranto nas casas.
 É por isso que tenho que acreditar na poluição sonora e na poluição luminosa, um estudo deveria ser feito.
 para a qualidade de vida dos residentes existentes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4964.733s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Eu vejo.
 Obrigado por esclarecer.
 Então, sim, esses tópicos se enquadram em algumas categorias.
 Então o civil incluiria o plano de iluminação, que poderia dar uma ideia de onde estão as luzes e quais áreas poderiam resultar em uma
 Você sabe, luzes que impactam propriedades vizinhas.
 E isso é algo que certamente poderíamos considerar.
 Acho que a posição das janelas e coisas dessa natureza é mais importante.
 a arquitetura, e então, você sabe, se houver isolamento acústico e assim por diante, que eu sei que existe um código em torno disso, mas isso seria, eu acho, civilizado.
 Então, sim, está coberto em alguns deles, mas para ser bem claro, e o solicitante pode me corrigir se eu estiver errado, acho que não.
 Haverá exposições que detalharão especificamente um estudo de poluição luminosa e um estudo de poluição sonora.
 Em vez disso, falaríamos sobre iluminação e isolamento acústico, etc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5038.389s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Senhor Presidente, isso está correto.
 Os planos de iluminação que o engenheiro civil irá rever incluirão finalmente um plano fotométrico.
 mostrando conformidade e minimização da transferência de luz para iluminação externa.
 E em relação ao ruído, além dos requisitos do código, há obviamente a legislação municipal sobre ruído.
 E se houver emissores de som específicos
 que são motivo de preocupação, como equipamentos para telhados, muitas vezes podem ser o foco de uma revisão arquitetônica e civil para mitigar esses impactos.
 Mas essas são as considerações típicas que um conselho teria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5097.163s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado.
 Christina, isso respondeu à sua pergunta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5103.393s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Ele respondeu à minha pergunta.
 Estou um pouco decepcionado.
 Não haverá um estudo mais aprofundado sobre essas coisas, mas guardarei mais comentários sobre isso até depois do Civil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5115.72s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sim, tenho esse desenho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5118.462s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, também tive uma pergunta específica sobre design.
 Presumo que seja para o Cubo 3.
 Você mencionou isso
 Ele tem as quatro propriedades que existem em Medford, ele tem um pipeline de trabalhos surgindo para outros projetos.
 E então eu queria saber, visto que seus quatro imóveis de cobertura têm várias unidades vagas.
 Incorpore algumas das deficiências que você tinha em seus projetos anteriores no projeto deste edifício para garantir que elas não aconteçam novamente nesta nova propriedade.
 Então, estou analisando como você usou suas análises pós-ação de edifícios anteriores para informar melhor a tomada de decisões nesta unidade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5166.021s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado.
 Então, nesse caso, vou apenas tentar
 mantê-lo sob a alçada do conselho.
 Vou reinterpretar essa pergunta porque, você sabe, existem elementos específicos detalhados nesses planos para este projeto que incorporam as melhores práticas e aprendizados de outros projetos na área?
 Portanto, se o candidato quiser falar sobre algum desses detalhes, vá em frente.
 Claro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5188.814s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sim.
 Quer dizer, obviamente estamos sempre aprendendo continuamente e tentando aproveitar as lições aprendidas em projetos anteriores.
 Acho que uma coisa a ter em mente é que estamos trabalhando com um desenvolvedor diferente aqui e nessas outras propriedades.
 Portanto, algumas das coisas que fizemos nas propriedades anteriores não se aplicam ao que estamos fazendo aqui com base no cliente e no local com o qual estamos trabalhando.
 Mas sempre tentamos aproveitar as lições aprendidas das coisas que fizemos de errado e das coisas que fizemos de certo e tentamos levá-las para o próximo projeto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5222.194s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Apenas uma questão de informação, Sr. Presidente.
 Você poderia realmente ser explícito com os moradores de Butters que estão conversando e ouvindo esta noite? Se você tiver sugestões específicas sobre como gerenciar, por exemplo, luz, ruído ou outros elementos da paisagem, poderia
 Por favor, informe a cidade, ou nós, para que possamos ter certeza de que faz parte das condições ou, você sabe, parte de nossa análise.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5255.977s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, mas quero dizer, sou engenheiro industrial, não engenheiro civil.
 Portanto, preciso que os engenheiros civis me dêem algo com que trabalhar primeiro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5265.004s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim, bem, para aprofundar o argumento do Andre, acho que em geral, o conselho de administração,
 acolhe perguntas e comentários do público.
 E como vocês viram nessas sessões, pelo menos espero que seja isso que estou buscando, o conselho está tentando garantir que, se eles levantarem uma questão ou algo que o conselho não tenha considerado ou perguntado, em última análise, estamos trabalhando com o candidato e o candidato está respondendo e fornecendo esses detalhes e o candidato tem respondido até agora.
 Então, sim, indo ao ponto de Andre, eu acho,
 Onde um comentário, seja feito diretamente à cidade ou em uma audiência pública ou qualquer outra coisa, mesmo que não venha de um local especializado, pode ajudar é se você tiver uma ideia.
 Você poderia, na forma de um comentário registrado, compartilhar essa ideia.
 E então isso pode inspirar uma discussão ou uma revisão que inclua um especialista naquela área específica que incorpore o espírito dessa ideia.
 Então sim, acho que se entendi bem, André, você queria deixar claro para os moradores que
 Ideias são bem-vindas e existem fóruns, seja falando aqui ou conversando com a cidade, onde os moradores podem dar a conhecer essas ideias.
 E especialmente se você divulgar essas ideias em um cronograma semelhante ou antes de uma discussão focal relacionada a isso, então pode ser algo que o conselho discuta com o candidato e faça um brainstorming.
 Isso é justo, André?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5367.772s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim.
 E pode ser tão simples como, você não quer que as luzes dos prédios brilhem do outro lado da rua, você sabe, nos seus prédios, ou talvez você queira mais luzes porque isso seria melhor para a segurança pública.
 Não sei.
 Coisas assim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5381.754s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bom.
 Obrigado.
 Outros comentários de membros do público atualmente veem outros membros do público que gostariam de falar, mas eu estou.
 Vou esperar alguns segundos só para ter certeza.
 Tudo bem.
 Não vendo nada, o presidente aguarda uma moção para encerrar a parte pública desta sessão da audiência.</p>

 Só quero verificar com a diretoria mais uma vez.
 Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário sobre o que vimos hoje ou outros tópicos que surgiram hoje?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5463.805s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Hum, vendo, uh, sim, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5467.25s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Por que não?
 Só uma coisa: enquanto o arquiteto está olhando para isso, eu adoraria ver o que é.
 A planta ou programa é para o primeiro andar que circunda o edifício.
 Você sabe, novamente, olhamos mais para o.
 Lado, mas.
 Todo o primeiro andar está vazio.
 Eu me pergunto se poderia ser uma área para murais, outras artes públicas, alguma parede verde.
 Eu gostaria de saber o que vai acontecer lá para que não seja apenas uma parede em branco.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5528.08s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vejo alguns movimentos de cabeça.
 Isso é algo que poderíamos abordar em uma audiência futura?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5532.502s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sim, certamente analisaremos o assunto e planejaremos responder em audiências futuras.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5538.944s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Excelente.
 Senhor presidente, a única coisa que acrescentarei é que podemos, creio, responder ao Sr. LaRue, certamente podemos oferecer algumas idéias e possíveis alternativas para o conselho considerar esses tipos de elementos de design neste nível.
 pode ser representativo e depois informar o conselho sobre o que os planos finais poderiam refletir como uma condição detalhada.
 Então você teria um objetivo de design sobre o que deseja alcançar em termos de detecção, mitigação ou fornecimento de algum gatilho, seja nos murais ou, você sabe, nos planos finais.
 Não tenho certeza se vamos ter, de novo, um conceito parecido com a arte pública, sabe, X porcentagem do muro será dedicado à arte pública.
 Mas certamente podemos oferecer um padrão e algumas ideias para o conselho considerar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5606.611s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim, acho que a representação ajuda, pelo menos permite uma discussão tangível, que informaria o design final.
 Tudo bem.
 Nós apreciamos isso.
 Agora, ótimo.
 Agora vamos passar para a logística.
 Então foi confirmado indiretamente, mas eu só quero confirmar novamente.
 Então, em duas semanas, a área de foco planejada era civil, e parece que estamos no caminho certo para revisar isso, bem como o plano paisagístico, bem como
 Quaisquer atualizações na discussão de hoje podem não ser refletidas na forma de um plano, mas apenas uma atualização geral sobre os tópicos discutidos hoje em duas semanas.
 Estamos no caminho certo para alcançá-lo.
 Estou entendendo corretamente?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5666.923s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, Senhor Presidente, esse é o plano para voltarmos dentro de duas semanas para dar seguimento à nossa discussão civil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5675.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tudo bem.
 E então, Sr. Bowmer, você tem uma estimativa de quando poderá ter esse memorando para o conselho e os candidatos revisarem, apenas em termos de coisas adicionais que você gostaria de ver?
 Provavelmente na segunda-feira, algo assim, um dia ou dois, na próxima semana.
 Excelente.
 Parece bom.
 Obrigado.
 Falarei com o candidato se ele quiser ser mais específico agora.
 Minha inclinação atual é que sejamos um pouco flexíveis por enquanto com a agenda de audiências em quatro semanas, mais ou menos dependendo de como o projeto e a discussão se desenvolverem em duas semanas.
 Parece razoável?
 Ou existe o desejo de especificar agora o que acontecerá dentro de quatro semanas?
 agenda seria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5736.39s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Acho que podemos ser flexíveis.
 Acho que, obviamente, dependendo de como for a audiência em duas semanas, se houver coisas para acompanhar, certamente gostaríamos de poder acompanhá-las, bem como acompanhar os elementos arquitetônicos desta noite.
 Então eu acho que para esse fim, se possível, se houver coisas que precisam ser limpas em vários tópicos, talvez pudesse ser uma espécie de público utilitário onde possamos cobrir vários tópicos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5766.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tudo bem, obrigado.
 Eu só queria que o público soubesse, então o próximo calendário é, desculpe, estou apenas verificando isso no meu calendário.
 Depois, há uma audiência em 11 de abril.
 É aí que vamos discutir questões civis.
 bem como o plano de paisagismo e algumas atualizações baseadas nesta audiência.
 E então a audiência subsequente será em 23 de abril.
 E é aí que mantemos a agenda flexível, mas esperamos que um dos temas que serão discutidos seja mais detalhado.
 atualizações de design com base no que o conselho e o público mencionaram hoje, bem como no memorando do Sr. Bowmer.
 Então, sim, é isso que podemos esperar a seguir, pessoal.
 Tudo bem.
 Acho que cobrimos todas as quatro áreas temáticas desta reunião.
 Só quero verificar com o candidato se há mais alguma coisa.

 Então, você sabe, como Cliff e Beta e todo mundo, eles vão encaminhá-los para você, você sabe, enquanto eu estiver fora e eles vão atualizar no site.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5952.552s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Então, está tudo bem.
 E então, há um plano para alguém, hum, ser,
 disponível para nos ajudar a enviar isso enquanto você estiver fora, ou devemos esperar quando você voltar?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5967.744s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Não, não.
 Meu plano é encontrar alguém.
 Então, quando as coisas acontecerem, vou me certificar de que, você sabe, acho que o plano, esse plano generoso estará em vigor quando eu partir, é provavelmente mais preciso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5980.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem.
 Parece bom.
 Mas obrigado pela atualização.
 E então o próximo ponto, acho, foi a ata da reunião.
 E eu te enviei um.
 Alguns dias atrás.
 Sim, espere.
 Vejo que a Diretora Haas está com a mão levantada.
 Por favor, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5998.488s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Aproveitarei todas as oportunidades para lembrar que estamos trabalhando com um consultor de zoneamento nas atualizações de zoneamento.
 Se alguém quiser se encontrar individualmente com ela ou alguém de sua equipe, podemos providenciar isso.
 Eu gosto se você tiver ideias de pensamentos que gostaria de ver.
 Ou se você quiser que ela participe de uma reunião para poder fazê-lo em uma sessão pública como
 Pense nas coisas que você gostaria de ver nas mudanças de zoneamento.
 Queria apenas lembrar que esse processo está avançando porque Danielle e eu nos reunimos com o consultor quase semanalmente e a Câmara Municipal se reúne em reunião de comitê.
 aproximadamente a cada duas semanas ou mais, também em uma reunião pública.
 Então, eu só queria que todos tivessem isso em mente para adicionar coisas.
 E vamos começar com coisas administrativas.
 Portanto, se há algo que o incomoda administrativamente em relação ao zoneamento, agora é um bom momento para nos contar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6063.775s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Ok, sim, obrigado, Diretor Hunt.
 E para ficar claro, os conselheiros que quiserem aproveitar essa oportunidade devem entrar em contato diretamente com você para agendar esse horário.
 Bem.
 Sim, penso que podemos certamente, como conselho, numa das nossas audiências regulares, discutir se queremos prosseguir alguma acção colectiva do conselho.
 Não, acho que minha inclinação pessoal está neste ponto do processo,
 Talvez se os membros do conselho já sabem coisas sobre as quais você tem opinião, eles deveriam trabalhar diretamente com você e o consultor.
 E então, sim, podemos, qualquer membro do conselho pode apresentar uma moção em uma audiência futura se quiser ter uma discussão coletiva mais pública sobre isso.
 Hum, parece bom.
 Obrigado pela atualização.
 Bem.
 Então, Dennis, você estava começando a redigir a ata da reunião.
 Sim, eu sei que você enviou... Eu sei que você enviou a ata da reunião.
 Estou apenas verificando agora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6127.072s">[Unidentified]</a>: Hum, não, há um separado para o normal, eu tenho o.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6148.938s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Aquele do dia 14 de março, sei que mandaram para todo mundo e só estou tentando retornar.
 Achei que tinha enviado todos, mas estava enviando muitas coisas, então não tenho certeza.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6164.845s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Sim, tenho 314 anos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6173.509s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: No dia 30 de janeiro foi enviado para todos, eu sei.
 Estou apenas voltando aos meus e-mails enviados.
 E há muito.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6187.912s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Ok, bem, vou verificar com a diretoria.
 Então temos a ata da reunião de 30 de janeiro e depois de 3 a 14 de janeiro. Os membros tiveram a oportunidade de revisá-los?
 Estou recebendo alguns acenos de cabeça.
 Ok, Jamie, vi sua cabeça balançando.
 Então, sim, depois de examiná-los, como você encontrou os comentários?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6218.416s">[Unidentified]</a>: Eles foram em 14 de janeiro e 14 de março.
 Ambos pareciam bons para mim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6225.443s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Ok, sim, também tive a oportunidade de revisá-los.
 Eles pareciam precisos.
 Dennis, quero ter certeza de que, se perdermos as atas da reunião, elas serão enviadas para nós.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6239.775s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Rachel fez todos eles, então é só uma questão de ela enviá-los para você.
 Antes de ir, sim, talvez possamos colocar todos eles em uma pasta e então você pode enviar tudo para nós. Sim, na verdade estão todos no Google Drive, só para esses e terei aprovado e não aprovado em duas pastas diferentes. E vou apenas enviar o link do Google Drive para você e você poderá fazer login lá.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6260.557s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Na verdade, isso vai funcionar. Acho que sim, seria bom porque não consigo encontrar o de março.
 Tenho 11, 25 e 30 de janeiro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6271.473s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Mas não vejo o outro março, quando enviei a todos vocês na sexta-feira passada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6276.139s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim, isso foi mais recente.
 Você ia dizer alguma coisa.
 Não, eu só estava concordando.
 Sim, tudo bem.
 Bem, agora estamos discutindo 30 de janeiro e 14 de março.
 Então, sim, parece que vários membros do conselho consideraram que as atas da reunião estavam em ordem.
 O presidente aguarda então uma moção para aprovar as atas das reuniões de 30 de janeiro e 14 de março.
 Eu tenho um segundo?
 Tudo bem, vamos fazer a chamada.
 Jim?
 André?
 Sim.
 Jamie?
 Sim.
 Ivete?
 Sim.
 Micro?
 Sim.
 Tudo bem, a ata da reunião foi aprovada e agradeço antecipadamente, Dennis.
 Ficaremos de olho no resto e poderemos tratar deles em nossa próxima sessão.
 Vamos ver.
 Amigos, apenas para lembrar que estarei ausente da nossa audiência na quinta-feira.
 Jamie se ofereceu para presidir.
 Jamie, tenho alguns detalhes para você, que contarei off-line.
 Mas sim, caso contrário, espero que tudo corra bem na quinta-feira.
 E então verei todos vocês no dia 11 de abril.
 Bem, acho que isso é, ah, vá em frente, Andre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6371.794s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim.
 Sim, só uma pergunta, e talvez seja para Alicia ou Dennis.
 Ele é o consultor 40B da cidade, não o vi e acho que nunca nos encontramos com ele, não é?
 E acho que a minha pergunta é: porque isso surge em termos do design de que estamos falando hoje, o que é?
 Podemos fazer algo para moldar melhor esses projetos 40B que estão surgindo, para que não sejam apenas os mesmos velhos projetos de blocos maciços que continuamos vendo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6413.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Andre, acho que houve algumas audiências nas quais o advogado Haverty não pôde participar, mas seu colega que ingressou hoje, Chris,
 Faz parte do mesmo escritório.
 Portanto, não os temos atualmente, mas eles estão se unindo.
 Portanto, eu recomendaria que houvesse algumas opções.
 O conselho poderia agendar uma sessão executiva com nosso consultor 40B para falar sobre isso com mais detalhes, ou qualquer membro do conselho pode entrar em contato diretamente
 ao nosso consultor 40B com esse tipo de dúvida para obter esses esclarecimentos.
 A única coisa que não podemos fazer é discutir isso com um grande grupo em privado.
 Sim, eu recomendaria que talvez para essa questão você contatasse diretamente o advogado Haverty e então poderíamos discutir o assunto publicamente em uma reunião.
 em uma audiência futura.
 Também poderíamos perguntar isso em público.
 Essa é a outra opção.
 Acho que não se qualificaria necessariamente como uma sessão executiva.
 Então pode ser que possamos confirmar que o advogado Haverty ou um de seus colegas estará presente na próxima audiência.
 Acho que eles estiveram presentes e poderíamos perguntar-lhes diretamente em público.
 Essa seria a outra opção.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6508.835s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Ok, estou feliz com qualquer um deles.
 Estou feliz talvez à luz do público.
 Quero dizer, quero dizer, aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6516.687s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Então, sim, talvez à luz da sua curiosidade e das duas semanas até a nossa próxima audiência, talvez eu faça a pergunta.
 em particular, você mesmo, obtenha uma resposta.
 E então, com base nisso, você poderia perguntar novamente em público ou poderia me dizer que gostaria que houvesse uma discussão pública sobre o assunto.
 Vou simplesmente expressar o que entendo.
 Acho que existe um equilíbrio delicado e alguns limites em termos do que o conselho pode ou não fazer.
 E é por isso que seria melhor, se houvesse incerteza sobre
 O que realmente podemos fazer, acho que seria melhor se o consultor 40B dissesse isso em público.
 Penso que, em geral, o equilíbrio entre as preocupações locais e algo que poderia tornar o projecto antieconómico, esp.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6576.456s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Bom.
 Só porque estou curioso, como vamos conseguir
 Você sabe, toda a negociação, como o número de unidades pela quantidade de terreno e tudo mais.
 Quer dizer, acho que seria bom se todos entendessem melhor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6594.821s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Claro, sim, talvez possamos começar, pois é uma questão mais geral.
 Vou planejá-lo como um dos temas de abertura.
 Para a nossa próxima sessão, podemos entrar em contato com o consultor 40 B e pedir-lhe que forneça um breve resumo ao público.
 tipo de consideração do conselho como parte do processo 40B.
 Isso funciona para você?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6619.358s">[Unidentified]</a>: Claro.
 Ok, ótimo.
 Outra coisa a ter em conta é que assim que estes projectos estiverem concluídos, e penso que vão a tribunal, vão colocar-nos em 10%.
 Então, dedos cruzados, em teoria não deveríamos ver outro 40B chegando.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6639.593s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: E não me importo com 40 Bs e quero apoiar a habitação.
 Eu só queria que fosse assim. Quero vê-los no nível de 50%.
 Eu adoraria que fosse projetado com sensibilidade e talvez em vez desses mega blocos, pudéssemos ter prédios menores ou alturas diferentes e coisas assim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6660.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vejo que o advogado Hunt quer dizer: sinto muito, diretor Hunt, uau, ele quer dizer alguma coisa.
 Então, num segundo, Diretor Hunt, só quero dizer que estamos seguindo uma linha.
 Não estamos falando desse projeto específico, mas sim de que já avançamos.
 Então, realmente
 Recomendo que não nos aprofundemos muito nos detalhes aqui.
 Mas Diretor Hunt, o que ele iria dizer?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6688.304s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Bom.
 Então, em termos de obter outra aplicação 40B, porque agora temos Safe Harbor por dois anos,
 Não veremos aquele que é controverso como argumentativo discutível.
 Direi que estamos conversando com outros incorporadores imobiliários sobre trazer projetos para Medford e zoneamento e como as coisas funcionam.
 Então o que poderíamos ver seria um 40B amigável, mas seria uma situação muito diferente porque eles não teriam o direito de nos apresentar e bloquear.
 Eles teriam a capacidade de nos fornecer e passar pelo processo 40B em vez de variações de zoneamento.
 certo, porque concordamos em deixá-los passar pelo processo 40B porque estamos interessados em 20% de moradias acessíveis ou em 25% ou 20% mais acessíveis, isso é algo que poderíamos, e direi que é algo que potencialmente discutimos com alguns incorporadores imobiliários,
 E é uma questão interessante para eles se essa quantidade de moradias populares aumentará muito seus custos para tornar o projeto específico em que estão pensando inacessível em vez de pedir variações, que você pode decidir conceder, mas eles teriam provas legais e.
 eles poderiam ser contestados, é verdade, poderiam ser apelados mais facilmente do que um amigável 40B.
 Então, eu só queria dar um pouco de contexto.
 Seria uma situação muito diferente.
 Acho que no terceiro 40B, não está claro para mim se eles podem simplesmente voltar atrás ou qual é o seu prazo de prescrição porque eles suspenderam o caso enquanto aguardam o resultado do HLC.
 E eles não voltaram para nós nos últimos seis, já se passaram cerca de cinco ou seis meses desde que o caso foi resolvido.
 Então, na verdade, essa é uma questão jurídica para a qual provavelmente deveríamos obter uma resposta.
 Então, eu só queria que você tivesse esse contexto ao pensar sobre essas coisas.
 O que Andre está levantando é uma questão de longo prazo.
 Não é algo que vai acontecer nos próximos seis meses ou anos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6835.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim, isso está correto.
 Pelo que entendi, o Safe Harbor simplesmente aumenta dramaticamente os tipos de razões que o tribunal de recurso aceitaria para negar um projecto.
 Então isso apenas muda a dinâmica do poder.
 Mas, em princípio, alguém poderia aplicar um porto seguro de 4 dB.
 Com o Safe Harbor, há uma
 Eles geralmente são amigáveis porque o conselho pode rejeitá-lo por vários motivos.
 Sim, de qualquer maneira.
 Então o presidente espera por uma moção para encerrar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6880.275s">[Unidentified]</a>: Moção para encerrar a sessão.
 Segundo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6882.656s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Em segundo lugar, está tudo bem.
 Vamos fazer uma chamada.
 Jim?
 Sim.
 André?
 Sim.
 Jamie?
 Sim.</p>
