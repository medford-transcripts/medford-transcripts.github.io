    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=277.86s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  That's good.
 Thank you, Pat.
 Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.
 So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.
 So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.
 I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.
 So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.
 This is our current landscape plan.
 This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.
 So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.
 More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.
 uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.
 And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.
 We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.
 Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.
 So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.
 You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.
 So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.
 So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.
 So here you'll see our ground floor plan.
 This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.
 Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.
 We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.
 This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.
 In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.
 This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.
 So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.
 This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.
 We have our bike storage.
 We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.
 In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.
 The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.
 Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.
 This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.
 We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.
 Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.
 We'll probably have some fitness located up here.
 So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.
 The units are all encapsulated here.
 The yellow would be your studio units.
 The purple would be your one bed units.
 The green would be your two bed units.
 And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.
 So moving up a floor plan.
 So this would be our typical floor three through five.
 And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.
 That's our most typical plan for three floors.
 One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.
 you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.
 So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.
 And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.
 And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.
 So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.
 The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.
 We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.
 So jumping into the concept design image.
 So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.
 This is conceptual design.
 So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.
 So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.
 This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.
 In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.
 So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.
 So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.
 And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.
 And part of the reason for that is one,
 from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.
 You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.
 So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.
 But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.
 So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.
 So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.
 And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.
 So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.
 There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.
 Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.
 One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.
 You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.
 This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor
 gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.
 Here you can see we have the five-story piece.
 You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.
 Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.
 This north elevation is the elevation that's
 most facing Myrtle Street.
 So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.
 You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.
 Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.
 And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.
 You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.
 and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.
 We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.
 There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.
 And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.
 you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Fellsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.
 So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.
 And then just briefly the townhome elevations.
 So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.
 Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.
 And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.
 So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.
 You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.
 So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.
 Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.
 And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.
 We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.
 And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.
 And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.
 So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.
 And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.
 And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.
 So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
 All right, so shadow study.
 So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.
 So we're going to show three items here.
 We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.
 The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.
 And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.
 And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.
 And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.
 So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.
 And this is the 9 a.m.
 condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.
 So this is the existing condition at those times of year.
 And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.
 And so we also looked at it
 as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.
 So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.
 And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.
 and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.
 So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.
 And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.
 That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.
 on those adjacent properties.
 So it's not that until 10 a.m.
 you are in a cloud of darkness.
 There's a lot of space between the buildings.
 There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.
 There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.
 And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.
 So here you'll see the 9 a.m.
 condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.
 This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.
 So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.
 and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.
 And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.
 And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.
 For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.
 And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.
 The sun's a lot higher in the air.
 So you'll see a lot less shadow.
 And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.
 So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.
 summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.
 So it's about only a 15 minute difference.
 In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.
 From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.
 So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.
 So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.
 Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.
 Three, the potential rail trail connection here.
 Four, we have our internal courtyards.
 One's
 potentially a little bit more active with the pool.
 Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.
 Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.
 Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with
 you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.
 I think we've been improving that each step along the way.
 I think
 where we are now is much better than where we started.
 And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.
 And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.
 But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.
 And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.
 So that is all.
 I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.

 វាដំណើរការល្អណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​លើក​យក​បញ្ហា​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​មិន​បាន​ពិភាក្សា​ចេញ​ពី​កិច្ច​ប្រជុំ​កាល​ពី​សប្តាហ៍​មុន ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ជា​សូចនាករ​ដ៏​ល្អ​នៃ​របៀប​ដើម្បី​ឈាន​ទៅ​មុខ​ជាមួយ​នឹង​គម្រោង​សាងសង់។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារឿងមួយដែលយើងបាននិយាយ
 នេះគឺជាអាគារធំមួយ។
 ឥឡូវនេះកម្ពស់ទាំងអស់គឺដូចគ្នា។
 ខ្ញុំបានរកឃើញថា ចលនានៅផ្នែកខាងជើងមានប្រសិទ្ធភាពណាស់ក្នុងការរំលេចច្រកចូលចំហៀង ដែលពិតជាដំណើរការសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ចំណាំថាផ្នែកដែលនៅសេសសល់នៃផ្នែកខាងកើតនៃផ្នែកខាងមុខខាងជើងនេះក៏ជាកន្លែងសាធារណៈផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មាន​តម្លៃ​ក្នុង​ការ​ពិចារណា​ថា​តើ​ភាព​ខុស​គ្នា​ខ្លាំង​ជាង​នេះ​នៅ​ក្នុង​លំហ​នេះ​នឹង​មាន​ប្រយោជន៍។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាចំណុចមួយទៀតគឺទិដ្ឋភាពនិរន្តរភាពនៃស្ថាបត្យកម្ម។
 យើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីការព្យាបាលតាមបង្អួចស្រដៀងគ្នានៅទូទាំងអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា បាទ
 វាពិតជាផ្តល់រង្វាន់ក្នុងការបន្តឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីអាកប្បកិរិយាប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៅលើ facade របស់អគារ។

 ប្រហែលជាវាទាក់ទងនឹងចម្ងាយពីបង្អួច។
 តោង​ជាប់​នឹង​ជញ្ជាំង ឬ​ដាក់​តាម​ផ្លូវ​ខ្យល់ វា​ជួយ​គ្រប់គ្រង​ពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យ។
 ប៉ុន្តែក្នុងករណីណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំលើកទឹកចិត្តឱ្យស្វែងរកវិធីធ្វើឱ្យអគារ facade ប្រសើរឡើងដោយមានការទទួលស្គាល់ ហើយដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ ពួកគេអាចអានអាកប្បកិរិយាប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៃ facade អគារតាមរបៀបណាមួយ។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំបានពិនិត្យមើលទំព័រទាំង 27 នៃការស្រាវជ្រាវស្រមោល។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ប្រាប់​គណៈកម្មាធិការ​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​រឿង​ទាំង​នោះ​ត្រឹមត្រូវ​ហើយ​ការ​រៀបចំ​គឺ​ត្រឹមត្រូវ​តាម​ចំណេះ​ដឹង​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះការវិភាគគុណភាពមុន និងក្រោយ ហើយបង្រួមវាទៅជាប្រធានបទស្រដៀងគ្នា។
 ទស្សនវិស័យ រយៈពេលនៃពេលវេលាដែលមានភាពខុសគ្នាដែលអាចវាស់វែងបានក្នុងការដាក់ស្រមោលក្នុងរយៈពេលមួយម៉ោងជាក់ស្តែង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជួយ​ដាក់​អ្វី​ៗ​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ទស្សនៈ។

 ខ្ញុំគិតថារូបថតនេះបង្ហាញពីរបៀបដែលការងារទាំងអស់ដែលបានធ្វើនៅផ្នែកខាងលិចនៃអគារបានប្រែក្លាយផ្លូវ Amaranth យ៉ាងពិតប្រាកដ។
 មានរូបភាពជាច្រើននៃអគារដែលយើងមិនទាន់បានឃើញ។

 ចាប់ផ្តើមយកចិត្តទុកដាក់លើអាគារខ្លួនឯង។

 ដូច្នេះអ្នកនឹងឃើញមតិយោបល់របស់ខ្ញុំបន្ថែមទៀតអំពីស្ថាបត្យកម្មនៃអគារ និងទីតាំងរបស់វា និងទីតាំងជាក់ស្តែងនៅលើគេហទំព័រ ក៏ដូចជាគំនិតដំបូងនៅលើសួនច្បារ ការអភិរក្ស និងការផ្សព្វផ្សាយរបស់វា។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1773.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 또는 당신이 그것을 알고 있는지 확인하십시오.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 업데이트해 주셔서 감사합니다.
 그런데 맥커드, 그게 무슨 말인지... 잘 모르겠어.
 그래서 제가 상담에서 질문하기 전에 한 가지 분명히 말씀드리고 싶은 것이 있습니다. 제가 이 내용을 올바르게 이해하고 있는 걸까요?
 오늘 회의 결과로 인해 부지 계획이 크게 변경되지 않으면 귀하가 요청한 일부 전시회와 아마도 곧 요청하게 될 전시회가 이제 다음 단계가 될 것입니다.
 당신은 그들에게 물어본 다음 그들을 봅니다.
 그런 다음 후속 회의에서 아키텍처의 다른 요소에 대한 자세한 피드백을 받을 것입니다.
 그래서?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1819.794s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 이것은 나에게 의미가 있습니다.
 나에게는 아이디어가 있습니다. 지난 주에 건축에서의 표현에 관해 몇 가지 논평을 했습니다.
 그러나 그것은 모두 당신에게 달려 있습니다.
 그래서 나는 이런 리드미컬한 접근 방식을 선호한다.
 그렇게 하세요. 하지만 예, 제 다음 단계는 여론과 여론이 여러분의 사람들에게 적용된다면 제 분석의 다음 단계를 알리는 데 도움이 될 것입니다. 제가 말했듯이 이 분석은 실제로 물질적인 것과 기타 사항에 관한 것이며 현재 상황에 대해 몇 가지 관찰을 했습니다.
 저는 세세하게 말하지만, 나만의 표현을 갖는 것이 중요하다고 생각하고, 거기서부터 다시 시작해서 도움이 될 수 있는 방법을 찾아봅니다.
 이 정도 규모의 건축물에서는 건물의 위치를 ​​고려하여 어떻게 그 규모를 의미 있게 만들 것인가에 대한 논의가 있어야 한다고 생각합니다.
 품질이 적절하고 사이트에서의 배치가 적절하다면 변수를 정말 이해하실 것이라고 생각합니다.
 제대로 대답해야 할지 모르겠네요?
 내가 이렇게 하지 않았다면 사과하겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1918.027s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 나에게는 분명했기 때문에 우리는 동의했습니다.
 감사합니다. 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 그럼 제가 그룹에 질문을 하나 할게요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1928.413s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 네, 마이크, 이쪽은 앤드류예요.
 클리프에게 물어보세요.
 나는 이 건물을 보고 있다.
 이것은 크고 긴 봉제 인형입니다.
 그냥 단단한 5층짜리 벽일 뿐, 특별한 건 없습니다.
 시간이 좀 지났고, 큰 벽처럼 보이지 않도록 조금 더 부수면 더 많은 일을 할 수 있을 것 같아요.
 이에 대해 어떻게 생각하는지 궁금합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1975.908s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 나는 전적으로 동의하고 동의합니다.
 제가 지향성 차별화라는 아이디어를 꺼낸 이유 중 하나는 그것이 엄청난 양의 무관심을 무너뜨리는 데 도움이 되는 한 가지 방법이라고 생각합니다.
 다른 것들도 있습니다.
 더 많은 수직 요소를 도입하는 전략에는 외관의 입구와 출구 수가 적고 일부 물리적 변화가 포함될 수 있습니다.
 하지만 동의합니다.
 건물을 해체하고 진화하는 데 도움이 되는 리듬을 선택하는 것이 도움이 될 것이라고 생각합니다.
 나에게는 이것이 시작점이다.
 기초가 전체 트랙 거리와 높이와 일치하면 블록 절단을 시작하여 올바른 균형을 찾으십시오.
 여전히 거대한 건물일 것이고 다른 방법은 없습니다.
 하지만 이 측정항목을 활용하는 방법이 있습니다.
 내 생각엔 당신이 말했듯이 해변이 어떤 조합으로 존재할 수도 있을 것 같아요.
 팀이 수평적이라는 말은 아니지만 그 점에는 동의합니다.
 또한 이 건물이 생겼다는 것도 기억하고 있기 때문에 이 입구를 강조하고 변화시키는 것이 중요하다고 생각합니다.
 하나의 개구부는 북쪽 모서리에 있는 하단 디스플레이 캐비닛에 대한 접근을 제공하고 서쪽으로 연결됩니다.
 이는 많은 도움이 되지만 나머지를 완전히 나누는 것만으로는 충분하지 않습니다.
 이것은 좋은 단계입니다.
 이 건물 옆면에 놓으면 좋을 것 같아요.
 동의합니다.
 지난주에 인더스트리얼룩의 밸런스를 어떻게 맞추느냐에 대한 논의가 있었던 것 같아요.
 내 말은 그 건물이 아직도 동쪽 창고 옆에 있다는 뜻이에요. 그게 그 곳의 역사이고 산업 용도로 사용되고 있어요.
 그러나 동시에 c.
 실제 건물을 보면 실제로는 증축 건물이라는 것을 알 수 있습니다.
 더 작은 부분으로 나누어져 있는 것 같습니다.
 하지만 어쨌든 지금 생각해 보는 것이 좋습니다. 잠금 크기를 분석하는 몇 가지 방법을 살펴보세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2163.382s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 네, 제 말은 에릭이 당신의 다른 프로젝트 사진을 보여주지 않은 것 같아요.
 이 슬라이드로 돌아가고 싶으신지 모르겠습니다.
 이때.
 있잖아요.
 Medford mudra와 마찬가지로 앞으로 더 많은 것이 있습니다.
 거의 다른 건물 같죠?
 그래서 나는 그것에 대해 생각했습니다.
 이 전략은 여기서 매우 유용합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2195.203s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 틀림없이.
 이에 대해 반대할 필요는 없지만, 한 가지 말씀드리고 싶은 것은 패시브 하우스가 있는 건물에서는 더 큰 변화를 만들기는 어렵다는 것입니다.
 본관에 출입구를 더 많이 배치하고 건물에 추가하는 정사각형 외벽이 많을수록 건물이 패시브 하우스의 요구 사항을 충족하기가 더 어려워집니다.
 나에게 무슨 일이 일어났고 우리는 지난 주에 기획 위원회, Alicia, Danielle 및 나머지 팀원들과 그것에 대해 이야기를 나눴습니다.
 Medford는 특수 기호를 선택했습니다.
 이것은 우리를 크게 걱정하게 만드는 것입니다.
 이것이 매사추세츠 에너지 규제의 미래입니다.
 따라서 에너지 법규를 준수하기 위해 점점 더 많은 프로젝트의 연결이 줄어들 것이라는 점을 고려해야 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2251.474s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 확장 가능한 코드가 무엇인지 설명해 주실 수 있나요?
 패시브하우스 모델과 비슷하지 않나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2261.774s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 이것은 사실이 아닙니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2262.635s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 그럼 당신은 그걸 지나쳤다고 생각하는 거죠, 그렇죠?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2265.457s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 음, Medford는 패시브하우스의 요구사항인 특정 에너지 코드를 선택했습니다.
 메드포드에서는 에너지 규정에 따라 패시브 주택을 지을 수밖에 없습니다.
 이는 향후 모든 프로젝트가 준수해야 하는 새로운 요구 사항입니다.
 알았어
 이것은 많은 사람들에게 새로운 것입니다.
 한동안 있었고 대부분 유럽에 있었지만 여기에도 등장했고 점점 더 많은 사람들이 익숙해지고 있지만 시간이 걸립니다.
 아시다시피, 더 나은 단열, 건물 외부의 지속적인 단열, 더 높은 효율성, 더 높은 효율의 창문, 더 나은 기계 및 전기 시스템.
 일반적으로 패시브하우스의 경우 에너지 비용이 90% 또는 심지어 90% 절감됩니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2320.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 제가 추가하고 싶은 한 가지는 Eric이 지적했듯이 그렇습니다.
 귀하의 사무실을 위한 세 가지 긍정적이고 부정적인 주택 프로젝트.
 하지만 우리도 패시브하우스를 많이 짓기 때문에 예를 들어보겠습니다.
 그리고 아시다시피, 그것이 어떻게 보이는지 보면 그것은 성과 기반 시스템입니다.
 이러한 방식으로 창문과 전력을 정확하게 시뮬레이션할 수 있습니다.
 그래서 창문이 너무 크면 이상적인 열운영을 이루기가 더 어렵고, 여러 개의 관절이 형성될 수 있는 지점에 도달하면 많은 관절이 단단한 벽으로 변환됩니다.
 이 벽은 단열이 쉽고 효과도 좋습니다.
 예를 들어, 이 문제를 해결하는 한 가지 방법은 당신이 보여주는 것과 같은 큰 창을 사용하지 않는 것이라고 생각합니다.
 따라서 샘플을 보실 때 창 크기를 살짝 줄여서 보시면 주변에 더 큰 효과를 보실 수 있습니다.
 그래서 저는 패시브 하우스에는 매우 어려운 측면이 있다는 점에 동의합니다.
 모든 시공 문서의 지속적인 모델링.
 하지만 내 생각엔 그렇게 생각하지 않는다. 우리는 패시브하우스를 18~19채 정도 지은 것 같다.
 나는 당신이 더 많은 발언권을 갖고 패시브 하우스 요구 사항을 충족할 수 있다고 생각합니다.
 우리는 많은 건물에 대해 이런 일을 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2439.664s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 제 말은, 제가 덧붙이고 싶은 것은 저는 항상 최대한의 프라이버시와 발코니가 있는 아파트를 많이 좋아했다는 것입니다.
 그것이 내가 생각하는 것입니다.
 메드포드 무드라 사진을 다시 봤습니다.
 제 생각엔 발코니가 실제보다 더 가벼워 보이는 것 같아요.
 이 목적으로 어떻게 사용하는지 생각해 보세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2480.297s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 한 가지 덧붙이자면.
 이 질문에 대해 Andrei에게 감사드립니다.
 건물을 연결하는 것은 기존 환경과 연결하는 또 다른 방법이라고 생각합니다.
 문자 그대로는 아니지만 다양한 건물의 높이를 구별하는 데 도움이 되는 좋은 방법입니다.
 북쪽에서는 무엇을 하고 있나요?
 예, 서쪽에 개방형 발코니가 있고 뒤쪽에도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2517.24s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 패튼 패튼, 당신의 궁전.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2520.463s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 죄송합니다. 그냥 들어가고 싶은데요.
 감사합니다
 패시브하우스에 대해 토론할 때 포럼 사용자들이 혼란스러워하지 않도록 몇 가지 사항을 명확히 하고 싶습니다.
 임시 에너지법(Ad Hoc Energy Act)에 따른 로드맵에 대해 Eric이 언급한 몇 가지 사항을 명확히 하기 위해.
 우리는 집단주의적이지 않습니다.
 에너지 코딩 전문가들은 상업용 건물에 대한 다른 옵션이 있다고 믿습니다.
 에릭은 주거용으로 패시브하우스를 구체적으로 언급했다.
 따라서 저는 이사회가 우리의 아이디어를 다른 청중에게 전달하여 향후 혼란을 야기하는 것을 원하지 않습니다.
 나는 이 사실을 모두에게 분명히 하고 싶습니다.
 이것이 바로 우리입니다.
 솔직히 우리는 에릭이 말한 것과 같이 그것에 대해 흥분했습니다.
 이것은 매사추세츠의 선도적인 패시브 주택 설계자이자 건축업자인 Davis의 3분기 프로젝트입니다.
 우리는 이 기회를 기대하며 계속해서 스스로를 교육하고 이 디자인 프로세스를 기회로 활용합니다.
 하지만 저는 이것이 가정용이라는 점을 강조하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2593.618s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 좋은 지적이군요.
 모니터링
 감사합니다
 탄 씨, 말씀해 주세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2600.157s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 감사합니다, 대통령님.
 Pat의 말에 따르면 LaRue 사람들이 아마란스의 수준을 높이는 데 정말로 관심을 갖고 집중했다면 다른 사람들이 할 수 있다고 생각하는 것처럼 우리도 그것에 집중할 수 있을 것 같습니다.
 우리가 보고 있는 진전에는 많은 시간이 걸린다는 것은 분명합니다.
 하지만 LaRue가 고급스러운 측면에 대해 걱정한다면 Eric과 Cliff가 개선을 위해 노력하는 데 왜 많은 시간을 투자할 수 없는지 모르겠습니다.
 이것은 개념 증명입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2653.145s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 앤드루 씨, 당신의 주된 관심이 메리골드 쪽이라고 했나요, 아니면 건물의 정면 측면에서 보면 북쪽 쪽이라고 했나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2665.248s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 저는 Cliff가 말했듯이 모든 수준에서 이에 대한 더 많은 작업을 보고 싶습니다.
 아마란스 구역은 길 건너편에 주거 지역이 있고 단지...
 아시다시피, 어떤 면에서는 특이한 것이 없는 정면 벽과 같습니다.
 아시다시피, 분명히 동쪽에도 같은 것이 있고, 창고 건물을 관통하는 또 다른 벽이 있습니다.
 그래서 내 생각엔
 자신에게 맞는 치료가 필요할 수 있습니다.
 길을 따라가다 보면 이런 모습이 나올 것입니다.
 그래서 저는 전체 업데이트가 약간의 추가 작업을 할 가치가 있다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2719.771s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2739.42s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 모르겠어요, Pat, 원한다면요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2741.942s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 이것은 정확합니다.
 이것은 정확합니다.
 미안
 이 시점에서 내가 개입할 수 있다.
 우리는 일부러 공부하지 않습니다.
 내 생각엔 그게 우리가 논의한 내용인 것 같아.
 글쎄, 그것을 프로젝트에 포함시키는 것이 가능하지만 아직 보여주지 않았습니다.
 이는 우리가 자세히 분석할 수 있는 부분이 아닙니다.
 가능성의 측면에서 보면 옥상이나 현장의 다른 곳에서 본 관점이거나 일종의 건축학적 관점인 경우가 있습니다.
 아시다시피, 설계 비용이든 다른 어떤 것이든 프로젝트에 영향을 미치는 다른 요소는 실제 요소입니다.
 이것은 공개 답변이며 이것이 우리 토론의 주제입니다.
 우리는 이 프로젝트에 태양 에너지를 사용할 계획인지에 대해 아직 명확한 답을 얻지 못했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2797.862s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 그리고 Mary의 말을 계속하면 어느 순간 사람들이 지붕이나 녹색 지붕 같은 것도 언급한 것 같아요.
 특히 5~6층 정도인 만큼 지붕 처리가 어떤 모습일지 지켜보는 것도 흥미로울 것이다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2821.773s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 네, 계속해서 디자인을 개선하고 지붕의 효과를 반영하는 요소를 포함할 수 있다고 생각합니다.
 혼란을 없애기 위해 현재 녹색 지붕이라고 부르는 것이 일부 평면도의 주차장에서 보이는 2층 안뜰에 있을 것이라고 생각합니다.</p>

 아니면 이 프로그램을 통해 우리가 어느 정도 도달했는지 말해야 합니까? 이 프로그램은 90% 완료인가요, 아니면 70% 완료인가요?
 이 사진을 봤을 때 받는 첫인상은 아파트가 아닌 창고 같은 느낌이 든다는 점에서 나 역시 앙드레의 말에 동의하는 경향이 있기 때문이다.
 이것이 첫인상입니다.
 하지만 이것이 완전한 계획이 아니라면 여전히 여지가 있을 수 있다는 것은 분명하다고 생각합니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2928.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: អូ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ឆ្លើយសំណួររបស់សមាជិកម្នាក់។
 ផែនការនេះគឺនៅខាងក្រោម ហើយក្រុមប្រឹក្សារបស់អ្នកអាចណែនាំអ្នកផងដែរ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំដឹងថាក្រុមប្រឹក្សាបានអនុម័តការអនុញ្ញាតទូទៅមួយចំនួនដើម្បីដោះស្រាយបញ្ហានេះ។
 ទាក់ទងនឹងអត្រាបញ្ចប់ ច្បាប់អាជ្ញាបណ្ណពេញលេញតម្រូវឱ្យយើងដាក់ស្នើការរចនាបឋម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាទាំងនេះគឺហួសពីស្តង់ដារមូលដ្ឋាននៅដំណាក់កាលនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នក និងក្រុមរបស់អ្នកយល់ថាយើងអាចកែលម្អ និងផ្តល់ព័ត៌មានលម្អិតបន្ថែមទៀត។
 ជាឧទាហរណ៍ នៅពេលដែលលោក LaRue បានសួរខ្ញុំអំពីការព្យាបាលដំបូល យ៉ាងហោចណាស់តាមគំនិត យើងអាចឃើញថា យើងគិតថានឹងមានគ្រឿងបរិក្ខារផ្សេងៗនៅលើដំបូល យ៉ាងហោចណាស់តាមគំនិត។
 ចង់​ឃើញ​ចំណុច​ពិសេស
 យើងអាចយកឈ្នះពួកគេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងសង្ឃឹមថានឹងធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នកដើម្បីផ្តល់នូវការព្យាករណ៍លម្អិតបន្ថែមទៀត និងធាតុលក្ខខណ្ឌគម្រោងនាពេលអនាគត។
 ដូច្នេះនៅកម្រិតអាជ្ញាប័ណ្ណពេញលេញនេះ អ្នកនឹងមិនអាចទទួលបាន 100% នៃគំនូររចនានោះទេ។
 ជាដើម ប៉ុន្តែគំនិតដែលបានបង្ហាញក្នុងកម្រិតធំជាងនេះ គឺផ្តោតលើផ្នែករសើបទាំងនេះ ដូចជា amaranth ជាដើម។
 នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​អាច​ផ្តោត​លើ ប៉ុន្តែ​វា​នៅ​តែ​ស្ថិត​ក្នុង​កម្រិត​បឋម។
 មានតែតាមរយៈការទទួលបានលិខិតអនុញ្ញាតសាងសង់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ ទើបអ្នកអាចធានាបាននូវគម្រោងចុងក្រោយ ហើយការសម្រេចចិត្តរបស់អ្នកនឹងឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីបញ្ហានេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​ប្រាប់​ជាមុន​ថា​តើ​យើង​មាន​លក្ខណៈ​ជាក់លាក់​ប៉ុណ្ណា។
 នៅក្នុងទីក្រុងជាច្រើន និងគម្រោងជាច្រើន ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថានៅក្នុងគម្រោងផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុង Medford កម្រិតនៃការរចនាគំនិតនេះនឹងមានលក្ខណៈសមរម្យសម្រាប់ការត្រួតពិនិត្យ និងការអនុម័តពេញលេញនៃលិខិតអនុញ្ញាត។
 ជាក់ស្តែង យើងចង់ដោះស្រាយកង្វល់របស់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សានៅក្នុងមតិសាធារណៈណាមួយ ហើយនឹងបន្តធ្វើដូច្នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាឧទាហរណ៍ ផែនការសាងសង់ដែលត្រូវបានពិនិត្យដោយ Eric គឺគ្រប់គ្រាន់សម្រាប់ការអនុម័តនៅដំណាក់កាលនេះ។
 អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​កំពុង​និយាយ​គឺ​ការ​ចាប់​អារម្មណ៍​តាម​ប្រធានបទ និង​ការ​រចនា​សោភ័ណភាព ហើយ​យើង​កំពុង​នាំមុខ​ក្នុង​ជំហាន​នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេវានឹងមិនមានកម្រិតនៃការធ្វើផែនការនោះទេ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់បានព័ត៌មានលម្អិតបន្ថែមអំពីលក្ខណៈពិសេស និងធាតុផ្សំនៃការរចនា យើងនឹងព្យាយាមឱ្យអស់ពីសមត្ថភាពដើម្បីផ្តល់ពួកវាសម្រាប់អ្នក។
 បាទ/ចាស យើងនឹងមិនបញ្ចូលឯកសារសំណង់ជាផ្នែកនៃរឿងនេះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារឿងមួយទៀតគឺការចាប់អារម្មណ៍ថានេះគឺជាអគារឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 បាទ មាន​អគារ​ឧស្សាហកម្ម​មួយ​និង​ការ​បោះ​ជំហាន​របស់​វា។
 នេះគឺជាសួនឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 មាន​ឃ្លាំង​ឧស្សាហកម្ម​នៅ​ក្បែរ​នោះ។
 ដូចដែល Eric បាននិយាយ យើងបានខ្ចីការរចនានេះពីបច្ចេកទេសទាំងនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា មនុស្ស​ម្នាក់ៗ​នឹង​មាន​យោបល់​រៀង​ខ្លួន។
 គំនិតផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺថាវាមើលទៅដូចជា 40B ផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវបានអនុម័ត និងសាងសង់ដោយទីក្រុង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3166.823s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 감사합니다
 Cliff Bomer에게 구체적인 질문이 있습니다.
 저는 단지 오늘 밤 모든 것이 해결되었는지 확인하여 갈등이 있을 경우 우리 모두가 같은 생각을 가질 수 있도록 하고 싶습니다.
 그래서 우리는 문제에 대해 이야기하고 있습니다.
 우리는 이미 연결 문제에 대해 논의했습니다.
 우리는 지붕에서 바라본 나머지 세부 사항에 대해 논의했습니다.
 부머씨, 오늘 적용되지 않는 개정안 내용에 대해 구체적으로 기대하는 것이 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3210.995s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: បាទ នោះជាសំណួរដ៏ល្អ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនអាចឆ្លើយលម្អិតបានទេ។
 អនុញ្ញាតឱ្យខ្ញុំសម្រាក។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ការ​លើក​ឡើង​របស់​មេធាវី Tan គឺ​សម​ហេតុ​ផល​ព្រោះ​ច្បាប់​ខ្លួន​ឯង​និយាយ​អំពី​ការ​ធ្វើ​ផែនការ​បឋម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលយើងកំពុងឃើញនៅក្នុងបេក្ខជននេះគឺជាឆន្ទៈ
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ភាគី​ទាំង​អស់​យល់​ស្រប​ថា​ទាំង​នេះ​គឺ​ជា​ការ​កែលម្អ​អគារ។
 ដូច្នេះតាមទស្សនៈរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំគិតថានេះជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំមានបញ្ហាខ្លះជាមួយ Time សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ របៀបដែលអគារឆ្លើយតបទៅនឹងបរិបទបច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់វា និងសម្របខ្លួនទៅនឹងគំរូនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍ទាក់ទងនឹងសោភ័ណភាព។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាមានកាតព្វកិច្ចនៅលើ facade សំខាន់ដែលប្រឈមមុខនឹងដែនសាធារណៈ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ពិត​ជា​ចូល​ចិត្ត​គោល​គំនិត​ភស្តុតាង​នៃ​គោល​គំនិត​ដែល​មេធាវី​បាន​លើក​ឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របទាំងស្រុងនឹងរឿងនេះ។ ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​អ្វី​ដែល​គណៈកម្មការ​ត្រូវ​ដឹង​គឺ​រូបភាព​ដែល​គេ​បាន​ឃើញ
 ដាក់វានៅកន្លែងល្អ ហើយបង្ហាញថាអ្វីមួយកំពុងដំណើរការក្នុងទិសដៅត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ពួកគេមិនបង្កើតកម្រិតលម្អិតខ្ពស់ទេ។
 នោះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលពួកគេត្រូវបានស្នើឱ្យធ្វើ ហើយពួកគេមិនគួរត្រូវធ្វើ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​តាម​គំនិត​ខ្ញុំ ផែនការ​ដំបូល និង​ការ​ដាក់​ឧបករណ៍​មេកានិក​គឺ​សំខាន់។
 តើយើងមិនមើលឧបករណ៍មេកានិចទេ?
 គ្រប់គ្រាន់
 ការពារពីដែនសាធារណៈ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ឃើញ​ជាន់​ផ្ទាល់​ដី​បន្ថែម​ទៀត​ដែល​មាន​ចំណត​រថយន្ត​នៅ​លើ​ផ្ទៃ​ដែល​ទាក់ទង​នឹង​ផ្នែក​ខាង​លិច​នៃ​អគារ។
 នោះហើយជាវា។
 ដូចជាខ្ញុំចង់ឃើញ អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចង់ឃើញគឺ ខ្ញុំគិតថារាល់ពេលដែលពួកគេធ្វើនោះ ពួកគេបង្ហាញថាពួកគេកំពុងស្តាប់អ្វីដែលអ្នកកំពុងនិយាយ។
 បន្ទាប់មកខ្ញុំនឹងរង់ចាំការវិភាគស៊ីជម្រៅបន្ថែមទៀត
 សោភ័ណភាពនៃអគារ ប៉ុន្តែរបៀបដែលពួកគេជួយអគារបញ្ចូលគ្នា ឬស្វែងរកតុល្យភាពត្រឹមត្រូវរវាងរូបរាងឧស្សាហកម្ម ប៉ុន្តែប្រហែលជានៅតែទាក់ទងនឹងចង្វាក់ និងទំហំជុំវិញមួយចំនួន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនអាចទេ វាជាការលំបាកសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំក្នុងការសង្ខេបអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងនៅក្នុងតែមួយ ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំមានពេលដើម្បីសរសេរកំណត់ចំណាំ តើខ្ញុំរំពឹងអ្វី?
 ដូចគ្នានេះផងដែរ យ៉ាងហោចណាស់នៅកម្រិតដែលខ្ញុំបានឃើញនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍ជាច្រើន ជាពិសេសប្រសិនបើមានបេក្ខជនដែលចង់ធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា វា​នឹង​ជា​ឱកាស​មួយ​ដែល​ខកខាន ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួក​គេ​មិន​បាន​បន្ត​ស្មារតី​នេះ ហើយ​ពិចារណា​អំពី​គំនិត​មួយ​ចំនួន​សម្រាប់​ការ​បញ្ចប់​ម៉ាស់។
 ក៏ដូចជាការផ្តល់គ្រឿងសិប្បកម្មជាមូលដ្ឋានមួយចំនួនទៀត។
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយផែនការដំបូលមានសារៈសំខាន់ក្នុងករណីនេះពីព្រោះយើងត្រូវដឹងពីអ្វីដែលអាចមើលឃើញពីផ្លូវ។
 ប្រសិនបើមតិនោះមិនត្រឹមត្រូវ នោះខ្ញុំមិនលើកទឹកចិត្តក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលឱ្យធ្វើការសម្រេចចិត្តដោយផ្អែកលើមតិនោះឡើយ រហូតទាល់តែខ្ញុំជឿថាបេក្ខជនពិតជាមានកាតព្វកិច្ច។
 បង្ហាញរូបភាពយ៉ាងត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ពួកគេពិតជាតំណាងឱ្យអ្វីមួយដែលជិតស្និទ្ធទៅនឹងអ្វីដែលសភា និងសាធារណជននឹងឃើញនៅពេលដែលវាត្រូវបានសាងសង់ពិតប្រាកដ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងត្រូវកំណត់អត្តសញ្ញាណពួកគេខ្លះ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​លើក​ទឹក​ចិត្ត​អ្នក​ឱ្យ​ត្រឡប់​មក​វិញ​ជាមួយ​នឹង​គំនិត​មួយ​ចំនួន​អំពី​របៀប​ធ្វើ​រឿង​នេះ។
 ស្វែងយល់បន្ថែមអំពីប្រភេទអគារ។
 ចំពោះដើមឈើ ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របថា ពួកវានៅជិតគ្នាណាស់ ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលខ្ញុំនិយាយនៅដើមដំបូង ខ្ញុំមិនធ្វើទេ ព្រោះខ្ញុំផ្តោតខ្លាំងលើការធ្វើផែនការទីតាំង ខ្ញុំមិនមើលប្លង់គេហទំព័រឱ្យលម្អិតទេ ប៉ុន្តែវាស្ថិតក្នុងកម្រិតដែលខ្ញុំឃើញជាធម្មតា ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាចាប់ពីចំណុចនេះតទៅ ដូចជាវត្ថុបុរាណ។
 ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំរកឃើញការបំពានលេខកូដធ្ងន់ធ្ងរ អ្នកគួរតែរំពឹងថានឹងមានការឆ្លើយតបពីខ្ញុំ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ កម្រិតនេះក៏ជាប្រភេទនៃការពិតមួយដែរ ដែលអ្វីដែលអ្នកឃើញនៅក្នុងដ្យាក្រាមគឺពិតជាអាចធ្វើទៅបានតាមលក្ខណៈជាក់លាក់ ហើយខ្ញុំចង់ផ្តល់ឱកាសក្នុងការធ្វើអត្ថាធិប្បាយលើវា។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងចង្អុលបង្ហាញ ហើយខ្ញុំក៏ដឹងថា ស្ថាបត្យករក៏ដឹងដែរ
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំប្រាកដថា Pat Newton ដឹងហើយថាមានតម្រូវការកូដអគារនៅលើដំបូលពិតប្រាកដ ដើម្បីធានាថាអគារអាចបំប្លែងទៅជាពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យនៅលើដំបូលនាពេលអនាគត ហើយទោះបីជាមិនមានឥឡូវនេះក៏ដោយ ក៏នៅតែមានតម្រូវការដែលដំបូលត្រូវបានរចនាឡើងជារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធដើម្បីផ្ទុកពួកគេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកអភិវឌ្ឍន៍ទាំងអស់សព្វថ្ងៃនេះនឹងធានាថាពួកគេមានលទ្ធភាពគ្រប់គ្រាន់ទៅកាន់បន្ទប់អគ្គិសនីដើម្បីដំឡើងបន្ទះស្រូបពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យទោះបីជាពួកគេមិនត្រូវបានដំឡើងក្នុងអំឡុងពេលដំណើរការសាងសង់ដំបូងក៏ដោយ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ចំណាយ​ពេល​បន្តិច ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​រីករាយ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ត្រៀម​ខ្លួន​ជា​ស្រេច។
 អនុស្សរណៈអំពីរឿងសំខាន់ៗដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាអាចនឹងបាត់បង់ក្នុងការផ្សព្វផ្សាយភស្តុតាងនៃគំនិត។
 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាខ្ញុំមានពេលវេលាដើម្បីគិតអំពីរឿងនេះទាក់ទងនឹងសម្ភារៈថ្មី។
 ប៉ុន្តែលើសពីនេះទៅទៀត ខ្ញុំសូមផ្តល់អនុសាសន៍ឱ្យធ្វើការស្រាវជ្រាវបន្ថែមទៀត ដើម្បីហួសពីគោលគំនិតនៃរបៀបរក្សាតុល្យភាព
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយពីមុនមក បាទ អេមីរ៉ាតនីមួយៗឥឡូវនេះមានទីក្រុងពាណិជ្ជកម្មមួយ ប៉ុន្តែតាមពិតទៅវាមានទម្រង់ស្មុគស្មាញ គួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ ចម្រុះ និងច្បាស់លាស់។
 នេះជាទិដ្ឋភាពទីក្រុងកាន់តែប្រសើរ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​អ្នក​មាន​ឱកាស​បាន​មើល​ទិដ្ឋភាព​ដ៏​ស្រស់​ស្អាត​នៃ​ទីក្រុង ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​នៅ​ទីនោះ
 ប្រសិនបើយើងក្រឡេកមើលកង្វល់មួយចំនួនដែលយើងបានឮនៅយប់នេះ សូមលើកវាមួយជុំទៀត ដើម្បីឈានទៅរកគោលដៅផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់អ្នក។
 ដូច្នេះ សូមអភ័យទោស ប្រសិនបើនេះជារង្វង់បន្តិច ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនអាចទេ អ្នកដឹងទេថា ក្នុងសេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍មួយ តើអ្វីជាសេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍មួយទៀត?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3690.346s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 디자인은 중요한 부분인데 클리프가 이를 종합적으로 평가할 수 있는 좋은 기회를 얻었다고 생각하고 지원자는 그의 피드백에 호응하는 것 같다.
 글쎄, 프로젝트가 수용 가능한지 확인하는 것은 의회의 책임이지만, 더 중요한 것은 전체 허가를 신청할 때 프로젝트의 보다 기술적인 측면을 고려해야 한다는 것입니다.
 우리는 폭우 운송 및 토목 공학과 같은 공공 서비스에 미치는 영향에 대해 이야기하고 있습니다.
 나는 의회가 그것을 알고 있다고 확신합니다.
 그 후보자도 그걸 알고 있을 거라 확신해요.
 나는 이 조언이 일반 디자인 청중과 긴 토론을 하게 되지는 않을 것이라고 추측할 뿐입니다.
 아시다시피 우리는 예정대로 진행되고 있습니다.
 우리는 프로젝트의 보다 기술적인 측면을 고려하기 시작합니다.
 저는 우리가 디자인 측면에서 많은 진전을 이루었다고 생각합니다.
 이제 제안 사항이 있으면 고려해야 할 사항이 있다는 것을 알고 계실 것입니다.
 디자인 변경, 아마도 Cliff의 업데이트 및 추가 사항이 있을 수 있으며, "좋아, 건설도 살펴봐야 하고, 폭풍도 살펴봐야 하고, 교통도 살펴봐야 해."라고 말할 때일 수도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3770.168s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 네, Elvin 변호사님 덕분입니다.
 오늘 회의의 목적은 이사회가 더 많은 세부 사항이나 변경 사항을 확인하기를 원하기 때문에 나머지 설계 요소를 명확히 하는 것입니다.

 나는 여론에 동의한다
 가까운 시일 내에 이 메모에도 감사하겠습니다.
 따라서 Cliff의 사본을 보내주시면 정말 감사하겠습니다.
 하지만 저는 상한선에 대한 자세한 내용과 컨설턴트의 제안 및 귀하의 요청의 중요성에 대한 자세한 내용을 듣고 있습니다.
 Baumer는 블록을 마무리하는 올바른 전략에 대해 이야기합니다.
 자세한 내용은 아래에서 들었습니다.
 나는 그것이 내가 관심을 갖는 주요 부분이라고 생각합니다.
 예, Baumer는 그 계획에 대해 논평했습니다.
 그들은 매우 가깝습니다.
 귀하는 이미 필요한 정보를 대부분 갖고 있는 것 같지만, 우리는 그것에 대해 생각해 보고 싶습니다.
 그래서 이 모든 것들을 고려할 수 있는 또 다른 디자인 미팅을 가질 수 있을 것 같아요.
 하지만 저는 Alvin 변호사의 의견에 동의합니다.
 이것을 끝없는 프로젝트로 남겨둘 수는 없습니다.
 우리가 가질 수 있는 달력에는
 아직 또 다른 디자인 회의를 위한 공간이 남아 있으며 일정을 맞추기 위해 몇 가지 결정을 내려야 할 것입니다.
 이제 2주 후에 예정된 다음 회의로 넘어가겠습니다.
 글쎄, 필요한 변경이나 필요한 문서 작성 문제는 실제로 엔지니어링의 본질입니다.
 좋습니다. 오늘 논의를 바탕으로 변경해야 할지 여부에 대해 논의할 수 있습니다. 하지만 그렇습니다. 그렇게 하려면 디자인도 통합해야 합니다.
 이사회가 법률에서 요구하는 시간 내에 평가해야 하는 모든 것을 평가할 수 있도록 기술적 요소에 대한 충분한 정보를 제공합니다.
 이것이 내 의도였습니다.
 계속하십시오.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3927.624s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 아뇨, 그냥 다른 걸 알아주셨으면 좋겠어요. 음.
 아, 평면도요.
 클리프가 보고 있는 것도 중요하고 좋은 일이지만, 현실은 완전한 승인을 받으면 결정이 내려지면 이러한 계획이 변경될 수 있다는 것입니다. 정부 검사를 위한 관리 계약에 기초한 것인지, 아니면 그들이 짓고 있는 구조가 큰 변화가 아닌 한 변경될 수 있는지, 종종 수정이 아닌 경우도 있습니다.
 기본적인 수정을 보면 대개 40B부터 시작하게 됩니다.
 평면도 및 아파트 크기와 같은 문제에 많은 시간을 소비해서는 안됩니다.
 객실 등이있는 객실이 있습니다. 하지만 이는 필요에 따라 조절할 수 있는 측면일 뿐이다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3984.346s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 가능하다면, 대통령 각하.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3988.356s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 응, 안드레 부탁해.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3990.077s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 내 말은, 우리가 몇 달 전에 또 다른 40B 허가 절차를 거쳤으며, 커뮤니티를 위한 더 나은 프로젝트가 될 것이라고 생각하는 몇 가지 주요 프로젝트에 대해 자세히 논의했다는 점을 지적하고 싶습니다.
 나는 우리가 이 프로젝트의 규모를 물려받았다고 생각한다.
 저를 믿으십시오. 다시 시작했다면 블록 중앙에 거대한 직사각형을 그리지 않았을 것입니다.
 하지만 우리에게는 이 프로젝트를 안전하게 보호하기 위해 최선을 다해야 할 책임이 있다고 생각합니다.
 그 크기는 정말 중요하며 가능한 최선의 방법으로 통합됩니다.
 저는 얘기를 안 해요.
 우리는 실제로 주차 문제를 분석하거나 논의하지 않습니다.
 아직 주차 공간 수에 대해서는 논의하지 않았습니다.
 우리는 전기 자동차 충전기의 수에 대해 말하는 것이 아닙니다.
 우리는 수평적 적용에 대해 말하는 것이 아닙니다.
 제가 언급한 모든 기술적 문제를 제외하고는 공공미술에 관한 것이 아닙니다.
 그래서 저는 깃발을 들고 이것이 우리가 이야기해야 할 문제라고 말하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4065.017s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 감사합니다 앤드류.
 어쩌면 내가 잘못 기억하고 있을지도 모릅니다.
 최근 청문회에서 주차와 휠체어에 관한 논의 중 일부는 엔지니어링과 관련된 것이라고 생각하지만, 조경과 더불어 반드시 논의되어야 한다는 점에는 전적으로 동의합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4082.101s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 사람들은 어떻게 들어오고 나가나요?
 쓰레기는 어떻게 들어오고 나가나요?
 이 모든 것.
 우리가 지난 400억 건의 조치를 취한 것은 진전이었습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4092.67s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 네, 하지만 제 기억으로는 40B가 토목공학부를 졸업했습니다.
 제가 틀렸을 수도 있지만, 그렇습니다. 후보자가 이 데이터를 제공할 의도가 없다면 그는 제공할 계획입니다.
 의회에는 이러한 세부 사항이 필요합니다.
 저는 건물의 기능이 매우 중요하다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4118.096s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 분명히.
 이 정보 중 일부는 평면도에 포함되어 있으며 이 패키지에도 포함되어 있습니다.
 이 주제에 관한 모든 질문에 답변해 드리겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4130.222s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 글쎄요, 지금은 그럴 것 같아요.
 물론 궁금할 수도 있습니다.
 향후 청문회에서 이 문제를 자세히 논의할 계획입니까?
 아니면 이사회가 구체적인 질문을 하고 그런 식으로 대답하기를 원하시나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4150.809s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 대통령님, Davis Corporation을 대신하여 말씀드려도 될까요?
 내 생각엔
 귀하의 의견을 명확하게 들은 것으로 생각되며 다음 회의로 넘어가겠습니다. 민사 문제 외에도 이러한 운영 문제 중 일부를 논의하고 확인할 수도 있습니다.
 아니면 예술 비용을 지불하는 공공 주차장의 위치(적어도 바이트 저장 측면에서)를 생각해 보세요.
 우리는 조경 계획 및 일부 관련 운영 문제에 대해 논의할 수 있습니다.
 불완전한 것이 있으면 표준을 만들 수 있습니다.
 아시다시피 크기나 대략적인 크기에 관한 것이라면 아마도 상태의 일부일 것입니다.
 이 수준의 디자인에 적합합니다.
 그러나 우리는 그 점을 놓치지 않을 것이며 Cliff의 메모를 검토하고 그의 의견과 제안을 바탕으로 추가적인 디자인 세부 사항을 마무리하고 싶을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4220.455s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 앤드류, 최소한 걱정거리를 좀 덜어줄 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4227.229s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 글쎄요, 추천과는 별개로 저는 우리가 고려할 모든 아이디어를 충분히 홍보하고 싶습니다.
 다른 문제를 논의하기 위해 곧 회의를 가질 것이라는 것을 알고 있지만 이것이 제가 이야기하고 있는 사항이고 우리가 논의하기를 원하는 사항이며, 필요한 경우 조건도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4254.242s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 그냥 대답하세요.
 명확하게 답변해 주시면 모든 문제를 해결하도록 노력하겠습니다.
 우리는 전에 그것들을 들어본 적이 있습니다.
 우리는 이러한 문제 중 일부를 논의했으며, 귀하가 지적한 것처럼 주차 문제는 이전 회의에서 심도있게 다루었던 문제라고 생각합니다.
 전체 리뷰를 기대합니다.
 나는 우리가 이 결과를 달성했으며 전체 검토가 시작된 이래로 큰 이익을 얻었다고 믿습니다.
 하지만 난...
 내 말은 많은 경우에 관련된 요인이 있다는 것입니다.
 공공미술이라는 아이디어가 떠올랐어요.
 우리는 이 결정을 이사회에 제출할 때 세부사항의 수준을 알 필요가 없습니다.
 하지만 실제로 이에 대한 몇 가지 표준을 설정할 수 있습니다.
 나는 이것이 Lau Rohr가 제안한 것이라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4315.214s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 추가 질문이나 의견이 있는지 알아보기 위해 지금 이사회 구성원들에게 연락하겠습니다.
 위원회의 질문과 의견을 고려한 후, 저는 이러한 아이디어를 조정하기 위해 공개 토론의 기회를 남겨두려고 합니다.
 하지만 먼저 이사회 구성원에게 추가 질문이나 의견이 있는 경우 의견을 들을 수 있는 기회를 주고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4345.665s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 나는 아무런 문제가 없습니다.
 나는 단 하나의 의견만을 가지고 있으며 Andrei가 말하고 말하는 것을 전적으로 지지합니다.
 그리고 그뿐만이 아닙니다.
 그래서 저는 우리가 확실히 했는지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 나는 대부분의 의회 의원들이 그에게 동의할 것이라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4364.47s">[Unidentified]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 나도 동의한다.
 나는 이러한 항목이 주로 시민 행위가 될 것으로 기대합니다.
 이 목록에 추가하고 싶은 또 다른 항목은 조명 프로젝트입니다.
 다른 변호사가 제기한 기술적 포인트도 있다.
 이것이 목표입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4385.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 설명해 주셔서 감사합니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4390.872s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 이것은 오늘의 회의인가, 아니면 미래의 회의인가?</p>

 그래서 저는 이 문제를 민사적인 부분에서 논의하도록 하겠다.
 왜냐면 여기서는 그게 문제가 아니거든요.
 내 말은, 후보자들이 이것에 대해 조금 이야기하고 싶었다면 환영할 일이지만 그들이 응답할 것이라고 기대하지는 않습니다.
 하지만 내 생각에 그것은 우리가 그 과정의 민사적인 부분에서 말할 것입니다.
 그런 다음
 나는 이것이 단지 의견이라는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 물론 대체 토지 이용을 권장하는 것은 위원회의 임무가 아닙니다.
 평론가가 지적한 내용입니다.
 이것은 공개 기록입니다.
 하지만 우리는 직접 참여하지는 않을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4721.002s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 대통령 각하, 우리가 머물지 않도록 제가 들어가서 최소한 짧은 답변이라도 하도록 하겠습니다.
 문제가 발생하면 모두가 우리가 문제를 다루고 있다는 느낌을 갖도록 하십시오.
 우리는 향후 청문회에서 구체적인 문제를 조사할 수 있습니다.
 다고스티노 부인. 참석할 수 없는 경우 현재 계획에서는 다음 머틀 확장이 필요하므로 머틀을 따라 주요 교차로까지 계속할 때 파이프라인 건물을 건너는 도로 한쪽에 머틀 확장을 제안하고 있습니다.
 그래서 건설선에서 보면, 네, 여기서는 보기 어렵습니다.
 아니요, 오늘 쇼의 요점은 그게 아닙니다.
 하지만 네, 이 지점부터 올라가면 도로의 본선은 그대로 유지되고 아래로 내려갑니다.
 아, 계획은 서쪽으로 이전하는 것이고 가로등 기둥과 관련하여 우리가 점유하고 관리하는 땅에 머틀 로드를 넓힐 것을 제안하고 있습니다.
 이 문제는 다음 청문회에서 자세히 제시할 수 있고, 이는 이전 청문회에서 얻은 정보이지만 국민들은 요점을 명확하게 파악하지 못합니다.
 이것은 우리의 의도가 아닙니다.
 그래서 우리는 더 자세히 알아볼 계획이지만 그게 전부입니다.
 우리는 기존 유틸리티 서비스 세트를 변경하지 않고 그대로 둘 계획입니다.
 그들이 머틀 로드 반대편에 있는 곳으로 전화를 걸고 있는데 우리는 그렇게 하고 싶지 않습니다.
 우리는 해당 서비스를 이전하거나 중단할 계획이 없습니다.
 그 다음에는 곡선이 있습니다.
 우리의 교통 계획은 본질적으로 머틀 로드에 자동차가 방해가 되지 않는 곳에 주차할 수 있는 공간을 확보하는 동시에 보도 공간을 보존하여 볼라드가 제자리에 유지되도록 하는 것입니다.
 이것은 다시 짧은 대답입니다.
 나는 단지 뭔가를 주고 싶다.
 이는 당신의 감정이 우리의 감정과 다르다는 것을 의미합니다.
 여기를 검토하면 2주 후에 해당 문제에 대해 더 자세히 논의할 수 있습니다.

 이것이 바로 우리가 고려할 수 있는 사항입니다.
 창문이나 물건의 배치가 더 중요한 것 같아요.
 건물이고, 음소거 같은 게 있으면 규칙이 있다는 건 알지만 문명화된 것 같아요.
 그렇습니다. 이것과 관련된 몇 가지 요점이 있습니다. 그러나 분명히 말하면, 제가 틀렸다면 질문자가 저를 정정할 수 있습니다. 저는 그렇게 생각하지 않습니다.
 빛과 소음 공해에 대한 상세한 연구를 다루는 전시회가 열릴 예정입니다.

 이 건물을 설계할 때 이전 프로젝트의 몇 가지 결함을 고려하여 새 프로젝트에서 이러한 결함이 반복되지 않도록 하세요.
 그래서 저는 Anatomy가 이전 전제를 사용하여 이 단위에 대해 더 많은 정보에 입각한 결정을 내릴 수 있는 방법을 살펴보고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5166.021s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 감사합니다
 그래서 이 경우에는 시도해 보겠습니다.
 이것을 의회에 돌려보내세요.
 이 분야의 다른 프로젝트에서 배운 모범 사례와 교훈을 포함하여 이 프로젝트 계획에 세부적인 특정 요소가 있는지 알고 계시기 때문에 다시 질문하겠습니다.
 그러니 후보자가 어떤 세부 사항에 대해 이야기하고 싶다면 따라 가십시오.
 틀림없이.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5188.814s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 내 말은, 분명히 우리는 항상 이전 프로젝트에서 배우고 배우려고 노력하고 있다는 것입니다.
 한 가지 기억해야 할 점은 우리가 여기서는 다른 자산이 아닌 다른 개발자와 협력한다는 것입니다.
 따라서 우리가 이전 호텔에서 수행한 작업 중 일부는 작업 중인 클라이언트와 위치에 따라 여기서 수행하는 작업에 적용되지 않습니다.
 하지만 우리는 항상 우리가 잘못한 것과 옳은 것을 이해하고 다음 프로젝트에 적용하려고 노력합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5222.194s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 대통령님, 이것은 단지 정보일 뿐입니다.
 오늘 밤 말하고 듣는 Buttes 주민들의 의견을 실제로 확인할 수 있습니까? 조명, 소리 또는 기타 풍경 요소 등을 제어하는 ​​방법에 대한 구체적인 지침이 있는 경우 가능합니까?
 이것이 제안의 일부인지 또는 이것이 우리 분석의 일부인지 확인할 수 있도록 이를 시나 우리에게 보고해 주십시오.
 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5255.977s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 네, 하지만 저는 토목 기술자가 아니라 산업 기술자라는 뜻입니다.
 그래서 더 일찍 작업할 수 있는 엔지니어가 필요했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5265.004s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 뭐, 앤드류의 입장에서 보면 전체적인 일정은,
 대중은 질문을 하고 자신의 의견을 표현할 수 있습니다.
 그리고 이 회의에서 볼 수 있듯이, 제가 말하는 것은 적어도 이사회가 제가 질문이나 이사회가 생각하지 않거나 묻지 않는 어떤 것을 묻는 경우 결국 그 후보자와 협력하게 되고 그 후보자가 이에 응답하고 세부 사항을 제공할 것이며 그 후보자가 실제로 응답했다는 것을 확인하기 위해 노력한다는 것입니다.
 나는 이것이 Andrew의 주장과 일치한다고 생각합니다.
 시에 직접 표현하든 공청회에서 아이디어를 제시하든, 지역 전문가가 아니더라도 아이디어가 있으면 여전히 유용할 수 있습니다.
 이 아이디어를 녹음된 댓글로 공유할 수 있나요?
 이는 해당 개념의 정신을 반영하는 특정 분야의 전문가가 참여하는 토론이나 논평으로 이어질 수 있습니다.
 글쎄, 내가 당신을 올바르게 이해했다면 안드레, 당신은 사람들에게 그것을 분명히 하고 싶어할 것 같아요.
 아이디어를 환영하며 지역 주민들이 여기 또는 도시와 함께 자신의 아이디어를 표현할 수 있는 포럼이 있습니다.
 특히 이러한 아이디어를 같은 시간대에 배치하거나 토론이 문제에 초점을 맞추기 전에 배치하면 이사회에서 후보자에 대해 토론하고 영감을 줄 수 있습니다.
 그게 공평한 거야, 앤드류?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5367.772s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 이는 건물에 불이 켜지는 것을 원하지 않는 것처럼 간단할 수도 있고, 공공 안전에 좋기 때문에 더 많은 조명을 원할 수도 있습니다.
 모르겠습니다.
 비슷한 것들.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5381.754s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 알았어
 감사합니다
 이제 다른 회원들의 댓글을 보면 다른 대중 회원들도 나와 함께 말하고 싶어한다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.
 확인하기 위해 몇 초 정도 기다리겠습니다.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 상사는 아무것도 보지 못하고 프로세스의 공개 부분을 닫아 달라는 요청을 기다립니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5412.685s">[Unidentified]</a>: 매우 감동적입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5416.007s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 다른 목록을 확인해 보세요.
 에버렛?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5429.399s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 마이크로?
 응 알았어.
 따라서 이번 회의에 대한 여론은 비공개입니다.
 우리는 다가오는 청문회에서 다른 중요한 문제에 대한 대중의 의견을 구할 것입니다.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 이 문제에 대해 의회에 다시 확인하고 싶습니다.
 오늘 우리가 본 내용이나 오늘 이용 가능한 다른 주제에 대해 질문이나 의견이 있으신가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5463.805s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 물론 그렇습니다. 어떤 이유에서인지 이미 알려져 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5467.25s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 왜 안 돼?
 한 가지: 건축가들이 이 작업을 진행하는 동안 나는 이 모든 소란이 무엇인지 알고 싶습니다.
 이 프로젝트는 건물 주변의 1층을 대상으로 합니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 더 많은 것을 찾고 있습니다.
 그러나 한편으로는.
 1층 전체가 비어있습니다.
 이곳이 더 많은 공공 예술 벽화와 녹색 벽을 위한 장소가 될 수 있을지 궁금합니다.
 나는 거기에서 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 알고 싶습니다. 그래서 그것은 단지 빈 벽이 아닙니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5528.08s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 머리 움직임이 보입니다.
 향후 청문회에서 이 문제를 해결할 수 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5532.502s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 네, 저희는 이 점을 확실히 고려하여 다음 청문회에서 답변할 계획을 세울 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5538.944s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 사적인.
 제가 의장에게 추가하고 싶은 한 가지는 우리가 LaRue에 대응할 수 있다고 생각하며 확실히 이사회에 이러한 유형의 디자인 요소를 이 수준에서 살펴볼 수 있는 대안적인 아이디어와 기회를 가져올 수 있다는 것입니다.
 이는 최종 계획에 반영될 수 있는 세부 요구 사항과 함께 제시된 후 이사회에 전달될 수 있습니다.
 이렇게 하면 겸손함을 얻거나 그림이나 최종 계획에서 조언을 제공하는 측면에서 달성하려는 디자인 목표를 갖게 됩니다.
 공공 예술에 대한 아이디어가 아직도 있는지는 잘 모르겠습니다. 아시다시피 벽의 X%는 공공 예술에 전념해야 합니다.
 그러나 우리는 귀하가 고려할 수 있는 몇 가지 프레임워크 표준과 아이디어를 확실히 제공할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5606.611s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 예, 저는 이 프레젠테이션이 유용하다고 생각합니다. 적어도 최종 디자인으로 이어지는 실용적인 토론을 가능하게 하기 때문입니다.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 우리는 매우 감사합니다.
 이제 좋아요.
 이제 배송 섹션으로 넘어가겠습니다.
 그래서 간접적으로 확인된 내용인데, 한번 더 확인하고 싶었습니다.
 그래서 2주 동안 주거지역을 중심으로 계획을 세웠고, 조경계획뿐만 아니라 지역도 함께 살펴보는 것 같았습니다.
 오늘 논의된 모든 업데이트는 특정 형식으로 반영되지 않을 수 있으며, 2주 동안 오늘 논의된 주제에 대한 일반적인 업데이트로만 반영됩니다.
 우리는 이 목표를 달성하기 위해 올바른 길을 가고 있습니다.
 내가 맞나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5666.923s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 네, 대통령 각하, 이것이 우리가 2주 후에 돌아와 민사 협상을 재개할 때의 우리 계획입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5675.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 그렇다면 부머 씨, 이사회와 후보자들이 고려할 이 메모를 받을 것으로 예상할 때 또 무엇을 보고 싶습니까?
 아마 월요일이나 그런 식으로 하루나 이틀 후에요.
 사적인.
 좋아 보인다.
 감사합니다
 지금 후보자가 명확히 하고 싶다면 제가 그와 얘기하겠습니다.
 저는 현재 2주 동안 서류와 토론이 어떻게 진행되는지에 따라 다소 유연하게 4주에 걸쳐 청문회 일정을 잡는 경향이 있습니다.
 이것이 합리적으로 보입니까?
 아니면 4주 후에 무슨 일이 일어날지 정확히 알고 싶으십니까?
 의제가있을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5736.39s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 좀 더 유연해질 수 있을 것 같아요.
 내 생각에 그 2주 동안은 관객에게 달려 있다고 생각합니다. 주목해야 할 것이 있다면 오늘 밤 건축적인 것뿐만 아니라 그것에도 주목하고 싶을 것입니다.
 그래서 가능하다면 여러 주제에 대해 해명이 필요한 내용이 있다면 폭넓은 주제를 다룰 수 있는 공청회가 될 수 있다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5766.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 그냥 시청자분들이 알아주셨으면 해서 달력의 다음 항목이요. 죄송해요. 방금 달력을 확인했어요.
 청문회는 4월 11일로 예정돼 있다.
 민사 문제를 논의해 봅시다.
 이 주제에 대한 일부 정원 가꾸기 프로젝트 및 업데이트와 동일합니다.
 다음 재판은 4월 23일 열릴 예정이다.
 우리는 여기서 유연한 의제를 유지하고 있지만 더 자세히 논의된 주제를 보고 싶습니다.
 오늘 의회와 대중의 의견과 Boomer의 메모를 바탕으로 업데이트가 개발되었습니다.
 이것은 우리가 나중에 기대할 수 있는 것입니다.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 이번 컨퍼런스의 네 가지 주제를 모두 다루었다고 생각합니다.
 후보자들에게 다른 일이 일어나는지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 오늘 밤에 얘기하고 싶나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5855.69s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 대통령님, 우리가 아닙니다.
 시간을 내어 피드백을 보내주셔서 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5861.274s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 네, 감사합니다.
 세부 사항과 시간에도 감사드립니다.
 여기서 진행 상황을 확인하는 것이 좋습니다.
 그러므로 우리는 2주 안에 회의를 열 것으로 예상합니다.
 그런 다음
 대통령은 현재 오후 6시 30분까지 사건을 계속해 달라는 요청을 기다리고 있다. 4월 11일.
 나는 이사했다.
 잠시 시간 있으세요?
 월요일.

 고마워요, 친구.
 따라서 이것이 의제에서 유일하게 중요한 문제입니다.
 많은 행동에는 요소가 있습니다.

 나는 거기 있을 것이다, 나는 갈 것이다.
 그래서 돌아오는 시기에 따라 월요일, 수요일, 목요일에 떠날 예정입니다.
 그러니 무슨 일이 생기면 거기에 모든 것을 넣어 두도록 할게요.
 그러니까 Cliff나 Beta나 다른 누구든지 그들은 그것을 당신에게 보낼 것이고, 내가 없는 동안 그들은 그것을 사이트에 업데이트할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5967.744s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 아니요.
 더 작은 비행기는 Janion입니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5998.488s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 저는 기회가 있을 때마다 우리가 귀하의 계획 컨설턴트와 협력하여 최신 정보를 얻고 있음을 상기시켜 드리겠습니다.
 누구든지 그 사람이나 그의 팀을 개인적으로 만나고 싶다면 우리가 주선해 드릴 수 있습니다.
 보고 싶은 내용이 있으면 꼭 읽어보고 싶습니다.
 또는 회의에 문제를 제기하고 싶다면 총회에서 그렇게 할 수 있습니다.
 이 지역에서 어떤 변화를 보고 싶은지 생각해 보세요.
 저는 이것이 지속적인 과정이라는 점을 상기시키고 싶습니다. Danielle과 저는 거의 매주 시의회 의원들과 만나고, 시의회는 위원회 회의를 위해 모입니다.
 대략 2주에 한 번씩 총회도 열립니다.
 그래서 사람들이 목록에 더 많은 콘텐츠를 추가하기를 바랍니다.
 행정적인 문제부터 시작해 보겠습니다.
 따라서 파티션 관리에 어려움이 있다면 지금이 저희에게 알려주세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6063.775s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 네, 고마워요, 헌터 국장님.
 명확성을 위해, 이 기회를 활용하려는 자문가는 지금 귀하에게 직접 연락하여 약속을 잡아야 합니다.
 놀라운.
 네, 제 생각엔 우리가 위원회를 대신하여 정기 청문회에서 우리가 위원회의 집단적 조치를 취하기를 원하는지 논의할 수 있을 것 같습니다.
 아니요, 현재로서는 그것이 제 개인적인 편견이라고 생각합니다.
 아마도 이사회 구성원이 귀하가 특정 문제에 대해 의견을 가지고 있다는 것을 이미 알고 있다면 귀하 및 귀하의 이사회 구성원과 직접 협력해야 할 것입니다.
 그렇습니다. 이 문제에 대해 더 많은 공개 그룹 토론을 원하는 시의원은 계류 중인 소송을 진행할 수 있습니다.
 음, 좋아 보이는군요.
 업데이트해 주셔서 감사합니다.
 놀라운.
 데니스, 시간을 낭비하기 시작했어요.

 이제 우리는 1월 30일과 3월 14일에 대해 이야기하고 있습니다.
 그렇습니다. 일부 이사회 구성원은 회의록이 정확하다고 생각하는 것 같습니다.

 사랑하는 친구 여러분, 저는 목요일에 모임에 참석하지 않을 것임을 여러분에게 상기시키고 싶습니다.
 Jimmy는 쇼를 주최하겠다고 제안했습니다.
 지미, 몇 가지 세부 사항을 당신과 공유하고 싶습니다.
 하지만 네, 그 외에는 목요일이 잘 됐으면 좋겠어요.
 그리고 4월 11일에 다시 만나요.
 글쎄요, 어서 가세요, 앤드류.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6371.794s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 네, 알리시아나 데니스에게 질문 하나 할게요.
 그는 도시의 40B 의원입니다. 나는 그를 만난 적이 없습니다. 우리 아직 그 사람 못 만난 것 같은데?
 내 질문은 이것이 오늘 우리가 이야기하고 있는 디자인에 관한 것이기 때문에 그것이 무엇인가 하는 것 같아요.
 점점 늘어나는 400억 개의 프로젝트를 우리가 계속 보고 있는 것과 같은 큰 프로젝트가 되지 않도록 더 잘 설계하기 위해 우리가 할 수 있는 일이 있을까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6413.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Andre, Haverty의 변호사는 재판에 참석할 수 없을 것 같지만 오늘 참석할 그의 동료 Chris는 참석할 것입니다.
 그는 같은 사무실에 속해 있어요.
 따라서 아직 그러한 요소는 없지만 함께 모일 것입니다.
 따라서 몇 가지 옵션을 제공합니다.
 이사회는 이 문제를 자세히 논의하기 위해 40B 고문과의 회의 일정을 잡거나 이사회 구성원에게 직접 연락할 수 있습니다.
 이러한 질문이 있는 경우 당사의 40B 고문에게 문의하여 자세한 내용을 문의하십시오.
 우리가 할 수 없는 유일한 일은 이 문제를 많은 사람들과 개인적으로 논의하는 것입니다.
 예, 이 사건과 관련하여 Haverty의 변호사에게 직접 문의하시기 바랍니다. 그러면 회의에서 이 문제를 공개적으로 논의할 수 있습니다.
 다음 세션에서.
 우리는 공개적으로 이 질문을 할 수도 있습니다.
 이것은 또 다른 옵션입니다.
 나는 이것이 집행 세션에 적합하지 않다고 생각합니다.
 그러면 우리는 다음 심리에서 Haverty의 변호사나 동료의 출석을 확인할 수 있을 것입니다.
 나는 그들이 거기에 있다고 생각하고 우리는 그들에게 공개적으로 물어봐야합니다.
 이것은 또 다른 선택이 될 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6508.835s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 글쎄요, 두 분 모두 기뻐요.
 어쩌면 나는 청중 앞에서 행복할 수도 있다.
 내 말은 여기를 의미합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6516.687s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 네, 아마도 당신의 호기심과 우리가 2주 후에 청문회에 참석하지 않을 것이라는 사실 때문에 제가 이 질문을 드려야 할 것 같습니다.
 또한 스스로 답을 얻을 것입니다.
 그러면 그걸 토대로 다시 공개적으로 물어보시거나, 공개적으로 논의하고 싶은지 말씀해 주시면 됩니다.
 제가 이해한 내용을 간략하게 요약하고 싶습니다.
 이사회가 할 수 있는 것과 할 수 없는 것에는 세부적인 균형과 한계가 있다고 생각합니다.
 그렇기 때문에 모호한 것이 더 좋습니다.
 우리는 정말로 무엇을 할 수 있나요? 이 내용은 40B Advisor에서 공개하면 더 좋을 것 같습니다.
 나는 일반적으로 내부 문제와 프로젝트를 특히 비경제적으로 만들 수 있는 요소 사이에 균형이 있다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6576.456s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 알았어
 알고 싶은데 어떻게 알 수 있나요?
 아시다시피 아파트 수, 토지 면적 등 모든 협상이 완료되었습니다.
 사람들이 더 잘 이해하면 좋을 것 같아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6594.821s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 물론이죠. 이것이 더 일반적인 문제이기 때문에 시작해 볼 수도 있습니다.
 이것을 공개 주제로 만들겠습니다.
 다음 회의에서 우리는 40B 고문에게 연락하여 대중을 위한 요약을 제공하도록 요청할 수 있습니다.
 40B 프로세스의 일부로 검사 일정을 입력합니다.
 이것이 당신에게 효과가 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6619.358s">[Unidentified]</a>: 틀림없이.
 알았어, 좋아.
 또 기억해야 할 점은 이 프로젝트가 완료되면 우리를 고소하고 10%의 세금을 납부하라고 강요할 것 같다는 것입니다.
 따라서 이론적으로 우리는 40B를 다시는 볼 수 없을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6639.593s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 나는 40B에 관심이 없으며 주택에 대한 도움을 원합니다.
 나는 단지 이렇기를 원합니다. 나는 그들이 50%에 도달하길 원한다.
 디자인이 잘 되었으면 좋겠고 아마도 이 거대한 블록 대신 높이가 다른 작은 건물이 있을 수도 있을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6660.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 헌터 변호사가 무슨 뜻인지 이해합니다. 헌터 감독에게 사과드립니다. 그는 뭔가를 하고 있습니다.
 그래서 헌터 국장님, 저는 우리가 올바른 길을 가고 있다고 말하고 싶습니다.
 우리는 이 프로젝트에 대해 구체적으로 이야기하고 있지는 않지만 앞으로 나아가고 있습니다.
 정말로
 여기서는 자세히 설명하지 않는 것이 좋습니다.
 그런데 헌터 감독은 뭐라고 말할까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6688.304s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 알았어
 따라서 또 다른 40B 프로그램을 갖는 측면에서 우리는 이제 2년의 안전 항구를 갖게 되었습니다.
 우리는 분쟁을 고려하지 않습니다.
 내 말은, 우리는 프로젝트를 메드포드와 주변 지역으로 가져오는 것과 그 진행 방식에 대해 다른 개발자들과 논의 중이라는 것입니다.
 그래서 우리는 40B를 봅니다. 이는 우호적이지만 앞서서 우리를 막을 능력이 없기 때문에 상황은 완전히 다를 것입니다.
 그들은 다른 영역을 생성하는 대신 40B 작업을 종료하고 종료할 수 있는 옵션을 갖게 됩니다.
 예, 왜냐하면 우리는 20%, 25%, 20% 저렴한 주택에 관심이 있기 때문에 40B 프로세스를 거치도록 동의했기 때문입니다. 이는 우리가 할 수 있는 일이고 일부 개발자와 논의할 수 있는 일이라고 말하고 싶습니다.
 그들에게 흥미로운 질문은 저렴한 주택이 그들이 고려하고 있는 특정 프로젝트를 감당할 수 없을 정도로 비용을 증가시킬 수 있는지 여부이며, 차액을 요구하는 대신 동의할 수 있지만 법적 증거를 갖게 될 것입니다.
 그들은 경쟁적일 수 있습니다. 실제로 그들은 400억 명이 넘는 사람들에게 매력적이고 친근합니다.
 그래서 저는 여러분에게 몇 가지 배경 정보를 제공하고 싶었습니다.
 상황은 완전히 달라질 것입니다.
 제 생각에는 40B III항에서 그들이 돌아올 수 있는지 여부가 확실하지 않으며 공소시효가 CPC 결정까지 사건을 보류하기 때문이라고 생각합니다.
 그들은 6년 동안 우리에게 연락을 하지 않았고, 사건이 해결된 지 약 5~6개월이 지났습니다.
 따라서 이것은 실제로 우리가 대답해야 할 법적 질문입니다.
 그래서 저는 여러분에게 이러한 것들에 대해 생각할 수 있는 맥락을 제공하고 싶습니다.
 Andrew가 제기한 문제는 오랫동안 지속되어 온 문제입니다.
 이런 일은 앞으로 6개월, 혹은 몇 년 안에는 일어나지 않을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6835.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 예, 맞습니다.
 내가 이해하는 바에 따르면, 보안 창구는 항소 법원의 프로젝트 거부 사유를 확대할 뿐입니다.
 그래서 동적으로 변경됩니다.
 그러나 4dB 안전 포트 원리가 적용될 수 있습니다.
 보안 콘센트의 경우 이사회가 여러 가지 이유로 귀하를 거부할 수 있으므로 가장 친근한 경향이 있습니다.
 응 뭐든지
 그런 다음 대통령은 회의가 끝날 때까지 기다립니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6880.275s">[Unidentified]</a>: 회의를 종료해주세요.
 월요일.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6882.656s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 둘째, 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 전화를 해보자.
 짐?
 이것은 정확합니다.
 앤드류?
 이것은 정확합니다.
 조립식 쇠지레?
 이것은 정확합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6893.147s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 행운을 빌어요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6894.089s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 마이크, 그렇죠.
 좋아요, 이제 준비가 되었습니다.</p>
