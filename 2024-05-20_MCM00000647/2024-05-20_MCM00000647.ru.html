 Спасибо, Денис.
 У людей, незнакомых с процессом 40В, много слухов.
 Комитет собирается по этому вопросу с конца прошлого года.
 У нас особая сессия.
 Тема сегодняшней конференции – дизайн.
 Итак, я знаю, что правление недавно получило обновление пакета дизайна.
 Поэтому я думаю, что сегодняшняя цель – обсудить этот вопрос.
 Я вижу, что вас представляют многие кандидаты.
 Я отдам его Пэту Нуну.
 Добро пожаловать</p>

 Итак, как я уже сказал, мы рады быть здесь сегодня вечером.
 Еще раз спасибо, что нашли время добавить нас в свой календарь.
 Сегодня вечером мы сосредоточимся на достижениях дизайна и различных архитектурных элементах.
 Как было обновлено на нашем последнем слушании, мы продолжаем добиваться прогресса в ходе испытания, сосредоточившись на окончательном дизайне в феврале.
 Команда дизайнеров встретилась и связалась с членами Cliff и командой планирования.
 Обзорные сессии и отзывы собираются и включаются в нашу сегодняшнюю презентацию.
 Поэтому мы ожидаем представить различные элементы дизайна плана этажа, высоту и обновление теневого исследования, а также предоставить окончательный обзор и обновление всего плана участка и соответствующих общественных благ.
 Итак, Эрик, я предоставляю тебе слово.
 Впредь.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=277.86s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  That's good.
 Thank you, Pat.
 Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.
 So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.
 So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.
 I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.
 So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.
 This is our current landscape plan.
 This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.
 So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.
 More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.
 uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.
 And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.
 We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.
 Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.
 So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.
 You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.
 So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.
 So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.
 So here you'll see our ground floor plan.
 This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.
 Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.
 We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.
 This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.
 In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.
 This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.
 So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.
 This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.
 We have our bike storage.
 We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.
 In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.
 The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.
 Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.
 This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.
 We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.
 Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.
 We'll probably have some fitness located up here.
 So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.
 The units are all encapsulated here.
 The yellow would be your studio units.
 The purple would be your one bed units.
 The green would be your two bed units.
 And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.
 So moving up a floor plan.
 So this would be our typical floor three through five.
 And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.
 That's our most typical plan for three floors.
 One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.
 you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.
 So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.
 And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.
 And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.
 So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.
 The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.
 We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.
 So jumping into the concept design image.
 So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.
 This is conceptual design.
 So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.
 So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.
 This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.
 In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.
 So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.
 So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.
 And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.
 And part of the reason for that is one,
 from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.
 You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.
 So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.
 But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.
 So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.
 So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.
 And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.
 So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.
 There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.
 Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.
 One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.
 You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.
 This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor
 gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.
 Here you can see we have the five-story piece.
 You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.
 Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.
 This north elevation is the elevation that's
 most facing Myrtle Street.
 So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.
 You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.
 Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.
 And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.
 You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.
 and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.
 We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.
 There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.
 And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.
 you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Fellsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.
 So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.
 And then just briefly the townhome elevations.
 So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.
 Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.
 And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.
 So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.
 You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.
 So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.
 Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.
 And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.
 We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.
 And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.
 And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.
 So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.
 And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.
 And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.
 So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
 All right, so shadow study.
 So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.
 So we're going to show three items here.
 We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.
 The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.
 And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.
 And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.
 And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.
 So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.
 And this is the 9 a.m.
 condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.
 So this is the existing condition at those times of year.
 And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.
 And so we also looked at it
 as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.
 So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.
 And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.
 and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.
 So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.
 And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.
 That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.
 on those adjacent properties.
 So it's not that until 10 a.m.
 you are in a cloud of darkness.
 There's a lot of space between the buildings.
 There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.
 There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.
 And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.
 So here you'll see the 9 a.m.
 condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.
 This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.
 So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.
 and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.
 And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.
 And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.
 For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.
 And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.
 The sun's a lot higher in the air.
 So you'll see a lot less shadow.
 And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.
 So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.
 summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.
 So it's about only a 15 minute difference.
 In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.
 From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.
 So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.
 So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.
 Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.
 Three, the potential rail trail connection here.
 Four, we have our internal courtyards.
 One's
 potentially a little bit more active with the pool.
 Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.
 Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.
 Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with
 you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.
 I think we've been improving that each step along the way.
 I think
 where we are now is much better than where we started.
 And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.
 And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.
 But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.
 And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.
 So that is all.
 I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.

 នេះគឺជាអាគារធំមួយ។
 ឥឡូវនេះកម្ពស់ទាំងអស់គឺដូចគ្នា។
 ខ្ញុំបានរកឃើញថា ចលនានៅផ្នែកខាងជើងមានប្រសិទ្ធភាពណាស់ក្នុងការរំលេចច្រកចូលចំហៀង ដែលពិតជាដំណើរការសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ចំណាំថាផ្នែកដែលនៅសេសសល់នៃផ្នែកខាងកើតនៃផ្នែកខាងមុខខាងជើងនេះក៏ជាកន្លែងសាធារណៈផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មាន​តម្លៃ​ក្នុង​ការ​ពិចារណា​ថា​តើ​ភាព​ខុស​គ្នា​ខ្លាំង​ជាង​នេះ​នៅ​ក្នុង​លំហ​នេះ​នឹង​មាន​ប្រយោជន៍។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាចំណុចមួយទៀតគឺទិដ្ឋភាពនិរន្តរភាពនៃស្ថាបត្យកម្ម។
 យើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីការព្យាបាលតាមបង្អួចស្រដៀងគ្នានៅទូទាំងអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា បាទ
 វាពិតជាផ្តល់រង្វាន់ក្នុងការបន្តឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីអាកប្បកិរិយាប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៅលើ facade របស់អគារ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​តាម​ពិត​មាន​វិធី​ខុស​គ្នា​ច្រើន​ក្នុង​ការ​ដោះស្រាយ​វា​អាស្រ័យ​លើ​ថាតើ​អ្នក​កំពុង​សម្លឹង​មើល​កម្ពស់​បែរ​មុខ​ទៅ​ទិស​ខាង​ជើង ឬ​កម្ពស់​បែរ​ទៅ​ទិស​ខាង​លិច។
 ប្រហែលជាវាទាក់ទងនឹងចម្ងាយពីបង្អួច។
 តោង​ជាប់​នឹង​ជញ្ជាំង ឬ​ដាក់​តាម​ផ្លូវ​ខ្យល់ វា​ជួយ​គ្រប់គ្រង​ពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យ។
 ប៉ុន្តែក្នុងករណីណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំលើកទឹកចិត្តឱ្យស្វែងរកវិធីធ្វើឱ្យអគារ facade ប្រសើរឡើងដោយមានការទទួលស្គាល់ ហើយដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ ពួកគេអាចអានអាកប្បកិរិយាប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៃ facade អគារតាមរបៀបណាមួយ។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំបានពិនិត្យមើលទំព័រទាំង 27 នៃការស្រាវជ្រាវស្រមោល។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ប្រាប់​គណៈកម្មាធិការ​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​រឿង​ទាំង​នោះ​ត្រឹមត្រូវ​ហើយ​ការ​រៀបចំ​គឺ​ត្រឹមត្រូវ​តាម​ចំណេះ​ដឹង​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះការវិភាគគុណភាពមុន និងក្រោយ ហើយបង្រួមវាទៅជាប្រធានបទស្រដៀងគ្នា។
 ទស្សនវិស័យ រយៈពេលនៃពេលវេលាដែលមានភាពខុសគ្នាដែលអាចវាស់វែងបានក្នុងការដាក់ស្រមោលក្នុងរយៈពេលមួយម៉ោងជាក់ស្តែង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជួយ​ដាក់​អ្វី​ៗ​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ទស្សនៈ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាឥឡូវនេះខ្ញុំ
 ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តនឹងលទ្ធផលនៃផែនការគេហទំព័រ។
 ភាព​ជាក់លាក់​នៅ​មិន​ទាន់​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​បាន​ពេញលេញ​នៅ​ឡើយ​ទេ​។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារូបថតនេះបង្ហាញពីរបៀបដែលការងារទាំងអស់ដែលបានធ្វើនៅផ្នែកខាងលិចនៃអគារបានប្រែក្លាយផ្លូវ Amaranth យ៉ាងពិតប្រាកដ។
 មានរូបភាពជាច្រើននៃអគារដែលយើងមិនទាន់បានឃើញ។
 តាមទស្សនៈរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំគិតថាការផ្តោតអារម្មណ៍ដែលអ្នកកំពុងឃើញនៅពេលនេះ គឺពិតជាទៅលើសម្ភារៈនៃស្ថាបត្យកម្ម និងរបៀបសម្រេចបាននូវមាត្រដ្ឋាន។
 ចាប់ផ្តើមយកចិត្តទុកដាក់លើអាគារខ្លួនឯង។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ទាន់​បាន​សរសេរ​អ្វី​នៅ​ឡើយ​ទេ ក្រៅ​ពី​កំណត់​ហេតុ​ខ្លី​មួយ​ដែល​សុំ​ភស្តុតាង​បន្ថែម។
 មូលហេតុ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ទាន់​សរសេរ​អ្វី​ក៏​ដោយ ព្រោះ​វា​បាន​ផ្លាស់​ប្តូរ។
 គម្រោង​នេះ​ពិតជា​បាន​ផ្លាស់ប្តូរ​ច្រើន​ណាស់ ហើយ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​មាន​ចំណុច​ណាមួយ​ក្នុង​ការ​ផ្តល់​យោបល់​របស់ខ្ញុំ​រហូត​ដល់​
 គាត់បានយល់ស្របថាអ្វីៗមានស្ថេរភាព ហើយថាពួកគេបានយកវិធីសាស្រ្តជាច្រើនទៅបទបង្ហាញចុងក្រោយ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកនឹងឃើញមតិយោបល់របស់ខ្ញុំបន្ថែមទៀតអំពីស្ថាបត្យកម្មនៃអគារ និងទីតាំងរបស់វា និងទីតាំងជាក់ស្តែងនៅលើគេហទំព័រ ក៏ដូចជាគំនិតដំបូងនៅលើសួនច្បារ ការអភិរក្ស និងការផ្សព្វផ្សាយរបស់វា។
 កន្លែងប្រើប្រាស់ចម្រុះ ឬទីធ្លាចំហរ ដែលបើកចំហសម្រាប់ទាំងសាធារណជន និងប្រជាពលរដ្ឋ ហាក់ដូចជាកន្លែងដ៏ល្អមួយ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1773.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Мне действительно нужно ответить на любые вопросы.
 Все хорошо.
 Спасибо за обновление.
 Итак, МакКорд, это просто... Да, это звучит хорошо.
 Итак, прежде чем задать вопрос на консультации, я хотел бы уточнить одну вещь: правильно ли я это понимаю?
 Если результаты сегодняшней встречи не привели к значительным изменениям в плане объекта, то теперь некоторые из экспонатов, которые вы запросили, и, возможно, те, которые вы вскоре запросите, станут следующим шагом.
 Вы спрашиваете их, а затем смотрите на них.
 Затем мы получим ваши подробные отзывы о других элементах архитектуры на последующих встречах.
 Так?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1819.794s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Для меня это имеет смысл.
 У меня есть идея, на прошлой неделе я высказал несколько комментариев по поводу репрезентации в архитектуре.
 Но это действительно зависит от вас во всем.
 Вот почему я предпочитаю этот ритмический подход.
 Пусть это будет сделано, но да, мой следующий шаг, скажем, широкой публики, общественного мнения, если это применимо к вашим людям, поможет проинформировать следующий уровень моего анализа, который, как я уже сказал, на самом деле касается материальных и других вещей, и я сделал некоторые наблюдения по поводу текущей ситуации.
 Что касается меня, я говорю это подробно, но я думаю, что важнее иметь свои собственные слова, и именно с этого я начинаю снова, просто находя способы, которые, по моему мнению, могут помочь.
 Я думаю, что в здании такого масштаба следует обсудить, как сделать масштаб значимым, учитывая расположение здания.
 Если качество правильное и размещение на сайте правильное, я думаю, вы действительно поймете переменные.
 Не знаю, правильно ли я отвечаю?
 Если я этого не сделал, прошу прощения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1918.027s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Для меня это было ясно, поэтому мы согласились.
 Спасибо
 Все хорошо.
 Тогда я задам вопрос группе.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1928.413s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Да, Майк, это Эндрю.
 Спроси Клиффа.
 Я смотрю на это здание.
 Это большой и длинный кусок амаранта.
 Это просто пятиэтажная сплошная стена, ничего особенного.
 Прошло много времени, и я действительно думаю, что они могут сделать больше, чтобы немного сломать это, чтобы оно не было похоже на большую стену.
 Интересно, что вы думаете по этому поводу?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1975.908s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Я полностью согласен и согласен.
 Я думаю, что одной из причин, по которой мне пришла в голову идея различия на основе ориентации, был один из способов помочь сломать огромный блок безразличия.
 Есть и другие.
 Стратегии, предполагающие введение большего количества вертикальных элементов, могут включать меньшее количество входов и выходов на фасаде, а также некоторые материальные изменения.
 Но я согласен.
 Я думаю, было бы полезно выбрать ритм, чтобы разбить здание на части и помочь ему развиваться по пути.
 Так что для меня это то, с чего вы начинаете.
 Если фундамент соответствует вашему расстоянию от дорожки и всему вашему росту, начните вырезать блоки, чтобы найти правильный баланс.
 Это всё равно будет огромное здание и другого пути нет.
 Но есть способы заставить эту шкалу работать на вас.
 Я думаю, вы знаете, пляжи, разница, как я уже сказал, может быть в какой-то группе.
 Я не говорю, что команда горизонтальная, но я согласен.
 Также помните, что это здание произошло, поэтому я считаю важным выделить и изменить этот вход.
 Одно отверстие обеспечивает доступ к нижней витрине в северном углу и ведет на запад.
 Это очень помогает, но недостаточно, чтобы разбить весь размер остального.
 Это хороший ход.
 Я думаю, было бы хорошо поставить его сбоку от этого здания.
 Я согласен.
 Думаю, на прошлой неделе была дискуссия о том, как сбалансировать индустриальный вид.
 Я имею в виду, что здание до сих пор находится рядом со складом на восточной стороне, и это история этого места, оно используется в промышленности.
 Но в то же время ц.
 Если вы посмотрите на настоящее здание, то увидите, что оно на самом деле является пристройкой.
 Кажется, что оно разделено на более мелкие части.
 Но в любом случае я советую вам об этом подумать сейчас. Взгляните на некоторые способы анализа размера замка.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2163.382s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Да, я имею в виду Эрика, я не думаю, что ты показывал фотографии других своих проектов.
 Я не знаю, хотите ли вы вернуться к этому слайду, но.
 В это время.
 Знаешь, там.
 Как и в случае с Модрой Медфорд, это еще не все.
 Это почти как другое здание, да?
 Поэтому я подумал об этом.
 Эта стратегия здесь очень полезна.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2195.203s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Конечно.
 Я не хочу сказать, что мне нужно возражать против этого, но я хочу сказать одно: с помощью пассивного дома трудно добиться большего изменения в здании.
 Чем больше входов и выходов вы разместите в главном здании, чем более квадратные внешние стены вы добавите к зданию, тем сложнее зданию соответствовать требованиям пассивного дома.
 Итак, что-то только что произошло со мной, и мы говорим об этом, вы знаете, мы говорили об этом на прошлой неделе с комитетом по планированию, Алисией, Даниэль и остальной частью команды, и это было
 Медфорд выбрал специализированный код.
 Это то, что нас очень беспокоит.
 Это будущее регулирования энергетики в Массачусетсе.
 Поэтому следует иметь в виду, что все больше и больше проектов будут все меньше и меньше подключаться в целях соблюдения энергетического законодательства.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2251.474s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Можете ли вы объяснить мне, что такое масштабируемый код?
 Разве это не похоже на модель пассивного дома?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2261.774s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Это неправда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2262.635s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Итак, вы думаете, что находитесь за пределами этого, верно?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2265.457s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Что ж, Медфорд выбрал специальный энергетический кодекс, который является обязательным условием для пассивного дома.
 В Медфорде у вас нет другого выбора, кроме как построить пассивный дом по энергетическому кодексу.
 Это новое требование, которому должны соответствовать все будущие проекты.
 ок
 Это новое для многих людей.
 Он существует уже некоторое время и в основном в Европе, но появляется и здесь, и все больше и больше людей к нему привыкают, но это требует времени.
 Вы знаете, лучшая изоляция, вы знаете, непрерывная изоляция снаружи здания, высокая эффективность, окна с высокой эффективностью, лучшие механические и электрические системы.
 Обычно с пассивным домом вы увидите 90% или даже 90% экономии затрат на электроэнергию.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2320.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Я хочу добавить одну вещь: как отметил Эрик, они это делают.
 Три проекта активного и пассивного жилья для вашего офиса.
 Но я приведу пример, потому что мы тоже строим много пассивных домов.
 И вы знаете, если вы посмотрите, как они выглядят, это система, основанная на производительности.
 Таким образом, окна и электроэнергию можно точно смоделировать.
 Поэтому, если у вас очень большие окна, на самом деле труднее добиться идеального термического процесса, и если вы достигнете точки, когда можно будет сформировать несколько стыков, многие стыки будут превращены в сплошные стены.
 И эти стены легко утеплить и сделать это хорошо.
 Например, я думаю, что один из способов решить эту проблему — не использовать большое окно, подобное тому, которое вы показываете.
 Поэтому, если вы немного уменьшите размер окна при просмотре образца, вы сможете получить больший эффект от окружающей области.
 Итак, я согласен с вами, в пассивном доме есть несколько очень сложных аспектов.
 Непрерывное моделирование всей строительной документации.
 Но я так не думаю, я думаю, что мы построили около 18 или 19 пассивных домов.
 Я думаю, что вы можете иметь больше свободы голоса и при этом соответствовать условиям пассивного дома.
 Мы делаем это и делаем это со многими зданиями.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2439.664s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Я имею в виду, что еще я хотел бы добавить: мне всегда нравилось много квартир с как можно большим количеством личного пространства и балкона.
 Это то, что я подумаю.
 Я снова увидел фотографию Модры Медфорд.
 Знаете, мне кажется, балкон выглядит светлее, чем есть на самом деле.
 Может быть, подумайте, как вы можете использовать их для этого.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2480.297s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Если бы я мог добавить одну вещь.
 Я благодарен Андрею за этот вопрос.
 Я думаю, что соединение зданий — это еще один способ соединить их с существующей средой.
 Не буквально, но это отличный способ помочь различать высоту разных зданий.
 Чем ты занимаешься на севере?
 Да, у нас есть открытый балкон в западной части, который также находится сзади.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2517.24s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Паттон Паттон, твой особняк.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2520.463s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Извините, я просто хочу войти.
 Спасибо
 Просто хочу уточнить несколько моментов, чтобы форумчане не запутались при обсуждении Пассивного Дома.
 Просто чтобы прояснить некоторые вещи, которые Эрик упомянул о дорожной карте в соответствии со специальным энергетическим кодексом.
 Мы не коллективны.
 Эксперты по энергетическому кодированию полагают, что для коммерческих зданий существуют и другие варианты.
 Эрик особо упомянул пассивный дом для жилых целей.
 Поэтому я просто не хочу, чтобы совет доносил наши идеи до другой аудитории и вызывал путаницу в будущем.
 Я просто хочу прояснить это для всех.
 Это мы.
 Честно говоря, мы были в восторге от этого, повторив то, что сказал Эрик.
 Это третий квартальный проект компании Davis, ведущей компании по проектированию и строительству пассивных домов в Массачусетсе.
 Мы с нетерпением ждем этой возможности и продолжим самообразование и используем этот процесс проектирования как возможность.
 Но хочу лишь подчеркнуть, что это для домашнего использования.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2593.618s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Это хороший момент.
 Наблюдать
 Спасибо
 Господин Тан, пожалуйста, говорите.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2600.157s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Спасибо, господин Президент.
 Основываясь на том, что сказал Пэт, я думаю, что если члены LaRue действительно заинтересованы и сосредоточены на повышении уровня амаранта, я думаю, что мы действительно можем сосредоточиться на этом, как я думаю, другие.
 Очевидно, что прогресс, который мы наблюдаем, требует для этого много времени.
 Но если ЛаРю беспокоит аспект амаранта, то я не вижу причин, по которым мы не можем тратить так много времени на попытки Эрика и Клиффа улучшиться.
 Это доказательство концепции.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2653.145s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Эндрю, ты сказал, что больше всего тебя беспокоит амарантовая сторона, или применительно к фасаду здания, северной стороне?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2665.248s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Я хочу видеть больше работы над этим, знаете ли, на всех уровнях, как сказал Клифф.
 Я думаю, что секция Амаранта мне особенно интересна, потому что через дорогу расположены жилые районы, и просто…
 Знаете, в чем-то это похоже на фасадную стену, в которой нет ничего необычного.
 Знаете, очевидно, то же самое есть и на восточной стороне, и через здание склада проходит еще одна стена.
 Так что я думаю
 Возможно, вам потребуется лечение, которое подойдет именно вам.
 Это будет то, что вы увидите по пути.
 Поэтому я думаю, что все обновление может стоить небольшой дополнительной работы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2719.771s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Есть ли у Правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2728.738s">[Mary Lee]</a>: Есть ли в здании солнечные батареи?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2739.42s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Я не знаю, Пэт, если хочешь.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2741.942s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Это верно.
 Это верно.
 Это верно.
 Извините
 Я могу вмешаться в этот момент.
 Мы не учимся специально.
 Я думаю, это то, что мы обсуждали.
 Что ж, включить это в проект возможно, но мы этого еще не показывали.
 Это не то, что мы можем проанализировать подробно.
 Вы знаете, с точки зрения возможностей, если это перспектива с крыши или где-то еще на месте, или какая-либо архитектурная перспектива.
 Вы знаете, другие факторы, влияющие на проект, будь то затраты на проектирование или что-то еще, реальны.
 Это открытый ответ и это тема нашего обсуждения.
 У нас до сих пор нет четкого ответа, планируем ли мы использовать солнечную энергию для этого проекта.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2797.862s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Продолжая то, что сказала Мэри, я думаю, что в какой-то момент люди также упоминали такие вещи, как крыши или зеленые крыши.
 Будет интересно посмотреть, как будет выглядеть обработка крыши, тем более, что этажей около 5 и 6.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2821.773s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, я думаю, мы можем продолжать улучшать дизайн и включать в него элементы, отражающие эффект крыши.
 Я думаю, что, возможно, чтобы прояснить некоторую путаницу, я думаю, что то, что мы пока называем зеленой крышей, будет находиться во дворе второго этажа, видимом с парковки на некоторых планах наших этажей.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2856.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Спасибо
 Есть ли у Правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2868.589s">[Mary Lee]</a>: На мой взгляд, это всего лишь черновой проект?
 Или я говорю, на каком этапе мы находимся с этой программой, эта программа завершена на 90% или на 70%?
 Потому что я склонен согласиться с Андре, потому что первое впечатление, которое оно производит, когда я вижу эту фотографию, заключается в том, что она создает у меня впечатление склада, а не квартиры.
 Это первое впечатление.
 Но я думаю, очевидно, что если это не полный план, то, возможно, еще найдется место.
 Внесите изменения.</p>

 យើងអាចយកឈ្នះពួកគេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងសង្ឃឹមថានឹងធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នកដើម្បីផ្តល់នូវការព្យាករណ៍លម្អិតបន្ថែមទៀត និងធាតុលក្ខខណ្ឌគម្រោងនាពេលអនាគត។
 ដូច្នេះនៅកម្រិតអាជ្ញាប័ណ្ណពេញលេញនេះ អ្នកនឹងមិនអាចទទួលបាន 100% នៃគំនូររចនានោះទេ។
 ជាដើម ប៉ុន្តែគំនិតដែលបានបង្ហាញក្នុងកម្រិតធំជាងនេះ គឺផ្តោតលើផ្នែករសើបទាំងនេះ ដូចជា amaranth ជាដើម។
 នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​អាច​ផ្តោត​លើ ប៉ុន្តែ​វា​នៅ​តែ​ស្ថិត​ក្នុង​កម្រិត​បឋម។
 មានតែតាមរយៈការទទួលបានលិខិតអនុញ្ញាតសាងសង់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ ទើបអ្នកអាចធានាបាននូវគម្រោងចុងក្រោយ ហើយការសម្រេចចិត្តរបស់អ្នកនឹងឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីបញ្ហានេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​ប្រាប់​ជាមុន​ថា​តើ​យើង​មាន​លក្ខណៈ​ជាក់លាក់​ប៉ុណ្ណា។
 នៅក្នុងទីក្រុងជាច្រើន និងគម្រោងជាច្រើន ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថានៅក្នុងគម្រោងផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុង Medford កម្រិតនៃការរចនាគំនិតនេះនឹងមានលក្ខណៈសមរម្យសម្រាប់ការត្រួតពិនិត្យ និងការអនុម័តពេញលេញនៃលិខិតអនុញ្ញាត។
 ជាក់ស្តែង យើងចង់ដោះស្រាយកង្វល់របស់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សានៅក្នុងមតិសាធារណៈណាមួយ ហើយនឹងបន្តធ្វើដូច្នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាឧទាហរណ៍ ផែនការសាងសង់ដែលត្រូវបានពិនិត្យដោយ Eric គឺគ្រប់គ្រាន់សម្រាប់ការអនុម័តនៅដំណាក់កាលនេះ។
 អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​កំពុង​និយាយ​គឺ​ការ​ចាប់​អារម្មណ៍​តាម​ប្រធានបទ និង​ការ​រចនា​សោភ័ណភាព ហើយ​យើង​កំពុង​នាំមុខ​ក្នុង​ជំហាន​នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេវានឹងមិនមានកម្រិតនៃការធ្វើផែនការនោះទេ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់បានព័ត៌មានលម្អិតបន្ថែមអំពីលក្ខណៈពិសេស និងធាតុផ្សំនៃការរចនា យើងនឹងព្យាយាមឱ្យអស់ពីសមត្ថភាពដើម្បីផ្តល់ពួកវាសម្រាប់អ្នក។
 បាទ/ចាស យើងនឹងមិនបញ្ចូលឯកសារសំណង់ជាផ្នែកនៃរឿងនេះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារឿងមួយទៀតគឺការចាប់អារម្មណ៍ថានេះគឺជាអគារឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 បាទ មាន​អគារ​ឧស្សាហកម្ម​មួយ​និង​ការ​បោះ​ជំហាន​របស់​វា។
 នេះគឺជាសួនឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 មាន​ឃ្លាំង​ឧស្សាហកម្ម​នៅ​ក្បែរ​នោះ។
 ដូចដែល Eric បាននិយាយ យើងបានខ្ចីការរចនានេះពីបច្ចេកទេសទាំងនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា មនុស្ស​ម្នាក់ៗ​នឹង​មាន​យោបល់​រៀង​ខ្លួន។
 គំនិតផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺថាវាមើលទៅដូចជា 40B ផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវបានអនុម័ត និងសាងសង់ដោយទីក្រុង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3166.823s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Спасибо
 У меня есть определенный вопрос к Клиффу Бомеру.
 Я просто хочу убедиться, что мы все уладим сегодня вечером, чтобы в случае возникновения какого-либо конфликта мы все могли быть на одной волне.
 Итак, мы говорим о проблемах.
 Мы уже обсуждали вопрос подключения.
 Остальные детали мы обсудили на виде с крыши.
 Господин Бомер, есть ли у вас какие-то конкретные ожидания относительно деталей поправки, которая сегодня не применима?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3210.995s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: បាទ នោះជាសំណួរដ៏ល្អ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនអាចឆ្លើយលម្អិតបានទេ។
 អនុញ្ញាតឱ្យខ្ញុំសម្រាក។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ការ​លើក​ឡើង​របស់​មេធាវី Tan គឺ​សម​ហេតុ​ផល​ព្រោះ​ច្បាប់​ខ្លួន​ឯង​និយាយ​អំពី​ការ​ធ្វើ​ផែនការ​បឋម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលយើងកំពុងឃើញនៅក្នុងបេក្ខជននេះគឺជាឆន្ទៈ
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ភាគី​ទាំង​អស់​យល់​ស្រប​ថា​ទាំង​នេះ​គឺ​ជា​ការ​កែលម្អ​អគារ។
 ដូច្នេះតាមទស្សនៈរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំគិតថានេះជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំមានបញ្ហាខ្លះជាមួយ Time សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ របៀបដែលអគារឆ្លើយតបទៅនឹងបរិបទបច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់វា និងសម្របខ្លួនទៅនឹងគំរូនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍ទាក់ទងនឹងសោភ័ណភាព។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាមានកាតព្វកិច្ចនៅលើ facade សំខាន់ដែលប្រឈមមុខនឹងដែនសាធារណៈ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ពិត​ជា​ចូល​ចិត្ត​គោល​គំនិត​ភស្តុតាង​នៃ​គោល​គំនិត​ដែល​មេធាវី​បាន​លើក​ឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របទាំងស្រុងនឹងរឿងនេះ។ ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​អ្វី​ដែល​គណៈកម្មការ​ត្រូវ​ដឹង​គឺ​រូបភាព​ដែល​គេ​បាន​ឃើញ
 ដាក់វានៅកន្លែងល្អ ហើយបង្ហាញថាអ្វីមួយកំពុងដំណើរការក្នុងទិសដៅត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ពួកគេមិនបង្កើតកម្រិតលម្អិតខ្ពស់ទេ។
 នោះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលពួកគេត្រូវបានស្នើឱ្យធ្វើ ហើយពួកគេមិនគួរត្រូវធ្វើ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​តាម​គំនិត​ខ្ញុំ ផែនការ​ដំបូល និង​ការ​ដាក់​ឧបករណ៍​មេកានិក​គឺ​សំខាន់។
 តើយើងមិនមើលឧបករណ៍មេកានិចទេ?
 គ្រប់គ្រាន់
 ការពារពីដែនសាធារណៈ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ឃើញ​ជាន់​ផ្ទាល់​ដី​បន្ថែម​ទៀត​ដែល​មាន​ចំណត​រថយន្ត​នៅ​លើ​ផ្ទៃ​ដែល​ទាក់ទង​នឹង​ផ្នែក​ខាង​លិច​នៃ​អគារ។
 នោះហើយជាវា។
 ដូចជាខ្ញុំចង់ឃើញ អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចង់ឃើញគឺ ខ្ញុំគិតថារាល់ពេលដែលពួកគេធ្វើនោះ ពួកគេបង្ហាញថាពួកគេកំពុងស្តាប់អ្វីដែលអ្នកកំពុងនិយាយ។
 បន្ទាប់មកខ្ញុំនឹងរង់ចាំការវិភាគស៊ីជម្រៅបន្ថែមទៀត
 សោភ័ណភាពនៃអគារ ប៉ុន្តែរបៀបដែលពួកគេជួយអគារបញ្ចូលគ្នា ឬស្វែងរកតុល្យភាពត្រឹមត្រូវរវាងរូបរាងឧស្សាហកម្ម ប៉ុន្តែប្រហែលជានៅតែទាក់ទងនឹងចង្វាក់ និងទំហំជុំវិញមួយចំនួន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនអាចទេ វាជាការលំបាកសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំក្នុងការសង្ខេបអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងនៅក្នុងតែមួយ ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំមានពេលដើម្បីសរសេរកំណត់ចំណាំ តើខ្ញុំរំពឹងអ្វី?
 ដូចគ្នានេះផងដែរ យ៉ាងហោចណាស់នៅកម្រិតដែលខ្ញុំបានឃើញនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍ជាច្រើន ជាពិសេសប្រសិនបើមានបេក្ខជនដែលចង់ធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា វា​នឹង​ជា​ឱកាស​មួយ​ដែល​ខកខាន ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួក​គេ​មិន​បាន​បន្ត​ស្មារតី​នេះ ហើយ​ពិចារណា​អំពី​គំនិត​មួយ​ចំនួន​សម្រាប់​ការ​បញ្ចប់​ម៉ាស់។
 ក៏ដូចជាការផ្តល់គ្រឿងសិប្បកម្មជាមូលដ្ឋានមួយចំនួនទៀត។
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយផែនការដំបូលមានសារៈសំខាន់ក្នុងករណីនេះពីព្រោះយើងត្រូវដឹងពីអ្វីដែលអាចមើលឃើញពីផ្លូវ។
 ប្រសិនបើមតិនោះមិនត្រឹមត្រូវ នោះខ្ញុំមិនលើកទឹកចិត្តក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលឱ្យធ្វើការសម្រេចចិត្តដោយផ្អែកលើមតិនោះឡើយ រហូតទាល់តែខ្ញុំជឿថាបេក្ខជនពិតជាមានកាតព្វកិច្ច។
 បង្ហាញរូបភាពយ៉ាងត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ពួកគេពិតជាតំណាងឱ្យអ្វីមួយដែលជិតស្និទ្ធទៅនឹងអ្វីដែលសភា និងសាធារណជននឹងឃើញនៅពេលដែលវាត្រូវបានសាងសង់ពិតប្រាកដ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងត្រូវកំណត់អត្តសញ្ញាណពួកគេខ្លះ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​លើក​ទឹក​ចិត្ត​អ្នក​ឱ្យ​ត្រឡប់​មក​វិញ​ជាមួយ​នឹង​គំនិត​មួយ​ចំនួន​អំពី​របៀប​ធ្វើ​រឿង​នេះ។
 ស្វែងយល់បន្ថែមអំពីប្រភេទអគារ។
 ចំពោះដើមឈើ ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របថា ពួកវានៅជិតគ្នាណាស់ ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលខ្ញុំនិយាយនៅដើមដំបូង ខ្ញុំមិនធ្វើទេ ព្រោះខ្ញុំផ្តោតខ្លាំងលើការធ្វើផែនការទីតាំង ខ្ញុំមិនមើលប្លង់គេហទំព័រឱ្យលម្អិតទេ ប៉ុន្តែវាស្ថិតក្នុងកម្រិតដែលខ្ញុំឃើញជាធម្មតា ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាចាប់ពីចំណុចនេះតទៅ ដូចជាវត្ថុបុរាណ។
 ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំរកឃើញការបំពានលេខកូដធ្ងន់ធ្ងរ អ្នកគួរតែរំពឹងថានឹងមានការឆ្លើយតបពីខ្ញុំ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ កម្រិតនេះក៏ជាប្រភេទនៃការពិតមួយដែរ ដែលអ្វីដែលអ្នកឃើញនៅក្នុងដ្យាក្រាមគឺពិតជាអាចធ្វើទៅបានតាមលក្ខណៈជាក់លាក់ ហើយខ្ញុំចង់ផ្តល់ឱកាសក្នុងការធ្វើអត្ថាធិប្បាយលើវា។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងចង្អុលបង្ហាញ ហើយខ្ញុំក៏ដឹងថា ស្ថាបត្យករក៏ដឹងដែរ
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំប្រាកដថា Pat Newton ដឹងហើយថាមានតម្រូវការកូដអគារនៅលើដំបូលពិតប្រាកដ ដើម្បីធានាថាអគារអាចបំប្លែងទៅជាពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យនៅលើដំបូលនាពេលអនាគត ហើយទោះបីជាមិនមានឥឡូវនេះក៏ដោយ ក៏នៅតែមានតម្រូវការដែលដំបូលត្រូវបានរចនាឡើងជារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធដើម្បីផ្ទុកពួកគេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកអភិវឌ្ឍន៍ទាំងអស់សព្វថ្ងៃនេះនឹងធានាថាពួកគេមានលទ្ធភាពគ្រប់គ្រាន់ទៅកាន់បន្ទប់អគ្គិសនីដើម្បីដំឡើងបន្ទះស្រូបពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យទោះបីជាពួកគេមិនត្រូវបានដំឡើងក្នុងអំឡុងពេលដំណើរការសាងសង់ដំបូងក៏ដោយ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ចំណាយ​ពេល​បន្តិច ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​រីករាយ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ត្រៀម​ខ្លួន​ជា​ស្រេច។
 អនុស្សរណៈអំពីរឿងសំខាន់ៗដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាអាចនឹងបាត់បង់ក្នុងការផ្សព្វផ្សាយភស្តុតាងនៃគំនិត។
 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាខ្ញុំមានពេលវេលាដើម្បីគិតអំពីរឿងនេះទាក់ទងនឹងសម្ភារៈថ្មី។
 ប៉ុន្តែលើសពីនេះទៅទៀត ខ្ញុំសូមផ្តល់អនុសាសន៍ឱ្យធ្វើការស្រាវជ្រាវបន្ថែមទៀត ដើម្បីហួសពីគោលគំនិតនៃរបៀបរក្សាតុល្យភាព
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយពីមុនមក បាទ អេមីរ៉ាតនីមួយៗឥឡូវនេះមានទីក្រុងពាណិជ្ជកម្មមួយ ប៉ុន្តែតាមពិតទៅវាមានទម្រង់ស្មុគស្មាញ គួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ ចម្រុះ និងច្បាស់លាស់។
 នេះជាទិដ្ឋភាពទីក្រុងកាន់តែប្រសើរ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​អ្នក​មាន​ឱកាស​បាន​មើល​ទិដ្ឋភាព​ដ៏​ស្រស់​ស្អាត​នៃ​ទីក្រុង ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​នៅ​ទីនោះ
 ប្រសិនបើយើងក្រឡេកមើលកង្វល់មួយចំនួនដែលយើងបានឮនៅយប់នេះ សូមលើកវាមួយជុំទៀត ដើម្បីឈានទៅរកគោលដៅផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់អ្នក។
 ដូច្នេះ សូមអភ័យទោស ប្រសិនបើនេះជារង្វង់បន្តិច ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនអាចទេ អ្នកដឹងទេថា ក្នុងសេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍មួយ តើអ្វីជាសេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍មួយទៀត?</p>

 Согласно документам, адвокат Кристофер Албин является адвокатом ПНД.
 Да, пожалуйста, продолжайте.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3677.017s">[SPEAKER_16]</a>: Да, я согласен с комментариями Тэма и Клиффа о том, что они выглядят как красивые архитектурные чертежи и планы, заложенные в 40B.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3690.346s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Дизайн — важный аспект, и я думаю, что у Клиффа есть хорошие шансы тщательно его оценить, и кандидат, кажется, отвечает на его комментарии.
 Что ж, обязанность Совета — убедиться, что проект приемлем, но, что более важно, нам необходимо рассмотреть более технические аспекты проекта при подаче заявки на получение полного разрешения.
 Мы говорим о влиянии на общественные услуги, такие как транспортировка ливневых вод и гражданское строительство.
 Я уверен, что совет это знает.
 Я уверен, что кандидат это знает.
 Я могу только предположить, что этот совет не будет участвовать в длительных дискуссиях с широкой дизайнерской аудиторией.
 И, вы знаете, мы идем по графику.
 Начинаем рассматривать более технические аспекты проекта.
 Я думаю, что мы добились большого прогресса в плане дизайна, вот что я думаю.
 Теперь я думаю, что если у вас есть какие-либо предложения, вы знаете, что есть некоторые моменты, которые вы, возможно, захотите рассмотреть.
 Изменения в дизайне, а может быть, обновления и дополнения от Клиффа, тогда, может быть, пришло время сказать: «Хорошо, нам нужно посмотреть на строительные работы, нам нужно посмотреть на штормы, нам нужно посмотреть на движение транспорта».</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3770.168s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, спасибо адвокату Эльфину.
 Цель моей сегодняшней встречи состоит в том, чтобы Правление прояснило оставшиеся элементы дизайна, поскольку они хотят увидеть больше деталей или изменений.
 Подробности о его состоянии мы получили от Боумера.
 согласен с общим мнением
 Я также буду признателен за этот меморандум в ближайшем будущем.
 Так что, если вы пришлете нам копию Клиффа, мы будем очень признательны.
 Но я слышу, вы знаете, более подробную информацию о крыше, подробности о важности предложений от консультантов и запросов от вас самих.
 Баумер о правильной стратегии прекращения мессы.
 Подробности я услышал ниже.
 Я думаю, что это основные части, которые меня интересуют.
 Да, как прокомментировал план Баумер.
 Они очень близки.
 Кажется, что у вас уже есть большая часть необходимой информации, но нам просто хочется об этом подумать.
 Поэтому я думаю, что мы можем провести еще одно совещание по дизайну, на котором можно будет учесть все эти вещи.
 Но я согласен с адвокатом Альфином.
 Мы не можем оставить это как бесконечный проект.
 В календаре мы можем иметь
 У нас еще есть место для еще одной встречи по дизайну, а затем нам придется принять некоторые решения, чтобы перейти к графику.
 Теперь перейдем к следующей запланированной встрече через две недели, если только
 Что ж, необходимые изменения или вопросы создания необходимых документов действительно лежат в основе инженерного дела.
 Хм, так что мы можем обсудить, вносить ли изменения, основываясь на сегодняшнем обсуждении, но да, нам нужно консолидировать дизайн, чтобы мы тоже могли это сделать.
 Предоставьте достаточную информацию о технических факторах, чтобы Совет мог оценить все, что нам нужно оценить, в течение срока, установленного законом.
 Это было мое намерение.
 Пожалуйста, продолжайте.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3927.624s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Нет, я просто хочу, чтобы ты знал кое-что еще, эм.
 О, план этажа.
 Они важны, и хорошо, что Клифф на них смотрит, но на самом деле, при полном одобрении, эти планы могут быть изменены после принятия решения, основаны ли они на, гм, гм, соглашении об управлении для государственной инспекции, или же конструкция, которую они строят, может быть изменена, если это не серьезные изменения, и часто это не модификация.
 Когда вы смотрите на основные модификации, вы обычно можете начать с 40B.
 Не следует тратить слишком много времени на такие вопросы, как планы этажей и размеры квартиры.
 Есть номера с комнатами и так далее. Но это всего лишь управляемый аспект в зависимости от потребностей.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3988.356s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, Андрей, пожалуйста.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3990.077s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Я имею в виду, я просто хочу отметить, что несколько месяцев назад мы прошли еще один процесс авторизации 40 B, где мы подробно обсудили некоторые ключевые проекты, и я думаю, что это приведет к улучшению проекта для сообщества.
 Я думаю, мы унаследовали масштаб этого проекта.
 Поверьте, если бы я перезапустился, я бы не нарисовал гигантский прямоугольник в центре квартала.
 Но я думаю, что мы обязаны сделать все возможное, чтобы обезопасить этот проект.
 Его масштаб действительно важен и интегрирован наилучшим образом.
 Что касается меня, мы не разговариваем.
 Мы действительно не анализируем и не обсуждаем вопросы парковки.
 Мы еще не обсуждали количество парковочных мест.
 Речь не идет о количестве зарядных устройств для электромобилей.
 Мы не говорим о горизонтальных приложениях.
 Помимо всех технических вопросов, о которых вы упомянули, речь не идет о паблик-арте.
 Поэтому я просто хочу поднять флаг и сказать, что это то, о чем нам следует говорить.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4065.017s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Спасибо, Эндрю.
 Возможно, я неправильно помню.
 Я думаю, что часть дискуссий на последних слушаниях по поводу парковок и инвалидных колясок связана с инженерией, но я полностью согласен, что их обязательно нужно обсуждать, как и благоустройство.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4082.101s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Как люди входят и выходят?
 Как мусор попадает и вывозится?
 Все эти вещи.
 Последняя работа 40B, которую мы сделали, была прогрессом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4092.67s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, но насколько я помню, 40Б окончил инженерно-строительный факультет.
 Возможно, я ошибаюсь, но да, если кандидат не намерен предоставлять эти данные, планируйте их отправить.
 Правлению нужны эти подробности.
 Я считаю, что они очень важны для функционирования здания.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4118.096s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Абсолютно.
 Часть этой информации включена в наш план этажа, который также включен в этот пакет.
 Я рад ответить на любые вопросы по этому поводу.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4130.222s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Ну, я думаю, пока.
 Мы, конечно, можем задаться вопросом.
 Собираетесь ли вы подробно обсудить этот вопрос на будущих слушаниях?
 Или вы хотите, чтобы правление задавало конкретные вопросы, а затем отвечало на них таким образом?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4150.809s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Господин президент, могу ли я говорить от имени корпорации Дэвис?
 Я думаю
 Думаю, мы вас ясно услышали и перейдем на следующее заседание. Помимо гражданских вопросов, мы также можем обсудить некоторые из этих оперативных вопросов и дать их количественную оценку.
 Или поставьте нас с точки зрения расположения (хотя бы с точки зрения байтового хранилища) общественной парковки, платящей за искусство.
 Мы можем обсудить ландшафтные планы и некоторые сопутствующие оперативные вопросы.
 Если что-то не завершено, мы можем создать стандарт.
 Знаете, если речь идет о размере или приблизительном размере, то, вероятно, это часть состояния.
 Это подходит для данного уровня дизайна.
 Однако мы не упустим это из виду, и я думаю, что мы захотим просмотреть меморандум Клиффа и доработать дополнительные детали дизайна на основе его комментариев и предложений.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4220.455s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Эндрю, ты хотя бы облегчишь часть своих забот?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4227.229s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Что ж, помимо одобрения, я хочу продвинуть все идеи, которые мы полностью рассмотрим.
 Я знаю, что скоро у нас будет встреча, чтобы обсудить другие вопросы, но я говорю о том, и я хочу, чтобы мы обсудили их и, если необходимо, условия.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4254.242s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Просто ответь.
 Просто отвечайте четко, мы постараемся решить каждый пункт.
 Мы слышали их раньше.
 Мы обсудили некоторые из этих вопросов, и, как вы отметили, парковка — это вопрос, который, я думаю, мы подробно рассмотрели на предыдущих встречах.
 Мы ожидаем полного обзора.
 Я думаю, что мы достигли этого результата и получили большую выгоду с момента начала полного обзора.
 Но я...
 Я имею в виду, что во многих случаях существуют соответствующие факторы.
 Мне пришла в голову идея паблик-арта.
 Нам не нужно будет знать уровень детализации, когда это решение будет представлено Правлению.
 Но мы действительно можем установить для этого некоторые стандарты.
 Я думаю, именно это предложил Лао Рёр.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4315.214s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 В настоящее время я свяжусь с членами правления, чтобы узнать, есть ли еще вопросы или комментарии.
 После рассмотрения вопросов и замечаний совета намерен оставить возможность публичного обсуждения оформления этих идей.
 Но сначала я хочу убедиться, что если у членов правления возникнут дополнительные вопросы или комментарии, у них будет возможность быть услышанными.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4345.665s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: У меня нет проблем.
 У меня лишь одно мнение и я полностью поддерживаю то, что говорит и говорит Андрей.
 И дело не только в нем.
 Поэтому я просто хочу убедиться, что нам все ясно.
 Я думаю, что большинство членов совета с ним согласятся.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4364.47s">[Unidentified]</a>: Это верно.
 Я тоже согласен.
 Я ожидаю, что эти предметы будут в первую очередь гражданскими работами.
 Еще один пункт, который я хотел бы добавить в этот список, — это проект освещения.
 Есть также технические моменты, поднятые другим юристом.
 Это цель.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4385.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Это верно.
 Спасибо за разъяснения.
 У меня тоже есть такие ожидания.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4390.872s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Это встреча сегодня или встреча в будущем?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4398.054s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Если я правильно понимаю, мы намерены раскрыть эти детали на следующей встрече.
 Спасибо
 Все хорошо.
 Есть ли у кого-либо из членов правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?
 Президент ничего не увидел, ожидая публичного обращения по концепции проекта.
 Я переехал.
 Понедельник.
 Есть ли у меня второй?
 Понедельник.
 Итак, давайте позвоним.

 Хорошо, публичная часть слушаний открыта.
 В настоящее время мы принимаем общественное мнение.
 О представленном сегодня концептуальном проекте.
 Если вы в аудитории хотите поговорить на эту тему, поднимите руку на зуме, включите камеру, поднимите руку и напечатайте что-нибудь в разговоре.
 Вы также можете написать DennisDMcDougall по адресу Medford-MA.gov.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4672.525s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Спасибо
 Итак, я запомнил и позабочусь, чтобы мы обсудили это в гражданской части процесса.
 Потому что здесь проблема не в этом.
 Я имею в виду, что если кандидаты захотят немного поговорить об этом, это будет приветствоваться, но я не жду от них ответа.
 Но я думаю, именно это мы и собираемся сказать в гражданской части процесса.
 Тогда
 Я знаю, что это всего лишь комментарий.
 Конечно, в обязанности комиссии не входит рекомендовать альтернативное землепользование.
 И это отметил рецензент.
 Это публичный рекорд.
 Но мы не будем принимать непосредственного участия.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4721.002s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Господин Президент, я войду и дам хотя бы краткий ответ, чтобы мы не остались.
 Пусть все почувствуют, что мы имеем дело с проблемой, когда она случается.
 Мы можем и обязательно углубимся в конкретные вопросы на следующих слушаниях.
 Г-жа Д'Агостино. Если вы не можете присутствовать, текущий план требует следующего расширения Мирта, поэтому, когда вы продолжите движение по Мирту к главной развилке, мы предлагаем расширение Мирта на одной стороне дороги, пересекающей здание трубопровода.
 Так что с линии здания да, здесь плохо видно.
 Нет, суть сегодняшнего шоу не в этом.
 Но да, поднимаясь с этой точки, основная линия дороги остается прежней и идет вниз.
 О, план состоит в том, чтобы двигаться на запад, и мы предлагаем расширить Миртл-роуд на земле, которую мы занимаем и управляем, относительно фонарного столба.
 Мы можем подробно изложить этот вопрос на следующих слушаниях, и это информация, полученная на предыдущих слушаниях, но люди не могут ясно увидеть суть.
 Это не наше намерение.
 Итак, мы планируем углубиться в подробности, но это все.
 Существующие группы коммунальных услуг мы планируем оставить без изменений.
 Они соединяются с участком на другой стороне Миртл-роуд, а мы не хотим этого делать.
 У нас нет планов переносить или прекращать какие-либо их услуги.
 Тогда есть кривая.
 Наш план переезда вращается вокруг них, фактически создавая место на Миртл-роуд, чтобы автомобили могли парковаться за пределами проезжей части, но при этом сохраняется пространство на тротуаре, чтобы столбы оставались на месте.
 Это снова краткий ответ.
 Я просто хочу что-то дать.
 Значит, ваши чувства отличаются от наших.
 Просматривая здесь, мы сможем обсудить более подробно через две недели.
 Расскажите всем о наших советах по очистке сорняков.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4856.667s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Спасибо, я просто хочу сказать спасибо.
 Я знаю, что мне больше не стоит беспокоиться, но спасибо.
 Это помогает прояснить некоторые вопросы.
 Поэтому я благодарю вас.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4866.834s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Спасибо
 Затем я увидел, как другой из зрителей поднял руку, чтобы помочь Кристине.
 Можете ли вы указать свое имя и адрес для регистрации?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4875.96s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: С уважением, Кристина Кач, Миртл-стрит, 130, Медфорд.
 У меня есть быстрый вопрос подтверждения, а затем вопрос о дизайне.
 Должно ли изучение светового и звукового загрязнения стать частью гражданского строительства или дизайна?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4898.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Поэтому я думаю, что изучение светового загрязнения и его загрязнения, я не уверен, проводится ли оно регулярно или нет.
 Дежурная выставка.
 Так мало кто думает, что этот проект освещает этап дружбы JE.
 Каковы особые предметы Дуба Чена?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4919.395s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, да.
 Ты построишь большое здание перед моей квартирой.
 Будет больше жителей, шума, животных, света.
 Беспрецедентные пейзажи и системы общественного освещения на этой улице ворвутся в нашу повседневную жизнь, особенно для тех, кто работает из дома.
 Кроме того, ночью, если мы рано ложимся спать, прибор также создает световое загрязнение не только в саду, но и в кустах амаранта в доме.
 Вот почему я считаю, что шум и световое загрязнение необходимо изучать.
 Качество жизни для существующих жильцов.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4964.733s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Я понял.
 Спасибо за разъяснения.
 Да, темы разделены на категории.
 Затем государственные служащие подготовят план освещения, чтобы жители понимали, где находится свет и какие районы могут быть затронуты.
 Знаете, свет влияет на соседей.
 Это именно то, что мы можем рассмотреть.
 Я думаю, что размещение окон и объектов более важно.
 Это здание, а потом, знаете, если есть немой и все такое, я знаю, что на это есть правила, но я думаю, что это цивилизованно.
 Так что да, некоторые моменты относятся к этому, но, чтобы внести ясность, спрашивающий может поправить меня, если я ошибаюсь, я так не думаю.
 Будут проводиться выставки, посвященные детальным исследованиям светового и шумового загрязнения.
 Вместо этого мы поговорим о таких вещах, как освещение и звукозащита.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5038.389s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Господин Президент прав.
 План освещения, который в конечном итоге будет рассмотрен инженером-строителем, будет включать фотометрический план.
 Демонстрирует соответствие и снижает светопропускание от внешнего освещения.
 Что касается шума, помимо действующих нормативных требований, существуют муниципальные правила по шуму.
 Что произойдет, если есть определенный генератор звука?
 Вызывающие обеспокоенность вопросы, такие как кровельное оборудование, часто могут быть в центре внимания архитектурно-гражданских оценок для смягчения этих воздействий.
 Но это факторы, которые обычно учитывают советы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5097.163s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Спасибо
 Кристина может ответить на ваш вопрос?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5103.393s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Он ответил на мой вопрос.
 Я был немного разочарован.
 Не буду больше вдаваться в эти вопросы, но прокомментирую этот вопрос после гражданского процесса.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5115.72s">[Unidentified]</a>: Да, у меня есть это фото.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5118.462s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Так что у меня тоже есть конкретный вопрос по поводу дизайна.
 Я думаю это для Cube 3.
 Вы упомянули
 Он владеет четырьмя объектами недвижимости в Медфорде и работает над другими проектами.
 Я спрашиваю, потому что у вас в четырех пентхаусах есть пустые квартиры.
 Учитывайте некоторые дефекты вашего предыдущего проекта при проектировании этого здания, чтобы гарантировать, что они не повторятся в этом новом объекте.
 Итак, я рассматриваю, как можно использовать вскрытие предыдущих зданий, чтобы принять более обоснованные решения для этого подразделения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5166.021s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Спасибо
 Так что в этом случае я попробую
 Передайте это в ведение совета.
 Я задам вопрос еще раз, потому что вы знаете, есть ли какие-либо конкретные элементы, подробно описанные в планах этого проекта, которые включают в себя передовой опыт и уроки, извлеченные из других проектов в этой области?
 Так что, если кандидат хочет поговорить о каких-либо деталях, пожалуйста, продолжайте.
 Конечно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5188.814s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Это верно.
 Я имею в виду, очевидно, что мы всегда учимся и пытаемся извлечь уроки из предыдущих проектов.
 Я думаю, вам следует помнить одну вещь: мы работаем здесь с разными застройщиками, а не с другой недвижимостью.
 Поэтому часть работы, которую мы проделали в предыдущих отелях, не применима к тому, что мы делаем здесь, в зависимости от клиента и места, где мы работаем.
 Но мы всегда пытаемся понять, что мы сделали неправильно, а что правильно, и пытаемся применить это к следующему проекту.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5222.194s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Господин Президент, это всего лишь информация.
 Можете ли вы действительно подтвердить мнение жителей Бьютса, которые говорят и слушают сегодня вечером? Если у вас есть конкретные инструкции о том, как ими управлять (например, светом, звуком или другими элементами ландшафта), можете ли вы?
 Пожалуйста, сообщите об этом городу или нам, чтобы мы могли быть уверены, что это часть предложения или вы знаете, что это часть нашего анализа.
 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5255.977s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, но я имею в виду, что я инженер-промышленник, а не инженер-строитель.
 Поэтому мне нужен был инженер, чтобы мне было над чем работать раньше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5265.004s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Что ж, опираясь на точку зрения Эндрю, я думаю, что в целом таблица,
 Публика может задавать вопросы и высказывать свое мнение.
 Как вы можете видеть на этих встречах, я надеюсь, что, по крайней мере, я говорю о том, что Правление постарается убедиться, что, если вы поднимете вопрос или что-то, что совет не рассматривает или не задает, мы в конечном итоге работаем с этим кандидатом, и этот кандидат отвечает и предоставляет эти детали, и этот кандидат уже ответил.
 Думаю, это соответствует точке зрения Эндрю.
 Если у вас есть идея, высказанная ли она непосредственно городу или на общественных слушаниях, она все равно может оказаться полезной, даже если она исходит не от местного эксперта.
 Можете ли вы поделиться этой идеей в виде записанного комментария?
 Это может привести к дискуссиям или комментариям с участием экспертов в конкретной области, отражающим дух концепции.
 Ну думаю, если я Вас правильно понял, Андрей, то Вы хотите дать понять народу.
 Идеи приветствуются, существуют форумы, на которых местные жители могут выразить свои идеи здесь или вместе с городом.
 Особенно, если вы поместите эти идеи в одинаковые сроки или до того, как обсуждение сосредоточится на проблеме, правление сможет обсудить и вдохновить кандидатов.
 Это справедливо, Эндрю?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5367.772s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Это верно.
 Это может быть так же просто, как вы не хотите, чтобы в вашем здании было освещение, или вам может потребоваться больше света, потому что это полезно для общественной безопасности.
 Я не знаю.
 Подобные вещи.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5381.754s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: ок
 Спасибо
 Комментарии других участников теперь показывают, что другие представители общественности тоже хотят высказаться, кроме меня.
 Я подожду несколько секунд, чтобы убедиться.
 Все хорошо.
 Председатель ничего не видит и ждет требования закрыть публичную часть процесса.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5412.685s">[Unidentified]</a>: Очень трогательно.</p>

 Поэтому общественное мнение закрыто для этой встречи.
 Мы будем искать мнения общественности по другим важным вопросам на предстоящих слушаниях.
 Все хорошо.
 Я просто хочу еще раз проверить это у правления.
 Есть ли у вас какие-либо вопросы или комментарии по поводу того, что мы увидели сегодня, или по другим темам, доступным сегодня?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5463.805s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Хм, конечно, да, я это знаю, почему-то известно заранее.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5467.25s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Почему нет?
 Одна вещь: пока архитекторы над этим работают, я хочу посмотреть, о чем идет речь.
 Этот проект предназначен для первого этажа вокруг здания.
 Знаете, мы ищем больше.
 Однако, с одной стороны.
 Весь первый этаж пуст.
 Интересно, может ли это быть место для других фресок в стиле паблик-арт, каких-нибудь зеленых стен?
 Я хочу знать, что там происходит, чтобы это не была просто пустая стена.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5528.08s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Я вижу движения головы.
 Можем ли мы решить этот вопрос на будущих слушаниях?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5532.502s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Да, мы обязательно учтем это и планируем ответить на следующих слушаниях.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5538.944s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Особенный.
 Единственное, что я хотел бы добавить председателю, это то, что я думаю, что мы можем ответить ЛаРю и, конечно же, мы можем предложить Правлению некоторые альтернативные идеи и возможности для рассмотрения этих типов элементов дизайна на этом уровне.
 Это может представлять, а затем информировать совет о подробных требованиях, которые могут быть отражены в окончательном плане.
 Таким образом, у вас будет дизайнерская цель, которой вы хотите достичь с точки зрения обретения смирения или предоставления нескольких советов, будь то в картине или в окончательном плане.
 Я не уверен, что у нас еще сохранилась идея паблик-арта, вы знаете, Х процентов стены должно быть посвящено паблик-арту.
 Но мы определенно можем предоставить вам на рассмотрение некоторые стандарты и идеи для оправ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5606.611s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, я считаю презентацию полезной, по крайней мере, она позволяет провести практические обсуждения, которые позволят создать окончательный дизайн.
 Все хорошо.
 Мы так благодарны.
 Теперь отлично.
 Теперь перейдем к отделу доставки.
 Так это подтвердилось косвенно, но я просто хотел перепроверить.
 Таким образом, в течение двух недель основным направлением планирования был жилой район, и казалось, что мы просматриваем территорию, а также ландшафтное планирование.
 Все обсуждаемые сегодня обновления могут быть отражены не в установленном формате, а только как общие обновления по обсуждаемым сегодня темам в течение двух недель.
 Мы на пути к достижению этой цели.
 Я прав?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5666.923s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, господин президент, это наш план, когда мы вернемся через две недели, чтобы возобновить гражданские переговоры.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5675.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Итак, Боумер, когда вы ожидаете получить этот меморандум для рассмотрения советом директоров и кандидатами, что еще вы хотите увидеть?
 Может быть, в понедельник, что-то в этом роде, день или два позже.
 Особенный.
 Выглядит хорошо.
 Спасибо
 Если кандидат хочет сейчас внести ясность, я поговорю с ним.
 Моя нынешняя тенденция заключается в том, чтобы проявлять гибкость и назначить слушания на четыре недели, более или менее в зависимости от того, как пройдут документы и обсуждения в течение двух недель.
 Кажется ли это разумным?
 Или хотите точно знать, что произойдет через четыре недели?
 Повестка дня будет.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5736.39s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Я думаю, мы можем быть немного более гибкими.
 Я думаю, что в эти две недели это действительно зависит от аудитории, если будет за чем следить, мы обязательно захотим следить, а также следить за архитектурными элементами сегодня вечером.
 Поэтому я думаю, что если возможно, если есть контент, который необходимо прояснить по многим темам, это могли бы быть общественные слушания, на которых мы могли бы охватить широкий спектр тем.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5766.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Я просто хочу, чтобы общественность знала, поэтому следующий пункт в календаре, извините, я только что проверил это в своем календаре.
 Слушания состоятся 11 апреля.
 Обсудим гражданские вопросы.
 То же самое с некоторыми садовыми проектами и обновлениями на эту тему.
 Следующее судебное заседание назначено на 23 апреля.
 Здесь мы держим гибкую повестку дня, но хотим видеть тему, которая обсуждается более подробно.
 Разработано обновление на основе того, что сегодня сказали совет и общественность, а также меморандума Боумера.
 Это то, чего мы можем ожидать позже.
 Все хорошо.
 Думаю, мы осветили все четыре темы этой конференции.
 Я просто хочу посоветоваться с кандидатами, чтобы узнать, не произойдет ли что-нибудь еще.
 Хотите поговорить сегодня вечером?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5855.69s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Господин Президент, не мы.
 Спасибо за ваше время и отзыв.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5861.274s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, спасибо.
 Я также ценю детали и время.
 Приятно видеть прогресс, происходящий здесь.
 Поэтому мы ожидаем встречу через две недели.
 Тогда
 В настоящее время президент ожидает просьбы о продолжении рассмотрения дела до 18:30 11 апреля.
 Я переехал.
 Есть секунда?
 Понедельник.
 Я позвоню по телефону.
 Джим?
 Это верно.
 Джейми?
 Эндрю?
 Это верно.
 Эверетт?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5906.331s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Удачи.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5907.332s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Микро?
 Это верно.
 Дело длилось до 11 апреля.
 Так что спасибо, друг.
 Так что это единственный важный вопрос в повестке дня.
 Есть элементы многих процедур.
 Денис, ты можешь прочитать статью ниже?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5923.985s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Конечно.
 У нас есть административные обновления, и я хотел бы сказать, что это обновление носит исключительно информационный характер.
 Меня там не будет.
 Я буду там, я пойду.
 Так что я уеду в понедельник, среду или четверг, в зависимости от того, когда вернусь.
 Так что, если что-то случится, я позабочусь, чтобы вы все туда положили.
 Итак, вы знаете, как Клифф, Бета и все остальные, они вам их отправят, и вы знаете, пока меня нет, они обновят это на сайте.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5952.552s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Так что все в порядке.
 Так что планируйте, чтобы кто-то стал
 Можете ли вы помочь нам доставить товар, когда вас нет рядом, или нам следует подождать, пока вы вернетесь?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5967.744s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Нет.
 Меньший план — Янион.
 Поэтому, когда это произойдет, я обязательно удостоверюсь, что вы знаете, я думаю, что этот план, этот щедрый план, который я реализую, когда уйду, вероятно, более точным.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5980.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Идеальный.
 Выглядит хорошо.
 Но спасибо за обновление.
 Думаю, следующий момент – это протокол заседания.
 Я посылаю вам копию.
 Недавно.
 Да, помните.
 Я увидел, как директор поднял руку.
 Пожалуйста, продолжайте.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5998.488s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Я воспользуюсь любой возможностью, чтобы напомнить вам, что мы работаем с консультантом по планированию, чтобы получить самую свежую информацию.
 Если кто-то захочет встретиться с ним или с кем-то из его команды приватно, мы можем это организовать.
 Хочу прочитать, если у вас есть представление о том, что вы хотите увидеть.
 Или, если вы хотите, чтобы это было вынесено на собрание, вы можете сделать это на публичном собрании.
 Подумайте, что бы вы хотели видеть в изменении территории.
 Я просто хочу напомнить вам, что этот процесс продолжается: мы с Даниэль встречаемся с советниками почти каждую неделю, а городской совет встречается на заседаниях комитетов.
 Примерно каждые две недели также проводятся общественные собрания.
 Так что я просто надеюсь, что люди добавят в список больше контента.
 Начнем с административных вопросов.
 Поэтому, если у вас возникли проблемы с управлением разделами, сейчас самое время сообщить нам об этом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6063.775s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, спасибо, директор Хантер.
 Чтобы внести ясность: консультанты, которые хотят воспользоваться этой возможностью, должны связаться с вами напрямую, чтобы составить расписание на данный момент.
 Ух ты.
 Да, я думаю, что от имени совета мы действительно можем обсудить на обычных слушаниях, хотим ли мы предпринять какие-то коллективные действия совета.
 Нет, я думаю, что моя личная предвзятость на данном этапе процесса
 Возможно, если члены правления уже знают, что у вас есть мнение по какому-то вопросу, им следует работать напрямую с вами и членами правления.
 Так что да, мы можем, любой член совета, который хочет более публичного коллективного обсуждения этого вопроса, может перейти к предстоящим судебным разбирательствам.
 Ну, выглядит хорошо.
 Спасибо за обновление.
 Ух ты.
 Деннис, ты начинаешь тратить немного времени.
 Да, я знаю, что ты посылаешь... Я знаю, что ты отправляешь минуты.
 Я только сейчас это проверил.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6127.072s">[Unidentified]</a>: Ладно, у меня регулярные расставания.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6148.938s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Сообщение от 14 марта. Я знаю, что вам его отправили, и я просто хочу ответить.
 Кажется, я отправил все это, но я отправил слишком много, поэтому не уверен.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6164.845s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Да, мне 314 лет.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6173.509s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Я знаю, что оно было отправлено всем 30 января.
 Я вернусь к отправленному письму.
 И их много.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6187.912s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, я проверю у правления.
 Итак, у нас есть протоколы с 30 января, с 3 января по 14 января. Есть ли у участников возможность проверить их?
 Я получил несколько кивков.
 Ну, Джейми, я вижу, ты качаешь головой.
 Да, после их просмотра, что вы думаете об оценке?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6218.416s">[Unidentified]</a>: 14 января и 14 марта соответственно.
 Оба кажутся мне хорошими.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6225.443s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, у меня тоже была возможность их проверить.
 Они выглядят правильно.
 Деннис, я хочу быть уверен, что если мы потеряем несколько минут, они отправят нас.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6239.775s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Рэйчел делает такие вещи, так что это просто вопрос того, что она тебя отправит.
 Прежде чем вы уйдете, да, может быть, мы сможем собрать их все в папку, и вы сможете отправить их нам. Да, они все есть на Гугл Диске, просто по этим я бы согласился и не согласился в двух разных файлах. Я пришлю вам ссылку на Google Диск, чтобы вы могли войти в систему.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6260.557s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: На самом деле, это сработает. Думаю, да, и это хорошо, потому что я не находил его с марта.
 У меня 11, 25 и 30 января.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6271.473s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Но когда я отправил его вам в прошлую пятницу, я не смог увидеть Марта.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6276.139s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, это очень ново.
 Вы хотите что-то сказать.
 Нет, я просто согласен.
 Да, окей.
 Сейчас речь идет о 30 января и 14 марта.
 Так что да, некоторые члены правления, похоже, считают, что протоколы точны.
 Затем президент ждал поручения утвердить протоколы заседаний 30 января и 14 марта.
 Есть ли у меня второй?
 Хорошо, позвоним
 Джим?
 Эндрю?
 Это верно.
 Джейми?
 Это верно.
 Эверетт?
 Это верно.
 Микро?
 Это верно.
 Хорошо, минуты согласованы, заранее спасибо, Денис.
 Мы рассмотрим оставшиеся вопросы и решим их на следующем заседании.
 Давайте посмотрим
 Дорогие друзья, я хотел бы напомнить вам, что меня не будет на заседании в четверг.
 Джейми предложил вести шоу.
 Джейми, я хочу поделиться с тобой некоторыми подробностями.
 Но да, в остальном я надеюсь, что четверг пройдет хорошо.
 И увидимся снова 11 апреля.
 Ну, я думаю, что давай, Эндрю.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6371.794s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Это верно.
 Да, просто вопрос, возможно, к Алисии или Деннису.
 Он консультант 40B в городе. Я никогда не встречал его. Думаю, мы с ним еще не познакомились?
 Я думаю, мой вопрос в том, что, поскольку это относится к дизайну, о котором мы говорим сегодня, что это такое?
 Можем ли мы сделать что-нибудь, чтобы лучше спроектировать эти растущие проекты 40B, чтобы они не были просто теми же большими блочными проектами, которые мы продолжаем видеть?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6413.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Андре, я не думаю, что на судебном заседании сможет присутствовать не адвокат Хаверти, а его коллега Крис, который сегодня будет здесь.
 Он принадлежит тому же офису.
 Так что у нас их пока нет, но они соберутся вместе.
 Поэтому предлагаю несколько вариантов.
 Совет директоров может запланировать встречи с нашими консультантами 40B для подробного обсуждения этого вопроса или может напрямую связаться с любым членом Совета директоров.
 Если у вас есть какие-либо из этих вопросов, свяжитесь с нашим консультантом 40B для получения разъяснений.
 Единственное, чего мы не можем сделать, так это обсудить этот вопрос приватно с большой группой людей.
 Да, я предлагаю вам напрямую связаться с юристами Хаверти по этому вопросу, и мы сможем открыто обсудить этот вопрос на встрече.
 На ближайшем слушании.
 Мы также можем задать этот вопрос публично.
 Это еще один вариант.
 Я не думаю, что это можно квалифицировать как исполнительную сессию.
 Тогда мы сможем подтвердить, что адвокат Хаверти или его коллега будут присутствовать на следующем слушании.
 Я думаю, что они есть, и нам просто нужно спросить их публично.
 Это был бы другой вариант.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6508.835s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Хорошо, я доволен вами обоими.
 Может быть, я счастлив перед публикой.
 Я имею в виду здесь.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6516.687s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Так что да, может быть, из-за вашего любопытства и того факта, что через две недели нас не будет на слушаниях, возможно, я задам этот вопрос.
 Тем более сами получите ответ.
 Затем, исходя из этого, вы можете задать еще раз публично или сообщить мне, хотите ли вы обсудить это публично.
 Я хотел бы кратко изложить свое понимание.
 Я думаю, что существует детальный баланс и предел того, что правление может и не может делать.
 Вот почему лучше быть двусмысленным.
 Что мы действительно можем сделать? Я думаю, было бы лучше, если бы 40B Advisor обнародовал это.
 Я думаю, что в целом это баланс между внутренними проблемами и факторами, которые могут сделать проект не особенно экономичным.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6576.456s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: ок
 Потому что я хочу знать, как мы можем это узнать?
 Знаете, все переговоры, типа количества квартир, количества земли и т.д.
 Я имею в виду, я думаю, было бы неплохо, если бы люди понимали лучше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6594.821s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Конечно, возможно, мы сможем начать, потому что это более распространенная проблема.
 Я сделаю это открытой темой.
 На следующей встрече мы можем связаться с консультантом 40 Б и попросить его дать аудитории краткое изложение.
 Введите проверочную таблицу как часть процесса 40B.
 Это работает для вас?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6619.358s">[Unidentified]</a>: Конечно.
 Хорошо, отлично.
 Еще следует помнить, что когда эти проекты будут завершены, я думаю, они подадут в суд и заставят нас заплатить налог в размере 10%.
 Так что теоретически мы никогда больше не увидим 40B.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6639.593s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Меня не волнует 40 Б, я хочу жилищную помощь.
 Я просто хочу, чтобы всё было именно так. Я хочу, чтобы они достигли 50%.
 Я бы хотел, чтобы он был хорошо спроектирован и, возможно, вместо этих гигантских блоков у нас были бы небольшие здания разной высоты или что-то в этом роде.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6660.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Я понимаю, что имеет в виду прокурор Хантер, я прошу прощения у директора Хантера, о, он что-то делает.
 Итак, директор Хантер, я просто хочу сказать, что мы на верном пути.
 Мы не говорим об этом конкретном проекте, но мы движемся вперед.
 действительно
 Предлагаю не вдаваться здесь в подробности.
 Но что скажет директор Хантер?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6688.304s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: ок
 Итак, что касается получения еще одной программы 40B, у нас теперь есть двухлетний безопасный порт.
 Мы не рассматриваем споры.
 Я имею в виду, что мы ведем переговоры с другими застройщиками о переносе проекта в Медфорд и его окрестностях и о том, как все будет работать.
 Итак, мы видим 40B, что является дружественным, но это будет совсем другая ситуация, потому что у них нет сил двигаться вперед и остановить нас.
 У них будет возможность выйти и завершить процессы 40B вместо установки разных зон.
 Да, потому что мы согласились позволить им пройти процесс 40B, потому что мы заинтересованы в доступном жилье 20%, 25% или 20% доступном жилье, и это то, что мы можем сделать, и я бы сказал, что это то, что мы можем обсудить с некоторыми застройщиками.
 Интересный вопрос для них заключается в том, может ли доступное жилье увеличить стоимость до такой степени, что конкретный проект, который они рассматривают, станет недоступным, и вместо того, чтобы просить разницу, вы можете согласиться, но у них будет юридическое доказательство.
 Они могут быть конкурентоспособными, на самом деле они привлекательны для вас более 40B и дружелюбны.
 Поэтому я просто хотел дать вам некоторую базовую информацию.
 Это была бы совсем другая ситуация.
 Я думаю, что в третьем 40Б я не уверен, смогут ли они вернуться назад или нет, что срок исковой давности таков, потому что дело приостановлено до вынесения решения КПЛ.
 Они не возвращались к нам уже шесть лет, а с момента урегулирования дела прошло около пяти или шести месяцев.
 Так что это действительно юридический вопрос, на который мы должны ответить.
 Поэтому я просто хочу дать вам контекст, в котором вы думаете об этих вещах.
 То, что поднял Эндрю, является долгосрочным вопросом.
 Этого не произойдет в ближайшие шесть месяцев или лет.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6835.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, это так.
 Я так понимаю, порт безопасности лишь расширяет основания для отклонения проекта Апелляционным судом.
 Так что он просто меняется динамически.
 Однако можно применить принцип порта безопасности 4 дБ.
 Что касается портов безопасности, то они, как правило, наиболее дружественны, поскольку плата может отклонить вас по многим причинам.
 Да, что угодно
 Затем председатель ждет закрытия заседания.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6880.275s">[Unidentified]</a>: Просьба завершить встречу.
 Понедельник.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6882.656s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Во-вторых, все в порядке.
 Давайте позвоним по телефону.

 Это верно.
 Эндрю?
 Это верно.

 Это верно.</p>
