    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=277.86s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  That's good.
 Thank you, Pat.
 Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.
 So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.
 So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.
 I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.
 So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.
 This is our current landscape plan.
 This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.
 So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.
 More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.
 uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.
 And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.
 We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.
 Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.
 So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.
 You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.
 So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.
 So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.
 So here you'll see our ground floor plan.
 This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.
 Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.
 We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.
 This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.
 In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.
 This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.
 So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.
 This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.
 We have our bike storage.
 We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.
 In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.
 The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.
 Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.
 This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.
 We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.
 Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.
 We'll probably have some fitness located up here.
 So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.
 The units are all encapsulated here.
 The yellow would be your studio units.
 The purple would be your one bed units.
 The green would be your two bed units.
 And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.
 So moving up a floor plan.
 So this would be our typical floor three through five.
 And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.
 That's our most typical plan for three floors.
 One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.
 you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.
 So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.
 And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.
 And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.
 So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.
 The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.
 We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.
 So jumping into the concept design image.
 So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.
 This is conceptual design.
 So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.
 So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.
 This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.
 In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.
 So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.
 So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.
 And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.
 And part of the reason for that is one,
 from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.
 You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.
 So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.
 But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.
 So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.
 So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.
 And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.
 So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.
 There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.
 Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.
 One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.
 You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.
 This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor
 gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.
 Here you can see we have the five-story piece.
 You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.
 Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.
 This north elevation is the elevation that's
 most facing Myrtle Street.
 So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.
 You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.
 Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.
 And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.
 You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.
 and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.
 We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.
 There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.
 And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.
 you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Fellsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.
 So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.
 And then just briefly the townhome elevations.
 So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.
 Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.
 And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.
 So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.
 You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.
 So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.
 Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.
 And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.
 We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.
 And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.
 And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.
 So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.
 And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.
 And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.
 So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
 All right, so shadow study.
 So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.
 So we're going to show three items here.
 We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.
 The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.
 And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.
 And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.
 And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.
 So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.
 And this is the 9 a.m.
 condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.
 So this is the existing condition at those times of year.
 And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.
 And so we also looked at it
 as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.
 So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.
 And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.
 and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.
 So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.
 And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.
 That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.
 on those adjacent properties.
 So it's not that until 10 a.m.
 you are in a cloud of darkness.
 There's a lot of space between the buildings.
 There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.
 There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.
 And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.
 So here you'll see the 9 a.m.
 condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.
 This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.
 So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.
 and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.
 And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.
 And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.
 For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.
 And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.
 The sun's a lot higher in the air.
 So you'll see a lot less shadow.
 And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.
 So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.
 summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.
 So it's about only a 15 minute difference.
 In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.
 From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.
 So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.
 So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.
 Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.
 Three, the potential rail trail connection here.
 Four, we have our internal courtyards.
 One's
 potentially a little bit more active with the pool.
 Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.
 Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.
 Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with
 you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.
 I think we've been improving that each step along the way.
 I think
 where we are now is much better than where we started.
 And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.
 And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.
 But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.
 And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.
 So that is all.
 I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.

 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​លើក​យក​បញ្ហា​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​មិន​បាន​ពិភាក្សា​ចេញ​ពី​កិច្ច​ប្រជុំ​កាល​ពី​សប្តាហ៍​មុន ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ជា​សូចនាករ​ដ៏​ល្អ​នៃ​របៀប​ដើម្បី​ឈាន​ទៅ​មុខ​ជាមួយ​នឹង​គម្រោង​សាងសង់។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារឿងមួយដែលយើងបាននិយាយ
 នេះគឺជាអាគារធំមួយ។
 ឥឡូវនេះកម្ពស់ទាំងអស់គឺដូចគ្នា។
 ខ្ញុំបានរកឃើញថា ចលនានៅផ្នែកខាងជើងមានប្រសិទ្ធភាពណាស់ក្នុងការរំលេចច្រកចូលចំហៀង ដែលពិតជាដំណើរការសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ចំណាំថាផ្នែកដែលនៅសេសសល់នៃផ្នែកខាងកើតនៃផ្នែកខាងមុខខាងជើងនេះក៏ជាកន្លែងសាធារណៈផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មាន​តម្លៃ​ក្នុង​ការ​ពិចារណា​ថា​តើ​ភាព​ខុស​គ្នា​ខ្លាំង​ជាង​នេះ​នៅ​ក្នុង​លំហ​នេះ​នឹង​មាន​ប្រយោជន៍។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាចំណុចមួយទៀតគឺទិដ្ឋភាពនិរន្តរភាពនៃស្ថាបត្យកម្ម។
 យើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីការព្យាបាលតាមបង្អួចស្រដៀងគ្នានៅទូទាំងអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា បាទ
 វាពិតជាផ្តល់រង្វាន់ក្នុងការបន្តឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីអាកប្បកិរិយាប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៅលើ facade របស់អគារ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​តាម​ពិត​មាន​វិធី​ខុស​គ្នា​ច្រើន​ក្នុង​ការ​ដោះស្រាយ​វា​អាស្រ័យ​លើ​ថាតើ​អ្នក​កំពុង​សម្លឹង​មើល​កម្ពស់​បែរ​មុខ​ទៅ​ទិស​ខាង​ជើង ឬ​កម្ពស់​បែរ​ទៅ​ទិស​ខាង​លិច។
 ប្រហែលជាវាទាក់ទងនឹងចម្ងាយពីបង្អួច។
 តោង​ជាប់​នឹង​ជញ្ជាំង ឬ​ដាក់​តាម​ផ្លូវ​ខ្យល់ វា​ជួយ​គ្រប់គ្រង​ពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យ។
 ប៉ុន្តែក្នុងករណីណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំលើកទឹកចិត្តឱ្យស្វែងរកវិធីធ្វើឱ្យអគារ facade ប្រសើរឡើងដោយមានការទទួលស្គាល់ ហើយដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ ពួកគេអាចអានអាកប្បកិរិយាប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៃ facade អគារតាមរបៀបណាមួយ។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំបានពិនិត្យមើលទំព័រទាំង 27 នៃការស្រាវជ្រាវស្រមោល។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ប្រាប់​គណៈកម្មាធិការ​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​រឿង​ទាំង​នោះ​ត្រឹមត្រូវ​ហើយ​ការ​រៀបចំ​គឺ​ត្រឹមត្រូវ​តាម​ចំណេះ​ដឹង​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះការវិភាគគុណភាពមុន និងក្រោយ ហើយបង្រួមវាទៅជាប្រធានបទស្រដៀងគ្នា។
 ទស្សនវិស័យ រយៈពេលនៃពេលវេលាដែលមានភាពខុសគ្នាដែលអាចវាស់វែងបានក្នុងការដាក់ស្រមោលក្នុងរយៈពេលមួយម៉ោងជាក់ស្តែង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជួយ​ដាក់​អ្វី​ៗ​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ទស្សនៈ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាឥឡូវនេះខ្ញុំ
 ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តនឹងលទ្ធផលនៃផែនការគេហទំព័រ។
 ភាព​ជាក់លាក់​នៅ​មិន​ទាន់​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​បាន​ពេញលេញ​នៅ​ឡើយ​ទេ​។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារូបថតនេះបង្ហាញពីរបៀបដែលការងារទាំងអស់ដែលបានធ្វើនៅផ្នែកខាងលិចនៃអគារបានប្រែក្លាយផ្លូវ Amaranth យ៉ាងពិតប្រាកដ។
 មានរូបភាពជាច្រើននៃអគារដែលយើងមិនទាន់បានឃើញ។
 តាមទស្សនៈរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំគិតថាការផ្តោតអារម្មណ៍ដែលអ្នកកំពុងឃើញនៅពេលនេះ គឺពិតជាទៅលើសម្ភារៈនៃស្ថាបត្យកម្ម និងរបៀបសម្រេចបាននូវមាត្រដ្ឋាន។
 ចាប់ផ្តើមយកចិត្តទុកដាក់លើអាគារខ្លួនឯង។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ទាន់​បាន​សរសេរ​អ្វី​នៅ​ឡើយ​ទេ ក្រៅ​ពី​កំណត់​ហេតុ​ខ្លី​មួយ​ដែល​សុំ​ភស្តុតាង​បន្ថែម។
 មូលហេតុ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ទាន់​សរសេរ​អ្វី​ក៏​ដោយ ព្រោះ​វា​បាន​ផ្លាស់​ប្តូរ។
 គម្រោង​នេះ​ពិតជា​បាន​ផ្លាស់ប្តូរ​ច្រើន​ណាស់ ហើយ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​មាន​ចំណុច​ណាមួយ​ក្នុង​ការ​ផ្តល់​យោបល់​របស់ខ្ញុំ​រហូត​ដល់​
 គាត់បានយល់ស្របថាអ្វីៗមានស្ថេរភាព ហើយថាពួកគេបានយកវិធីសាស្រ្តជាច្រើនទៅបទបង្ហាញចុងក្រោយ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកនឹងឃើញមតិយោបល់របស់ខ្ញុំបន្ថែមទៀតអំពីស្ថាបត្យកម្មនៃអគារ និងទីតាំងរបស់វា និងទីតាំងជាក់ស្តែងនៅលើគេហទំព័រ ក៏ដូចជាគំនិតដំបូងនៅលើសួនច្បារ ការអភិរក្ស និងការផ្សព្វផ្សាយរបស់វា។
 កន្លែងប្រើប្រាស់ចម្រុះ ឬទីធ្លាចំហរ ដែលបើកចំហសម្រាប់ទាំងសាធារណជន និងប្រជាពលរដ្ឋ ហាក់ដូចជាកន្លែងដ៏ល្អមួយ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1773.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أنا حقا بحاجة للإجابة على أي أسئلة.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 شكرا على التحديث.
 لذا، ماكورد، إنه فقط... نعم، هذا يبدو جيدًا.
 لذا، قبل أن أطرح سؤالاً في الاستشارة، أود أن أوضح شيئًا واحدًا: هل أفهم هذا بشكل صحيح؟
 إذا لم تسفر نتائج اجتماع اليوم عن تغييرات كبيرة في مخطط الموقع، فإن بعض المعروضات التي طلبتها، وربما تلك التي ستطلبها قريبًا، ستكون الآن هي الخطوة التالية.
 تسألهم ثم تنظر إليهم.
 سنتلقى بعد ذلك تعليقاتك التفصيلية حول العناصر الأخرى للبنية في الاجتماعات اللاحقة.
 لذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1819.794s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: هذا منطقي بالنسبة لي.
 لدي فكرة، لقد أدليت ببعض التعليقات الأسبوع الماضي حول التمثيل في الهندسة المعمارية.
 ولكن الأمر كله متروك لك حقًا.
 لهذا السبب أفضّل هذا النهج الإيقاعي.
 فليكن ذلك، ولكن نعم، خطوتي التالية، لنفترض أن الرأي العام والرأي العام، إذا انطبق على شعبك، سيساعد في إثراء المستوى التالي من تحليلي، والذي، كما قلت، يتعلق حقًا بأشياء مادية وأشياء أخرى، وقد قدمت بعض الملاحظات حول الوضع الحالي.
 بالنسبة لي، أقول ذلك بالتفصيل، ولكن أعتقد أنه من المهم أن يكون لدي كلماتي الخاصة، وهنا أبدأ مرة أخرى، مجرد إيجاد الطرق التي أعتقد أنها يمكن أن تساعد.
 أعتقد أنه في مبنى بهذا المقياس يجب أن يكون هناك نقاش حول كيفية جعل المقياس ذا معنى بالنظر إلى موقع المبنى.
 إذا كانت الجودة مناسبة والوضع على الموقع مناسب، فأعتقد أنك ستفهم المتغيرات حقًا.
 لا أعلم هل أجيب بشكل صحيح؟
 إذا لم أفعل هذا فأنا أعتذر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1918.027s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: كان الأمر واضحًا بالنسبة لي، لذلك اتفقنا.
 شكرا، كل شيء على ما يرام.
 ثم سأطرح سؤالاً على المجموعة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1928.413s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: نعم، مايك، هذا أندرو.
 اسأل كليف.
 أنا أنظر إلى هذا المبنى.
 هذه قطعة كبيرة وطويلة من القطيفة.
 إنه مجرد جدار صلب مكون من خمسة طوابق، لا يوجد شيء مميز.
 لقد مر وقت طويل وأعتقد حقًا أن بإمكانهم فعل المزيد لتفكيكه قليلاً حتى لا يبدو وكأنه جدار كبير.
 وأتساءل ما رأيك في هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1975.908s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: أنا أتفق وأوافق تماما.
 أعتقد أن أحد الأسباب التي دفعتني إلى طرح فكرة التمايز على أساس التوجه هو أنها إحدى الطرق للمساعدة في كسر كتلة كبيرة من اللامبالاة.
 هناك آخرون أيضا.
 قد تتضمن الاستراتيجيات التي تقدم المزيد من العناصر العمودية عددًا أقل من المداخل والمخارج على الواجهة، بالإضافة إلى بعض التغييرات المادية.
 لكنني أوافق.
 أعتقد أنه سيكون من المفيد اختيار إيقاع لتفكيك المبنى ومساعدته على التطور على طول الطريق.
 بالنسبة لي، هذا هو المكان الذي تبدأ منه.
 إذا كان الأساس يطابق المسافة التي تفصلك عن المسار وارتفاعك بالكامل، فابدأ في قطع الكتل للعثور على التوازن الصحيح.
 سيظل مبنى ضخمًا وليس هناك طريقة أخرى.
 ولكن هناك طرقًا لجعل هذا المقياس مناسبًا لك.
 أعتقد، كما تعلمون، أن الشواطئ، كما قلت، قد تكون في مجموعة ما.
 لا أقول أن الفريق أفقي، لكني أوافق على ذلك.
 تذكر أيضًا أن هذا المبنى قد حدث، لذلك أعتقد أنه من المهم تسليط الضوء على هذا المدخل وتغييره.
 توفر إحدى الفتحات إمكانية الوصول إلى خزانة العرض السفلية في الزاوية الشمالية وتؤدي إلى الغرب.
 وهذا يساعد كثيرًا، لكنه ليس كافيًا لتقسيم حجم الباقي بالكامل.
 هذه خطوة جيدة.
 أعتقد أنه سيكون من الجميل وضعه على جانب هذا المبنى.
 أنا موافق.
 أعتقد أنه كان هناك نقاش الأسبوع الماضي حول كيفية تحقيق التوازن بين المظهر الصناعي.
 أعني أن المبنى لا يزال بجوار المستودع على الجانب الشرقي، وهذا هو تاريخ المكان، فهو يستخدم للصناعة.
 ولكن في نفس الوقت ج.
 إذا نظرت إلى المبنى الفعلي، سترى أنه في الواقع امتداد.
 يبدو أنها مقسمة إلى أجزاء أصغر.
 لكن على أية حال أنصحك بالتفكير في الأمر الآن. ألقِ نظرة على بعض الطرق لتحليل حجم القفل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2163.382s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: نعم، أعني إريك، لا أعتقد أنك عرضت أي صور لمشاريعك الأخرى.
 لا أعرف إذا كنت تريد العودة إلى هذه الشريحة، ولكن.
 في هذا الوقت.
 كما تعلمون، هناك.
 كما هو الحال مع مودرا ميدفورد، هناك المزيد في المستقبل.
 إنه تقريبًا مثل مبنى آخر، أليس كذلك؟
 لذلك فكرت في ذلك.
 هذه الإستراتيجية مفيدة جدًا هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2195.203s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 لا أريد أن أقول إن عليّ أن أجادل ضد ذلك، لكني أريد أن أقول شيئًا واحدًا: من الصعب إحداث فرق أكبر في مبنى يحتوي على Passive House.
 كلما زاد عدد المداخل والمخارج التي تضعها في المبنى الرئيسي، والجدران الخارجية المربعة التي أضفتها إلى المبنى، زادت صعوبة تلبية المبنى لمتطلبات المنزل السلبي.
 لقد حدث لي شيء ما ونحن نتحدث عنه، كما تعلمون، تحدثنا عنه الأسبوع الماضي مع لجنة التخطيط وأليسيا ودانييل وبقية الفريق وكان الأمر كذلك
 اختار ميدفورد رمزًا متخصصًا.
 وهذا أمر يقلقنا كثيراً.
 هذا هو مستقبل تنظيم الطاقة في ولاية ماساتشوستس.
 لذلك، يجب أن يؤخذ في الاعتبار أن المزيد والمزيد من المشاريع سيتم ربطها بشكل أقل فأقل من أجل الامتثال لتشريعات الطاقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2251.474s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: هل يمكن أن توضح لي ما هو الكود القابل للتطوير؟
 أليس هذا مشابهًا لنموذج المنزل السلبي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2261.774s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: هذا ليس صحيحا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2262.635s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: إذن تعتقد أنك تجاوزت ذلك، أليس كذلك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2265.457s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: حسنًا، اختار ميدفورد رمز طاقة محددًا وهو أحد متطلبات المنزل السلبي.
 في ميدفورد، ليس لديك خيار سوى بناء منزل سلبي وفقًا لرمز الطاقة.
 وهذا مطلب جديد يجب أن تمتثل له جميع المشاريع المستقبلية.
 حسنا
 وهذا جديد بالنسبة لكثير من الناس.
 لقد كانت موجودة منذ فترة من الوقت ومعظمها في أوروبا، ولكنها ظهرت هنا أيضًا وأصبح المزيد والمزيد من الناس يعتادون عليها، لكن الأمر يستغرق وقتًا.
 كما تعلمون، عزل أفضل، كما تعلمون، عزل مستمر خارج المبنى، كفاءة عالية، نوافذ عالية الكفاءة، أنظمة ميكانيكية وكهربائية أفضل.
 عادةً مع المنزل السلبي، ستلاحظ توفيرًا بنسبة 90% أو حتى 90% في تكاليف الطاقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2320.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: شيء واحد أريد إضافته هو أنه كما أشار إريك، فإنهم يفعلون ذلك.
 ثلاثة مشاريع إسكان إيجابية وسلبية لمكتبك.
 لكنني سأعطي مثالا، لأننا نبني أيضا الكثير من المنازل السلبية.
 وكما تعلمون، إذا نظرتم إلى شكلها، فستجدونها نظامًا قائمًا على الأداء.
 وبهذه الطريقة، يمكن محاكاة النوافذ والطاقة بدقة.
 لذلك إذا كان لديك نوافذ كبيرة جدًا، يكون تحقيق العملية الحرارية المثالية أكثر صعوبة، وإذا وصلت إلى نقطة يمكن أن تتشكل فيها مفاصل متعددة، فسيتم تحويل العديد من المفاصل إلى جدران صلبة.
 وهذه الجدران سهلة العزل وتفعل ذلك بشكل جيد.
 على سبيل المثال، أعتقد أن إحدى الطرق لحل هذه المشكلة هي عدم استخدام نافذة كبيرة مثل تلك التي تظهرها.
 لذلك، إذا قمت بتقليل حجم النافذة قليلاً عند عرض العينة، فيمكنك الحصول على تأثير أكبر من المنطقة المحيطة.
 لذلك، أنا أتفق معك، هناك بعض الجوانب الصعبة للغاية بالنسبة للمنزل السلبي.
 النمذجة المستمرة لجميع وثائق البناء.
 لكنني لا أعتقد ذلك، أعتقد أننا بنينا حوالي 18 أو 19 منزلاً سلبيًا.
 أعتقد أنه يمكنك أن يكون لك رأي أكبر وأن تستوفي متطلبات المنزل السلبي.
 نحن نفعل هذا ونفعل هذا مع العديد من المباني.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2439.664s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: أعني، ما أود إضافته أيضًا هو أنني أحببت دائمًا الكثير من الشقق التي تتمتع بأكبر قدر ممكن من الخصوصية والشرفة.
 هذا ما سأفكر فيه.
 رأيت صورة مودرا ميدفورد مرة أخرى.
 كما تعلمون، يبدو لي أن الشرفة تبدو أخف مما هي عليه في الواقع.
 ربما فكر في كيفية استخدامها لهذا الغرض.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2480.297s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: إذا كان بإمكاني إضافة شيء واحد.
 أنا ممتن لأندريه على هذا السؤال.
 أعتقد أن ربط المباني هو طريقة أخرى لربطها بالبيئة الحالية.
 ليس حرفيًا، ولكنها طريقة رائعة للمساعدة في التمييز بين ارتفاعات المباني المختلفة.
 ماذا تفعل في الشمال؟
 نعم، لدينا شرفة مفتوحة على الجانب الغربي وهي أيضاً في الخلف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2517.24s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: باتون باتون، القصر الخاص بك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2520.463s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: آسف، أريد فقط الدخول.
 شكرا لك
 أريد فقط توضيح بعض النقاط حتى لا يرتبك مستخدمو المنتدى عند مناقشة Passive House.
 فقط لتوضيح بعض الأشياء التي ذكرها إريك حول خارطة الطريق بموجب قانون الطاقة المخصص.
 نحن لسنا جماعيين.
 يعتقد خبراء ترميز الطاقة أن هناك خيارات أخرى للمباني التجارية.
 ذكر إريك على وجه التحديد Passive House للأغراض السكنية.
 لذلك لا أريد أن ينقل مجلس الإدارة أفكارنا إلى جمهور مختلف ويسبب ارتباكًا في المستقبل.
 أريد فقط توضيح هذا الأمر للجميع.
 هذا نحن.
 بصراحة، كنا متحمسين لذلك، مرددين ما قاله إريك.
 هذا هو المشروع الفصلي الثالث لشركة Davis، وهي شركة رائدة في تصميم وبناء المنازل السلبية في ماساتشوستس.
 نحن نتطلع إلى هذه الفرصة ونواصل تثقيف أنفسنا واستخدام عملية التصميم هذه كفرصة.
 لكني أريد فقط التأكيد على أن هذا للاستخدام المنزلي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2593.618s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: هذه نقطة جيدة.
 مراقبة
 شكرا لك
 السيد تان، من فضلك تحدث.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2600.157s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: شكرا سيدي الرئيس.
 بناءً على ما قاله بات، أعتقد أنه إذا كان أعضاء LaRue مهتمين حقًا ويركزون على زيادة مستويات القطيفة، أعتقد أنه يمكننا حقًا التركيز على ذلك كما أعتقد أن الآخرين يستطيعون ذلك.
 ومن الواضح أن التقدم الذي نشهده يستغرق الكثير من الوقت.
 لكن إذا كان LaRue قلقًا بشأن جانب القطيفة، فأنا لا أرى سببًا لعدم قدرتنا على قضاء الكثير من الوقت على إريك وكليف في محاولة التحسين.
 وهذا دليل على المفهوم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2653.145s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 أندرو، هل قلت أن اهتمامك الرئيسي هو جانب القطيفة، أو فيما يتعلق بواجهة المبنى، الجانب الشمالي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2665.248s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: أريد أن أرى المزيد من العمل في هذا الشأن، كما تعلمون، على جميع المستويات، كما قال كليف.
 أعتقد أن قسم أمارانث مثير للاهتمام بشكل خاص بالنسبة لي لأنه توجد مناطق سكنية عبر الشارع وهو فقط...
 كما تعلمون، إنه يشبه في بعض النواحي جدار الواجهة، حيث لا يوجد شيء غير عادي.
 كما تعلمون، من الواضح أن هناك نفس الشيء على الجانب الشرقي، وهناك جدار آخر يمر عبر مبنى المستودع.
 لذلك أعتقد
 قد تحتاج إلى علاج مناسب لك.
 وهذا سيكون ما تراه على طول الطريق.
 لذلك أعتقد أن التحديث بأكمله قد يستحق القليل من العمل الإضافي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2719.771s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 هل لدى المجلس أي أسئلة أو تعليقات؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2728.738s">[Mary Lee]</a>: هل يحتوي المبنى على ألواح شمسية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2739.42s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لا أعرف، بات، إذا كنت تريد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2741.942s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 هذا صحيح.
 هذا صحيح.
 آسف
 يمكنني التدخل في هذه المرحلة.
 نحن لا ندرس عن قصد.
 أعتقد أن هذا ما ناقشناه.
 حسنًا، من الممكن إدراج ذلك في المشروع، لكننا لم نعرضه بعد.
 وهذا ليس شيئًا يمكننا تحليله بالتفصيل.
 كما تعلمون، من حيث الاحتمالات، إذا كان منظورًا من سطح أو مكان آخر في الموقع، أو نوع ما من المنظور المعماري.
 كما تعلمون، العوامل الأخرى التي تؤثر على المشروع، سواء كانت تكاليف التصميم أو أي شيء آخر، هي عوامل حقيقية.
 هذه إجابة مفتوحة وهذا هو موضوع مناقشتنا.
 ما زلنا لا نملك إجابة واضحة حول ما إذا كنا نخطط لاستخدام الطاقة الشمسية في هذا المشروع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2797.862s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: واستمرارًا لما قالته ماري، أعتقد أنه في مرحلة ما ذكر الناس أيضًا أشياء مثل الأسطح أو الأسطح الخضراء.
 سيكون من المثير للاهتمام أن نرى كيف ستبدو معالجة السقف، خاصة وأن هناك حوالي 5 و 6 طوابق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2821.773s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أنه يمكننا الاستمرار في تحسين التصميم وإدراج العناصر التي تعكس تأثير السقف.
 أعتقد أنه ربما من أجل إزالة بعض الالتباس، أعتقد أن ما نسميه الآن بالسقف الأخضر سيكون في فناء الطابق الثاني الذي يمكن رؤيته من موقف السيارات في بعض مخططات الطوابق لدينا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2856.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: شكرا لك
 هل لدى المجلس أي أسئلة أو تعليقات؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2868.589s">[Mary Lee]</a>: في رأيي، هذه مجرد مسودة تقريبية؟
 أم أقول أين وصلنا من هذا البرنامج هل هذا البرنامج مكتمل بنسبة 90% أم مكتمل بنسبة 70%؟
 لأنني أميل إلى الاتفاق مع أندريه لأن الانطباع الأول الذي يتركه عندما أرى هذه الصورة هو أنها تعطيني انطباعًا بوجود مستودع وليس شقة.
 هذا هو الانطباع الأول.
 لكنني أعتقد أنه من الواضح أنه إذا لم تكن هذه هي الخطة الكاملة، فقد لا يزال هناك مجال.
 إجراء تغييرات.</p>

 ខ្ញុំគិតថាទាំងនេះគឺហួសពីស្តង់ដារមូលដ្ឋាននៅដំណាក់កាលនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នក និងក្រុមរបស់អ្នកយល់ថាយើងអាចកែលម្អ និងផ្តល់ព័ត៌មានលម្អិតបន្ថែមទៀត។
 ជាឧទាហរណ៍ នៅពេលដែលលោក LaRue បានសួរខ្ញុំអំពីការព្យាបាលដំបូល យ៉ាងហោចណាស់តាមគំនិត យើងអាចឃើញថា យើងគិតថានឹងមានគ្រឿងបរិក្ខារផ្សេងៗនៅលើដំបូល យ៉ាងហោចណាស់តាមគំនិត។
 ចង់​ឃើញ​ចំណុច​ពិសេស
 យើងអាចយកឈ្នះពួកគេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងសង្ឃឹមថានឹងធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នកដើម្បីផ្តល់នូវការព្យាករណ៍លម្អិតបន្ថែមទៀត និងធាតុលក្ខខណ្ឌគម្រោងនាពេលអនាគត។
 ដូច្នេះនៅកម្រិតអាជ្ញាប័ណ្ណពេញលេញនេះ អ្នកនឹងមិនអាចទទួលបាន 100% នៃគំនូររចនានោះទេ។
 ជាដើម ប៉ុន្តែគំនិតដែលបានបង្ហាញក្នុងកម្រិតធំជាងនេះ គឺផ្តោតលើផ្នែករសើបទាំងនេះ ដូចជា amaranth ជាដើម។
 នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​អាច​ផ្តោត​លើ ប៉ុន្តែ​វា​នៅ​តែ​ស្ថិត​ក្នុង​កម្រិត​បឋម។
 មានតែតាមរយៈការទទួលបានលិខិតអនុញ្ញាតសាងសង់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ ទើបអ្នកអាចធានាបាននូវគម្រោងចុងក្រោយ ហើយការសម្រេចចិត្តរបស់អ្នកនឹងឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីបញ្ហានេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​ប្រាប់​ជាមុន​ថា​តើ​យើង​មាន​លក្ខណៈ​ជាក់លាក់​ប៉ុណ្ណា។
 នៅក្នុងទីក្រុងជាច្រើន និងគម្រោងជាច្រើន ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថានៅក្នុងគម្រោងផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុង Medford កម្រិតនៃការរចនាគំនិតនេះនឹងមានលក្ខណៈសមរម្យសម្រាប់ការត្រួតពិនិត្យ និងការអនុម័តពេញលេញនៃលិខិតអនុញ្ញាត។
 ជាក់ស្តែង យើងចង់ដោះស្រាយកង្វល់របស់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សានៅក្នុងមតិសាធារណៈណាមួយ ហើយនឹងបន្តធ្វើដូច្នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាឧទាហរណ៍ ផែនការសាងសង់ដែលត្រូវបានពិនិត្យដោយ Eric គឺគ្រប់គ្រាន់សម្រាប់ការអនុម័តនៅដំណាក់កាលនេះ។
 អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​កំពុង​និយាយ​គឺ​ការ​ចាប់​អារម្មណ៍​តាម​ប្រធានបទ និង​ការ​រចនា​សោភ័ណភាព ហើយ​យើង​កំពុង​នាំមុខ​ក្នុង​ជំហាន​នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេវានឹងមិនមានកម្រិតនៃការធ្វើផែនការនោះទេ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់បានព័ត៌មានលម្អិតបន្ថែមអំពីលក្ខណៈពិសេស និងធាតុផ្សំនៃការរចនា យើងនឹងព្យាយាមឱ្យអស់ពីសមត្ថភាពដើម្បីផ្តល់ពួកវាសម្រាប់អ្នក។
 បាទ/ចាស យើងនឹងមិនបញ្ចូលឯកសារសំណង់ជាផ្នែកនៃរឿងនេះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារឿងមួយទៀតគឺការចាប់អារម្មណ៍ថានេះគឺជាអគារឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 បាទ មាន​អគារ​ឧស្សាហកម្ម​មួយ​និង​ការ​បោះ​ជំហាន​របស់​វា។
 នេះគឺជាសួនឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 មាន​ឃ្លាំង​ឧស្សាហកម្ម​នៅ​ក្បែរ​នោះ។
 ដូចដែល Eric បាននិយាយ យើងបានខ្ចីការរចនានេះពីបច្ចេកទេសទាំងនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា មនុស្ស​ម្នាក់ៗ​នឹង​មាន​យោបល់​រៀង​ខ្លួន។
 គំនិតផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺថាវាមើលទៅដូចជា 40B ផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវបានអនុម័ត និងសាងសង់ដោយទីក្រុង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3166.823s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 شكرا لك
 لدي سؤال محدد لكليف بومر.
 أريد فقط أن أتأكد من تسوية كل شيء الليلة حتى إذا كان هناك أي صراع، يمكننا أن نكون جميعًا على نفس الصفحة.
 لذلك نحن نتحدث عن المشاكل.
 لقد ناقشنا بالفعل مسألة الاتصال.
 ناقشنا التفاصيل المتبقية في المنظر من السقف.
 سيد بومر، هل لديك أي توقعات محددة بخصوص تفاصيل التعديل الذي لا ينطبق اليوم؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3210.995s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: បាទ នោះជាសំណួរដ៏ល្អ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនអាចឆ្លើយលម្អិតបានទេ។
 អនុញ្ញាតឱ្យខ្ញុំសម្រាក។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ការ​លើក​ឡើង​របស់​មេធាវី Tan គឺ​សម​ហេតុ​ផល​ព្រោះ​ច្បាប់​ខ្លួន​ឯង​និយាយ​អំពី​ការ​ធ្វើ​ផែនការ​បឋម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលយើងកំពុងឃើញនៅក្នុងបេក្ខជននេះគឺជាឆន្ទៈ
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ភាគី​ទាំង​អស់​យល់​ស្រប​ថា​ទាំង​នេះ​គឺ​ជា​ការ​កែលម្អ​អគារ។
 ដូច្នេះតាមទស្សនៈរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំគិតថានេះជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំមានបញ្ហាខ្លះជាមួយ Time សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ របៀបដែលអគារឆ្លើយតបទៅនឹងបរិបទបច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់វា និងសម្របខ្លួនទៅនឹងគំរូនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍ទាក់ទងនឹងសោភ័ណភាព។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាមានកាតព្វកិច្ចនៅលើ facade សំខាន់ដែលប្រឈមមុខនឹងដែនសាធារណៈ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ពិត​ជា​ចូល​ចិត្ត​គោល​គំនិត​ភស្តុតាង​នៃ​គោល​គំនិត​ដែល​មេធាវី​បាន​លើក​ឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របទាំងស្រុងនឹងរឿងនេះ។ ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​អ្វី​ដែល​គណៈកម្មការ​ត្រូវ​ដឹង​គឺ​រូបភាព​ដែល​គេ​បាន​ឃើញ
 ដាក់វានៅកន្លែងល្អ ហើយបង្ហាញថាអ្វីមួយកំពុងដំណើរការក្នុងទិសដៅត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ពួកគេមិនបង្កើតកម្រិតលម្អិតខ្ពស់ទេ។
 នោះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលពួកគេត្រូវបានស្នើឱ្យធ្វើ ហើយពួកគេមិនគួរត្រូវធ្វើ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​តាម​គំនិត​ខ្ញុំ ផែនការ​ដំបូល និង​ការ​ដាក់​ឧបករណ៍​មេកានិក​គឺ​សំខាន់។
 តើយើងមិនមើលឧបករណ៍មេកានិចទេ?
 គ្រប់គ្រាន់
 ការពារពីដែនសាធារណៈ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ឃើញ​ជាន់​ផ្ទាល់​ដី​បន្ថែម​ទៀត​ដែល​មាន​ចំណត​រថយន្ត​នៅ​លើ​ផ្ទៃ​ដែល​ទាក់ទង​នឹង​ផ្នែក​ខាង​លិច​នៃ​អគារ។
 នោះហើយជាវា។
 ដូចជាខ្ញុំចង់ឃើញ អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចង់ឃើញគឺ ខ្ញុំគិតថារាល់ពេលដែលពួកគេធ្វើនោះ ពួកគេបង្ហាញថាពួកគេកំពុងស្តាប់អ្វីដែលអ្នកកំពុងនិយាយ។
 បន្ទាប់មកខ្ញុំនឹងរង់ចាំការវិភាគស៊ីជម្រៅបន្ថែមទៀត
 សោភ័ណភាពនៃអគារ ប៉ុន្តែរបៀបដែលពួកគេជួយអគារបញ្ចូលគ្នា ឬស្វែងរកតុល្យភាពត្រឹមត្រូវរវាងរូបរាងឧស្សាហកម្ម ប៉ុន្តែប្រហែលជានៅតែទាក់ទងនឹងចង្វាក់ និងទំហំជុំវិញមួយចំនួន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនអាចទេ វាជាការលំបាកសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំក្នុងការសង្ខេបអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងនៅក្នុងតែមួយ ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំមានពេលដើម្បីសរសេរកំណត់ចំណាំ តើខ្ញុំរំពឹងអ្វី?
 ដូចគ្នានេះផងដែរ យ៉ាងហោចណាស់នៅកម្រិតដែលខ្ញុំបានឃើញនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍ជាច្រើន ជាពិសេសប្រសិនបើមានបេក្ខជនដែលចង់ធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា វា​នឹង​ជា​ឱកាស​មួយ​ដែល​ខកខាន ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួក​គេ​មិន​បាន​បន្ត​ស្មារតី​នេះ ហើយ​ពិចារណា​អំពី​គំនិត​មួយ​ចំនួន​សម្រាប់​ការ​បញ្ចប់​ម៉ាស់។
 ក៏ដូចជាការផ្តល់គ្រឿងសិប្បកម្មជាមូលដ្ឋានមួយចំនួនទៀត។
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយផែនការដំបូលមានសារៈសំខាន់ក្នុងករណីនេះពីព្រោះយើងត្រូវដឹងពីអ្វីដែលអាចមើលឃើញពីផ្លូវ។
 ប្រសិនបើមតិនោះមិនត្រឹមត្រូវ នោះខ្ញុំមិនលើកទឹកចិត្តក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលឱ្យធ្វើការសម្រេចចិត្តដោយផ្អែកលើមតិនោះឡើយ រហូតទាល់តែខ្ញុំជឿថាបេក្ខជនពិតជាមានកាតព្វកិច្ច។
 បង្ហាញរូបភាពយ៉ាងត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ពួកគេពិតជាតំណាងឱ្យអ្វីមួយដែលជិតស្និទ្ធទៅនឹងអ្វីដែលសភា និងសាធារណជននឹងឃើញនៅពេលដែលវាត្រូវបានសាងសង់ពិតប្រាកដ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងត្រូវកំណត់អត្តសញ្ញាណពួកគេខ្លះ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​លើក​ទឹក​ចិត្ត​អ្នក​ឱ្យ​ត្រឡប់​មក​វិញ​ជាមួយ​នឹង​គំនិត​មួយ​ចំនួន​អំពី​របៀប​ធ្វើ​រឿង​នេះ។
 ស្វែងយល់បន្ថែមអំពីប្រភេទអគារ។
 ចំពោះដើមឈើ ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របថា ពួកវានៅជិតគ្នាណាស់ ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលខ្ញុំនិយាយនៅដើមដំបូង ខ្ញុំមិនធ្វើទេ ព្រោះខ្ញុំផ្តោតខ្លាំងលើការធ្វើផែនការទីតាំង ខ្ញុំមិនមើលប្លង់គេហទំព័រឱ្យលម្អិតទេ ប៉ុន្តែវាស្ថិតក្នុងកម្រិតដែលខ្ញុំឃើញជាធម្មតា ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាចាប់ពីចំណុចនេះតទៅ ដូចជាវត្ថុបុរាណ។
 ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំរកឃើញការបំពានលេខកូដធ្ងន់ធ្ងរ អ្នកគួរតែរំពឹងថានឹងមានការឆ្លើយតបពីខ្ញុំ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ កម្រិតនេះក៏ជាប្រភេទនៃការពិតមួយដែរ ដែលអ្វីដែលអ្នកឃើញនៅក្នុងដ្យាក្រាមគឺពិតជាអាចធ្វើទៅបានតាមលក្ខណៈជាក់លាក់ ហើយខ្ញុំចង់ផ្តល់ឱកាសក្នុងការធ្វើអត្ថាធិប្បាយលើវា។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងចង្អុលបង្ហាញ ហើយខ្ញុំក៏ដឹងថា ស្ថាបត្យករក៏ដឹងដែរ
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំប្រាកដថា Pat Newton ដឹងហើយថាមានតម្រូវការកូដអគារនៅលើដំបូលពិតប្រាកដ ដើម្បីធានាថាអគារអាចបំប្លែងទៅជាពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យនៅលើដំបូលនាពេលអនាគត ហើយទោះបីជាមិនមានឥឡូវនេះក៏ដោយ ក៏នៅតែមានតម្រូវការដែលដំបូលត្រូវបានរចនាឡើងជារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធដើម្បីផ្ទុកពួកគេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកអភិវឌ្ឍន៍ទាំងអស់សព្វថ្ងៃនេះនឹងធានាថាពួកគេមានលទ្ធភាពគ្រប់គ្រាន់ទៅកាន់បន្ទប់អគ្គិសនីដើម្បីដំឡើងបន្ទះស្រូបពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យទោះបីជាពួកគេមិនត្រូវបានដំឡើងក្នុងអំឡុងពេលដំណើរការសាងសង់ដំបូងក៏ដោយ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ចំណាយ​ពេល​បន្តិច ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​រីករាយ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ត្រៀម​ខ្លួន​ជា​ស្រេច។
 អនុស្សរណៈអំពីរឿងសំខាន់ៗដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាអាចនឹងបាត់បង់ក្នុងការផ្សព្វផ្សាយភស្តុតាងនៃគំនិត។
 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាខ្ញុំមានពេលវេលាដើម្បីគិតអំពីរឿងនេះទាក់ទងនឹងសម្ភារៈថ្មី។
 ប៉ុន្តែលើសពីនេះទៅទៀត ខ្ញុំសូមផ្តល់អនុសាសន៍ឱ្យធ្វើការស្រាវជ្រាវបន្ថែមទៀត ដើម្បីហួសពីគោលគំនិតនៃរបៀបរក្សាតុល្យភាព
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយពីមុនមក បាទ អេមីរ៉ាតនីមួយៗឥឡូវនេះមានទីក្រុងពាណិជ្ជកម្មមួយ ប៉ុន្តែតាមពិតទៅវាមានទម្រង់ស្មុគស្មាញ គួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ ចម្រុះ និងច្បាស់លាស់។
 នេះជាទិដ្ឋភាពទីក្រុងកាន់តែប្រសើរ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​អ្នក​មាន​ឱកាស​បាន​មើល​ទិដ្ឋភាព​ដ៏​ស្រស់​ស្អាត​នៃ​ទីក្រុង ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​នៅ​ទីនោះ
 ប្រសិនបើយើងក្រឡេកមើលកង្វល់មួយចំនួនដែលយើងបានឮនៅយប់នេះ សូមលើកវាមួយជុំទៀត ដើម្បីឈានទៅរកគោលដៅផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់អ្នក។
 ដូច្នេះ សូមអភ័យទោស ប្រសិនបើនេះជារង្វង់បន្តិច ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនអាចទេ អ្នកដឹងទេថា ក្នុងសេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍មួយ តើអ្វីជាសេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍មួយទៀត?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3669.292s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، سأصل قريباً.
 وتظهر السجلات أن المحامي كريستوفر ألبين هو محامي PND.
 نعم، يرجى الاستمرار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3677.017s">[SPEAKER_16]</a>: نعم، أتفق مع تعليقات تام وكليف بأنهما يبدوان كرسومات وخطط معمارية جميلة مدرجة في 40ب.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3690.346s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: يعد التصميم جانبًا مهمًا وأعتقد أن لدى كليف فرصة جيدة لتقييمه بشكل شامل ويبدو أن المرشح يستجيب لتعليقاته.
 حسنًا، تقع على عاتق المجلس مسؤولية التأكد من أن المشروع مقبول، ولكن الأهم من ذلك، أننا نحتاج إلى مراعاة الجوانب الأكثر تقنية للمشروع عند التقدم للحصول على الإذن الكامل.
 نحن نتحدث عن التأثيرات على الخدمات العامة مثل نقل مياه الأمطار والهندسة المدنية.
 وأنا متأكد من أن المجلس يعرف ذلك.
 أنا متأكد من أن المرشح يعرف ذلك.
 لا أستطيع إلا أن أفترض أن هذه النصيحة لن تدخل في مناقشات مطولة مع جمهور التصميم العام.
 وكما تعلمون، نحن في الموعد المحدد.
 نبدأ في النظر في الجوانب الأكثر تقنية للمشروع.
 أعتقد أننا حققنا الكثير من التقدم فيما يتعلق بالتصميم، وهذا ما أعتقده.
 الآن أعتقد أنه إذا كان لديك أي اقتراحات، فأنت تعلم أن هناك بعض الأشياء التي قد ترغب في أخذها في الاعتبار.
 تغييرات في التصميم، وربما تحديثات وإضافات من كليف، ثم ربما حان الوقت لنقول، "حسنًا، نحن بحاجة إلى إلقاء نظرة على البناء، نحتاج إلى النظر إلى العواصف، نحتاج إلى النظر إلى حركة المرور."</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3770.168s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، بفضل المحامي إلفين.
 الغرض من اجتماعي اليوم هو أن يوضح مجلس الإدارة عناصر التصميم المتبقية لأنه يريد رؤية المزيد من التفاصيل أو التغييرات.
 لقد تلقينا تفاصيل عن حالته من باومر.
 وأنا أتفق مع الرأي العام
 وسأقدر أيضًا هذه المذكرة في المستقبل القريب.
 لذا، إذا كان بوسعك أن ترسل لنا نسخة من Cliff's، فسوف نقدر ذلك حقًا.
 لكنني أسمع، كما تعلمون، المزيد من التفاصيل حول السقف، وتفاصيل حول أهمية الاقتراحات من الاستشاريين والطلبات من نفسك.
 باومر يتحدث عن الإستراتيجية الصحيحة لإنهاء الكتلة.
 سمعت التفاصيل أدناه.
 أعتقد أن هذه هي الأجزاء الرئيسية التي تهمني.
 نعم، كما علق باومر على الخطة.
 إنهم قريبون جدًا.
 يبدو أن لديك بالفعل معظم المعلومات التي تحتاجها، ولكننا نريد فقط أن نفكر في الأمر.
 لذلك أعتقد أنه يمكننا عقد اجتماع تصميم آخر حيث يمكن أخذ كل هذه الأشياء في الاعتبار.
 لكنني أتفق مع المحامي ألفين.
 لا يمكننا أن نترك هذا كمشروع لا نهاية له.
 في التقويم يمكن أن يكون لدينا
 لا يزال لدينا مجال لاجتماع تصميم آخر وبعد ذلك سيتعين علينا اتخاذ بعض القرارات للوصول إلى الجدول الزمني.
 الآن دعنا ننتقل إلى الاجتماع التالي المقرر بعد أسبوعين، إلا إذا
 حسنًا، إن التغييرات المطلوبة أو مسألة إنشاء المستندات اللازمة هي في الواقع جوهر الهندسة.
 حسنًا، حتى نتمكن من مناقشة ما إذا كان يجب إجراء تغييرات بناءً على مناقشة اليوم، ولكن نعم، نحن بحاجة إلى دمج التصميم حتى نتمكن من القيام بذلك أيضًا.
 توفير معلومات كافية عن العوامل الفنية حتى يتمكن مجلس الإدارة من تقييم كل ما نحتاج إلى تقييمه ضمن الإطار الزمني الذي يتطلبه القانون.
 كانت هذه نيتي.
 يرجى الاستمرار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3927.624s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: لا، أريدك فقط أن تعرف شيئًا آخر، أم.
 أوه، خطة الكلمة.
 إنها مهمة، ومن الجيد أن كليف ينظر إليها، ولكن الحقيقة هي، مع الموافقة الكاملة، يمكن تغيير هذه الخطط بمجرد اتخاذ القرار، سواء كانت مبنية على، أم، أم، اتفاقية إدارة للتفتيش الحكومي، أو ما إذا كان الهيكل الذي يبنونه يمكن تغييره طالما أنه ليس تغييرًا كبيرًا، وفي كثير من الأحيان لا يكون تعديلًا.
 عندما تنظر إلى التعديلات الأساسية، يمكنك عادةً البدء بـ 40B.
 لا ينبغي أن تقضي الكثير من الوقت في قضايا مثل مخططات الطوابق وأبعاد الشقق.
 هناك غرف بها غرف وما إلى ذلك. ولكن هذا مجرد جانب يمكن التحكم فيه اعتمادًا على الاحتياجات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3984.346s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: لو كان بوسعي، سيدي الرئيس.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3988.356s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، أندريه، من فضلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3990.077s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: أعني، أريد فقط أن أشير إلى أننا مررنا بعملية ترخيص 40 ب أخرى قبل بضعة أشهر حيث ناقشنا بعض المشاريع الرئيسية بالتفصيل وأعتقد أن ذلك سيؤدي إلى مشروع أفضل للمجتمع.
 أعتقد أننا ورثنا حجم هذا المشروع.
 صدقني، لو قمت بإعادة التشغيل، لم أكن لأرسم مستطيلًا عملاقًا في وسط الكتلة.
 لكنني أعتقد أن علينا مسؤولية بذل كل ما في وسعنا لتأمين هذا المشروع.
 حجمها مهم حقًا ومتكامل بأفضل طريقة ممكنة.
 أما أنا فلا نتحدث.
 نحن لا نحلل أو نناقش قضايا وقوف السيارات حقًا.
 لم نناقش عدد أماكن وقوف السيارات بعد.
 نحن لا نتحدث عن عدد أجهزة الشحن للسيارات الكهربائية.
 نحن لا نتحدث عن التطبيقات الأفقية.
 وبصرف النظر عن جميع المسائل التقنية التي ذكرتها، فإن الأمر لا يتعلق بالفن العام.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن أرفع العلم وأقول إن هذا شيء يجب أن نتحدث عنه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4065.017s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا أندرو.
 ربما أتذكر بشكل غير صحيح.
 أعتقد أن بعض المناقشات التي دارت في جلسات الاستماع الأخيرة حول مواقف السيارات والكراسي المتحركة كانت مرتبطة بالهندسة، لكنني أوافق تمامًا على أنها تحتاج بالتأكيد إلى مناقشتها، بالإضافة إلى تنسيق الحدائق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4082.101s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: كيف يدخل الناس ويخرجون؟
 كيف تدخل القمامة وتخرج؟
 كل هذه الأشياء.
 آخر 40 مليار عمل قمنا به كان التقدم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4092.67s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، لكن على ما أذكر، تخرج 40ب من كلية الهندسة المدنية.
 قد أكون مخطئا، ولكن نعم، إذا كان المرشح لا ينوي تقديم هذه البيانات، فإنه يخطط لتقديمها.
 المجلس يحتاج إلى هذه التفاصيل.
 أعتقد أنها مهمة جدًا لعمل المبنى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4118.096s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: قطعاً.
 تم تضمين بعض هذه المعلومات في مخطط الطابق الخاص بنا، والذي تم تضمينه أيضًا في هذه الحزمة.
 ويسعدني الإجابة على أي أسئلة حول هذا الموضوع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4130.222s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، أعتقد في الوقت الراهن.
 ولعلنا نتساءل بالطبع.
 هل تخططون لمناقشة هذه القضية بالتفصيل في جلسات الاستماع المستقبلية؟
 أم أنك تريد من مجلس الإدارة أن يطرح أسئلة محددة ثم يجيب عليها بهذه الطريقة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4150.809s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، هل لي أن أتحدث نيابة عن شركة ديفيس؟
 أعتقد
 أعتقد أننا سمعناك بوضوح وسننتقل إلى الاجتماع التالي. وبصرف النظر عن القضايا المدنية، يمكننا أيضًا مناقشة وتحديد بعض هذه القضايا التشغيلية.
 أو ضعنا من حيث الموقع (على الأقل من حيث تخزين البايت) لموقف السيارات العام الذي يدفع ثمن الفن.
 يمكننا مناقشة خطط المناظر الطبيعية وبعض القضايا التشغيلية ذات الصلة.
 إذا كان هناك شيء غير مكتمل، يمكننا إنشاء معيار.
 كما تعلمون، إذا كان الأمر يتعلق بالحجم أو الحجم التقريبي، فمن المحتمل أن يكون جزءًا من الشرط.
 وهذا مناسب لهذا المستوى من التصميم.
 ومع ذلك، فإننا لن نغفل عن ذلك، وأعتقد أننا سنرغب في مراجعة مذكرة Cliff ووضع اللمسات النهائية على تفاصيل التصميم الإضافية بناءً على تعليقاته واقتراحاته.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4220.455s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 أندرو، هل يمكنك على الأقل تخفيف بعض مخاوفك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4227.229s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: حسنًا، بصرف النظر عن التأييد، أريد الترويج لجميع الأفكار التي سننظر فيها بشكل كامل.
 أعلم أنه سيكون لدينا اجتماع قريبًا لمناقشة قضايا أخرى، لكن هذه هي الأشياء التي أتحدث عنها وأريد أن نناقشها، وإذا لزم الأمر، الشروط.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4254.242s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: فقط أجب.
 فقط أجب بوضوح، سنحاول حل كل نقطة.
 لقد سمعناهم من قبل.
 لقد ناقشنا بعض هذه القضايا، وكما لاحظتم، فإن مواقف السيارات هي قضية أعتقد أننا تناولناها بعمق في الاجتماعات السابقة.
 ونحن نتطلع إلى مراجعة كاملة.
 وأعتقد أننا حققنا هذه النتيجة واستفدنا كثيرا منذ بدء المراجعة الكاملة.
 لكن أنا...
 ما أعنيه هو أنه في كثير من الحالات هناك عوامل ذات صلة.
 خطرت لي فكرة الفن العام.
 ولن نحتاج إلى معرفة مستوى التفاصيل عند تقديم هذا القرار إلى مجلس الإدارة.
 لكن يمكننا في الواقع وضع بعض المعايير لذلك.
 أعتقد أن هذا ما اقترحه لاو رور.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4315.214s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 سأقوم بالاتصال بأعضاء مجلس الإدارة في هذا الوقت لمعرفة ما إذا كان هناك أي أسئلة أو تعليقات أخرى.
 وبعد النظر في أسئلة وتعليقات المجلس، أنوي أن أترك الفرصة للمناقشة العامة لتصميم هذه الأفكار.
 لكن أولاً، أريد التأكد من أنه إذا كان لدى أعضاء مجلس الإدارة أسئلة أو تعليقات إضافية، فستتاح لهم الفرصة للاستماع إليهم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4345.665s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: ليس لدي أي مشاكل.
 لدي رأي واحد فقط وأنا أؤيد تماما ما يقوله ويقوله أندريه.
 وليس هو فقط.
 لذلك أريد فقط التأكد من أننا واضحون.
 وأعتقد أن أغلب أعضاء المجلس سيتفقون معه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4364.47s">[Unidentified]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 وأنا أوافق أيضا.
 أتوقع أن تكون هذه العناصر عملاً مدنيًا في المقام الأول.
 عنصر آخر أود إضافته إلى هذه القائمة هو مشروع الإضاءة.
 هناك أيضًا نقاط فنية أثارها محامٍ آخر.
 هذا هو الهدف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4385.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 شكرا على التوضيح.
 لدي أيضا مثل هذه التوقعات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4390.872s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: فهل هذا لقاء اليوم أم لقاء في المستقبل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4398.054s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: إذا فهمت الأمر بشكل صحيح، فإننا نعتزم الكشف عن هذه التفاصيل في الاجتماع القادم.
 شكرا، كل شيء على ما يرام.
 هل لدى أي من أعضاء مجلس الإدارة أي أسئلة أو تعليقات؟
 ولم ير الرئيس شيئا، في انتظار خطاب عام حول مفهوم المشروع.
 انتقلت.
 الاثنين.
 هل لدي واحدة ثانية؟
 الاثنين.
 لذلك دعونا نجري مكالمة.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4672.525s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 لذلك، أتذكر وسوف أتأكد من أننا نناقش هذا الأمر في الجزء المدني من العملية.
 لأن هذه ليست المشكلة هنا.
 أعني، إذا أراد المرشحون التحدث قليلاً عن هذا الأمر، فسيكون ذلك موضع ترحيب، لكنني لا أتوقع منهم الرد.
 لكنني أعتقد أن هذا ما سنقوله في الجزء المدني من العملية.
 ثم
 أعلم أن هذا مجرد تعليق.
 وبطبيعة الحال، ليس من مهمة اللجنة أن توصي باستخدامات بديلة للأراضي.
 وهذا ما لاحظه المراجع.
 هذا هو السجل العام.
 لكننا لن نشارك بشكل مباشر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4721.002s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، سأدخل وأعطي على الأقل إجابة قصيرة حتى لا نبقى.
 دع الجميع يشعر أننا نتعامل مع مشكلة عند حدوثها.
 يمكننا أن نتعمق في قضايا محددة في جلسات الاستماع المستقبلية.
 السيدة داجوستينو. إذا لم تتمكن من الحضور، فإن الخطة الحالية تتطلب امتداد ميرتل التالي، لذلك عندما تستمر في ميرتل إلى التقاطع الرئيسي، فإننا نقترح امتداد ميرتل على جانب واحد من الطريق الذي يعبر مبنى خط الأنابيب.
 لذلك من خط البناء، نعم، من الصعب أن نرى هنا.
 لا، هذا ليس الهدف من عرض اليوم.
 لكن نعم، عند الصعود من هذه النقطة، يظل الخط الرئيسي للطريق كما هو وينخفض.
 أوه، الخطة هي التحرك غربًا ونحن نقترح توسيع طريق ميرتل على الأرض التي نحتلها ونديرها فيما يتعلق بعمود الإنارة.
 يمكننا عرض هذه القضية بالتفصيل في الجلسة القادمة، وهذه معلومات تم الحصول عليها في جلسات الاستماع السابقة، لكن الناس لا يستطيعون رؤية النقطة بوضوح.
 هذه ليست نيتنا.
 لذلك، نخطط للخوض في مزيد من التفاصيل، ولكن هذا كل ما في الأمر.
 نحن نخطط لترك المجموعات الحالية من خدمات المرافق دون تغيير.
 إنهم يتصلون بالموقع على الجانب الآخر من طريق ميرتل، ونحن لا نريد أن نفعل ذلك.
 ليس لدينا أي خطط لنقل أو إيقاف أي من خدماتهم.
 ثم هناك المنحنى.
 تدور خطة النقل الخاصة بنا حولهم، مما يؤدي بشكل أساسي إلى توفير مساحة على طريق ميرتل للسيارات لإيقافها بعيدًا عن الطريق، مع الحفاظ على المساحة على الرصيف حتى تظل الأعمدة في مكانها.
 وهذا مرة أخرى إجابة قصيرة.
 أريد فقط أن أعطي شيئا.
 هذا يعني أن مشاعرك مختلفة عن مشاعرنا.
 وبالمراجعة هنا، يمكننا مناقشة الأمر بمزيد من التفصيل خلال أسبوعين.
 أخبر الجميع عن نصائحنا لإزالة الأعشاب الضارة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4856.667s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: شكرا لك، أريد فقط أن أقول شكرا لك.
 أعلم أنه لا داعي للقلق بعد الآن، لكن شكرًا لك.
 وهذا يساعد على توضيح بعض القضايا.
 لذا أشكرك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4866.834s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 ثم رأيت عضوًا آخر من الجمهور يرفع يده لمساعدة كريستينا.
 هل يمكنك تقديم اسمك وعنوانك للتسجيل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4875.96s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: مع خالص التقدير، كريستينا كاش، ١٣٠ شارع ميرتل، ميدفورد.
 لدي سؤال تأكيد سريع ومن ثم سؤال التصميم.
 هل ينبغي أن تصبح دراسة التلوث الضوئي والصوتي جزءًا من الهندسة المدنية أو التصميم؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4898.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: لذلك أعتقد أن دراسة التلوث الضوئي والتلوث الضوئي، لست متأكدًا مما إذا كانت يتم إجراؤها بانتظام أم لا.
 معرض الواجب.
 قليل من الناس يعتقدون أن هذا المشروع يغطي مرحلة الصداقة في JE.
 ما هي العناصر الخاصة لأوك تشين؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4919.395s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم نعم.
 سوف تقوم ببناء مبنى كبير أمام شقتي.
 سيكون هناك المزيد من السكان والضوضاء والحيوانات والضوء.
 سوف تقتحم المناظر الطبيعية وأنظمة الإضاءة العامة غير المسبوقة في هذا الشارع حياتنا اليومية، خاصة لأولئك الذين يعملون من المنزل.
 بالإضافة إلى ذلك، في الليل، إذا ذهبنا إلى الفراش مبكرًا، فإن الجهاز أيضًا يخلق تلوثًا ضوئيًا ليس فقط في الحديقة، ولكن أيضًا في شجيرات القطيفة في المنزل.
 ولهذا السبب أعتقد أنه يجب دراسة الضوضاء والتلوث الضوئي.
 نوعية الحياة للمقيمين الحاليين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4964.733s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أفهم.
 شكرا على التوضيح.
 نعم، المواضيع مقسمة إلى فئات.
 سيقوم مسؤولو الولاية بعد ذلك بإعداد خطة الإضاءة حتى يفهم السكان مكان الأضواء والمناطق التي قد تتأثر.
 كما تعلمون، الضوء يؤثر على الجيران.
 وهذا هو بالضبط ما يمكن أن نأخذه بعين الاعتبار.
 أعتقد أن وضع النوافذ والأشياء أكثر أهمية.
 إنه مبنى، وبعد ذلك، كما تعلمون، إذا كان هناك أبكم وكل ذلك، أعلم أن هناك قواعد بشأنه، لكنني أعتقد أنه متحضر.
 لذا نعم، هناك بعض النقاط ذات صلة بهذا الأمر، لكن للتوضيح، يمكن للسائل أن يصحح لي إذا كنت مخطئا، لا أعتقد ذلك.
 وستكون هناك معارض مخصصة للدراسات التفصيلية للتلوث الضوئي والضوضاء.
 بدلا من ذلك، سنتحدث عن أشياء مثل الإضاءة وعزل الصوت.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5038.389s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: السيد الرئيس على حق.
 ستتضمن خطة الإضاءة التي سيتم مراجعتها في النهاية من قبل المهندس الإنشائي خطة ضوئية.
 يوضح الامتثال ويقلل من انتقال الضوء من الإضاءة المحيطة.
 فيما يتعلق بالضوضاء، بالإضافة إلى المتطلبات التنظيمية الحالية، هناك لوائح خاصة بالضوضاء البلدية.
 ماذا يحدث إذا كان هناك مولد صوت معين؟
 يمكن أن تكون القضايا المثيرة للقلق، مثل معدات التسقيف، في كثير من الأحيان محور التقييمات المدنية المعمارية للتخفيف من هذه الآثار.
 لكن هذه هي العوامل التي تأخذها النصائح عادة بعين الاعتبار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5097.163s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 هل تستطيع كريستينا الإجابة على سؤالك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5103.393s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: أجاب على سؤالي.
 لقد شعرت بخيبة أمل قليلا.
 لن أخوض في هذه القضايا أكثر من ذلك، لكنني سأعلق على هذه القضية بعد المحاكمة المدنية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5115.72s">[Unidentified]</a>: نعم، لدي هذه الصورة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5118.462s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: لذلك لدي أيضًا سؤال محدد حول التصميم.
 أعتقد أن هذا مخصص لـ Cube 3.
 لقد ذكرت
 يمتلك أربعة عقارات في ميدفورد ويعمل في مشاريع أخرى.
 أسأل لأن لديك شقق فارغة في أربعة شقق بنتهاوس.
 خذ بعين الاعتبار بعض عيوب مشروعك السابق عند تصميم هذا المبنى للتأكد من عدم تكرارها في هذا المشروع الجديد.
 لذا، فأنا أبحث في كيفية استخدام التشريح للمباني السابقة لاتخاذ قرارات أكثر استنارة لهذه الوحدة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5166.021s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 لذلك في هذه الحالة سأحاول
 ارجع هذا إلى المجلس.
 سأطرح السؤال مرة أخرى لأنه هل تعرف ما إذا كانت هناك أي عناصر محددة مفصلة في خطط هذا المشروع تتضمن أفضل الممارسات والدروس المستفادة من المشاريع الأخرى في هذا المجال؟
 لذا، إذا أراد المرشح التحدث عن أي تفاصيل، فيرجى المتابعة.
 بالتأكيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5188.814s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 أعني، من الواضح أننا نتعلم دائمًا ونحاول التعلم من المشاريع السابقة.
 أعتقد أن هناك شيئًا واحدًا عليك أن تتذكره وهو أننا نعمل مع مطورين مختلفين هنا، وليس مع عقارات أخرى.
 لذا فإن بعض الأعمال التي قمنا بها في الفنادق السابقة لا تنطبق على ما نقوم به هنا، اعتمادًا على العميل والموقع الذي نعمل فيه.
 لكننا نحاول دائمًا أن نفهم ما الخطأ الذي ارتكبناه وما الذي فعلناه بشكل صحيح ونحاول تطبيقه على المشروع التالي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5222.194s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، هذه مجرد معلومات.
 هل يمكنك حقًا تأكيد آراء سكان بوتس الذين يتحدثون ويستمعون الليلة؟ إذا كانت لديك تعليمات محددة حول كيفية التحكم بها (مثل الضوء أو الصوت أو عناصر المناظر الطبيعية الأخرى)، فهل يمكنك ذلك؟
 يرجى إبلاغ المدينة أو إلينا بهذا حتى نتمكن من التأكد من أن هذا جزء من الاقتراح أو كما تعلم أن هذا جزء من تحليلنا.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5255.977s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم، ولكن أعني أنني مهندس صناعي، وليس مهندسا مدنيا.
 لذلك كنت بحاجة إلى مهندس حتى يكون لدي شيء لأعمل عليه في وقت سابق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5265.004s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنًا، بناءً على وجهة نظر أندرو، أعتقد أن الجدول بشكل عام،
 يمكن للجمهور طرح الأسئلة والتعبير عن آرائهم.
 وكما ترون في هذه الاجتماعات، آمل أن ما أقوله على الأقل هو أن مجلس الإدارة سيحاول التأكد من أنه إذا طرحت سؤالاً أو شيئًا لا يفكر فيه مجلس الإدارة أو يطرحه، فسوف ينتهي بنا الأمر إلى العمل مع هذا المرشح وسيقوم هذا المرشح بالرد وتقديم تلك التفاصيل وقد استجاب هذا المرشح بالفعل.
 أعتقد أن هذا يطابق وجهة نظر أندرو.
 إذا كانت لديك فكرة، سواء تم التعبير عنها مباشرة للمدينة أو في جلسة استماع عامة، فمن الممكن أن تظل مفيدة، حتى لو لم تأتي من خبير محلي.
 هل يمكنك مشاركة هذه الفكرة كتعليق مسجل؟
 وقد يؤدي ذلك إلى مناقشات أو تعليقات يشارك فيها خبراء في مجال معين تعكس روح المفهوم.
 حسنًا، أعتقد أنه إذا فهمتك بشكل صحيح يا أندريه، فأنت تريد أن توضح الأمر للناس.
 نرحب بالأفكار وتوجد منتديات للسكان المحليين للتعبير عن أفكارهم هنا أو مع المدينة.
 خاصة إذا قمت بوضع هذه الأفكار في نفس الإطار الزمني أو قبل أن تركز المناقشة على القضية، يمكن لمجلس الإدارة مناقشة المرشحين وإلهامهم.
 هل هذا عادل يا أندرو؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5367.772s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 قد يكون هذا أمرًا بسيطًا مثل عدم رغبتك في إضاءة المبنى الخاص بك، أو قد ترغب في المزيد من الإضاءة لأنها مفيدة للسلامة العامة.
 لا أعرف.
 أشياء مماثلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5381.754s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا
 شكرا لك
 تُظهر تعليقات الأعضاء الآخرين الآن أن أفرادًا آخرين من الجمهور يريدون أيضًا التحدث علنًا بجانبي.
 سأنتظر بضع ثوان للتأكد.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 لا يرى الرئيس شيئًا وينتظر طلب إغلاق الجزء العام من العملية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5412.685s">[Unidentified]</a>: مؤثر جدا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5416.007s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: تحقق من القوائم الأخرى.
 ايفرت؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5420.81s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5421.931s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: من كان هناك؟
 نحن.
 جيس؟
 نحن.
 نادي رياضي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5427.958s">[Unidentified]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5429.399s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: مايكرو؟
 نعم حسنا.
 ولذلك فإن الرأي العام مغلق أمام هذا الاجتماع.
 وسوف نسعى للحصول على مساهمة الجمهور في القضايا الهامة الأخرى في جلسات الاستماع القادمة.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 أريد فقط التحقق مرة أخرى مع المجلس بشأن هذا الأمر.
 هل لديك أي أسئلة أو تعليقات حول ما رأيناه اليوم أو المواضيع الأخرى المتاحة اليوم؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5463.805s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: حسنًا، بالطبع، نعم، أعلم ذلك، لسبب ما هو معروف مسبقًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5467.25s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: ولم لا؟
 شيء واحد: بينما يعمل المهندسون المعماريون على هذا، أريد أن أرى سبب كل هذه الضجة.
 هذا المشروع مخصص للطابق الأرضي حول المبنى.
 كما تعلمون، نحن نبحث عن المزيد.
 ومع ذلك، من ناحية.
 الطابق الأول بأكمله فارغ.
 أتساءل عما إذا كان هذا يمكن أن يكون مكانًا لمزيد من الجداريات الفنية العامة، وبعض الجدران الخضراء؟
 أريد أن أعرف ما الذي يحدث هناك حتى لا يكون مجرد جدار فارغ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5528.08s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أرى حركات الرأس.
 هل يمكننا حل هذه المشكلة في جلسة استماع مستقبلية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5532.502s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم، سنأخذ ذلك بعين الاعتبار بالتأكيد ونخطط للرد في جلسة الاستماع القادمة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5538.944s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: خاص.
 الشيء الوحيد الذي أود إضافته إلى الرئيس هو أنني أعتقد أنه يمكننا الرد على LaRue وبالتأكيد يمكننا تقديم بعض الأفكار والفرص البديلة إلى مجلس الإدارة للنظر في هذه الأنواع من عناصر التصميم على هذا المستوى.
 يمكن أن يقدم هذا ومن ثم يبلغ مجلس الإدارة بالمتطلبات التفصيلية التي يمكن أن تنعكس في الخطة النهائية.
 بهذه الطريقة سيكون لديك هدف تصميمي تريد تحقيقه من حيث اكتساب التواضع أو تقديم بعض النصائح سواء في اللوحة أو في المخطط النهائي.
 لست متأكدًا من أنه ما زال لدينا فكرة الفن العام، كما تعلمون، يجب تخصيص نسبة X بالمائة من الجدار للفن العام.
 ولكن يمكننا بالتأكيد تقديم بعض معايير الإطار والأفكار التي يمكنك وضعها في الاعتبار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5606.611s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، أجد العرض التقديمي مفيدًا، على الأقل يسمح بإجراء مناقشات عملية تؤدي إلى التصميم النهائي.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 نحن ممتنون جدا.
 عظيم الآن.
 الآن دعنا ننتقل إلى قسم التسليم.
 لذلك تم تأكيد ذلك بشكل غير مباشر، لكنني أردت فقط التحقق مرة أخرى.
 لذا، لمدة أسبوعين، كان التركيز الرئيسي للتخطيط هو المنطقة السكنية، وبدا أننا كنا ننظر إلى المنطقة بالإضافة إلى تخطيط المناظر الطبيعية.
 قد لا تنعكس جميع التحديثات التي تمت مناقشتها اليوم في تنسيق محدد، ولكن فقط كتحديثات عامة حول المواضيع التي تمت مناقشتها اليوم لمدة أسبوعين.
 ونحن نسير على الطريق الصحيح لتحقيق هذا الهدف.
 هل أنا على حق؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5666.923s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم سيدي الرئيس، هذه هي خطتنا عندما نعود بعد أسبوعين لاستئناف المفاوضات المدنية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5675.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 إذن يا بومر، عندما تتوقع استلام هذه المذكرة لينظر فيها مجلس الإدارة والمرشحون، ماذا تريد أن ترى أيضًا؟
 ربما يوم الاثنين، شيء من هذا القبيل، بعد يوم أو يومين.
 خاص.
 تبدو جيدة.
 شكرا لك
 إذا أراد المرشح التوضيح الآن سأتحدث معه.
 أميل حاليًا إلى التحلي بالمرونة وتحديد مواعيد جلسات الاستماع لمدة أربعة أسابيع، أكثر أو أقل اعتمادًا على كيفية سير الأوراق والمناقشات على مدار الأسبوعين.
 هل يبدو هذا معقولا؟
 أو تريد أن تعرف بالضبط ما سيحدث في أربعة أسابيع؟
 سيكون هناك جدول أعمال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5736.39s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: أعتقد أنه يمكننا أن نكون أكثر مرونة قليلاً.
 أعتقد أن الأمر يعتمد حقًا في هذين الأسبوعين على الجمهور، إذا كان هناك أي شيء يجب مراقبته، فسنرغب بالتأكيد في مراقبته وكذلك مراقبة العناصر المعمارية الليلة.
 لذلك أعتقد أنه إذا كان ذلك ممكنًا، إذا كان هناك محتوى يحتاج إلى توضيح حول العديد من المواضيع، فيمكن أن تكون جلسة استماع عامة حيث يمكننا تغطية مجموعة واسعة من المواضيع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5766.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 أريد فقط أن يعرف الجمهور، لذلك البند التالي في التقويم، آسف، لقد تحققت للتو من التقويم الخاص بي.
 ومن المقرر أن تعقد جلسة الاستماع في 11 أبريل.
 دعونا نناقش القضايا المدنية.
 نفس الشيء مع بعض مشاريع البستنة والتحديثات حول هذا الموضوع.
 ومن المقرر عقد الجلسة القادمة للمحكمة في 23 أبريل.
 نحن نحتفظ بجدول أعمال مرن هنا، ولكننا نريد أن نرى موضوعًا تتم مناقشته بمزيد من التفصيل.
 تم تطوير تحديث بناءً على ما قاله المجلس والجمهور اليوم، بالإضافة إلى مذكرة بومر.
 وهذا ما يمكن أن نتوقعه لاحقا.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 أعتقد أننا قد تناولنا جميع المواضيع الأربعة لهذا المؤتمر.
 أريد فقط أن أتحقق من المرشحين لمعرفة ما إذا كان أي شيء آخر سيحدث.
 هل تريد التحدث الليلة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5855.69s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، ليس نحن.
 شكرا لك على وقتك وردود الفعل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5861.274s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم شكرا لك.
 أنا أيضًا أقدر التفاصيل والوقت.
 من الجيد رؤية التقدم الذي يحدث هنا.
 ولذلك نتوقع اجتماعا في غضون أسبوعين.
 ثم
 وينتظر الرئيس حاليًا طلبًا لمواصلة القضية حتى الساعة 6:30 مساءً. في 11 أبريل.
 انتقلت.
 هل لديك ثانية؟
 الاثنين.
 سأتصل بك على الهاتف.
 جيم؟
 هذا صحيح.
 جيمي؟
 أندرو؟
 هذا صحيح.
 ايفرت؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5906.331s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5907.332s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: مايكرو؟
 هذا صحيح.
 واستمرت القضية حتى 11 أبريل.
 لذا شكرا يا صديق.
 إذن هذه هي القضية المهمة الوحيدة على جدول الأعمال.
 هناك عناصر للعديد من الإجراءات.
 دينيس، هل يمكنك قراءة المقال أدناه؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5923.985s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 لدينا تحديثات إدارية وأود أن أقول إن هذا التحديث لأغراض إعلامية فقط.
 لن أكون هناك.
 سأكون هناك، سأذهب.
 لذا سأغادر يوم الاثنين أو الأربعاء أو الخميس، اعتمادًا على موعد عودتي.
 لذا إذا حدث أي شيء، سأتأكد من وضع كل شيء هناك.
 لذا، كما تعلم، مثل Cliff وBeta وأي شخص آخر، سيرسلونها إليك، وكما تعلم، أثناء غيابي، سيقومون بتحديثها على الموقع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5952.552s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: لذلك لا بأس.
 لذا خطط لشخص ما ليصبح
 هل يمكنك مساعدتنا في تسليم البضائع عندما لا تكون متواجدًا، أم يجب أن ننتظر حتى عودتك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5967.744s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: لا.
 الطائرة الأصغر هي جانيون.
 لذلك عندما يحدث ذلك، سأتأكد بالتأكيد من أنك تعلم، وأعتقد أن هذه الخطة، هذه الخطة السخية التي أنفذها عندما أغادر ربما تكون أكثر دقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5980.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: مثالي.
 تبدو جيدة.
 لكن شكرا على التحديث.
 أعتقد أن النقطة التالية هي محضر الاجتماع.
 سأرسل لك نسخة.
 حديثاً.
 نعم، تذكر.
 رأيت المدير يرفع يده.
 يرجى الاستمرار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5998.488s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: وسوف أغتنم كل فرصة لتذكيركم بأننا نعمل مع مستشار التخطيط للحصول على أحدث المعلومات.
 إذا كان أي شخص يرغب في مقابلته أو مقابلة أي من فريقه على انفراد، فيمكننا ترتيب ذلك.
 أود أن أقرأها إذا كانت لديك فكرة عما تريد رؤيته.
 أو إذا كنت تريد طرح الأمر في الاجتماع، فيمكنك القيام بذلك في اجتماع عام.
 فكر فيما ترغب في رؤيته يتغير في المنطقة.
 أريد فقط أن أذكرك بأن هذه العملية مستمرة: أنا ودانييل نلتقي بأعضاء المجلس كل أسبوع تقريبًا، ويجتمع مجلس المدينة في اجتماعات اللجنة.
 هناك أيضًا اجتماعات عامة تُعقد كل أسبوعين تقريبًا.
 لذلك آمل فقط أن يضيف الأشخاص المزيد من المحتوى إلى القائمة.
 لنبدأ بالقضايا الإدارية.
 لذا، إذا كنت تواجه مشكلة في إدارة أقسامك، فهذا هو الوقت المناسب لإعلامنا بذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6063.775s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، شكرًا لك، أيها المدير هانتر.
 للتوضيح، يجب على المستشارين الذين يرغبون في الاستفادة من هذه الفرصة الاتصال بك مباشرةً لتحديد موعد في هذا الوقت.
 رائع.
 نعم، أعتقد أنه يمكننا بالنيابة عن المجلس أن نناقش في جلسات الاستماع العادية ما إذا كنا نريد اتخاذ بعض الإجراءات الجماعية للمجلس.
 لا، أعتقد أن هذا هو تحيزي الشخصي في هذه المرحلة من العملية
 ربما إذا كان أعضاء مجلس الإدارة يعرفون بالفعل أن لديك رأيًا بشأن قضية ما، فيجب عليهم العمل مباشرةً معك ومع أعضاء مجلس الإدارة.
 لذا، نعم نستطيع ذلك، أي عضو في المجلس يريد إجراء المزيد من المناقشة الجماعية العامة حول هذه القضية يمكنه المضي قدمًا في الدعاوى القضائية المعلقة.
 حسنا، أنها تبدو جيدة.
 شكرا على التحديث.
 رائع.
 دينيس، لقد بدأت تضيع بعض الوقت.
 نعم، أعرف ما ترسله... أعرف أنك ترسل دقائق.
 لقد تحققت من هذا الآن.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6127.072s">[Unidentified]</a>: حسنًا، لدي حالات انفصال منتظمة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6148.938s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: تم النشر في 14 مارس. أعلم أنه تم إرساله إليك وأردت الرد فقط.
 أعتقد أنني نشرت كل شيء، لكنني نشرت الكثير، لذا لست متأكدًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6164.845s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: نعم، عمري 314 سنة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6173.509s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: أعلم أنه تم إرساله إلى الجميع في 30 يناير.
 سأعود إلى البريد الإلكتروني الذي أرسلته.
 وهناك الكثير منهم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6187.912s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنًا، سأتحقق من الأمر مع المجلس.
 لذا، لدينا بروتوكولات من 30 يناير، ومن 3 يناير إلى 14 يناير. هل لدى المشاركين الفرصة للتحقق منها؟
 حصلت على عدد قليل من الإيماءات.
 حسنًا يا جيمي، أرى أنك تهز رأسك.
 نعم بعد مشاهدتهم ما رأيك في التقييم؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6218.416s">[Unidentified]</a>: 14 يناير و14 مارس على التوالي.
 كلاهما يبدو جيدًا بالنسبة لي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6225.443s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، لقد أتيحت لي أيضًا الفرصة للتحقق منها.
 إنهم يبدون على حق.
 دينيس، أريد التأكد من أننا إذا خسرنا بضع دقائق، فسوف يرسلوننا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6239.775s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: راشيل تفعل هذه الأشياء، لذا فالأمر يتعلق فقط بإرسالها لك.
 قبل أن تذهب، نعم، ربما يمكننا وضعهم جميعًا في مجلد ويمكنك إرسالهم إلينا. نعم، جميعها موجودة على Google Drive، لكني أوافق وأختلف عليها في ملفين مختلفين. سأرسل لك رابط Google Drive حتى تتمكن من تسجيل الدخول.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6260.557s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: في الواقع، سوف ينجح الأمر. أعتقد ذلك، وهو أمر جيد لأنني لم أجده منذ شهر مارس.
 لدي 11 و 25 و 30 يناير.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6271.473s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: لكن عندما أرسلتها إليك يوم الجمعة الماضي، لم أتمكن من رؤية مارث.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6276.139s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، هذا جديد جداً.
 تريد أن تقول شيئا.
 لا، أنا فقط أوافق.
 نعم حسنا.
 الآن نحن نتحدث عن 30 يناير و 14 مارس.
 لذا، نعم، يبدو أن بعض أعضاء مجلس الإدارة يعتقدون أن المحضر دقيق.
 ثم انتظر الرئيس تعليمات بالموافقة على محضر اجتماعي 30 يناير و14 مارس.
 هل لدي واحدة ثانية؟
 حسنا، دعونا نتصل
 جيم؟
 أندرو؟
 هذا صحيح.
 جيمي؟
 هذا صحيح.
 ايفرت؟
 هذا صحيح.
 مايكرو؟
 هذا صحيح.
 حسنًا، لقد تم الاتفاق على المحضر، شكرًا مقدمًا، دينيس.
 سننظر في القضايا المتبقية ونحلها في الاجتماع القادم.
 دعونا نرى
 أصدقائي الأعزاء، أود أن أذكركم بأنني لن أكون في الاجتماع يوم الخميس.
 عرض جيمي استضافة العرض.
 جيمي، أريد أن أشارككم بعض التفاصيل.
 لكن نعم، بخلاف ذلك آمل أن يسير يوم الخميس على ما يرام.
 ونراكم مرة أخرى في 11 أبريل.
 حسنا، أعتقد المضي قدما، أندرو.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6371.794s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 نعم، مجرد سؤال ربما لأليسيا أو دينيس.
 وهو مستشار 40B في المدينة. لم أقابله قط. لا أعتقد أننا التقينا به بعد؟
 أعتقد أن سؤالي هو، بما أن هذا يتعلق بالتصميم الذي نتحدث عنه اليوم، ما هو؟
 هل هناك أي شيء يمكننا القيام به لتصميم هذه المشاريع المتنامية التي يبلغ حجمها 40 مليارًا بشكل أفضل بحيث لا تكون مجرد نفس المشاريع الكبيرة التي نستمر في رؤيتها؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6413.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أندريه، لا أعتقد أن محامي هافرتي سيكون قادرًا على حضور المحاكمة، لكن زميله كريس الذي سيكون هنا اليوم.
 إنه ينتمي إلى نفس المكتب.
 لذلك، ليس لدينا هذه العناصر بعد، لكنها ستجتمع معًا.
 ولذلك، أقدم عدة خيارات.
 يجوز لمجلس الإدارة جدولة اجتماعات مع مستشارينا 40B لمناقشة هذه المسألة بالتفصيل أو قد يتصل بأي عضو في مجلس الإدارة مباشرة.
 إذا كان لديك أي من هذه الأسئلة، يرجى الاتصال بمستشارنا 40B للتوضيح.
 الشيء الوحيد الذي لا يمكننا فعله هو مناقشة هذه القضية على انفراد مع مجموعة كبيرة من الناس.
 نعم، أقترح عليك الاتصال بمحامي هافرتي مباشرة بخصوص هذه القضية ويمكننا مناقشة هذه القضية بشكل مفتوح في الاجتماع.
 في الجلسة القادمة.
 يمكننا أيضًا أن نطرح هذا السؤال علنًا.
 هذا خيار آخر.
 لا أعتقد أن هذا مؤهل كجلسة تنفيذية.
 سنتمكن بعد ذلك من تأكيد حضور محامي هافيرتي أو زميله في الجلسة القادمة.
 أعتقد أنهم موجودون هناك وعلينا فقط أن نسألهم علنًا.
 وهذا من شأنه أن يكون خيارا آخر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6508.835s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: حسنًا، أنا سعيد بكلاكما.
 ربما أنا سعيد أمام الجمهور.
 أعني هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6516.687s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: لذا، نعم، ربما بسبب فضولك وحقيقة أننا لن نكون في جلسة الاستماع خلال أسبوعين، ربما سأطرح هذا السؤال.
 علاوة على ذلك، سوف تحصل على الجواب بنفسك.
 وبعد ذلك، بناءً على ذلك، يمكنك أن تسأل مرة أخرى علنًا أو تخبرني إذا كنت تريد مناقشة هذا الأمر علنًا.
 أود أن ألخص فهمي بإيجاز.
 أعتقد أن هناك توازنًا تفصيليًا وحدودًا لما يمكن لمجلس الإدارة فعله وما لا يمكنه فعله.
 لهذا السبب من الأفضل أن تكون غامضًا.
 ماذا يمكننا أن نفعل حقا؟ أعتقد أنه سيكون من الأفضل أن يقوم 40B Advisor بنشر هذا الأمر للعامة.
 أعتقد بشكل عام أن هناك توازنًا بين القضايا الداخلية والعوامل التي قد تجعل المشروع غير اقتصادي بشكل خاص.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6576.456s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: حسنا
 لأنني أريد أن أعرف، كيف يمكننا معرفة ذلك؟
 كما تعلمون، فإن جميع المفاوضات، مثل عدد الشقق ومساحة الأرض وما إلى ذلك، تتم.
 أعني، أعتقد أنه سيكون من الرائع أن يفهم الناس الأمر بشكل أفضل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6594.821s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: بالتأكيد، ربما يمكننا البدء لأن هذه مشكلة أكثر شيوعًا.
 سأجعل هذا موضوعا مفتوحا.
 في الاجتماع التالي، يمكننا الاتصال بالمستشار 40 ب ونطلب منه أن يقدم ملخصًا للجمهور.
 أدخل جدول الفحص كجزء من عملية 40B.
 هل هذا العمل بالنسبة لك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6619.358s">[Unidentified]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 حسنًا، عظيم.
 شيء آخر يجب أن نتذكره هو أنه عند الانتهاء من هذه المشاريع، أعتقد أنهم سيقاضيوننا ويجبروننا على دفع ضريبة بنسبة 10٪.
 لذلك من الناحية النظرية لن نرى 40B مرة أخرى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6639.593s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: لا يهمني 40B، أريد المساعدة في السكن.
 أريد فقط أن يكون مثل هذا. أريدهم أن يصلوا إلى 50%.
 أتمنى أن يكون مصممًا بشكل جيد وربما بدلاً من هذه الكتل العملاقة يكون لدينا مباني أصغر بارتفاعات مختلفة أو شيء من هذا القبيل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6660.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أفهم ما يعنيه المحامي هانتر، أعتذر للمدير هانتر، إنه يفعل شيئًا ما.
 لذا، أيها المدير هانتر، أريد فقط أن أقول إننا نسير على الطريق الصحيح.
 نحن لا نتحدث عن هذا المشروع بالتحديد، ولكننا نمضي قدمًا.
 حقا
 أقترح عدم الخوض في التفاصيل هنا.
 لكن ماذا سيقول المخرج هانتر؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6688.304s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: حسنا
 لذا، فيما يتعلق بالحصول على برنامج 40B آخر، لدينا الآن ملاذ آمن لمدة عامين.
 نحن لا نعتبر النزاعات.
 أعني أننا نجري مناقشات مع مطورين آخرين حول جلب المشروع إلى ميدفورد والمنطقة المحيطة بها وكيفية سير الأمور.
 لذلك نرى 40B، وهو أمر ودي، لكن الوضع سيكون مختلفًا تمامًا لأنهم لا يملكون القدرة على المضي قدمًا وإيقافنا.
 سيكون لديهم خيار الخروج من عمليات 40B وإنهائها بدلاً من إنشاء مناطق مختلفة.
 نعم، لأننا وافقنا على السماح لهم بالمرور عبر عملية 40B لأننا مهتمون بإسكان ميسور التكلفة بنسبة 20% أو 25% أو 20% وهذا شيء يمكننا القيام به وأود أن أقول إنه شيء يمكننا مناقشته مع بعض المطورين.
 والسؤال المثير للاهتمام بالنسبة لهم هو ما إذا كان الإسكان الميسور التكلفة يمكن أن يزيد التكلفة إلى الحد الذي يصبح فيه المشروع المحدد الذي يفكرون فيه غير قابل للتحمل، وبدلاً من المطالبة بالفرق، يمكنك الموافقة ولكن سيكون لديهم دليل قانوني.
 يمكن أن تكون قادرة على المنافسة، في الواقع فهي جذابة بالنسبة لك أكثر من 40 مليارًا وودودة.
 لذلك أردت فقط أن أقدم لك بعض المعلومات الأساسية.
 سيكون الوضع مختلفا تماما.
 أعتقد أنه في الفقرة 40ب الثالثة، لست متأكدًا مما إذا كان بإمكانهم العودة أم لا، وأن قانون التقادم يرجع إلى تعليق القضية حتى قرار قانون الإجراءات الجنائية.
 لم يعودوا إلينا منذ ست سنوات، ومضى حوالي خمسة أو ستة أشهر منذ تسوية القضية.
 إذن هذا سؤال قانوني حقًا وعلينا الإجابة عليه.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن أعطيكم السياق الذي تفكرون فيه في هذه الأشياء.
 ما أثاره أندرو هو قضية طويلة الأمد.
 وهذا لن يحدث في الأشهر أو السنوات الستة المقبلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6835.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم هذا صحيح.
 وكما أفهم، فإن المنفذ الأمني ​​لا يؤدي إلا إلى توسيع أسباب رفض المشروع من قبل محكمة الاستئناف.
 لذا فهو يتغير ديناميكيًا فقط.
 ومع ذلك، يمكن تطبيق مبدأ منفذ الأمان بمقدار 4 ديسيبل.
 فيما يتعلق بالمنافذ الأمنية، فهي تميل إلى أن تكون الأكثر ودية حيث يمكن لمجلس الإدارة أن يرفضك لأسباب عديدة.
 نعم مهما كان
 ثم ينتظر الرئيس اختتام الاجتماع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6880.275s">[Unidentified]</a>: يرجى إنهاء الاجتماع.
 الاثنين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6882.656s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: ثانيا، كل شيء على ما يرام.
 دعونا نجري مكالمة هاتفية.
 جيم؟
 هذا صحيح.
 أندرو؟
 هذا صحيح.
 جيمي؟
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6893.147s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6894.089s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: مايك، نعم.
