 Tôi đã gọi cho anh à, Andrew?
 Vâng, xin lỗi.
 Mike Caldera đã tham dự.
 Chúng tôi đã tính đến việc ăn uống đầy đủ nên sẵn sàng lên đường.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=47.597s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Vào ngày 29 tháng 3 năm 2023, Thống đốc Healey đã ký một dự luật ngân sách bổ sung bao gồm việc gia hạn đến ngày 31 tháng 3 năm 2025 đối với các điều khoản tạm thời liên quan đến Đạo luật Họp Mở.
 Đợi một lát.
 Tôi đã đăng ký chưa?
 Tôi không chắc liệu chúng tôi có được ghi lại hay không, nhưng chúng tôi đã ghi lại.
 Xin lỗi, xin lỗi về điều đó.
 Cụ thể, phần mở rộng bổ sung này cho phép các cơ quan công quyền tiếp tục tổ chức các cuộc họp từ xa mà không yêu cầu số đại biểu cơ quan công quyền phải có mặt thực tế tại địa điểm họp và cung cấp quyền truy cập thay thế phù hợp cho các cuộc họp từ xa.
 Lời lẽ của tôi sẽ tạo ra những thay đổi đáng kể đối với Đạo luật về các cuộc họp mở và mở rộng các quy tắc tạm thời liên quan đến các cuộc họp từ xa từ ngày 31 tháng 3 năm 2023 đến ngày 31 tháng 3 năm 2025.</p>

 Cảm ơn, Dennis.
 Thưa các bạn, đối với những người chưa quen với quy trình 40B, đó là nhiều phiên điều trần.
 Ủy ban đã họp về vấn đề này từ cuối năm ngoái.
 Chúng tôi có những phiên đặc biệt.
 Chủ đề của hội nghị hôm nay là thiết kế.
 Vì vậy, tôi biết hội đồng quản trị gần đây đã nhận được bản cập nhật cho gói thiết kế.
 Đó là lý do tại sao tôi nghĩ mục tiêu của ngày hôm nay là thảo luận về vấn đề này.
 Tôi thấy bạn được đại diện bởi một số ứng cử viên.
 Tôi sẽ đưa nó cho Pat Noone.
 Chào mừng</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=163.161s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Xin cảm ơn Ngài Chủ tịch, các thành viên Hội đồng quản trị.
 Cảm ơn bạn đã tổ chức chúng tôi tối nay.
 Dưới đây là một số thành viên trong nhóm đã sẵn sàng trình diễn.
 Tôi sẽ nhờ Eric Samuelson từ Cube 3 chia sẻ màn hình của anh ấy và thực hiện hầu hết phần demo tối nay.
 Tôi sẽ đợi bạn đề cập đến điều đó và giới thiệu nhanh và chuyển chủ đề.
 Cảm ơn</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=277.86s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  That's good.
 Thank you, Pat.
 Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.
 So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.
 So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.
 I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.
 So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.
 This is our current landscape plan.
 This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.
 So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.
 More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.
 uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.
 And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.
 We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.
 Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.
 So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.
 You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.
 So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.
 So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.
 So here you'll see our ground floor plan.
 This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.
 Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.
 We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.
 This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.
 In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.
 This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.
 So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.
 This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.
 We have our bike storage.
 We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.
 In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.
 The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.
 Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.
 This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.
 We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.
 Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.
 We'll probably have some fitness located up here.
 So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.
 The units are all encapsulated here.
 The yellow would be your studio units.
 The purple would be your one bed units.
 The green would be your two bed units.
 And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.
 So moving up a floor plan.
 So this would be our typical floor three through five.
 And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.
 That's our most typical plan for three floors.
 One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.
 you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.
 So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.
 And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.
 And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.
 So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.
 The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.
 We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.
 So jumping into the concept design image.
 So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.
 This is conceptual design.
 So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.
 So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.
 This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.
 In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.
 So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.
 So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.
 And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.
 And part of the reason for that is one,
 from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.
 You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.
 So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.
 But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.
 So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.
 So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.
 And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.
 So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.
 There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.
 Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.
 One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.
 You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.
 This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor
 gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.
 Here you can see we have the five-story piece.
 You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.
 Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.
 This north elevation is the elevation that's
 most facing Myrtle Street.
 So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.
 You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.
 Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.
 And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.
 You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.
 and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.
 We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.
 There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.
 And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.
 you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Fellsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.
 So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.
 And then just briefly the townhome elevations.
 So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.
 Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.
 And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.
 So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.
 You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.
 So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.
 Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.
 And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.
 We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.
 And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.
 And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.
 So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.
 And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.
 And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.
 So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
 All right, so shadow study.
 So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.
 So we're going to show three items here.
 We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.
 The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.
 And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.
 And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.
 And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.
 So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.
 And this is the 9 a.m.
 condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.
 So this is the existing condition at those times of year.
 And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.
 And so we also looked at it
 as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.
 So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.
 And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.
 and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.
 So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.
 And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.
 That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.
 on those adjacent properties.
 So it's not that until 10 a.m.
 you are in a cloud of darkness.
 There's a lot of space between the buildings.
 There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.
 There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.
 And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.
 So here you'll see the 9 a.m.
 condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.
 This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.
 So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.
 and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.
 And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.
 And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.
 For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.
 And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.
 The sun's a lot higher in the air.
 So you'll see a lot less shadow.
 And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.
 So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.
 summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.
 So it's about only a 15 minute difference.
 In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.
 From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.
 So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.
 So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.
 Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.
 Three, the potential rail trail connection here.
 Four, we have our internal courtyards.
 One's
 potentially a little bit more active with the pool.
 Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.
 Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.
 Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with
 you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.
 I think we've been improving that each step along the way.
 I think
 where we are now is much better than where we started.
 And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.
 And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.
 But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.
 And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.
 So that is all.
 I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1314.237s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Vì vậy, có lẽ sẽ hợp lý hơn nếu bạn đến gặp Cliff Bomer lần sau, chỉ để hiểu ý tưởng chung thôi, Cliff.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1328.783s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: bạn có thể nghe tôi nói không
 Tất cả đều ổn.
 Xuất sắc.
 chào ngài
 Cuộc gặp cuối cùng của chúng tôi với các quan chức thành phố chỉ diễn ra cách đây sáu ngày, vào ngày 20.
 Tôi đã xem hầu hết những gì được trình chiếu.
 Có một số khác biệt, nhưng chúng là nhỏ.
 Tôi nghĩ, tôi chỉ muốn nhấn mạnh rằng tôi nghĩ
 Bạn có thể nhận thấy rằng hầu hết các nhận xét của tôi cho đến nay đều là về quy hoạch trang web, đối với tôi đây là nơi thích hợp để bắt đầu.
 Không cần phải thảo luận chi tiết về chất lượng của tòa nhà, v.v., và chắc chắn không cần phải thảo luận về vật liệu ở đâu, hoặc thậm chí là sơ đồ tầng, cho đến khi có một số lượng lớn các tòa nhà.
 Cho đến khi dấu chân thực sự phát huy tác dụng, chủ yếu vẫn là sự tiếp xúc của tòa nhà với các đường phố xung quanh.
 Và từ góc độ này, tôi luôn rất ủng hộ sự phát triển của dự án này.
 Tôi nghĩ bây giờ chúng ta nhìn thấy một cây cầu trong chính kiến ​​trúc.
 Điều này rất quan trọng.
 Đây thực sự là những khái niệm.
 các bản vẽ, nhưng tôi nghĩ rằng theo quan điểm của tôi, chúng phản ánh rằng dự án đang đi đúng hướng.
 Tất nhiên, sự thất bại lớn trong đầu là quan trọng.
 Tôi xem xét lại Chế độ xem phố của Google, chỉ để nhớ quy mô kiến ​​trúc của người Amarans.
 Các bậc thang ở mặt tiền dài phía bắc và phía nam của tòa nhà có mối liên hệ như thế nào với quy mô của tòa nhà bên kia đường.
 Tôi nghĩ bạn biết từ đó hoặc từ Google hoặc từ đó, những tòa nhà này
 Trên thực tế, tôi nghĩ nó hoạt động rất tốt vì tòa nhà bên kia đường có ít tầng hơn để chiếm giữ, nhưng chúng thực sự có một đường cầu rất cao bắc qua tòa nhà và thậm chí bắc qua một số tòa nhà lân cận rất gần nhau.
 Bạn đi lên tầng một.
 Thường có ba tầng để ở và một mái nhà.
 Vì vậy tôi nghĩ sự giảm thiểu này về mặt quy mô
 Nó hoạt động rất tốt.
 Tôi sẽ điểm qua một số vấn đề vẫn còn chưa được thảo luận từ cuộc họp tuần trước mà tôi nghĩ đó là những dấu hiệu thực sự tốt về cách tiếp tục thực hiện dự án xây dựng.
 Tôi nghĩ một trong những điều chúng ta đã nói đến là
 Đây là một tòa nhà lớn.
 Bây giờ tất cả các độ cao đều giống nhau.
 Tôi nhận thấy rằng chuyển động ở phía bắc rất hiệu quả trong việc làm nổi bật lối vào bên cạnh, điều này thực sự có hiệu quả đối với tôi.
 Tuy nhiên, hãy lưu ý rằng phần còn lại của mặt phía đông của mặt tiền phía bắc này cũng là không gian công cộng.
 Tôi nghĩ cần xem xét liệu sự khác biệt lớn hơn trong không gian này có hữu ích hay không.
 Tôi nghĩ một điểm khác là khía cạnh bền vững của kiến ​​trúc.
 Chúng ta đang nói về cách xử lý cửa sổ tương tự trong toàn bộ tòa nhà.
 Tôi nghĩ là có,
 Thật sự rất bổ ích khi tiếp tục phản ánh thái độ bền vững về mặt tiền tòa nhà.
 Tôi nghĩ thực sự có nhiều cách xử lý rất khác nhau tùy thuộc vào việc bạn đang nhìn vào độ cao hướng về phía bắc hay độ cao hướng về phía tây.
 Có lẽ nó liên quan đến khoảng cách từ cửa sổ.
 Được gắn vào tường hoặc đặt ở nơi có gió nhẹ, nó giúp kiểm soát ánh sáng mặt trời.
 Nhưng trong mọi trường hợp, tôi khuyến khích tìm cách làm phong phú mặt tiền tòa nhà bằng sự công nhận và như tôi đã nói, họ có thể đọc được thái độ bền vững của mặt tiền tòa nhà theo một cách nào đó.
 Tuy nhiên, tôi đã xem lại tất cả 27 trang của Shadow Research.
 Tôi sẽ nói với hội đồng rằng tôi nghĩ những điều đó là đúng và việc chuẩn bị là chính xác theo hiểu biết tốt nhất của tôi.
 Tôi đánh giá cao việc phân tích chất lượng trước và sau và thu hẹp nó vào các chủ đề giống nhau.
 Phối cảnh, khoảng thời gian trong đó có sự khác biệt có thể đo lường được về bóng râm trong một giờ thực tế.
 Tôi nghĩ điều đó giúp đưa mọi thứ vào quan điểm.
 tôi nghĩ bây giờ tôi
 Tôi hài lòng với kết quả của kế hoạch trang web.
 Các chi tiết cụ thể vẫn chưa được làm đầy đủ.
 Tôi nghĩ bức ảnh này cho thấy tất cả công việc được thực hiện ở phía tây của tòa nhà đã thực sự biến đổi Phố Amaranth.
 Có rất nhiều hình ảnh của tòa nhà mà chúng ta chưa thấy.
 Theo quan điểm của tôi, tôi nghĩ trọng tâm mà bạn đang thấy bây giờ thực sự là tính chất vật chất của kiến ​​trúc và cách đạt được quy mô.
 Bắt đầu chú ý đến chính tòa nhà.
 Tôi chưa viết gì cả, ngoài một bản ghi nhớ ngắn gọn yêu cầu thêm bằng chứng.
 Lý do tôi chưa viết gì là vì nó đã thay đổi.
 Dự án thực sự đã thay đổi rất nhiều và tôi không nghĩ rằng việc đưa ra quan điểm của mình có ích lợi gì cho đến khi
 Anh ấy đồng ý rằng mọi thứ tương đối ổn định và họ đã thực hiện một số cách tiếp cận đối với bài thuyết trình cuối cùng.
 Vì vậy, bạn sẽ thấy nhiều nhận xét của tôi hơn về kiến ​​trúc của tòa nhà cũng như vị trí của nó và vị trí thực tế trên khu đất cũng như những suy nghĩ đầu tiên về khu vườn, việc bảo tồn và quảng bá.
 Một không gian sử dụng hỗn hợp hoặc một không gian mở, dành cho cả công chúng và cư dân, có vẻ là một nơi tốt.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1773.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tôi chắc chắn sẵn sàng trả lời bất kỳ câu hỏi nào.
 Tất cả đều ổn.
 Cảm ơn đã cập nhật.
 Vì vậy, ông McCord, chỉ là...ừ, điều đó nghe hay đấy.
 Vì vậy, một điều tôi muốn làm rõ trước khi đặt câu hỏi tư vấn là... Vậy, tôi hiểu điều này có đúng không?
 Nếu kết quả của cuộc họp tối nay không dẫn đến những thay đổi đáng kể đối với kế hoạch của địa điểm thì tại thời điểm này, những vật trưng bày mà bạn yêu cầu, và có lẽ một số vật mà bạn sẽ sớm yêu cầu, sẽ là bước tiếp theo.
 Bạn hỏi họ và sau đó nhìn thấy họ.
 Sau đó, chúng tôi sẽ nhận được phản hồi chi tiết của bạn về các yếu tố khác của kiến ​​trúc trong các cuộc họp tiếp theo.
 Vì thế?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1819.794s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Đối với tôi, điều đó có ý nghĩa.
 Tôi có những nhận xét, tôi đã đưa ra một số nhận xét vào tuần trước về sự thể hiện trong kiến ​​trúc.
 Nhưng nó thực sự phụ thuộc vào bạn trên bảng.
 Đó là lý do tại sao tôi đánh giá cao cách tiếp cận nhịp nhàng này.
 Hãy làm điều đó, nhưng vâng, bước tiếp theo của tôi, giả sử công chúng nói chung, khái niệm của công chúng, nếu nó áp dụng cho người của bạn, điều đó sẽ giúp cung cấp thông tin cho cấp độ phân tích tiếp theo của tôi, như tôi đã nói thực sự là về tính vật chất, v.v., và tôi đã đưa ra một số nhận xét khác về tình trạng hiện tại của mọi thứ,
 Đối với tôi, tôi diễn đạt nó một cách cao siêu, nhưng tôi nghĩ điều quan trọng hơn là bạn phải có lời nói của riêng mình, và đó là nơi tôi bắt đầu lại, chỉ tìm kiếm những cách mà tôi nghĩ có thể giúp ích.
 Tôi nghĩ trong một tòa nhà có quy mô như thế này, thật đáng để thảo luận về cách làm cho quy mô có ý nghĩa đối với vị trí của tòa nhà.
 Nếu chất lượng phù hợp và vị trí trên trang web phù hợp, tôi nghĩ bạn đã thực sự có được các biến số.
 Tôi không biết mình đã trả lời rõ ràng chưa.
 Nếu tôi không làm vậy, tôi xin lỗi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1918.027s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Đối với tôi điều đó đủ rõ ràng nên hãy chấp nhận nó.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Tất cả đều ổn.
 Sau đó tôi sẽ đặt câu hỏi với hội đồng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1928.413s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Vâng, Mike, đây là Andrew.
 Hãy hỏi Vách đá.
 Tôi nhìn vào tòa nhà này.
 Đó là một miếng lớn, một miếng rau dền dài.
 Nó chỉ là một bức tường năm tầng kiên cố, không có gì khác biệt.
 Nó thực sự dài và tôi thực sự nghĩ rằng họ có thể làm nhiều hơn để phá vỡ nó một chút để nó không giống như một bức tường lớn.
 Tôi đã tự hỏi bạn nghĩ gì về điều này?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1975.908s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Tôi đồng ý và hoàn toàn đồng ý.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng một trong những lý do khiến tôi đưa ra ý tưởng về quá trình nâng cao sự khác biệt dựa trên định hướng là một cách giúp phá bỏ những khối thờ ơ lớn.
 Có những người khác
 Các chiến lược liên quan đến việc giới thiệu nhiều yếu tố theo chiều dọc hơn có thể bao gồm ít lối vào và lối ra hơn trên mặt tiền và một số thay đổi về vật liệu.
 Nhưng tôi đồng ý.
 Tôi nghĩ sẽ rất hữu ích nếu chọn một nhịp điệu để chia nhỏ chiều dài của tòa nhà và giúp nó liên quan đến sự phát triển bên kia đường.
 Vì vậy, đối với tôi, đó là nơi bạn bắt đầu.
 Nếu nền móng phù hợp với khoảng cách của bạn với đường phố và chiều cao chung của bạn, hãy bắt đầu khắc khối để tìm sự cân bằng phù hợp.
 Nó vẫn sẽ là một tòa nhà lớn và không có cách nào khác.
 Nhưng có nhiều cách để làm cho thang đo này phù hợp với bạn.
 Tôi nghĩ, bạn biết đấy, Vịnh, sự khác biệt, như tôi đã nói, có thể là một số nhóm.
 Tôi không nói là các ban nhạc, nó thiên về sự phân chia theo chiều ngang hơn, nhưng tôi đồng ý.
 Cũng nên nhớ là tòa nhà này có, nên tôi nghĩ việc làm nổi bật và thay đổi lối vào này là rất quan trọng
 Một lỗ mở giúp tiếp cận mặt tiền cửa hàng phía dưới ở góc phía bắc và di chuyển về phía tây.
 Điều này giúp ích rất nhiều, nhưng không đủ để giúp phá vỡ kích thước tổng thể của phần còn lại.
 Đây là một động thái tốt.
 Tôi nghĩ đặt nó ở phía bên này của tòa nhà là một hình thức đẹp.
 Tôi đồng ý.
 Tôi nghĩ tuần trước đã có một số cuộc thảo luận về cách cân bằng diện mạo công nghiệp.
 Ý tôi là, tòa nhà này vẫn gắn liền với nhà kho ở phía đông và đó là lịch sử của địa điểm này, nó từng được sử dụng trong công nghiệp.
 Nhưng đồng thời,
 Nếu bạn nhìn vào tòa nhà thực tế, tòa nhà thực tế là một cấu trúc bổ sung.
 Nó giống như bị chia thành nhiều phần nhỏ hơn.
 Nhưng dù sao đi nữa, đối với tôi, đó là điều tôi khuyên bạn nên xem xét ngay bây giờ. Hãy xem xét một số cách để phân tích quy mô của khóa cửa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2163.382s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Vâng, ý tôi là, Eric, tôi không nghĩ bạn đã đưa ra hình ảnh về một số dự án khác của mình.
 Tôi không biết bạn có muốn quay lại slide này không, nhưng.
 Vào thời điểm đó.
 Bạn biết đấy, ở đó.
 Giống như Maudra Medford, còn nhiều hơn thế.
 Nó gần giống như một tòa nhà khác phải không?
 Vì vậy tôi đã nghĩ về nó.
 Chiến lược này rất hữu ích ở đây.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2195.203s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: chắc chắn.
 Tôi không muốn nói rằng tôi nhất thiết phải mâu thuẫn với điều này, nhưng có một điều tôi muốn đề cập là với Nhà thụ động, việc tạo ra sự khác biệt lớn hơn bên trong tòa nhà sẽ khó hơn.
 Bạn càng đặt nhiều lối vào và lối ra vào một tòa nhà, về cơ bản là mỗi foot vuông bức tường bên ngoài mà bạn thêm vào tòa nhà thì tòa nhà càng khó đáp ứng các yêu cầu của Nhà thụ động.
 Vì vậy, có một điều tôi chợt nghĩ đến và chúng ta đang nói về nó, bạn biết đấy, chúng ta đã nói về vấn đề này vào tuần trước với ủy ban kế hoạch, Alicia và Danielle cùng những người còn lại trong nhóm, và đó là một
 Medford đã chọn một mã chuyên biệt.
 Đây là điều chúng tôi rất quan tâm.
 Đây là tương lai của quy định năng lượng ở Massachusetts.
 Vì vậy, một điều cần nhớ là ngày càng có nhiều dự án sẽ ngày càng có ít sự khớp nối, phân tách để tuân thủ các quy định về năng lượng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2251.474s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Bạn có thể giải thích cho tôi mã có thể mở rộng là gì không?
 Không phải nó giống với mô hình Nhà thụ động sao?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2261.774s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Không phải vậy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2262.635s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Vì vậy, bạn nghĩ rằng bạn vượt xa điều đó, phải không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2265.457s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Chà, Medford đã chọn một mã năng lượng chuyên dụng, đây là điều kiện tiên quyết cho Ngôi nhà thụ động.
 Ở Medford, bạn không có lựa chọn nào khác ngoài việc xây dựng một ngôi nhà thụ động bằng mã năng lượng.
 Đây là yêu cầu mới mà tất cả các dự án trong tương lai đều phải đáp ứng.
 được rồi
 Điều này là mới đối với nhiều người.
 Nó đã xuất hiện được một thời gian, chủ yếu ở Châu Âu, nhưng nó đang xuất hiện ở đây và nhiều người bắt đầu quen với nó, nhưng nó đang mất dần thời gian.
 Bạn biết đấy, cách nhiệt tốt hơn, bạn biết đấy, cách nhiệt liên tục bên ngoài tòa nhà, hiệu quả cao hơn, cửa sổ hiệu quả cao hơn, hệ thống cơ và điện tốt hơn.
 Thông thường, với một ngôi nhà thụ động, bạn thường sẽ thấy tiết kiệm được 90% hoặc thậm chí 90% chi phí năng lượng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2320.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Một điều tôi muốn nói thêm, như Eric đã đề cập, họ có
 Ba dự án nhà ở chủ động và thụ động cho văn phòng của bạn.
 Nhưng tôi sẽ đưa ra một gợi ý, chẳng hạn, vì chúng tôi cũng thực hiện rất nhiều công việc xây dựng nhà thụ động.
 Và bạn biết đấy, nếu bạn nhìn vào vẻ ngoài của chúng, thì đó là một hệ thống rất dựa trên hiệu suất.
 Do đó, cửa sổ và năng lượng có thể được mô hình hóa chặt chẽ.
 Vì vậy, nếu bạn có cửa sổ rất lớn, việc đạt được hiệu suất tản nhiệt tuyệt vời sẽ khó khăn hơn rất nhiều và nếu bạn đạt đến mức có thể thực hiện được bao nhiêu khớp nối, thì nhiều khớp nối sẽ được thực hiện trong các bức tường kiên cố.
 Và những bức tường này rất dễ cách ly và làm tốt.
 Ví dụ, tôi nghĩ rằng một cách để giải quyết vấn đề này là không nhất thiết phải cần một cửa sổ lớn như cửa sổ bạn đang hiển thị.
 Do đó, nếu bạn giảm kích thước cửa sổ một chút từ góc độ mô hình, bạn có thể nhận được nhiều hiệu ứng hơn từ khu vực xung quanh được cách ly tốt.
 Vì vậy tôi đồng ý với bạn, Passive House có một số khía cạnh rất khó.
 Mô hình hóa liên tục của tất cả các tài liệu xây dựng.
 Nhưng tôi không nghĩ vậy, tôi nghĩ hiện tại chúng tôi đã xây được khoảng 18 hoặc 19 tòa nhà Passivhaus.
 Tôi nghĩ bạn có thể tự do hơn với khả năng khớp nối thể tích mà vẫn đáp ứng các yêu cầu của Ngôi nhà thụ động.
 Chúng tôi làm điều này và chúng tôi làm điều này với nhiều tòa nhà.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2439.664s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Ý tôi là, một điều khác mà tôi muốn nói thêm là tôi luôn ủng hộ việc càng nhiều đơn vị có không gian ngoài trời riêng và càng nhiều ban công càng tốt.
 Đây là điều tôi chắc chắn sẽ xem xét.
 Tôi đã nhìn thấy bức ảnh này của Maudra Medford một lần nữa.
 Bạn biết đấy, tôi nghĩ có một ban công, ban công trông rõ ràng hơn thực tế rất nhiều.
 Có thể nghĩ về cách bạn có thể sử dụng chúng để làm điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2480.297s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Nếu tôi có thể thêm một điều.
 Tôi biết ơn Andrew vì đã hỏi câu hỏi này.
 Tôi nghĩ sự khớp nối của một tòa nhà là một cách khác để giúp kết nối nó với môi trường hiện tại.
 Không phải theo nghĩa đen, nhưng đó là một cách tuyệt vời để giúp xác định sự khác biệt ở các độ cao khác nhau của tòa nhà.
 Bạn làm gì ở miền bắc?
 Vâng, chúng tôi có một ban công lộ thiên ở đầu phía tây, cũng được lùi lại.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2517.24s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Patton Patton, cung điện của bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2520.463s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Xin lỗi, tôi chỉ muốn vào.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Tôi chỉ muốn làm rõ một số điều để diễn đàn không bị nhầm lẫn khi bàn về Passive House.
 Chỉ để làm rõ một số điều mà Eric đã đề cập về lộ trình tuân thủ mã năng lượng chuyên dụng.
 chúng ta không phải là một tập thể
 Các chuyên gia về mã năng lượng tin rằng có những lựa chọn khác cho các tòa nhà thương mại.
 Eric đặc biệt đề cập đến con đường Nhà thụ động dành cho mục đích dân cư.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ không muốn hội đồng truyền đạt ý kiến ​​của chúng tôi đến những đối tượng khác và gây ra sự nhầm lẫn trong tương lai.
 Tôi chỉ muốn làm rõ điều này cho mọi người.
 Chúng ta là vậy đấy.
 Để lặp lại những gì Eric đã nói, thành thật mà nói, chúng tôi rất vui mừng về điều đó.
 Đây là dự án quý 3 của Davis Company, một công ty đi đầu trong lĩnh vực thiết kế và xây dựng Nhà thụ động ở Massachusetts.
 Chúng tôi mong chờ cơ hội này và sẽ tiếp tục đào tạo bản thân cũng như sử dụng quy trình thiết kế này như một cơ hội.
 Nhưng tôi chỉ muốn làm rõ rằng đây là dành cho khu dân cư.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2593.618s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Đây là một điểm tốt.
 quan sát
 cảm ơn bạn
 Luật sư Tấn xin hãy nói.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2600.157s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Cảm ơn ngài Tổng thống.
 Dựa trên những gì Pat đã nói, tôi nghĩ nếu mối quan tâm và trọng tâm của thành viên LaRue thực sự là cải thiện mức độ rau dền, tôi nghĩ chúng tôi chắc chắn có thể tập trung vào điều đó vì tôi nghĩ những người khác.
 Sự tăng trưởng mà chúng ta thấy rõ ràng là mất rất nhiều thời gian cho việc đó.
 Nhưng nếu ông LaRue lo ngại về khía cạnh rau dền, tôi thấy không có lý do gì chúng ta không thể dành nhiều thời gian hơn cho những điểm mà Eric và Cliff đã cố gắng cải thiện.
 Đây là một bằng chứng về khái niệm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2653.145s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Được rồi, cảm ơn bạn.
 Andrew, anh cho biết mối quan tâm lớn nhất của anh là mặt rau dền, hay điều đó cũng áp dụng cho mặt trước của tòa nhà, mặt phía bắc?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2665.248s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Ý tôi là, tôi muốn thấy nhiều công việc hơn về vấn đề này, bạn biết đấy, ở mọi độ cao, như Cliff đã đề cập.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng phía Amaranth đặc biệt nổi bật với tôi bởi vì có khu dân cư ở bên kia đường và chỉ,
 Bạn biết đấy, ở một khía cạnh nào đó, nó trông giống như một bức tường mặt tiền không có gì khác biệt.
 Bạn biết đấy, rõ ràng là có điều tương tự ở phía đông và có một bức tường khác đối diện với tòa nhà kho.
 vì vậy tôi nghĩ
 Bạn có thể cần một phương pháp điều trị phù hợp với mình.
 Đây sẽ là những gì bạn nhìn thấy trên đường.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng toàn bộ độ cao có thể đáng để làm thêm một chút.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2719.771s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Được rồi, cảm ơn.
 Hội đồng có câu hỏi hoặc ý kiến ​​nào khác không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2728.738s">[Mary Lee]</a>: Tòa nhà này có tấm pin mặt trời không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2739.42s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Tôi không biết, Pat, nếu bạn muốn điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2741.942s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Đúng.
 Đúng.
 Đúng.
 xin lỗi
 Tôi có thể can thiệp vào thời điểm này.
 Chúng tôi không nghiên cứu cụ thể về điều đó.
 Tôi nghĩ đó là điều chúng tôi đã thảo luận.
 Chà, có thể kết hợp điều này vào dự án, nhưng đây chưa phải là điều chúng tôi đã thể hiện.
 Đây không phải là điều chúng ta có thể phân tích chi tiết.
 Bạn biết đấy, xét về tính khả thi, nếu đó là phối cảnh không gian trên mái nhà hoặc một nơi nào khác trên khu đất, hoặc bất kỳ loại phối cảnh kiến ​​trúc nào.
 Bạn biết đấy, những ảnh hưởng khác đến dự án, cho dù đó là chi phí, thiết kế hay bất cứ điều gì, điều đó là đúng.
 Đây là một câu trả lời mở và đây là chủ đề thảo luận của chúng tôi.
 Chúng tôi vẫn chưa có câu trả lời rõ ràng về việc liệu chúng tôi có kế hoạch sử dụng năng lượng mặt trời cho dự án này hay không.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2797.862s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Tiếp tục với những gì Mary nói, tôi nghĩ ở một thời điểm nào đó người ta cũng đề cập đến những thứ như khu vực sân thượng hay mái nhà xanh.
 Sẽ rất thú vị khi xem cách xử lý mái nhà sẽ như thế nào, đặc biệt là vì có khoảng năm và sáu tầng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2821.773s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Đúng, tôi nghĩ chúng ta có thể tiếp tục cải tiến thiết kế và kết hợp các yếu tố phản ánh hiệu ứng của mái nhà.
 Tôi nghĩ có lẽ để làm sáng tỏ một số nhầm lẫn, tôi nghĩ cái mà chúng tôi vẫn gọi là không gian mái xanh cho đến bây giờ sẽ nằm ở sân trên tầng hai, có thể nhìn thấy phía trên bãi đậu xe trong một số sơ đồ mặt bằng của chúng tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2856.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: tốt cảm ơn
 Hội đồng có câu hỏi hoặc ý kiến nào khác không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2868.589s">[Mary Lee]</a>: Vậy theo hiểu biết của tôi thì đây chỉ là kế hoạch dự thảo thôi phải không?
 Hay tôi nói, chúng ta đang ở giai đoạn nào của chương trình này, chương trình này đã hoàn thành 90% hay 70%?
 Bởi vì tôi có xu hướng đồng ý với Andre vì ấn tượng đầu tiên mà nó mang lại cho tôi khi nhìn thấy bức ảnh này là nó cho tôi ấn tượng về một nhà kho hơn là một căn hộ chung cư.
 Đây là ấn tượng đầu tiên.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ, rõ ràng, nếu đó không phải là kế hoạch đầy đủ thì có lẽ vẫn còn chỗ,
 Thực hiện thay đổi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2922.696s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, tôi hiểu.
 Ồ, tiếp tục đi, luật sư Tim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2928.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: À, tôi chỉ muốn trả lời câu hỏi của thành viên thôi.
 Kế hoạch dưới đây và hội đồng của bạn cũng có thể tư vấn cho bạn, nhưng tôi biết hội đồng đã thông qua một số giấy phép chung này để giải quyết vấn đề này.
 Về tỷ lệ hoàn thiện, luật cấp phép đầy đủ yêu cầu chúng tôi phải nộp thiết kế sơ bộ.
 Tôi nghĩ những điều này đã vượt quá tiêu chuẩn cơ bản ở giai đoạn này.
 Tôi nghĩ bạn và nhóm của bạn hiểu rằng chúng tôi có thể tinh chỉnh và cung cấp thêm chi tiết.
 Ví dụ, khi ông LaRue hỏi tôi về cách xử lý mái nhà, ít nhất là về mặt khái niệm, chúng tôi có thể nhận thấy rằng chúng tôi nghĩ rằng sẽ có những cơ sở vật chất khác nhau trên mái nhà, ít nhất là về mặt khái niệm.
 Nếu bạn muốn xem chi tiết cụ thể,
 Chúng ta có thể vượt qua chúng.
 Nhưng chúng tôi hy vọng được làm việc với bạn để cung cấp thêm các yếu tố về điều kiện dự đoán chi tiết và dự án trong tương lai.
 Vì vậy, ở cấp độ giấy phép đầy đủ này, bạn sẽ không bao giờ nhận được 100% bản vẽ thiết kế.
 v.v., nhưng những ý tưởng được thể hiện ở mức độ lớn hơn lại tập trung vào những lĩnh vực nhạy cảm này, chẳng hạn như rau dền.
 Đây là điều chúng ta thực sự có thể tập trung vào, nhưng nó vẫn ở mức độ sơ bộ.
 Chỉ khi có được giấy phép xây dựng, bạn mới có thể đảm bảo cho dự án cuối cùng và quyết định của bạn sẽ phản ánh điều này.
 Tôi chỉ muốn nói thẳng về mức độ cụ thể của chúng tôi.
 Ở nhiều thành phố và nhiều dự án, và tôi nghĩ ở các dự án khác ở Medford, cấp độ thiết kế ý tưởng này sẽ phù hợp để xem xét và phê duyệt giấy phép đầy đủ.
 Rõ ràng, chúng tôi muốn giải quyết những lo ngại của Hội đồng trong bất kỳ bình luận nào của công chúng và sẽ tiếp tục làm như vậy.
 Nhưng ví dụ, kế hoạch xây dựng được Eric xem xét đã đủ để phê duyệt ở giai đoạn này.
 Điều chúng tôi thực sự đang nói đến là ấn tượng chủ quan và thiết kế thẩm mỹ, và chúng tôi sẽ dẫn đầu trong bước này.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy, sẽ không có mức độ lập kế hoạch như vậy.
 Nếu bạn muốn biết thêm chi tiết về các tính năng thiết kế và thành phần, chúng tôi sẽ cố gắng hết sức để cung cấp chúng cho bạn.
 Có, chúng tôi sẽ không bao gồm các tài liệu xây dựng như một phần của việc này.
 Tôi đoán điều khác là ấn tượng rằng đây là một tòa nhà công nghiệp.
 Vâng, có một tòa nhà công nghiệp và dấu chân của nó.
 Đây là khu công nghiệp.
 Có kho công nghiệp ngay bên cạnh.
 Như Eric đã nói, chúng tôi mượn thiết kế này từ những kỹ thuật này.
 Tôi nghĩ mỗi người sẽ có quan điểm riêng của mình.
 Ý kiến ​​​​cá nhân của tôi là nó trông giống như bất kỳ 40B nào khác được thành phố phê duyệt và xây dựng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3166.823s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tất cả đều ổn.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Tôi có một câu hỏi làm rõ cho Cliff Bomer.
 Tôi chỉ muốn đảm bảo rằng chúng ta sẽ giải quyết xong mọi việc tối nay để nếu có bất kỳ tranh chấp nào, tất cả chúng ta đều có thể thống nhất quan điểm.
 Vì vậy chúng ta nói về vật chất.
 Chúng ta đã thảo luận về vấn đề khớp nối.
 Chúng tôi đã thảo luận các chi tiết khác trong chế độ xem mái nhà.
 Thưa ông Bomer, ông có kỳ vọng cụ thể nào về những chi tiết sửa đổi mà hiện tại chưa thể thực hiện được?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3210.995s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Vâng, đó là một câu hỏi hay.
 Tôi không thể trả lời chi tiết.
 Hãy để tôi thư giãn.
 Tôi nghĩ lập luận của Luật sư Tấn có lý vì bản thân luật đã nói về quy hoạch sơ bộ.
 Tôi nghĩ những gì chúng ta đang thấy ở ứng viên này là một ý chí
 Tôi nghĩ tất cả các bên đều đồng ý rằng đây là những cải tiến đối với tòa nhà.
 Vì vậy, theo quan điểm của tôi, tôi nghĩ đây có lẽ là lúc tôi gặp một số vấn đề với Thời gian, đối với tôi cách tòa nhà phản ứng với bối cảnh hiện tại và thích ứng với mô hình phát triển có liên quan đến tính thẩm mỹ.
 Tôi tin rằng có một nghĩa vụ ở mặt tiền chính đối diện với phạm vi công cộng.
 Tôi thực sự thích khái niệm bằng chứng khái niệm mà luật sư đề cập.
 Tôi hoàn toàn đồng ý với điều này. Tôi nghĩ điều mà ủy ban cần biết là những hình ảnh họ nhìn thấy là
 Đặt nó ở một nơi tốt và cho thấy rằng một cái gì đó đang đi đúng hướng.
 Họ không tạo ra mức độ chi tiết cao.
 Đó không phải là điều họ được yêu cầu làm và họ không cần phải làm như vậy.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng theo quan điểm của tôi, sơ đồ mái nhà và vị trí đặt thiết bị cơ khí là quan trọng.
 Không phải chúng ta đang nhìn vào thiết bị cơ khí sao?
 đủ rồi
 Bảo vệ khỏi phạm vi công cộng.
 Tôi muốn xem thêm về tầng trệt, nơi có bãi đậu xe trên mặt đất, liên quan đến mặt tiền phía tây của tòa nhà.
 Thế là xong
 Giống như, tôi muốn xem, điều tôi thực sự muốn thấy là, tôi nghĩ rằng mỗi lần họ làm vậy, họ đều thể hiện rằng họ thực sự lắng nghe những gì bạn đang nói.
 Sau đó tôi sẽ đợi một đợt phân tích sâu hơn
 Tính thẩm mỹ của tòa nhà nhưng cách chúng giúp tòa nhà hòa hợp hoặc tìm ra sự cân bằng phù hợp giữa vẻ ngoài công nghiệp nhưng có lẽ vẫn liên quan đến một số nhịp điệu và quy mô của môi trường xung quanh.
 Vì vậy tôi không thể, thật khó để tôi có thể tóm tắt mọi thứ trong một, nếu tôi có thời gian để viết một ghi chú, tôi sẽ mong đợi điều gì,
 Ngoài ra, ít nhất là ở cấp độ mà tôi đã thấy ở nhiều cộng đồng, đặc biệt nếu có những ứng viên muốn làm việc với bạn.
 Tôi nghĩ sẽ là một cơ hội bị bỏ lỡ nếu họ không tiếp tục tinh thần này và xem xét một số ý tưởng về cách kết thúc thánh lễ.
 cũng như cung cấp một số thủ công cơ bản hơn.
 Như tôi đã nói, sơ đồ mái nhà rất quan trọng trong trường hợp này vì chúng ta cần biết những gì có thể nhìn thấy từ đường phố.
 Nếu ý kiến ​​đó không chính xác thì tôi sẽ không khuyến khích hội đồng quản trị đưa ra quyết định dựa trên quan điểm đó cho đến khi tôi thực sự tin rằng ứng viên có sự ràng buộc.
 Trình bày hình ảnh chính xác.
 Chúng thực sự đại diện cho một cái gì đó rất gần với những gì Quốc hội và công chúng sẽ thấy khi nó thực sự được xây dựng.
 Vì vậy chúng ta cần xác định một số trong số chúng.
 Vì vậy, tôi khuyến khích bạn quay lại với một số ý tưởng về cách thực hiện điều này.
 Tìm hiểu thêm về loại tòa nhà.
 Về phần cây cối, tôi đồng ý rằng chúng rất gần nhau, nhưng như tôi đã nói lúc đầu, tôi không làm vậy, vì tôi quá tập trung vào việc quy hoạch mặt bằng nên tôi không xem sơ đồ mặt bằng một cách chi tiết, nhưng chúng ở mức độ mà tôi thường thấy, và tôi nghĩ từ thời điểm này trở đi, là hiện vật.
 Nếu tôi thấy có sự vi phạm mã nghiêm trọng, bạn sẽ mong đợi phản hồi từ tôi.
 Bạn biết đấy, cấp độ này cũng gần như là một thực tế, rằng những gì bạn thấy trong sơ đồ thực sự có thể thực hiện được theo thông số kỹ thuật và tôi muốn có cơ hội để bình luận về điều đó.
 Tôi sẽ chỉ ra, và tôi biết các kiến trúc sư cũng biết,
 Tôi cũng chắc chắn Pat Newton biết điều này, có những yêu cầu thực tế về quy chuẩn xây dựng trên mái nhà để đảm bảo các tòa nhà có thể chuyển đổi sang sử dụng năng lượng mặt trời trên mái nhà trong tương lai, và ngay cả nếu bây giờ không có, thì vẫn có những yêu cầu rằng mái nhà phải được thiết kế theo cấu trúc để có thể tiếp nhận.
 Tôi nghĩ tất cả các nhà phát triển ngày nay sẽ đảm bảo rằng họ có đủ quyền truy cập vào phòng điện để lắp đặt các tấm pin mặt trời, ngay cả khi chúng chưa được lắp đặt trong quá trình xây dựng ban đầu.
 Vì thế tôi đã đi một chút, nhưng tôi rất vui vì đã sẵn sàng.
 Một bản ghi nhớ về những điều quan trọng mà tôi nghĩ có thể bị thiếu trong quá trình quảng bá bằng chứng về khái niệm.
 Tôi chỉ muốn đảm bảo rằng tôi có thời gian để suy nghĩ về điều này khi xét đến vật liệu mới.
 Nhưng hơn thế nữa, tôi khuyên bạn nên nghiên cứu thêm để vượt ra ngoài khái niệm về cách cân bằng
 Như tôi đã nói trước đây, vâng, hiện nay mỗi tiểu vương quốc đều có một thành phố thương mại thương mại, nhưng thực tế nó là một hình thức khá phức tạp, thú vị, đa dạng và rõ ràng.
 Đây là một cái nhìn tốt hơn về thành phố.
 Tôi nghĩ bạn có cơ hội ngắm cảnh thành phố đẹp, nhưng tôi nghĩ nó ở đó
 Nếu chúng ta xem xét một số mối quan ngại mà chúng ta đã nghe được tối nay, hãy thực hiện một vòng nữa để thực sự thúc đẩy mục tiêu của chính bạn.
 Vì vậy, xin lỗi nếu đây là một điều hơi vòng vo, nhưng tôi thực sự không thể, bạn biết đấy, trong một tuyên bố, một tuyên bố khác là gì?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3669.292s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: Thưa ngài Tổng thống, tôi sẽ vào rất nhanh.

 Vâng, xin vui lòng tiếp tục.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3677.017s">[SPEAKER_16]</a>: Có, tôi đồng ý với nhận xét của Luật sư Tâm và Cliff rằng đây trông giống như những bản vẽ và kế hoạch kiến ​​trúc đẹp được nộp theo 40B.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3690.346s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Thiết kế là một khía cạnh quan trọng và tôi nghĩ Cliff có cơ hội tốt để đánh giá kỹ lưỡng và các ứng viên dường như đang phản hồi lại nhận xét của anh ấy.
 Chà, nghĩa vụ của hội đồng quản trị là đảm bảo rằng dự án này có thể chấp nhận được, nhưng quan trọng hơn, chúng ta cần xem thêm các khía cạnh kỹ thuật của dự án này trong đơn xin cấp phép đầy đủ.
 Chúng ta đang nói về tác động đối với các dịch vụ công cộng như giao thông, nước mưa và kỹ thuật dân dụng.
 Tôi chắc chắn hội đồng quản trị biết điều đó.
 Tôi chắc chắn rằng các ứng viên biết điều đó.
 Tôi vừa đề cập rằng hội đồng sẽ không tham gia vào các cuộc thảo luận dài với nhiều khán giả thiết kế.
 Và, bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi đang đúng tiến độ.
 Chúng tôi bắt đầu xem xét các khía cạnh kỹ thuật hơn của dự án.
 Tôi nghĩ chúng tôi đã đạt được nhiều tiến bộ về mặt thiết kế, đó là điều tôi nghĩ.
 Tôi đoán bây giờ, nếu bạn có bất kỳ đề xuất nào, bạn biết đấy, có một số điều bạn có thể muốn xem xét,
 Sửa đổi thiết kế và có thể một số cập nhật cũng như ý kiến đóng góp bổ sung từ Cliff, thì có lẽ đã đến lúc phải nói, được rồi, chúng ta cần xem lại công trình dân dụng, chúng ta cần xem lại nước mưa, chúng ta cần xem lại giao thông.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3770.168s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, cảm ơn luật sư Elfin.
 Mục đích của cuộc họp tối nay của tôi là để hội đồng quản trị làm rõ mọi yếu tố thiết kế còn lại mà họ muốn xem thêm chi tiết hoặc thay đổi.
 Chúng tôi đã nhận được thông tin chi tiết về tình hình của anh ấy từ ông Bowmer.
 Tôi đồng ý với ý kiến chung
 Tôi cũng sẽ đánh giá cao bản ghi nhớ này trong tương lai gần.
 Vì vậy, nếu bạn có thể gửi cho chúng tôi một bản sao, Cliff, chúng tôi sẽ thực sự đánh giá cao điều đó.
 Nhưng những gì tôi nghe được là, bạn biết đấy, nhiều chi tiết hơn về mái nhà, chi tiết về tầm quan trọng, yêu cầu từ các nhà tư vấn và yêu cầu từ, bạn biết đấy,
 Baumer về những chiến lược đúng đắn để kết thúc Thánh Lễ.
 Tôi đã nghe thêm chi tiết bên dưới.
 Tôi nghĩ đây là những lĩnh vực chính thu hút sự chú ý của tôi.
 Vâng, như ông Baumer đã nói, bình luận về kế hoạch
 Họ rất thân thiết.
 Có vẻ như bạn đã có hầu hết các chi tiết bạn cần, nhưng chúng tôi chỉ muốn nghĩ về nó.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ chúng ta có thể sử dụng một cuộc họp khác về thiết kế, có thể tính đến tất cả những điều này.
 Nhưng tôi đồng ý với Luật sư Alfin.
 Chúng ta không thể để đây là một dự án không bao giờ kết thúc.
 Trên lịch chúng ta có thể có
 Chúng ta vẫn còn chỗ cho một cuộc họp thiết kế nữa và sau đó chúng ta sẽ phải đưa ra một số quyết định để duy trì đúng tiến độ.
 Bây giờ, đến cuộc họp dự kiến tiếp theo trong hai tuần nữa, trừ khi có bất kỳ
 Chà, những thay đổi cần thiết hoặc vấn đề tạo ra các tài liệu cần thiết thực sự là trọng tâm của kỹ thuật.
 Ừm, vậy nên chúng ta có thể thảo luận liệu điều đó có nên thay đổi hay không dựa trên cuộc thảo luận ngày hôm nay, nhưng vâng, chúng ta cần phải hội tụ thiết kế để chúng ta cũng có thể, ừm,
 Cung cấp đủ chi tiết về các yếu tố kỹ thuật để hội đồng quản trị có thể đánh giá mọi thứ mà chúng tôi phải đánh giá trong khung thời gian pháp lý.
 Đó là ý định của tôi.
 Hãy tiếp tục.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3927.624s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Không, tôi chỉ muốn, bạn biết đấy, thêm điều gì đó, ừm,
 Ờ, sơ đồ mặt bằng.
 Chúng quan trọng, và thật tốt khi Cliff đang xem xét chúng, nhưng trên thực tế, dựa trên đơn xin giấy phép đầy đủ, những kế hoạch đó có thể được sửa đổi sau khi có quyết định, cho dù đó là dựa trên, ừm, ừm, thỏa thuận quản lý để xem xét của tiểu bang, hay, ừ, thiết kế hoàn công, chúng có thể được sửa đổi nếu chúng không phải là những sửa đổi lớn, và chúng thường không như vậy.
 Khi bạn xem xét những sửa đổi quan trọng, bạn thường có thể bắt đầu từ 40B.
 Chúng ta không nên dành quá nhiều thời gian cho các vấn đề như sơ đồ tầng và kích thước căn hộ.
 Có một số đơn vị có phòng, v.v., nhưng đây chỉ là một khía cạnh có thể được quản lý tùy theo yêu cầu.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3984.346s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Nếu tôi có thể, thưa Tổng thống.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3988.356s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, Andrew làm ơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3990.077s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Ý tôi là, tôi chỉ muốn chỉ ra rằng vài tháng trước chúng tôi đã trải qua một quy trình cấp phép 40 B khác, nơi chúng tôi đã thảo luận một số chi tiết quan trọng về thiết kế và tôi nghĩ điều đó đã mang lại một dự án tốt hơn cho cộng đồng.
 Tôi nghĩ chúng tôi đã kế thừa quy mô của dự án này.
 Tin tôi đi, nếu tôi bắt đầu lại từ đầu, tôi sẽ không vẽ một hình chữ nhật khổng lồ ở giữa khu phố.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ chúng ta có nghĩa vụ phải làm mọi thứ có thể để đảm bảo dự án này.
 Quy mô của nó thực sự quan trọng và được tích hợp theo cách tốt nhất có thể.
 Về phần tôi, chúng tôi không nói chuyện.
 Chúng tôi không thực sự phân tích hoặc thảo luận về vấn đề đỗ xe.
 Chúng tôi vẫn chưa thảo luận về việc có bao nhiêu bãi đậu xe đạp.
 Chúng ta chưa nói về việc có bao nhiêu bộ sạc xe điện.
 Chúng tôi không nói về lập trình theo chiều ngang.
 Ngoài tất cả các vấn đề kỹ thuật mà bạn đề cập, chúng tôi không nói về nghệ thuật công cộng.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ muốn cắm cờ và nói rằng đây là những điều chúng ta nên nói đến.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4065.017s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Cảm ơn, Andrew.
 Có thể tôi nhớ nhầm.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng một số cuộc thảo luận tại phiên điều trần gần đây nhất về bãi đậu xe và giá để xe đạp có liên quan đến kỹ thuật, nhưng tôi hoàn toàn đồng ý rằng chúng hoàn toàn nên được thảo luận, cũng như cảnh quan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4082.101s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Mọi người vào và ra bằng cách nào?
 Chất thải vào và ra như thế nào?
 Tất cả những điều này.
 Công việc 40B cuối cùng chúng tôi làm là sự tiến bộ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4092.67s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Đúng, nhưng theo tôi nhớ, 40B cuối cùng thuộc về Kỹ thuật Xây dựng.
 Có thể tôi nhớ nhầm, nhưng đúng vậy, nếu ứng viên không có ý định gửi những thông tin chi tiết này, vui lòng lên kế hoạch gửi chúng.
 Hội đồng quản trị cần những chi tiết này.
 Tôi tin rằng chúng rất quan trọng đối với chức năng của tòa nhà.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4118.096s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Tuyệt đối.
 Một số thông tin này được bao gồm trong sơ đồ tầng của chúng tôi, cũng được bao gồm trong gói này.
 Tôi rất sẵn lòng trả lời bất kỳ câu hỏi nào về vấn đề này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4130.222s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, tôi đoán là cho đến nay.
 Chúng tôi chắc chắn có thể đặt câu hỏi về điều đó.
 Có ý định thảo luận chi tiết hơn về vấn đề này tại phiên điều trần trong tương lai không?
 Hay bạn muốn hội đồng quản trị đặt những câu hỏi cụ thể và sau đó giải quyết chúng theo cách đó?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4150.809s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Thưa ngài Chủ tịch, tôi có thể thay mặt cho Tập đoàn Davis phát biểu được không?
 tôi nghĩ
 Tôi nghĩ chúng tôi đã nghe rõ ý kiến của bạn và bắt đầu cuộc họp tiếp theo, ngoài các vấn đề dân sự, chúng tôi cũng có thể thảo luận về một số vấn đề vận hành này và chúng tôi có thể định lượng chúng.
 Hoặc xác định vị trí của chúng tôi về mặt vị trí (ít nhất là về mặt lưu trữ byte) đối với bãi đậu xe công cộng trả phí dành cho nghệ thuật.
 Chúng ta có thể thảo luận về kế hoạch cảnh quan và thảo luận về một số vấn đề vận hành liên quan.
 Nếu điều gì đó chưa được khái niệm hóa đầy đủ, chúng ta có thể đưa ra một tiêu chuẩn.
 Bạn biết đấy, nếu nó theo tỷ lệ, kích thước hoặc xấp xỉ, nó có thể là một phần của tình trạng.
 Điều này phù hợp với cấp độ thiết kế này.
 Tuy nhiên, chúng tôi sẽ không đánh mất điều này và tôi nghĩ chúng tôi sẽ háo hức xem lại bản ghi nhớ của Cliff và theo dõi thêm các chi tiết thiết kế dựa trên nhận xét và đề xuất của anh ấy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4220.455s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Được rồi, cảm ơn bạn.
 Andrew, điều đó ít nhất có làm giảm bớt phần nào mối lo ngại của bạn không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4227.229s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Vâng, ít hơn chỉ là ngón tay cái muốn đẩy tất cả các ý tưởng mà chúng tôi sẽ xem xét lại hoàn chỉnh.
 Tôi biết chúng ta sẽ sớm tổ chức một cuộc họp để thảo luận về một số vấn đề khác, nhưng những điều tôi đang nói đến và tôi muốn đảm bảo rằng chúng ta sẽ thảo luận về chúng và nếu cần, cả các điều kiện.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4254.242s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Jis pou reponn.

 Lúc này tôi sẽ kiểm tra với các thành viên trong hội đồng xem có thắc mắc hay ý kiến ​​gì khác không.
 Sau khi xem xét các câu hỏi và nhận xét của Hội đồng, tôi dự định để ngỏ khả năng nhận xét của công chúng về các thiết kế ý tưởng này.
 Nhưng trước tiên, tôi muốn đảm bảo rằng nếu bất kỳ thành viên hội đồng nào có thêm câu hỏi hoặc nhận xét, họ sẽ có cơ hội được lắng nghe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4345.665s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Tôi không có vấn đề gì.
 Tôi chỉ có một bình luận và tôi hoàn toàn ủng hộ những gì Andrew đã nói và đề cập.
 Và không chỉ có anh ấy.
 Vì vậy tôi chỉ muốn chắc chắn rằng chúng tôi rõ ràng.
 Tôi nghĩ hầu hết các thành viên của Hội đồng sẽ đồng ý với anh ấy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4364.47s">[Unidentified]</a>: Đúng.
 Tôi cũng đồng ý.
 Tôi kỳ vọng rằng những yếu tố này sẽ chủ yếu là công trình dân dụng.
 Một mục khác tôi muốn thêm vào danh sách này rõ ràng là kế hoạch chiếu sáng.
 Ngoài ra còn có những điểm kỹ thuật được một luật sư khác nêu ra.
 Đó là mục tiêu.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4385.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Đúng.

 Đợi một lát, và sau đó nếu có một khán giả nào đó, à, tôi thấy một khán giả nào đó giơ tay.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi đi đến họ đầu tiên.
 Gặp Allison D. Vui lòng cung cấp tên và địa chỉ của cô ấy để lưu vào hồ sơ của bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4499.191s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: chào ngài
 chào buổi tối
 Vâng, Alison D'Agostino.
 Tôi đại diện cho D'Agostino Trust, chủ sở hữu của 1022-1024 Fellsway.
 Tôi chỉ muốn bắt đầu lại và cảm ơn bạn đã cho tôi cơ hội được nói chuyện và nhìn thấy điều này.
 Thành thật mà nói, tôi đã học được rất nhiều điều trong suốt quá trình này.
 Vì vậy, tôi rất biết ơn về bài thuyết trình và phần thảo luận của hội thảo.
 Chỉ là một điều nhanh chóng.
 Thật ra tôi sẽ kỹ thuật hơn.
 Tôi chỉ muốn chấp nhận điều này
 Bạn biết đấy, tôi nghĩ luật sư Tan đã nói điều đó hay nhất.
 Đây là một không gian công nghiệp.
 Vì vậy, mặc dù tôi đánh giá cao đây là một dự án xây dựng công nghiệp, nhưng tại sao không xây dựng một tòa nhà công nghiệp tương tự như các dự án khác của công ty Davis tại nhà kho Amazon ở Chelsea?
 Điều đó có vẻ tốt đẹp.
 Đây là mục đích thiết kế ban đầu của không gian, nhưng tôi sẽ để lại nó dưới dạng nhận xét.
 Về khía cạnh kỹ thuật sử dụng, đã được đề cập nhiều lần trong cuộc họp vừa qua, xin cảm ơn rất nhiều
 Davis Charter cho biết sẽ mở rộng Phố Myrtle.
 Một điều chúng ta chưa thực sự thảo luận ở đây là khía cạnh thực tế.
 Có rất nhiều cột điện và cột điện dọc theo vỉa hè ở Myrtle.
 Việc mở rộng đường phố, mối quan tâm thực sự của tôi là vì hôm nọ tôi đang dắt chó đi dạo,
 Sau đó, bạn đến công ty sửa ống nước, thực ra nằm ở giao lộ giữa Myrtle và Fairsway.
 Đường bất động sản của bạn nằm ngay bên kia vỉa hè.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ chỉ có một vài câu hỏi, có thể bạn chưa biết chi tiết, điều này tôi đánh giá cao, nhưng khi bạn nói về việc uốn cong đường phố, kế hoạch sơ bộ về điện và tất cả các tiện ích này là gì, và sau đó bạn sẽ mở rộng đường ở giao lộ hiện tại của Fellsway và Myrtle thông qua khu đất này như thế nào?
 Hòa bình, có thể nói, bạn không sở hữu hình vuông nhỏ này.
 Một lần nữa, tôi nghĩ tài liệu này rất phù hợp với các dự án khác.
 Tôi thực sự coi dự án này như một trò cười thương mại, tôi xin lỗi vì cái tên, tôi nghĩ tôi đã cười một chút.
 Tôi nghĩ chất liệu có vẻ tốt.
 Tôi đồng ý rằng đây là một tòa nhà hình hộp lớn không phù hợp với cộng đồng.
 Đây chỉ là những nhận xét của tôi.
 Cảm ơn một lần nữa cho thời gian của bạn.
 Tôi thực sự biết ơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4672.525s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Vì vậy, tôi nhớ điều đó và tôi sẽ đảm bảo rằng chúng ta sẽ thảo luận vấn đề đó trong phần dân sự của phiên điều trần.
 Bởi vì đó không thực sự là vấn đề ở đây.
 Ý tôi là, nếu ứng viên muốn nói một chút về vấn đề, điều này chắc chắn được hoan nghênh, nhưng tôi không nhất thiết mong họ có sẵn câu trả lời.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ đó là điều chúng tôi dự định giải quyết trong phần dân sự của phiên điều trần.
 sau đó
 Tôi biết đây chỉ là một bình luận.
 Tất nhiên, ủy ban không có trách nhiệm đề xuất các cách sử dụng đất thay thế.
 Vì vậy, có, người đánh giá đã chỉ ra.
 Đây là hồ sơ công khai.
 Nhưng chúng tôi sẽ không tham gia trực tiếp.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4721.002s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Thưa ngài Chủ tịch, tôi sẽ vào và ít nhất cũng phải trả lời ngắn gọn để chúng ta không ở lại
 Làm cho mọi người cảm thấy rằng chúng ta đang giải quyết các vấn đề khi chúng phát sinh.
 Chúng tôi có thể và chắc chắn sẽ tìm hiểu sâu hơn các vấn đề cụ thể tại phiên điều trần tiếp theo.
 Bà D'Agostino, nếu bà không thể tham dự, kế hoạch hiện tại yêu cầu mở rộng Myrtle tiếp theo, vì vậy khi bà tiếp tục đi trên Myrtle về phía ngã tư Phố Chief, chúng tôi đang đề xuất mở rộng Myrtle ở một bên đường, ngang qua ranh giới tòa nhà Pipe Building.
 Vì vậy, từ các đường nét của tòa nhà, vâng, rất khó để nhìn thấy ở đây.
 Không, đó thực sự không phải mục đích của buổi diễn tối nay.
 Nhưng đúng vậy, từ điểm này đi lên đồi, các vạch vỉa hè về cơ bản vẫn giữ nguyên và đi xuống.
 Uh, kế hoạch là di chuyển về phía tây và chúng tôi đề xuất mở rộng Phố Myrtle trên khu đất mà chúng tôi sở hữu và kiểm soát liên quan đến các cột điện.
 Chúng tôi có thể trình bày vấn đề này chi tiết hơn ở phiên điều trần tiếp theo và đây là thông tin nhận được ở phiên điều trần trước, nhưng mọi người không thể nhìn rõ mặt bằng.
 Đó không phải là ý định của chúng tôi.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi dự định trình bày vấn đề này chi tiết hơn, nhưng, ừm.
 Đối với các nhóm tiện ích hiện có, chúng tôi dự định giữ nguyên chúng.
 Họ kết nối với khu nhà ở phía bên kia Phố Myrtle và chúng tôi không muốn làm điều đó.
 Chúng tôi không có kế hoạch di chuyển chúng hoặc ngừng cung cấp bất kỳ dịch vụ nào cho chúng.
 Sau đó là đường cong.
 Kế hoạch di dời của chúng tôi xoay quanh chúng, thực sự tạo ra một khoảng trống trên Phố Myrtle để ô tô có thể đỗ bên ngoài khu vực lưu thông, nhưng nó cũng bảo tồn các khoảng trống trên vỉa hè để các cột vẫn giữ nguyên vị trí.
 Đó lại là câu trả lời ngắn gọn.
 Tôi chỉ muốn cung cấp một cái gì đó.
 Vậy là cảm xúc của bạn khác với cảm xúc của chúng tôi.
 Bằng cách điều hướng đến đây, chúng ta có thể thảo luận vấn đề này chi tiết hơn sau hai tuần.
 Hãy cho mọi người biết về những lời khuyên của chúng tôi về những bãi cỏ sạch sẽ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4856.667s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Cảm ơn, tôi chỉ muốn nói, cảm ơn.
 Tôi biết tôi không nên bận tâm nữa, nhưng cảm ơn.
 Điều này giúp làm rõ một số vấn đề này.
 Vì vậy tôi cảm ơn bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4866.834s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Sau đó tôi thấy một khán giả khác giơ tay đỡ Christina.
 Bạn có thể cho biết tên và địa chỉ để đăng ký được không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4875.96s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Trân trọng, Christina Kach, 130 Phố Myrtle, Medford.
 Tôi có một câu hỏi làm rõ nhanh và sau đó là một câu hỏi về thiết kế.
 Nghiên cứu về ô nhiễm ánh sáng và tiếng ồn có trở thành một phần của kỹ thuật hoặc thiết kế dân dụng không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4898.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng các nghiên cứu về ô nhiễm ánh sáng và sự ô nhiễm của nó, tôi không chắc liệu chúng có được thực hiện thường xuyên hay không.
 Triển lãm nghĩa vụ.
 Thế là, ít ai nghĩ rằng kế hoạch đang thắp sáng giai đoạn kết bạn của jei.
 Cờ tướng hành lý gì đặc biệt?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4919.395s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Vâng, vâng.
 Bạn sẽ xây một tòa nhà lớn trước căn hộ của tôi.
 Sẽ có nhiều cư dân, tiếng ồn, động vật, ánh sáng hơn.
 Cảnh quan, hệ thống chiếu sáng công cộng trước đây chưa từng tồn tại trên con phố này sẽ xâm chiếm cuộc sống hàng ngày của chúng ta, đặc biệt là đối với những người làm việc tại nhà.
 Ngoài ra vào ban đêm, nếu chúng ta đi ngủ sớm, các thiết bị còn tạo ra ô nhiễm ánh sáng, không chỉ ở ngoài vườn mà còn ở các bụi dền trong nhà.
 Đó là lý do tại sao tôi tin rằng ô nhiễm tiếng ồn và ô nhiễm ánh sáng cần được nghiên cứu.
 chất lượng cuộc sống cho cư dân hiện hữu.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4964.733s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tôi hiểu.
 Cảm ơn đã làm rõ.
 Có, chủ đề được chia thành các loại.
 Sau đó, các công chức sẽ đưa ra một kế hoạch chiếu sáng để cho phép mọi người hiểu được vị trí của đèn và những khu vực nào có thể gây ra chúng.
 Bạn biết đấy, ánh sáng ảnh hưởng đến những ngôi nhà lân cận.
 Đây chắc chắn là điều chúng ta có thể xem xét.
 Tôi nghĩ vị trí cửa sổ và các thứ quan trọng hơn.
 Tòa nhà, và sau đó, bạn biết đấy, nếu có hệ thống cách âm, v.v., tôi biết có những quy tắc cho việc đó, nhưng tôi nghĩ, nó sẽ văn minh.
 Vì vậy, vâng, một số điều này đề cập đến điều đó, nhưng cần nói rõ hơn, liệu người đặt câu hỏi có thể sửa tôi nếu tôi sai không, tôi không nghĩ vậy.
 Sẽ có các cuộc triển lãm dành riêng cho chi tiết nghiên cứu ô nhiễm ánh sáng và nghiên cứu ô nhiễm tiếng ồn.
 Thay vào đó, chúng ta sẽ nói về những thứ như ánh sáng và cách âm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5038.389s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Thưa Chủ tịch, đúng vậy.
 Kế hoạch chiếu sáng sẽ được kỹ sư xây dựng xem xét cuối cùng sẽ bao gồm kế hoạch đo quang.
 Thể hiện sự tuân thủ và giảm thiểu sự truyền ánh sáng từ ánh sáng bên ngoài.
 Về tiếng ồn, ngoài các yêu cầu quy định, rõ ràng còn có quy định về tiếng ồn của thành phố.
 Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu có một máy phát âm thanh cụ thể
 Các vấn đề cần quan tâm như thiết bị trên mái nhà thường có thể là trọng tâm của việc đánh giá kiến trúc và dân dụng nhằm giảm thiểu những tác động này.
 Nhưng đây là những yếu tố mà hội đồng thường xem xét.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5097.163s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Christina, điều đó có trả lời được câu hỏi của bạn không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5103.393s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Anh ấy đã trả lời câu hỏi của tôi.
 Tôi hơi thất vọng.
 Sẽ không đi sâu hơn vào những vấn đề này, nhưng tôi sẽ đưa ra bất kỳ bình luận nào thêm về vấn đề này sau phiên tòa dân sự.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5115.72s">[Unidentified]</a>: Vâng, tôi có bức ảnh đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5118.462s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Vâng, tôi cũng có một câu hỏi cụ thể về thiết kế.
 Tôi nghĩ cái này dành cho Cube 3.
 bạn đã đề cập
 Ông sở hữu bốn bất động sản ở Medford và đang thực hiện một loạt dự án khác.
 Vì vậy, tôi hỏi vì bạn có một số căn hộ trống trong bốn căn hộ áp mái của mình.
 Bao gồm một số khiếm khuyết tồn tại trong dự án trước đây của bạn trong thiết kế của tòa nhà này để đảm bảo rằng chúng không tái diễn ở bất động sản mới này.
 Vì vậy, tôi đang xem cách bạn có thể sử dụng các đánh giá sau khi khám nghiệm tử thi về các tòa nhà trước đó để đưa ra quyết định tốt hơn cho đơn vị này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5166.021s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Vì vậy, trong trường hợp này tôi sẽ thử
 Đặt nó dưới thẩm quyền của Hội đồng.
 Tôi sẽ lặp lại câu hỏi bởi vì, bạn biết đấy, có yếu tố cụ thể nào được nêu chi tiết trong các kế hoạch này cho dự án này kết hợp các phương pháp hay nhất và bài học rút ra từ các dự án khác trong lĩnh vực này không?
 Vì vậy, nếu ứng viên muốn nói về bất kỳ chi tiết nào trong số này, hãy tiếp tục.
 chắc chắn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5188.814s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Đúng.
 Ý tôi là, rõ ràng là chúng tôi luôn học hỏi và cố gắng học hỏi từ các dự án trước đó.
 Tôi nghĩ một điều bạn phải ghi nhớ là chúng tôi đang làm việc với các nhà phát triển khác nhau ở đây chứ không phải các cơ sở kinh doanh khác.
 Vì vậy, một số điều chúng tôi đã làm ở các khách sạn trước đây không áp dụng cho những gì chúng tôi đang làm ở đây, tùy thuộc vào khách hàng và địa điểm mà chúng tôi đang hợp tác.
 Nhưng chúng tôi luôn cố gắng học hỏi từ những điều chúng tôi đã làm sai và những điều chúng tôi đã làm đúng và cố gắng áp dụng những điều đó vào dự án tiếp theo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5222.194s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Thưa ngài Tổng thống, đây chỉ là vấn đề thông tin.
 Bạn thực sự có thể nói rõ điều đó với cư dân Buttes đang nói và nghe tối nay không? Nếu bạn có đề xuất cụ thể về cách quản lý (chẳng hạn như ánh sáng, tiếng ồn hoặc các yếu tố khác của cảnh quan), bạn có thể?
 Vui lòng cho thành phố hoặc chúng tôi biết để chúng tôi có thể đảm bảo rằng đó là một phần yêu cầu hoặc bạn biết đấy, một phần trong phân tích của chúng tôi.
 Cảm ơn</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5255.977s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Đúng, nhưng ý tôi là, tôi là kỹ sư công nghiệp, không phải kỹ sư xây dựng.
 Vì vậy, tôi cần kỹ sư xây dựng cho tôi thứ gì đó để làm việc trước.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5265.004s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, dựa trên quan điểm của Andrew, tôi nghĩ về tổng thể, biểu đồ,
 Công chúng được chào đón để đặt câu hỏi và bình luận.
 Như bạn có thể thấy trong các cuộc họp này, và ít nhất tôi hy vọng rằng điều tôi đang nói là hội đồng quản trị cố gắng đảm bảo rằng nếu bạn nêu một câu hỏi hoặc điều gì đó mà hội đồng quản trị chưa xem xét hoặc yêu cầu, thì cuối cùng chúng tôi sẽ làm việc với ứng viên đó và ứng viên đó trả lời cũng như đưa ra những chi tiết này, và ứng viên đó đã trả lời cho đến nay.
 Vì vậy, tôi đoán, nói về quan điểm của Andrew,
 Nếu bạn có một ý tưởng, cho dù đó là bình luận trực tiếp với thành phố hay trong một buổi điều trần công khai, nó vẫn có thể hữu ích ngay cả khi nó không đến từ một địa phương có chuyên môn.
 Bạn có thể chia sẻ ý tưởng này dưới dạng bình luận được ghi lại không?
 Sau đó, điều này có thể khơi dậy một cuộc thảo luận hoặc bình luận bao gồm các chuyên gia trong lĩnh vực cụ thể, những người thể hiện tinh thần của ý tưởng.
 Vì vậy, vâng, tôi nghĩ nếu tôi hiểu chính xác về bạn Andrew, bạn muốn nói rõ điều đó với người dân,
 Các ý tưởng đều được hoan nghênh và có những diễn đàn nơi người dân có thể bày tỏ những ý tưởng đó, tại đây hoặc với thành phố.
 Đặc biệt nếu bạn đưa những ý tưởng này vào một mốc thời gian tương tự hoặc trước một cuộc thảo luận tập trung liên quan đến vấn đề này, hội đồng quản trị có thể thảo luận và động não với các ứng viên.
 Điều đó có công bằng không, Andrew?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5367.772s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Đúng.
 Nó có thể đơn giản như bạn không muốn đèn tòa nhà sáng đối diện với tòa nhà của bạn hoặc bạn có thể muốn nhiều ánh sáng hơn vì điều đó tốt hơn cho an toàn công cộng.
 Tôi không biết.
 Những điều như thế.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5381.754s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: được rồi

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5463.805s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Ừm, thấy rồi, ừ, cứ tiếp tục đi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5467.25s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: tại sao không
 Có một điều: trong khi các kiến trúc sư đang làm việc này, tôi muốn xem nó là gì.
 Sơ đồ hoặc sơ đồ này dành cho tầng một xung quanh tòa nhà.
 Bạn biết đấy, một lần nữa chúng tôi đang xem xét nhiều hơn.
 Tuy nhiên, sang một bên.
 Toàn bộ tầng một trống rỗng.
 Tôi tự hỏi liệu nó có thể là khu vực dành cho tranh tường, tác phẩm nghệ thuật công cộng khác, bức tường xanh nào đó hay không.
 Tôi muốn biết chuyện gì đang xảy ra ở đó để nó không chỉ là một bức tường trống.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5528.08s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tôi thấy một số chuyển động đầu.
 Chúng ta có thể giải quyết vấn đề này trong phiên điều trần trong tương lai không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5532.502s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Có, chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ xem xét vấn đề này và lên kế hoạch phản hồi tại phiên điều trần trong tương lai.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5538.944s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Đặc biệt.
 Điều duy nhất tôi muốn nói thêm với ông Chủ tịch là tôi nghĩ chúng tôi có thể trả lời ông LaRue và chắc chắn chúng tôi có thể đưa ra một số ý tưởng và khả năng thay thế để hội đồng quản trị xem xét các loại yếu tố thiết kế này ở cấp độ này.
 Điều này có thể đại diện và sau đó thông báo cho hội đồng những yêu cầu chi tiết nào có thể được phản ánh trong kế hoạch cuối cùng.
 Vì vậy, bạn sẽ có mục tiêu thiết kế về những gì bạn muốn đạt được về mặt phát hiện, suy giảm hoặc cung cấp một số kích hoạt, cho dù điều này là trong bức tranh tường hay trong kế hoạch cuối cùng.
 Tôi không chắc liệu chúng ta có còn có khái niệm nghệ thuật công cộng nữa không, bạn biết đấy, X phần trăm bức tường nên được dành riêng cho nghệ thuật công cộng.
 Nhưng chúng tôi chắc chắn có thể cung cấp một tiêu chuẩn và một số ý tưởng cho các khung hình để bạn xem xét.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5606.611s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Đúng, tôi nghĩ việc trình bày sẽ hữu ích, ít nhất nó cho phép các cuộc thảo luận hữu hình sẽ hình thành nên thiết kế cuối cùng.
 Tất cả đều ổn.
 Chúng tôi rất biết ơn.
 Bây giờ tuyệt vời.
 Bây giờ chúng ta hãy chuyển sang vấn đề hậu cần.
 Vậy là nó đã được xác nhận một cách gián tiếp, nhưng tôi chỉ muốn kiểm tra lại thôi.
 Vì vậy, trong hai tuần, khu vực trọng tâm của quy hoạch là khu dân dụng và có vẻ như chúng tôi đang tiến hành xem xét khu vực này cũng như quy hoạch cảnh quan.
 Mọi cập nhật được thảo luận hôm nay có thể không được phản ánh theo định dạng đã định mà chỉ đơn giản là cập nhật chung về các chủ đề được thảo luận hôm nay sau hai tuần.
 Chúng tôi đang trên đường đạt được mục tiêu này.
 Tôi có hiểu đúng không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5666.923s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Vâng, thưa Chủ tịch, đó là kế hoạch của chúng tôi khi quay lại hai tuần nữa để tiếp tục thảo luận dân sự.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5675.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tất cả đều ổn.
 Vì vậy, ông Bowmer, ông dự kiến ​​khi nào sẽ nhận được bản ghi nhớ này để hội đồng quản trị và các ứng viên xem xét, chính xác là ông muốn xem những gì khác?
 Có lẽ là thứ Hai, đại loại thế, một hoặc hai ngày, tuần sau.
 Đặc biệt.
 Có vẻ tốt.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Nếu bây giờ ứng viên muốn nói cụ thể hơn, tôi sẽ nói chuyện với anh ấy.
 Xu hướng hiện tại của tôi là linh hoạt với các phiên điều trần được lên lịch trong bốn tuần, ít nhiều tùy thuộc vào diễn biến của các bài báo và cuộc thảo luận trong hai tuần.
 Nó có vẻ hợp lý?
 Hay bạn muốn biết rõ điều gì sẽ xảy ra sau bốn tuần nữa?
 Chương trình nghị sự sẽ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5736.39s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Tôi nghĩ chúng ta có thể linh hoạt hơn một chút.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng rõ ràng, tùy thuộc vào cách khán giả đi trong hai tuần, nếu có những điều cần phải tuân theo, chúng tôi chắc chắn muốn có thể theo dõi những điều này, cũng như theo dõi các yếu tố kiến ​​trúc tối nay.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng, nếu có thể, nếu có nội dung cần được làm rõ về nhiều chủ đề, thì đó có thể là một phiên điều trần dịch vụ công, nơi chúng tôi có thể đề cập đến nhiều chủ đề.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5766.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Được rồi, cảm ơn.
 Tôi chỉ muốn cho công chúng biết, nên tiếp theo trên lịch là, xin lỗi, tôi vừa kiểm tra nó trên lịch của mình.
 Phiên điều trần sau đó sẽ được tổ chức vào ngày 11 tháng 4.
 Chúng ta sẽ thảo luận về vấn đề dân sự.
 Tương tự với kế hoạch làm vườn và một số cập nhật dựa trên đối tượng này.
 Phiên điều trần tiếp theo sẽ được tổ chức vào ngày 23/4.
 Ở đây chúng tôi đang duy trì chương trình làm việc linh hoạt, nhưng chúng tôi muốn xem một trong những chủ đề được thảo luận chi tiết hơn.
 Thiết kế các bản cập nhật dựa trên những gì Hội đồng và công chúng đã đề cập hôm nay và bản ghi nhớ của ông Bowmer.
 Vâng, đó là điều chúng ta có thể mong đợi tiếp theo, thưa ngài.
 Tất cả đều ổn.
 Tôi nghĩ chúng ta đã đề cập đến tất cả bốn lĩnh vực chủ đề của hội nghị này.
 Tôi chỉ muốn kiểm tra với ứng viên xem có chuyện gì khác đang xảy ra không.
 Bạn có muốn nói chuyện tối nay không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5855.69s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Thưa ngài Tổng thống, không phải chúng tôi.
 Cảm ơn bạn đã dành thời gian và ý kiến ​​​​của bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5861.274s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, cảm ơn bạn.
 Tôi cũng đánh giá cao chi tiết và thời gian.
 Thật tốt khi thấy sự tiến bộ vẫn tiếp tục ở đây.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi mong đợi cuộc họp trong hai tuần.
 sau đó
 Hiện Chủ tịch đang chờ kiến nghị tiếp tục vụ việc cho đến 6h30 chiều ngày 11/4.
 Tôi đã di chuyển.
 Có một giây không?
 thứ hai.
 Tôi sẽ gọi điện thoại.
 Jim?
 Đúng.
 Jamie?
 Andrew?
 Đúng.
 Everett?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5906.331s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: May mắn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5907.332s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: vi mô?
 Đúng.
 Vụ việc này kéo dài đến ngày 11/4.
 Vì vậy, cảm ơn bạn bè.
 Vì vậy, đây là mục chính duy nhất trong chương trình nghị sự.
 Có một số yếu tố thủ tục.
 Dennis, bạn có thể đọc bài viết sau đây không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5923.985s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: chắc chắn.
 Chúng tôi có bản cập nhật quản trị và tôi muốn nói rằng bản cập nhật này chỉ nhằm mục đích cung cấp thông tin.
 Tôi sẽ không có mặt.
 Tôi sẽ ở đó, tôi sẽ đi.
 Vì vậy, tôi sẽ ra ngoài vào thứ Hai, thứ Tư hoặc thứ Năm tới, tùy thuộc vào thời điểm tôi quay lại.
 Vì vậy, nếu có thứ gì đó xuất hiện, tôi sẽ đảm bảo bạn nhận được mọi thứ có trong đó.
 Vì vậy, bạn biết đấy, giống như Cliff và Beta và mọi người, họ sẽ gửi chúng cho bạn và bạn biết đấy, khi tôi đi vắng, họ sẽ cập nhật nó trên trang web.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5952.552s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vậy là mọi thứ đều ổn.
 Vậy là có một kế hoạch dành cho ai đó, ừm, trở thành,
 Bạn có thể giúp chúng tôi giao hàng khi bạn đi vắng hay chúng tôi nên đợi cho đến khi bạn quay lại?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5967.744s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Không không.
 Lên kế hoạch ít hơn là yoony yon.
 Vì vậy, khi điều này xảy ra, tôi sẽ chắc chắn rằng, bạn biết đấy, tôi nghĩ kế hoạch này, kế hoạch hào phóng mà tôi sẽ thực hiện khi tôi ra đi, có lẽ chính xác hơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5980.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Xuất sắc.
 Có vẻ tốt.
 Nhưng cảm ơn vì đã cập nhật.
 Tôi nghĩ điểm tiếp theo là biên bản cuộc họp.
 Tôi đang gửi cho bạn một bản sao.
 Gần đây.
 Vâng, chờ đã.
 Tôi thấy Hiệu trưởng Haas giơ tay.
 Hãy tiếp tục.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5998.488s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Tôi sẽ tận dụng mọi cơ hội để nhắc bạn rằng chúng tôi đang làm việc với các nhà tư vấn quy hoạch để có những thông tin mới nhất.
 Nếu ai đó muốn gặp riêng anh ấy hoặc ai đó trong nhóm của anh ấy, chúng tôi có thể sắp xếp việc đó.
 Tôi rất thích đọc nếu bạn có ý tưởng về những gì bạn muốn xem.
 Hoặc nếu bạn muốn nó đi họp thì bạn có thể làm ở cuộc họp công cộng chẳng hạn.
 Hãy suy nghĩ về những gì bạn muốn thấy trong sự thay đổi quy hoạch.
 Tôi chỉ muốn nhắc bạn rằng quá trình này đang được tiến hành vì Danielle và tôi hầu như họp với các nhà tư vấn hàng tuần và Hội đồng Thành phố họp trong các cuộc họp ủy ban.
 Khoảng hai tuần một lần, cũng có một cuộc họp công khai.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ hy vọng rằng mọi người sẽ thêm nội dung có tính đến điều đó.
 Hãy bắt đầu với vấn đề hành chính.
 Vì vậy, nếu bạn đang gặp vấn đề với việc quản lý phân vùng, bây giờ là thời điểm tốt để cho chúng tôi biết.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6063.775s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, wi, mèsi, Direktè Hunter.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6127.072s">[Unidentified]</a>: À, không, tôi có một cuộc chia tay thường xuyên.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6148.938s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Tin nhắn ngày 14 tháng 3, tôi biết họ đã gửi nó cho mọi người và tôi chỉ muốn phản hồi.
 Tôi tưởng đã gửi hết nhưng gửi nhiều quá nên không chắc chắn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6164.845s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Vâng, tôi 314 tuổi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6173.509s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Tôi biết nó đã được gửi cho mọi người vào ngày 30 tháng 1.
 Tôi sẽ quay lại email đã được gửi.
 Và có rất nhiều.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6187.912s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Được rồi, được rồi, tôi sẽ kiểm tra với hội đồng quản trị.
 Như vậy ta có các biên bản từ ngày 30/1, ngày 3/1 đến ngày 14/1. Các thành viên có cơ hội để xem xét chúng không?
 Tôi nhận được một vài cái gật đầu.
 Chà, Jamie, tôi thấy bạn lắc đầu.
 Có, sau khi xem chúng, bạn thấy các đánh giá đó như thế nào?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6218.416s">[Unidentified]</a>: Lần lượt là ngày 14 tháng 1 và ngày 14 tháng 3.
 Cả hai đều có vẻ tốt với tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6225.443s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, vâng, tôi cũng có cơ hội xem lại chúng.
 Họ trông chính xác.
 Dennis, tôi muốn chắc chắn rằng nếu chúng ta làm mất biên bản, họ sẽ gửi chúng cho chúng ta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6239.775s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Rachel làm những thứ này nên việc cô ấy gửi chúng cho bạn chỉ là vấn đề.
 Trước khi bạn đi, vâng, có lẽ chúng tôi có thể đặt tất cả chúng vào một thư mục và bạn có thể gửi tất cả cho chúng tôi. Vâng, thực ra tất cả chúng đều có trong Google Drive, chỉ là đối với những thứ này, tôi sẽ phê duyệt và không phê duyệt ở hai tệp khác nhau. Tôi sẽ chỉ gửi cho bạn một liên kết tới Google Drive để bạn có thể đăng nhập.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6260.557s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Trên thực tế, điều này sẽ hiệu quả. Tôi nghĩ có, điều đó thật tốt vì tôi không thể tìm thấy cái từ tháng Ba.
 Tôi có ngày 11, 25 và 30 tháng 1.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6271.473s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Nhưng khi tôi gửi nó cho bạn vào thứ Sáu tuần trước, tôi đã không thấy tháng Ba nào nữa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6276.139s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, đó là rất gần đây.
 Bạn muốn nói điều gì đó.
 Không, tôi chỉ đồng ý thôi.
 Vâng, được rồi.
 Chà, bây giờ chúng ta đang nói về ngày 30 tháng 1 và ngày 14 tháng 3.
 Vì vậy, vâng, một số thành viên hội đồng quản trị dường như cho rằng biên bản đó là chính xác.
 Sau đó, Chủ tịch nước chờ đề nghị phê chuẩn biên bản các cuộc họp ngày 30/1 và 14/3.
 Tôi có một giây không?
 Được rồi, hãy gọi điện nhé.
 Jim?

 Đúng.

 Đúng.

 Được rồi, biên bản đã được phê duyệt, cảm ơn trước, Dennis.
 Chúng tôi sẽ xem xét các vấn đề còn lại và giải quyết chúng trong cuộc họp tiếp theo.
 hãy xem nào
 Các bạn thân mến, tôi xin nhắc các bạn rằng tôi sẽ vắng mặt trong phiên điều trần hôm thứ Năm.
 Jamie đề nghị được dẫn chương trình.
 Jamie, tôi có một số chi tiết muốn chia sẻ với bạn nhé.
 Nhưng vâng, ngoài điều đó ra, tôi hy vọng thứ Năm sẽ diễn ra tốt đẹp.
 Và tôi sẽ gặp lại tất cả các bạn vào ngày 11 tháng 4.
 Chà, tôi đoán thế này, ồ, tiếp tục đi, Andrew.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6371.794s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Đúng.
 Vâng, chỉ là một câu hỏi thôi, có thể dành cho Alicia hoặc Dennis.
 Anh là chuyên viên tư vấn 40B ở TP. Tôi chưa bao giờ gặp anh ấy. Tôi không nghĩ chúng ta đã gặp anh ấy rồi?
 Tôi đoán câu hỏi của tôi là, vì điều này liên quan đến thiết kế mà chúng ta đang nói đến ngày hôm nay, nó là gì?
 Chúng ta có thể làm điều gì đó để định hình tốt hơn các dự án 40B mới nổi này để chúng không chỉ là những dự án khối lớn cũ kỹ mà chúng ta vẫn thấy không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6413.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Andre, tôi không nghĩ Luật sư Haverty có thể tham dự một số phiên điều trần, nhưng đồng nghiệp Chris của ông ấy, người sẽ tham dự hôm nay,
 Nó thuộc về cùng một văn phòng.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi chưa có chúng, nhưng chúng sẽ đến với nhau.
 Vì vậy tôi đề nghị có một số lựa chọn.
 Hội đồng có thể lên lịch một cuộc họp điều hành với cố vấn 40B của chúng tôi để thảo luận chi tiết hơn về vấn đề này hoặc có thể liên hệ trực tiếp với bất kỳ thành viên Hội đồng nào.
 Nếu bạn có những thắc mắc này, vui lòng liên hệ với chuyên gia tư vấn 40B của chúng tôi để được giải thích.
 Điều duy nhất chúng tôi không thể làm là thảo luận riêng về vấn đề này với một nhóm đông người.
 Có, tôi khuyên bạn nên liên hệ trực tiếp với Luật sư Haverty về vấn đề này và chúng ta có thể thảo luận vấn đề này một cách cởi mở trong một cuộc họp.
 tại phiên điều trần trong tương lai.
 Chúng ta cũng có thể đặt câu hỏi này một cách công khai.
 Đây là một lựa chọn khác.
 Tôi không nghĩ rằng điều đó nhất thiết phải đủ điều kiện để trở thành một phiên họp điều hành.
 Sau đó chúng tôi có thể xác nhận rằng Luật sư Haverty hoặc một trong những đồng nghiệp của ông ấy sẽ có mặt tại phiên điều trần tiếp theo.
 Tôi nghĩ họ ở đó và chúng ta chỉ cần hỏi họ ở nơi công cộng.
 Đó sẽ là một lựa chọn khác.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6508.835s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Được rồi, tôi hạnh phúc với cả hai người.
 Có lẽ tôi đang hạnh phúc trong mắt công chúng.
 Ý tôi là, ý tôi là, ở đây.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6516.687s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vì vậy, vâng, có lẽ vì sự tò mò của bạn và thực tế là chúng ta còn hai tuần nữa mới đến phiên điều trần tiếp theo, có lẽ tôi sẽ hỏi câu hỏi đó.
 Đặc biệt là chính bạn, hãy nhận được câu trả lời.
 Sau đó, dựa vào đó, bạn có thể hỏi lại một cách công khai hoặc bạn có thể cho tôi biết rằng bạn muốn thảo luận công khai về vấn đề này.
 Hãy để tôi bày tỏ sự hiểu biết của tôi một cách ngắn gọn.
 Tôi nghĩ có một sự cân bằng mong manh và một số hạn chế đối với những gì một hội đồng quản trị có thể và không thể làm.
 Đó là lý do tại sao sẽ tốt hơn nếu có sự không chắc chắn
 Thực tế chúng ta có thể làm gì, tôi nghĩ sẽ tốt hơn nếu nhà tư vấn 40B nói điều này trước công chúng.
 Tôi nghĩ, nói chung, chính sự cân bằng giữa các vấn đề địa phương và các yếu tố có thể khiến dự án trở nên kém kinh tế nói riêng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6576.456s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: được rồi
 Chỉ vì tôi tò mò, làm thế nào chúng ta có thể tìm thấy
 Bạn biết đấy, tất cả các cuộc đàm phán, như số lượng căn hộ, số lượng đất, v.v.
 Ý tôi là, tôi nghĩ sẽ thật tuyệt nếu mọi người hiểu rõ hơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6594.821s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tất nhiên là có, có lẽ chúng ta có thể bắt đầu vì đây là một vấn đề tổng quát hơn.
 Tôi sẽ biến đây thành một trong những chủ đề mở đầu.
 Tại cuộc họp tiếp theo, chúng ta có thể liên hệ với nhà tư vấn 40 B và yêu cầu anh ta đưa ra một bản tóm tắt ngắn gọn cho khán giả.
 Loại xem xét bảng như một phần của quy trình 40B.
 Điều này có hiệu quả với bạn không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6619.358s">[Unidentified]</a>: chắc chắn.
 Được rồi, tuyệt vời.
 Một điều cần nhớ nữa là một khi những dự án này hoàn thành, tôi nghĩ họ sẽ ra tòa và buộc chúng ta phải gánh chịu mức thuế 10%.
 Vì vậy, về lý thuyết, chúng ta sẽ không thấy 40B nữa xuất hiện.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6639.593s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Tôi không quan tâm đến 40 B, tôi muốn hỗ trợ nhà ở.
 Tôi chỉ muốn nó được như thế. Tôi muốn thấy họ đạt mức 50%.
 Tôi ước nó sẽ được thiết kế tốt và có thể chúng ta sẽ có những tòa nhà nhỏ hơn hoặc có chiều cao khác hoặc những thứ tương tự thay vì những khối nhà khổng lồ này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6660.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tôi hiểu ý của Luật sư Hunter là, tôi xin lỗi, Giám đốc Hunter, ồ, anh ấy có ý gì đó.
 Vì vậy, Giám đốc Hunter, tôi chỉ muốn nói rằng, chúng ta đang đi theo một đường lối.
 Chúng tôi không nói về dự án cụ thể này, nhưng chúng tôi đã đạt được tiến bộ.
 thực sự là vậy
 Tôi đề nghị chúng ta không đi vào chi tiết ở đây.
 Nhưng Hiệu trưởng Hunter, ông ấy sẽ nói gì?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6688.304s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: được rồi
 Vì vậy, xét về việc nhận được một đơn đăng ký 40B khác, vì hiện tại chúng ta đã có bến đỗ an toàn trong hai năm,
 Chúng tôi không coi những điều gây tranh cãi là gây tranh cãi.
 Tôi có thể nói rằng chúng tôi đang nói chuyện với các nhà phát triển bất động sản khác về việc đưa các dự án đến Medford và phân vùng cũng như cách mọi thứ sẽ hoạt động.
 Vì vậy, những gì chúng ta có thể thấy là một 40B thân thiện, nhưng đó sẽ là một tình huống rất khác vì họ không có đủ sức mạnh để vượt lên và ngăn chặn chúng ta.
 Họ sẽ có khả năng ban hành và hoàn thành quy trình 40B thay vì phân vùng khác nhau.
 Có, bởi vì chúng tôi đã đồng ý để họ trải qua quy trình 40B vì chúng tôi quan tâm đến nhà ở giá rẻ 20% hoặc nhà ở giá rẻ 25% hoặc 20%, đó là điều chúng tôi có thể làm và tôi có thể nói đó là điều chúng tôi có thể thảo luận với một số nhà phát triển bất động sản.
 Một câu hỏi thú vị dành cho họ là liệu nhiều nhà ở giá rẻ có làm tăng chi phí đến mức dự án cụ thể mà họ đang xem xét trở nên không thể chấp nhận được hay không, và thay vì yêu cầu chênh lệch, bạn có thể quyết định phê duyệt nhưng họ sẽ có bằng chứng pháp lý.
 Họ có thể bị thử thách, thực sự, họ có sức hấp dẫn với bạn hơn 40B thân thiện.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ muốn cung cấp một số thông tin cơ bản.
 Đây sẽ là một tình huống rất khác.
 Tôi nghĩ trong 40B thứ ba, tôi không rõ liệu họ có thể quay lại hay thời hiệu là bao nhiêu vì vụ việc bị tạm dừng chờ kết quả của HLC.
 Họ đã không liên lạc lại với chúng tôi trong sáu năm và đã khoảng năm hoặc sáu tháng kể từ khi vụ việc được giải quyết.
 Vì vậy, thực sự, đây là một câu hỏi pháp lý mà chúng ta nên tìm câu trả lời.
 Vì vậy tôi chỉ muốn cung cấp cho bạn bối cảnh đó khi bạn nghĩ về những điều này.
 Điều Andrew nêu ra là một câu hỏi dài hơi.
 Điều này sẽ không xảy ra trong sáu tháng hoặc năm tới.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6835.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Vâng, điều đó đúng.
 Theo tôi hiểu, bến cảng an toàn chỉ đơn giản là mở rộng nhiều cơ sở để các tòa phúc thẩm từ chối các dự án.
 Vì vậy, nó chỉ thay đổi động lực.
 Tuy nhiên, về nguyên tắc, cổng an toàn 4 dB có thể được triển khai.
 Với bến cảng an toàn, thực tế là họ nhìn chung rất thân thiện vì hội đồng quản trị có thể từ chối bạn vì nhiều lý do.
 Ừ, sao cũng được.
 Sau đó, Tổng thống chờ kiến ​​nghị hoãn phiên họp.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6880.275s">[Unidentified]</a>: Đề nghị kết thúc cuộc họp.
 thứ hai.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6882.656s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Thứ hai, mọi thứ đều ổn.
 Hãy thực hiện cuộc gọi.

 Đúng.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6893.147s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: May mắn.</p>
