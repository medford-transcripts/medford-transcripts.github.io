    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=277.86s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  That's good.
 Thank you, Pat.
 Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.
 So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.
 So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.
 I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.
 So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.
 This is our current landscape plan.
 This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.
 So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.
 More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.
 uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.
 And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.
 We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.
 Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.
 So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.
 You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.
 So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.
 So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.
 So here you'll see our ground floor plan.
 This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.
 Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.
 We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.
 This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.
 In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.
 This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.
 So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.
 This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.
 We have our bike storage.
 We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.
 In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.
 The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.
 Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.
 This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.
 We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.
 Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.
 We'll probably have some fitness located up here.
 So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.
 The units are all encapsulated here.
 The yellow would be your studio units.
 The purple would be your one bed units.
 The green would be your two bed units.
 And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.
 So moving up a floor plan.
 So this would be our typical floor three through five.
 And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.
 That's our most typical plan for three floors.
 One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.
 you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.
 So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.
 And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.
 And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.
 So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.
 The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.
 We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.
 So jumping into the concept design image.
 So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.
 This is conceptual design.
 So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.
 So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.
 This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.
 In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.
 So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.
 So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.
 And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.
 And part of the reason for that is one,
 from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.
 You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.
 So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.
 But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.
 So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.
 So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.
 And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.
 So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.
 There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.
 Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.
 One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.
 You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.
 This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor
 gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.
 Here you can see we have the five-story piece.
 You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.
 Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.
 This north elevation is the elevation that's
 most facing Myrtle Street.
 So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.
 You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.
 Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.
 And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.
 You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.
 and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.
 We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.
 There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.
 And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.
 you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Fellsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.
 So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.
 And then just briefly the townhome elevations.
 So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.
 Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.
 And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.
 So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.
 You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.
 So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.
 Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.
 And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.
 We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.
 And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.
 And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.
 So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.
 And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.
 And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.
 So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
 All right, so shadow study.
 So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.
 So we're going to show three items here.
 We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.
 The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.
 And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.
 And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.
 And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.
 So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.
 And this is the 9 a.m.
 condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.
 So this is the existing condition at those times of year.
 And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.
 And so we also looked at it
 as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.
 So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.
 And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.
 and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.
 So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.
 And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.
 That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.
 on those adjacent properties.
 So it's not that until 10 a.m.
 you are in a cloud of darkness.
 There's a lot of space between the buildings.
 There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.
 There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.
 And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.
 So here you'll see the 9 a.m.
 condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.
 This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.
 So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.
 and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.
 And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.
 And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.
 For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.
 And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.
 The sun's a lot higher in the air.
 So you'll see a lot less shadow.
 And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.
 So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.
 summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.
 So it's about only a 15 minute difference.
 In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.
 From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.
 So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.
 So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.
 Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.
 Three, the potential rail trail connection here.
 Four, we have our internal courtyards.
 One's
 potentially a little bit more active with the pool.
 Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.
 Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.
 Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with
 you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.
 I think we've been improving that each step along the way.
 I think
 where we are now is much better than where we started.
 And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.
 And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.
 But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.
 And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.
 So that is all.
 I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1328.783s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: តើអ្នកអាចស្តាប់ខ្ញុំបានទេ?
 ទាំងអស់គឺល្អ។
 ល្អឥតខ្ចោះ។
 ជំរាបសួរលោក
 កិច្ច​ប្រជុំ​ចុង​ក្រោយ​របស់​យើង​ជាមួយ​មន្ត្រី​ក្រុង​គឺ​ទើប​តែ​ប្រាំមួយ​ថ្ងៃ​មុន​គឺ​នៅ​ថ្ងៃ​ទី​២០។
 ខ្ញុំបានមើលភាគច្រើននៃអ្វីដែលបានបង្ហាញ។
 មាន​ភាព​ខុស​គ្នា​ខ្លះ ប៉ុន្តែ​វា​មាន​លក្ខណៈ​តូចតាច។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បញ្ជាក់ថា ខ្ញុំគិត
 អ្នកប្រហែលជាបានកត់សម្គាល់ឃើញថា មតិភាគច្រើនរបស់ខ្ញុំរហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះ គឺនិយាយអំពីការធ្វើផែនការគេហទំព័រ ដែលសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំគឺជាកន្លែងដ៏ល្អមួយដើម្បីចាប់ផ្តើម។
 មិនចាំបាច់ពិភាក្សាលម្អិតអំពីគុណភាពនៃអគារជាដើមនោះទេ ហើយប្រាកដណាស់មិនចាំបាច់ពិភាក្សាអំពីកន្លែងដែលសម្ភារៈទាំងនោះស្ថិតនៅ ឬសូម្បីតែផែនការជាន់ រហូតដល់មានអគារមួយចំនួនធំ។
 រហូតទាល់តែស្នាមជើងពិតជាចូលមកលេង វាភាគច្រើននិយាយអំពីការប៉ះពាល់របស់អគារទៅកាន់ផ្លូវជុំវិញនោះ។
 ហើយតាមទស្សនៈនេះ ខ្ញុំតែងតែគាំទ្រយ៉ាងខ្លាំងចំពោះការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍គម្រោងនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាឥឡូវនេះយើងឃើញស្ពាននៅក្នុងស្ថាបត្យកម្មខ្លួនឯង។
 នេះមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់។
 ទាំងនេះពិតជាគំនិត។
 គំនូរ ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​តាម​គំនិត​ខ្ញុំ​គេ​ឆ្លុះ​បញ្ចាំង​ថា​គម្រោង​នេះ​កំពុង​ដំណើរ​ការ​ហើយ។
 ជាការពិតណាស់ ការបរាជ័យដ៏ធំនៅដើមដំបូងគឺមានសារៈសំខាន់។
 ខ្ញុំបានក្រឡេកមើល Google Street View ម្តងទៀត ដើម្បីចងចាំពីមាត្រដ្ឋានស្ថាបត្យកម្មរបស់ Amarans ។
 របៀប​ដែល​ជំហាន​នៅ​ខាង​ជើង និង​ខាង​ត្បូង​វែង​នៃ​អគារ​ទាក់ទង​នឹង​ទំហំ​អគារ​នៅ​ទូទាំង​ផ្លូវ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកដឹងមកពីនោះ ឬពី Google ឬពីទីនោះ អគារទាំងនេះ
 តាមពិតទៅ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាដំណើរការល្អណាស់ ព្រោះអគារនៅទូទាំងផ្លូវមានជាន់តិចជាងសម្រាប់កាន់កាប់ ប៉ុន្តែតាមពិតពួកគេមានខ្សែស្ពានខ្ពស់ដែលលាតសន្ធឹងលើអគារ ហើយថែមទាំងលាតសន្ធឹងអគារជិតខាងមួយចំនួនដែលនៅជិតគ្នាផងដែរ។
 អ្នកឡើងទៅជាន់ទីមួយ។
 ជាធម្មតាមានបីជាន់សម្រាប់រស់នៅ និងដំបូល។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ការ​កាត់​បន្ថយ​នេះ​គឺ​ទាក់ទង​នឹង​មាត្រដ្ឋាន
 វាដំណើរការល្អណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​លើក​យក​បញ្ហា​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​មិន​បាន​ពិភាក្សា​ចេញ​ពី​កិច្ច​ប្រជុំ​កាល​ពី​សប្តាហ៍​មុន ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ជា​សូចនាករ​ដ៏​ល្អ​នៃ​របៀប​ដើម្បី​ឈាន​ទៅ​មុខ​ជាមួយ​នឹង​គម្រោង​សាងសង់។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារឿងមួយដែលយើងបាននិយាយ
 នេះគឺជាអាគារធំមួយ។
 ឥឡូវនេះកម្ពស់ទាំងអស់គឺដូចគ្នា។
 ខ្ញុំបានរកឃើញថា ចលនានៅផ្នែកខាងជើងមានប្រសិទ្ធភាពណាស់ក្នុងការរំលេចច្រកចូលចំហៀង ដែលពិតជាដំណើរការសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ចំណាំថាផ្នែកដែលនៅសេសសល់នៃផ្នែកខាងកើតនៃផ្នែកខាងមុខខាងជើងនេះក៏ជាកន្លែងសាធារណៈផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មាន​តម្លៃ​ក្នុង​ការ​ពិចារណា​ថា​តើ​ភាព​ខុស​គ្នា​ខ្លាំង​ជាង​នេះ​នៅ​ក្នុង​លំហ​នេះ​នឹង​មាន​ប្រយោជន៍។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាចំណុចមួយទៀតគឺទិដ្ឋភាពនិរន្តរភាពនៃស្ថាបត្យកម្ម។
 យើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីការព្យាបាលតាមបង្អួចស្រដៀងគ្នានៅទូទាំងអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា បាទ
 វាពិតជាផ្តល់រង្វាន់ក្នុងការបន្តឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីអាកប្បកិរិយាប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៅលើ facade របស់អគារ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​តាម​ពិត​មាន​វិធី​ខុស​គ្នា​ច្រើន​ក្នុង​ការ​ដោះស្រាយ​វា​អាស្រ័យ​លើ​ថាតើ​អ្នក​កំពុង​សម្លឹង​មើល​កម្ពស់​បែរ​មុខ​ទៅ​ទិស​ខាង​ជើង ឬ​កម្ពស់​បែរ​ទៅ​ទិស​ខាង​លិច។
 ប្រហែលជាវាទាក់ទងនឹងចម្ងាយពីបង្អួច។
 តោង​ជាប់​នឹង​ជញ្ជាំង ឬ​ដាក់​តាម​ផ្លូវ​ខ្យល់ វា​ជួយ​គ្រប់គ្រង​ពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យ។
 ប៉ុន្តែក្នុងករណីណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំលើកទឹកចិត្តឱ្យស្វែងរកវិធីធ្វើឱ្យអគារ facade ប្រសើរឡើងដោយមានការទទួលស្គាល់ ហើយដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ ពួកគេអាចអានអាកប្បកិរិយាប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៃ facade អគារតាមរបៀបណាមួយ។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំបានពិនិត្យមើលទំព័រទាំង 27 នៃការស្រាវជ្រាវស្រមោល។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ប្រាប់​គណៈកម្មាធិការ​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​រឿង​ទាំង​នោះ​ត្រឹមត្រូវ​ហើយ​ការ​រៀបចំ​គឺ​ត្រឹមត្រូវ​តាម​ចំណេះ​ដឹង​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះការវិភាគគុណភាពមុន និងក្រោយ ហើយបង្រួមវាទៅជាប្រធានបទស្រដៀងគ្នា។
 ទស្សនវិស័យ រយៈពេលនៃពេលវេលាដែលមានភាពខុសគ្នាដែលអាចវាស់វែងបានក្នុងការដាក់ស្រមោលក្នុងរយៈពេលមួយម៉ោងជាក់ស្តែង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជួយ​ដាក់​អ្វី​ៗ​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ទស្សនៈ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាឥឡូវនេះខ្ញុំ
 ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តនឹងលទ្ធផលនៃផែនការគេហទំព័រ។
 ភាព​ជាក់លាក់​នៅ​មិន​ទាន់​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​បាន​ពេញលេញ​នៅ​ឡើយ​ទេ​។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារូបថតនេះបង្ហាញពីរបៀបដែលការងារទាំងអស់ដែលបានធ្វើនៅផ្នែកខាងលិចនៃអគារបានប្រែក្លាយផ្លូវ Amaranth យ៉ាងពិតប្រាកដ។
 មានរូបភាពជាច្រើននៃអគារដែលយើងមិនទាន់បានឃើញ។
 តាមទស្សនៈរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំគិតថាការផ្តោតអារម្មណ៍ដែលអ្នកកំពុងឃើញនៅពេលនេះ គឺពិតជាទៅលើសម្ភារៈនៃស្ថាបត្យកម្ម និងរបៀបសម្រេចបាននូវមាត្រដ្ឋាន។
 ចាប់ផ្តើមយកចិត្តទុកដាក់លើអាគារខ្លួនឯង។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ទាន់​បាន​សរសេរ​អ្វី​នៅ​ឡើយ​ទេ ក្រៅ​ពី​កំណត់​ហេតុ​ខ្លី​មួយ​ដែល​សុំ​ភស្តុតាង​បន្ថែម។
 មូលហេតុ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ទាន់​សរសេរ​អ្វី​ក៏​ដោយ ព្រោះ​វា​បាន​ផ្លាស់​ប្តូរ។
 គម្រោង​នេះ​ពិតជា​បាន​ផ្លាស់ប្តូរ​ច្រើន​ណាស់ ហើយ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​មាន​ចំណុច​ណាមួយ​ក្នុង​ការ​ផ្តល់​យោបល់​របស់ខ្ញុំ​រហូត​ដល់​
 គាត់បានយល់ស្របថាអ្វីៗមានស្ថេរភាព ហើយថាពួកគេបានយកវិធីសាស្រ្តជាច្រើនទៅបទបង្ហាញចុងក្រោយ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកនឹងឃើញមតិយោបល់របស់ខ្ញុំបន្ថែមទៀតអំពីស្ថាបត្យកម្មនៃអគារ និងទីតាំងរបស់វា និងទីតាំងជាក់ស្តែងនៅលើគេហទំព័រ ក៏ដូចជាគំនិតដំបូងនៅលើសួនច្បារ ការអភិរក្ស និងការផ្សព្វផ្សាយរបស់វា។
 កន្លែងប្រើប្រាស់ចម្រុះ ឬទីធ្លាចំហរ ដែលបើកចំហសម្រាប់ទាំងសាធារណជន និងប្រជាពលរដ្ឋ ហាក់ដូចជាកន្លែងដ៏ល្អមួយ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1773.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: ខ្ញុំពិតជាមានដើម្បីឆ្លើយសំណួរណាមួយ។
 ទាំងអស់គឺល្អ។
 អរគុណសម្រាប់ការអាប់ដេត។
 ដូច្នេះ លោក McCord វាគ្រាន់តែ... បាទ ស្តាប់ទៅល្អណាស់។
 ដូច្នេះ រឿងមួយដែលខ្ញុំចង់បញ្ជាក់មុននឹងសួរសំណួរពិគ្រោះគឺ... អញ្ចឹងតើខ្ញុំយល់រឿងនេះត្រឹមត្រូវទេ?
 ប្រសិនបើលទ្ធផលនៃការប្រជុំនៅយប់នេះមិនមានលទ្ធផលនៅក្នុងការផ្លាស់ប្តូរសំខាន់ៗចំពោះផែនការគេហទំព័រទេនោះ នៅពេលនេះ វត្ថុតាំងបង្ហាញដែលអ្នកបានស្នើសុំ ហើយប្រហែលជាមួយចំនួនដែលអ្នកនឹងស្នើសុំឆាប់ៗនេះ នឹងក្លាយជាជំហានបន្ទាប់។
 អ្នកសួរពួកគេហើយបន្ទាប់មកមើលពួកគេ។
 បន្ទាប់មក យើងនឹងទទួលបានមតិកែលម្អលម្អិតរបស់អ្នកលើធាតុផ្សេងទៀតនៃស្ថាបត្យកម្មនៅក្នុងការប្រជុំជាបន្តបន្ទាប់។
 ដូច្នេះ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1819.794s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ វាសមហេតុផលណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំ​មាន​យោបល់ ខ្ញុំ​បាន​បញ្ចេញ​មតិ​ខ្លះ​កាល​ពី​សប្តាហ៍​មុន​អំពី​ការ​តំណាង​ក្នុង​ស្ថាបត្យកម្ម។
 ប៉ុន្តែវាពិតជាអាស្រ័យលើអ្នកនៅទូទាំងក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះវិធីសាស្រ្តចង្វាក់នេះ។
 ចូរធ្វើវាចុះ ប៉ុន្តែ បាទ ជំហានបន្ទាប់របស់ខ្ញុំ ឧបមាថាសាធារណជនទូទៅ គោលគំនិតរបស់សាធារណជន ប្រសិនបើវាអនុវត្តចំពោះមនុស្សរបស់អ្នក នោះនឹងជួយផ្តល់ដំណឹងដល់កម្រិតបន្ទាប់នៃការវិភាគរបស់ខ្ញុំ ដែលដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយគឺពិតជាអំពីសម្ភារៈ និងអ្វីៗផ្សេងទៀត ហើយខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការសង្កេតខ្លះទៀតអំពីស្ថានភាពបច្ចុប្បន្ន។
 សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំនិយាយវាក្នុងន័យល្អិតល្អន់ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថាវាសំខាន់ជាងក្នុងការមានពាក្យផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់អ្នក ហើយនោះជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមម្តងទៀត ដោយគ្រាន់តែស្វែងរកវិធីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាអាចជួយបាន។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​នៅ​ក្នុង​អគារ​នៃ​មាត្រដ្ឋាន​នេះ វា​គួរ​តែ​ពិភាក្សា​ពី​របៀប​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​មាត្រដ្ឋាន​មាន​អត្ថន័យ​ដែល​បាន​ផ្តល់​ឱ្យ​នូវ​ទីតាំង​របស់​អគារ។
 ប្រសិនបើគុណភាពត្រឹមត្រូវ ហើយការដាក់នៅលើគេហទំព័រត្រឹមត្រូវ ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកពិតជាទទួលបានអថេរ។

 ខ្ញុំមើលអគារនេះ។
 វាជាដុំធំមួយដុំវែងនៃ amaranth ។
 វា​គ្រាន់​តែ​ជា​ជញ្ជាំង​រឹង​ប្រាំ​ជាន់​ប៉ុណ្ណោះ មិន​មាន​អ្វី​ខុស​គ្នា​នោះ​ទេ។

 មានអ្នកផ្សេងទៀត។
 យុទ្ធសាស្ត្រដែលពាក់ព័ន្ធនឹងការណែនាំធាតុបញ្ឈរបន្ថែមទៀតអាចរួមបញ្ចូលច្រកចូល និងច្រកចេញតិចជាងមុននៅលើ facade និងការផ្លាស់ប្តូរសម្ភារៈមួយចំនួន។

 ប៉ុន្តែមានវិធីដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យមាត្រដ្ឋាននេះដំណើរការសម្រាប់អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា អ្នកដឹងទេ ឆ្នេរសមុទ្រ ភាពខុសគ្នាដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ អាចជាក្រុមមួយចំនួន។

 សូមចងចាំផងដែរថាអគារនេះកើតឡើង ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាវាមានសារៈសំខាន់ក្នុងការរំលេច និងផ្លាស់ប្តូរច្រកចូលនេះ។
 ការបើកមួយផ្តល់នូវការចូលទៅកាន់មុខហាងទាបនៅជ្រុងខាងជើង ហើយផ្លាស់ទីទៅខាងលិច។

 នេះគឺជាចលនាដ៏ល្អមួយ។

 ខ្ញុំយល់ព្រម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាកាលពីសប្តាហ៍មុនមានការពិភាក្សាខ្លះអំពីរបៀបធ្វើឱ្យមានតុល្យភាពនៃរូបរាងឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា អគារនេះនៅតែជាប់នឹងឃ្លាំងនៅប៉ែកខាងកើត ហើយនោះជាប្រវត្តិនៃទីតាំង វាមានការប្រើប្រាស់ឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 ប៉ុន្តែទន្ទឹមនឹងនោះ គ.
 បើ​ក្រឡេក​ទៅ​មើល​អគារ​ពិត អគារ​ពិត​ជា​សំណង់​បន្ថែម។
 វាដូចជាត្រូវបានបែងចែកទៅជាផ្នែកតូចៗ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ វាជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំណែនាំអ្នកឱ្យពិចារណាឥឡូវនេះ។ សូមក្រឡេកមើលវិធីមួយចំនួនដើម្បីវិភាគទំហំនៃការចាក់សោ។</p>

 ច្រកចូល និងច្រកចេញកាន់តែច្រើនដែលអ្នកដាក់ចូលទៅក្នុងអាគារ សំខាន់រាល់ការេនៃជញ្ជាំងខាងក្រៅដែលអ្នកបន្ថែមទៅក្នុងអាគារ វាកាន់តែពិបាកសម្រាប់អាគារដើម្បីបំពេញតាមតម្រូវការ Passive House។
 ដូច្នេះ មានរឿងមួយដែលទើបតែកើតឡើងចំពោះខ្ញុំ ហើយយើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីវា អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងបាននិយាយអំពីរឿងនេះកាលពីសប្តាហ៍មុនជាមួយនឹងគណៈកម្មការរៀបចំផែនការ ហើយ Alicia និង Danielle និងក្រុមដែលនៅសល់ ហើយវាគឺជា

 នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ​ខ្លាំង​ណាស់។
 នេះគឺជាអនាគតនៃបទប្បញ្ញត្តិថាមពលនៅរដ្ឋ Massachusetts។
 ដូច្នេះរឿងមួយដែលត្រូវចងចាំនោះគឺថា គម្រោងកាន់តែច្រើនឡើងៗនឹងមានការភ្ជាប់គ្នាតិចទៅតិច ដើម្បីអនុលោមតាមបទប្បញ្ញត្តិថាមពល។</p>

 នៅក្នុង Medford អ្នកគ្មានជម្រើសអ្វីក្រៅពីការកសាងផ្ទះអកម្មទៅលេខកូដថាមពលនោះទេ។
 នេះគឺជាតម្រូវការថ្មីដែលគម្រោងនាពេលអនាគតទាំងអស់ត្រូវតែបំពេញ។
 មិនអីទេ
 នេះជារឿងថ្មីសម្រាប់មនុស្សជាច្រើន។
 វាមានរយៈពេលមួយរយៈហើយ ភាគច្រើននៅអឺរ៉ុប ប៉ុន្តែវាកំពុងបង្ហាញនៅទីនេះ ហើយមនុស្សកាន់តែច្រើនចាប់ផ្តើមស៊ាំនឹងវា ប៉ុន្តែវាកំពុងចំណាយពេលរបស់វា។

 ជាធម្មតា ជាមួយនឹងផ្ទះអកម្ម អ្នកនឹងឃើញការសន្សំ 90% ឬសូម្បីតែ 90% ក្នុងការចំណាយថាមពល។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2320.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: រឿងមួយដែលខ្ញុំចង់បន្ថែមដូចដែល Eric បានរៀបរាប់ ពួកគេធ្វើ
 គម្រោងលំនៅដ្ឋានសកម្ម និងអកម្មចំនួនបីសម្រាប់ការិយាល័យរបស់អ្នក។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ផ្តល់​យោបល់​ជា​ឧទាហរណ៍ ព្រោះ​យើង​ក៏​ធ្វើ​ការ​សាងសង់​ផ្ទះ​អកម្ម​ច្រើន​ដែរ។
 ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេថា ប្រសិនបើអ្នកក្រឡេកមើលរបៀបដែលពួកគេមើលទៅ វាគឺជាប្រព័ន្ធដែលផ្អែកលើការអនុវត្តយ៉ាងខ្លាំង។
 ដូច្នេះបង្អួចនិងថាមពលអាចត្រូវបានយកគំរូតាមយ៉ាងជិតស្និទ្ធ។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើអ្នកមានបង្អួចធំខ្លាំង វាពិតជាលំបាកជាងក្នុងការសម្រេចបាននូវដំណើរការកម្ដៅដ៏ល្អឥតខ្ចោះ ហើយប្រសិនបើអ្នកឈានដល់ចំណុចដែលអាចបង្កើតបានប៉ុន្មានសន្លាក់ សន្លាក់ជាច្រើននឹងត្រូវធ្វើឡើងជាជញ្ជាំងរឹង។
 ហើយជញ្ជាំងទាំងនេះងាយស្រួលក្នុងការអ៊ីសូឡង់និងធ្វើបានល្អ។
 ជាឧទាហរណ៍ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវិធីមួយដើម្បីដោះស្រាយបញ្ហានេះគឺមិនចាំបាច់ត្រូវការបង្អួចធំដូចបង្អួចដែលអ្នកកំពុងបង្ហាញនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ ប្រសិនបើអ្នកកាត់បន្ថយទំហំបង្អួចបន្តិចពីទិដ្ឋភាពគំរូ អ្នកអាចទទួលបានប្រសិទ្ធិភាពកាន់តែច្រើនពីតំបន់ជុំវិញដែលដាច់ឆ្ងាយពីគ្នា។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំយល់ស្របជាមួយអ្នក Passive House មានទិដ្ឋភាពលំបាកខ្លាំងមួយចំនួន។
 ការធ្វើគំរូបន្តនៃឯកសារសំណង់ទាំងអស់។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំមិនគិតដូច្នេះទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងបានសាងសង់អគារ Passivhaus ប្រហែល ១៨ ឬ ១៩ ហើយ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា អ្នក​អាច​មាន​សេរីភាព​កាន់​តែ​ច្រើន​ជា​មួយ​នឹង​ការ​បញ្ចេញ​សំឡេង ហើយ​នៅ​តែ​បំពេញ​តាម​លក្ខខណ្ឌ Passive House។

 យើងមិនសិក្សាជាពិសេសនោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថានោះជាអ្វីដែលយើងបានពិភាក្សា។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ វាអាចបញ្ចូលវាទៅក្នុងគម្រោង ប៉ុន្តែនេះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលយើងបានបង្ហាញនៅឡើយទេ។
 នេះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលយើងអាចវិភាគបានលម្អិតនោះទេ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ នៅក្នុងលក្ខខណ្ឌនៃលទ្ធភាព ប្រសិនបើវាជាទស្សនវិស័យនៅលើដំបូល ឬកន្លែងផ្សេងទៀតនៅលើទីតាំង ឬប្រភេទនៃទស្សនវិស័យស្ថាបត្យកម្មណាមួយ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ឥទ្ធិពលផ្សេងទៀតលើគម្រោង មិនថាតម្លៃ ការរចនា ឬអ្វីក៏ដោយ នោះជាការពិត។
 នេះគឺជាចម្លើយបើកចំហ ហើយនេះគឺជាប្រធានបទនៃការពិភាក្សារបស់យើង។
 យើងនៅមិនទាន់មានចម្លើយច្បាស់លាស់ថាតើយើងមានគម្រោងប្រើប្រាស់ថាមពលពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យសម្រាប់គម្រោងនេះឬអត់។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2797.862s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: បន្តជាមួយនឹងអ្វីដែលម៉ារីបាននិយាយ ខ្ញុំគិតថានៅចំណុចខ្លះមនុស្សក៏បានលើកឡើងអំពីរឿងដូចជាដំបូលផ្ទះ ឬដំបូលពណ៌បៃតង។
 វានឹងគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ក្នុងការមើលថាតើការព្យាបាលដំបូលនឹងទៅជាយ៉ាងណាជាពិសេសចាប់តាំងពីមានប្រហែល 5 និង 6 ជាន់។</p>

 ខ្ញុំគិតថា ប្រហែលជាដើម្បីជម្រះភាពច្របូកច្របល់ខ្លះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលយើងហៅថាកន្លែងដំបូលពណ៌បៃតងរហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះនឹងស្ថិតនៅក្នុងទីធ្លាជាន់ទី 2 ដែលអាចមើលឃើញពីលើចំណតរថយន្តនៅក្នុងផែនការជាន់របស់យើងមួយចំនួន។</p>

 តើក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលមានសំណួរ ឬយោបល់ផ្សេងទៀតទេ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2868.589s">[Mary Lee]</a>: ដូច្នេះ តាម​ការ​យល់​ឃើញ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ នេះ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ជា​គម្រោង​ព្រាង​ទេ?
 ឬ​មួយ​ខ្ញុំ​និយាយ​ថា តើ​យើង​ស្ថិត​ក្នុង​ដំណាក់​កាល​ណា​ជាមួយ​កម្មវិធី​នេះ តើ​កម្មវិធី​នេះ​ចប់​៩០% ឬ​៧០%?
 ដោយសារតែខ្ញុំមានទំនោរយល់ស្របជាមួយ Andre ពីព្រោះចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍ដំបូងដែលវាផ្តល់ឱ្យខ្ញុំនៅពេលខ្ញុំឃើញរូបថតនេះគឺថាវាផ្តល់ឱ្យខ្ញុំនូវចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍នៃឃ្លាំងជាជាងផ្ទះល្វែង។
 នេះគឺជាចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍ដំបូង។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថា ជាក់ស្តែង ប្រសិនបើនោះមិនមែនជាផែនការពេញលេញទេនោះ ប្រហែលជានៅមានបន្ទប់នៅឡើយ។

 អូ ទៅមុខ មេធាវី Tim ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2928.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: អូ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ឆ្លើយសំណួររបស់សមាជិកម្នាក់។
 ផែនការនេះគឺនៅខាងក្រោម ហើយក្រុមប្រឹក្សារបស់អ្នកអាចណែនាំអ្នកផងដែរ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំដឹងថាក្រុមប្រឹក្សាបានអនុម័តការអនុញ្ញាតទូទៅមួយចំនួនដើម្បីដោះស្រាយបញ្ហានេះ។
 ទាក់ទងនឹងអត្រាបញ្ចប់ ច្បាប់អាជ្ញាបណ្ណពេញលេញតម្រូវឱ្យយើងដាក់ស្នើការរចនាបឋម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាទាំងនេះគឺហួសពីស្តង់ដារមូលដ្ឋាននៅដំណាក់កាលនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នក និងក្រុមរបស់អ្នកយល់ថាយើងអាចកែលម្អ និងផ្តល់ព័ត៌មានលម្អិតបន្ថែមទៀត។
 ជាឧទាហរណ៍ នៅពេលដែលលោក LaRue បានសួរខ្ញុំអំពីការព្យាបាលដំបូល យ៉ាងហោចណាស់តាមគំនិត យើងអាចឃើញថា យើងគិតថានឹងមានគ្រឿងបរិក្ខារផ្សេងៗនៅលើដំបូល យ៉ាងហោចណាស់តាមគំនិត។
 ចង់​ឃើញ​ចំណុច​ពិសេស
 យើងអាចយកឈ្នះពួកគេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងសង្ឃឹមថានឹងធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នកដើម្បីផ្តល់នូវការព្យាករណ៍លម្អិតបន្ថែមទៀត និងធាតុលក្ខខណ្ឌគម្រោងនាពេលអនាគត។
 ដូច្នេះនៅកម្រិតអាជ្ញាប័ណ្ណពេញលេញនេះ អ្នកនឹងមិនអាចទទួលបាន 100% នៃគំនូររចនានោះទេ។
 ជាដើម ប៉ុន្តែគំនិតដែលបានបង្ហាញក្នុងកម្រិតធំជាងនេះ គឺផ្តោតលើផ្នែករសើបទាំងនេះ ដូចជា amaranth ជាដើម។
 នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​អាច​ផ្តោត​លើ ប៉ុន្តែ​វា​នៅ​តែ​ស្ថិត​ក្នុង​កម្រិត​បឋម។
 មានតែតាមរយៈការទទួលបានលិខិតអនុញ្ញាតសាងសង់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ ទើបអ្នកអាចធានាបាននូវគម្រោងចុងក្រោយ ហើយការសម្រេចចិត្តរបស់អ្នកនឹងឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីបញ្ហានេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​ប្រាប់​ជាមុន​ថា​តើ​យើង​មាន​លក្ខណៈ​ជាក់លាក់​ប៉ុណ្ណា។
 នៅក្នុងទីក្រុងជាច្រើន និងគម្រោងជាច្រើន ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថានៅក្នុងគម្រោងផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុង Medford កម្រិតនៃការរចនាគំនិតនេះនឹងមានលក្ខណៈសមរម្យសម្រាប់ការត្រួតពិនិត្យ និងការអនុម័តពេញលេញនៃលិខិតអនុញ្ញាត។
 ជាក់ស្តែង យើងចង់ដោះស្រាយកង្វល់របស់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សានៅក្នុងមតិសាធារណៈណាមួយ ហើយនឹងបន្តធ្វើដូច្នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាឧទាហរណ៍ ផែនការសាងសង់ដែលត្រូវបានពិនិត្យដោយ Eric គឺគ្រប់គ្រាន់សម្រាប់ការអនុម័តនៅដំណាក់កាលនេះ។
 អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​កំពុង​និយាយ​គឺ​ការ​ចាប់​អារម្មណ៍​តាម​ប្រធានបទ និង​ការ​រចនា​សោភ័ណភាព ហើយ​យើង​កំពុង​នាំមុខ​ក្នុង​ជំហាន​នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេវានឹងមិនមានកម្រិតនៃការធ្វើផែនការនោះទេ។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់បានព័ត៌មានលម្អិតបន្ថែមអំពីលក្ខណៈពិសេស និងធាតុផ្សំនៃការរចនា យើងនឹងព្យាយាមឱ្យអស់ពីសមត្ថភាពដើម្បីផ្តល់ពួកវាសម្រាប់អ្នក។
 បាទ/ចាស យើងនឹងមិនបញ្ចូលឯកសារសំណង់ជាផ្នែកនៃរឿងនេះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថារឿងមួយទៀតគឺការចាប់អារម្មណ៍ថានេះគឺជាអគារឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 បាទ មាន​អគារ​ឧស្សាហកម្ម​មួយ​និង​ការ​បោះ​ជំហាន​របស់​វា។
 នេះគឺជាសួនឧស្សាហកម្ម។
 មាន​ឃ្លាំង​ឧស្សាហកម្ម​នៅ​ក្បែរ​នោះ។
 ដូចដែល Eric បាននិយាយ យើងបានខ្ចីការរចនានេះពីបច្ចេកទេសទាំងនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា មនុស្ស​ម្នាក់ៗ​នឹង​មាន​យោបល់​រៀង​ខ្លួន។
 គំនិតផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺថាវាមើលទៅដូចជា 40B ផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវបានអនុម័ត និងសាងសង់ដោយទីក្រុង។</p>

 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា ពួកយើងដោះស្រាយគ្រប់យ៉ាងនៅយប់នេះ ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើមានជម្លោះណាមួយ យើងទាំងអស់គ្នាអាចនៅលើទំព័រតែមួយ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងនិយាយអំពីបញ្ហា។
 យើងបានពិភាក្សារួចហើយអំពីបញ្ហានៃការភ្ជាប់។
 យើងបានពិភាក្សាលម្អិតផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុងទិដ្ឋភាពដំបូល។
 លោក Bomer តើអ្នកមានការរំពឹងទុកជាក់លាក់ណាមួយទាក់ទងនឹងព័ត៌មានលម្អិតនៃវិសោធនកម្មដែលមិនអាចអនុវត្តបាននាពេលបច្ចុប្បន្ននេះទេ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3210.995s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: បាទ នោះជាសំណួរដ៏ល្អ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនអាចឆ្លើយលម្អិតបានទេ។
 អនុញ្ញាតឱ្យខ្ញុំសម្រាក។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ការ​លើក​ឡើង​របស់​មេធាវី Tan គឺ​សម​ហេតុ​ផល​ព្រោះ​ច្បាប់​ខ្លួន​ឯង​និយាយ​អំពី​ការ​ធ្វើ​ផែនការ​បឋម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលយើងកំពុងឃើញនៅក្នុងបេក្ខជននេះគឺជាឆន្ទៈ
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ភាគី​ទាំង​អស់​យល់​ស្រប​ថា​ទាំង​នេះ​គឺ​ជា​ការ​កែលម្អ​អគារ។
 ដូច្នេះតាមទស្សនៈរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំគិតថានេះជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំមានបញ្ហាខ្លះជាមួយ Time សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ របៀបដែលអគារឆ្លើយតបទៅនឹងបរិបទបច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់វា និងសម្របខ្លួនទៅនឹងគំរូនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍ទាក់ទងនឹងសោភ័ណភាព។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាមានកាតព្វកិច្ចនៅលើ facade សំខាន់ដែលប្រឈមមុខនឹងដែនសាធារណៈ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ពិត​ជា​ចូល​ចិត្ត​គោល​គំនិត​ភស្តុតាង​នៃ​គោល​គំនិត​ដែល​មេធាវី​បាន​លើក​ឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របទាំងស្រុងនឹងរឿងនេះ។ ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​អ្វី​ដែល​គណៈកម្មការ​ត្រូវ​ដឹង​គឺ​រូបភាព​ដែល​គេ​បាន​ឃើញ
 ដាក់វានៅកន្លែងល្អ ហើយបង្ហាញថាអ្វីមួយកំពុងដំណើរការក្នុងទិសដៅត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ពួកគេមិនបង្កើតកម្រិតលម្អិតខ្ពស់ទេ។
 នោះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលពួកគេត្រូវបានស្នើឱ្យធ្វើ ហើយពួកគេមិនគួរត្រូវធ្វើ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​តាម​គំនិត​ខ្ញុំ ផែនការ​ដំបូល និង​ការ​ដាក់​ឧបករណ៍​មេកានិក​គឺ​សំខាន់។
 តើយើងមិនមើលឧបករណ៍មេកានិចទេ?
 គ្រប់គ្រាន់
 ការពារពីដែនសាធារណៈ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ឃើញ​ជាន់​ផ្ទាល់​ដី​បន្ថែម​ទៀត​ដែល​មាន​ចំណត​រថយន្ត​នៅ​លើ​ផ្ទៃ​ដែល​ទាក់ទង​នឹង​ផ្នែក​ខាង​លិច​នៃ​អគារ។
 នោះហើយជាវា។
 ដូចជាខ្ញុំចង់ឃើញ អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចង់ឃើញគឺ ខ្ញុំគិតថារាល់ពេលដែលពួកគេធ្វើនោះ ពួកគេបង្ហាញថាពួកគេកំពុងស្តាប់អ្វីដែលអ្នកកំពុងនិយាយ។
 បន្ទាប់មកខ្ញុំនឹងរង់ចាំការវិភាគស៊ីជម្រៅបន្ថែមទៀត
 សោភ័ណភាពនៃអគារ ប៉ុន្តែរបៀបដែលពួកគេជួយអគារបញ្ចូលគ្នា ឬស្វែងរកតុល្យភាពត្រឹមត្រូវរវាងរូបរាងឧស្សាហកម្ម ប៉ុន្តែប្រហែលជានៅតែទាក់ទងនឹងចង្វាក់ និងទំហំជុំវិញមួយចំនួន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនអាចទេ វាជាការលំបាកសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំក្នុងការសង្ខេបអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងនៅក្នុងតែមួយ ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំមានពេលដើម្បីសរសេរកំណត់ចំណាំ តើខ្ញុំរំពឹងអ្វី?
 ដូចគ្នានេះផងដែរ យ៉ាងហោចណាស់នៅកម្រិតដែលខ្ញុំបានឃើញនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍ជាច្រើន ជាពិសេសប្រសិនបើមានបេក្ខជនដែលចង់ធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា វា​នឹង​ជា​ឱកាស​មួយ​ដែល​ខកខាន ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួក​គេ​មិន​បាន​បន្ត​ស្មារតី​នេះ ហើយ​ពិចារណា​អំពី​គំនិត​មួយ​ចំនួន​សម្រាប់​ការ​បញ្ចប់​ម៉ាស់។
 ក៏ដូចជាការផ្តល់គ្រឿងសិប្បកម្មជាមូលដ្ឋានមួយចំនួនទៀត។
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយផែនការដំបូលមានសារៈសំខាន់ក្នុងករណីនេះពីព្រោះយើងត្រូវដឹងពីអ្វីដែលអាចមើលឃើញពីផ្លូវ។
 ប្រសិនបើមតិនោះមិនត្រឹមត្រូវ នោះខ្ញុំមិនលើកទឹកចិត្តក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលឱ្យធ្វើការសម្រេចចិត្តដោយផ្អែកលើមតិនោះឡើយ រហូតទាល់តែខ្ញុំជឿថាបេក្ខជនពិតជាមានកាតព្វកិច្ច។
 បង្ហាញរូបភាពយ៉ាងត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ពួកគេពិតជាតំណាងឱ្យអ្វីមួយដែលជិតស្និទ្ធទៅនឹងអ្វីដែលសភា និងសាធារណជននឹងឃើញនៅពេលដែលវាត្រូវបានសាងសង់ពិតប្រាកដ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងត្រូវកំណត់អត្តសញ្ញាណពួកគេខ្លះ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​លើក​ទឹក​ចិត្ត​អ្នក​ឱ្យ​ត្រឡប់​មក​វិញ​ជាមួយ​នឹង​គំនិត​មួយ​ចំនួន​អំពី​របៀប​ធ្វើ​រឿង​នេះ។
 ស្វែងយល់បន្ថែមអំពីប្រភេទអគារ។
 ចំពោះដើមឈើ ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របថា ពួកវានៅជិតគ្នាណាស់ ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលខ្ញុំនិយាយនៅដើមដំបូង ខ្ញុំមិនធ្វើទេ ព្រោះខ្ញុំផ្តោតខ្លាំងលើការធ្វើផែនការទីតាំង ខ្ញុំមិនមើលប្លង់គេហទំព័រឱ្យលម្អិតទេ ប៉ុន្តែវាស្ថិតក្នុងកម្រិតដែលខ្ញុំឃើញជាធម្មតា ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាចាប់ពីចំណុចនេះតទៅ ដូចជាវត្ថុបុរាណ។
 ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំរកឃើញការបំពានលេខកូដធ្ងន់ធ្ងរ អ្នកគួរតែរំពឹងថានឹងមានការឆ្លើយតបពីខ្ញុំ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ កម្រិតនេះក៏ជាប្រភេទនៃការពិតមួយដែរ ដែលអ្វីដែលអ្នកឃើញនៅក្នុងដ្យាក្រាមគឺពិតជាអាចធ្វើទៅបានតាមលក្ខណៈជាក់លាក់ ហើយខ្ញុំចង់ផ្តល់ឱកាសក្នុងការធ្វើអត្ថាធិប្បាយលើវា។

 បាទ ដោយសារតែយើងបានយល់ព្រមអនុញ្ញាតឱ្យពួកគេឆ្លងកាត់ដំណើរការ 40B ដោយសារតែយើងចាប់អារម្មណ៍លើលំនៅដ្ឋានតម្លៃសមរម្យ 20% ឬ 25% ឬ 20% លំនៅដ្ឋានតម្លៃសមរម្យ ដែលជាអ្វីដែលយើងអាចធ្វើបាន ហើយខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថាវាជាអ្វីដែលយើងអាចពិភាក្សាជាមួយអ្នកអភិវឌ្ឍន៍អចលនទ្រព្យមួយចំនួន។
 សំណួរគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍មួយសម្រាប់ពួកគេគឺថាតើលំនៅឋានដែលមានតម្លៃសមរម្យអាចបង្កើនថ្លៃដើមដល់ចំណុចដែលគម្រោងពិសេសដែលពួកគេកំពុងពិចារណាក្លាយជាមិនមានតម្លៃសមរម្យ ហើយជំនួសឱ្យការស្នើសុំភាពខុសគ្នា អ្នកអាចសម្រេចចិត្តយល់ព្រម ប៉ុន្តែពួកគេនឹងមានភស្តុតាងផ្លូវច្បាប់។
 ពួកគេអាចជាការប្រកួតប្រជែង ជាការពិតពួកគេមានភាពទាក់ទាញសម្រាប់អ្នកជាង 40B មិត្តភាព។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ផ្តល់ព័ត៌មានមូលដ្ឋានមួយចំនួន។
 នេះនឹងជាស្ថានភាពខុសគ្នាខ្លាំង។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថានៅក្នុង 40B ទីបី ខ្ញុំមិនប្រាកដថាតើពួកគេអាចត្រឡប់ទៅវិញបានឬក៏អត់ថាលក្ខន្តិកៈនៃការកំណត់គឺដោយសារតែករណីនេះត្រូវបានផ្អាកដោយរង់ចាំលទ្ធផលនៃ HLC ។
 ពួកគេមិនបានត្រលប់មកយើងវិញក្នុងរយៈពេលប្រាំមួយឆ្នាំហើយវាមានរយៈពេលប្រហែលប្រាំឬប្រាំមួយខែចាប់តាំងពីករណីនេះត្រូវបានដោះស្រាយ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ពិត​ជា​សំណួរ​ផ្លូវ​ច្បាប់​ដែល​យើង​គួរ​រក​ចម្លើយ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​ផ្តល់​ឱ្យ​អ្នក​នូវ​បរិបទ​នោះ​ដូច​ជា​អ្នក​គិត​អំពី​រឿង​ទាំង​នេះ​។
 អ្វី​ដែល Andrew បាន​លើក​ឡើង​គឺ​ជា​សំណួរ​រយៈពេល​វែង។
 រឿងនេះនឹងមិនកើតឡើងក្នុងរយៈពេលប្រាំមួយខែ ឬឆ្នាំខាងមុខទេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6835.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: បាទ ត្រឹមត្រូវហើយ។
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំយល់ហើយ កំពង់ផែសុវត្ថិភាពគ្រាន់តែពង្រីកមូលដ្ឋានសម្រាប់សាលាឧទ្ធរណ៍ដើម្បីបដិសេធគម្រោង។
 ដូច្នេះវាគ្រាន់តែផ្លាស់ប្តូរថាមវន្ត។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយជាគោលការណ៍ ច្រកសុវត្ថិភាព 4 dB អាចត្រូវបានអនុវត្ត។
 ជាមួយនឹងកំពង់ផែសុវត្ថិភាពកើតឡើង ការពិតដែលថាពួកគេជាទូទៅមានភាពរួសរាយរាក់ទាក់បំផុត ពីព្រោះក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលអាចបដិសេធអ្នកដោយហេតុផលជាច្រើន។
 បាទ អ្វីក៏ដោយ
