 好吧，各位，对于那些不熟悉 40B 流程的人来说，这是一次多场听证会。
 自去年年底以来，该委员会一直在就这一问题举行会议。
 我们有专题会议。
 今天会议的主题是设计。
 所以我知道董事会最近收到了设计包的更新。
 这就是为什么我认为今天的目的是讨论这个问题。
 我看到我们有几位候选人代表。
 我会把它交给帕特·诺恩。

 因此，我们期望展示平面图、立面图和遮阳研究更新的各种设计元素，并对总体场地规划和相关公共利益进行最终审查和更新。
 所以，埃里克，我将请你发言。
 从现在开始。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=277.86s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  That's good.
 Thank you, Pat.
 Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.
 So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.
 So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.
 I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.
 So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.
 This is our current landscape plan.
 This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.
 So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.
 More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.
 uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.
 And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.
 We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.
 Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.
 So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.
 You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.
 So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.
 So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.
 So here you'll see our ground floor plan.
 This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.
 Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.
 We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.
 This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.
 In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.
 This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.
 So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.
 This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.
 We have our bike storage.
 We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.
 In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.
 The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.
 Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.
 This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.
 We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.
 Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.
 We'll probably have some fitness located up here.
 So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.
 The units are all encapsulated here.
 The yellow would be your studio units.
 The purple would be your one bed units.
 The green would be your two bed units.
 And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.
 So moving up a floor plan.
 So this would be our typical floor three through five.
 And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.
 That's our most typical plan for three floors.
 One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.
 you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.
 So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.
 And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.
 And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.
 So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.
 The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.
 We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.
 So jumping into the concept design image.
 So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.
 This is conceptual design.
 So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.
 So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.
 This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.
 In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.
 So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.
 So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.
 And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.
 And part of the reason for that is one,
 from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.
 You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.
 So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.
 But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.
 So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.
 So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.
 And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.
 So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.
 There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.
 Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.
 One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.
 You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.
 This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor
 gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.
 Here you can see we have the five-story piece.
 You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.
 Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.
 This north elevation is the elevation that's
 most facing Myrtle Street.
 So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.
 You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.
 Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.
 And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.
 You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.
 and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.
 We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.
 There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.
 And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.
 you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Fellsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.
 So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.
 And then just briefly the townhome elevations.
 So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.
 Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.
 And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.
 So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.
 You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.
 So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.
 Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.
 And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.
 We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.
 And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.
 And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.
 So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.
 And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.
 And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.
 So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
 All right, so shadow study.
 So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.
 So we're going to show three items here.
 We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.
 The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.
 And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.
 And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.
 And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.
 So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.
 And this is the 9 a.m.
 condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.
 So this is the existing condition at those times of year.
 And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.
 And so we also looked at it
 as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.
 So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.
 And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.
 and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.
 So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.
 And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.
 That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.
 on those adjacent properties.
 So it's not that until 10 a.m.
 you are in a cloud of darkness.
 There's a lot of space between the buildings.
 There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.
 There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.
 And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.
 So here you'll see the 9 a.m.
 condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.
 This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.
 So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.
 and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.
 And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.
 And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.
 For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.
 And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.
 The sun's a lot higher in the air.
 So you'll see a lot less shadow.
 And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.
 So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.
 summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.
 So it's about only a 15 minute difference.
 In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.
 From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.
 So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.
 So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.
 Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.
 Three, the potential rail trail connection here.
 Four, we have our internal courtyards.
 One's
 potentially a little bit more active with the pool.
 Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.
 Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.
 Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with
 you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.
 I think we've been improving that each step along the way.
 I think
 where we are now is much better than where we started.
 And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.
 And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.
 But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.
 And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.
 So that is all.
 I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1314.237s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 所以也许接下来去见克利夫·博莫是有意义的，只是为了了解总体想法，克利夫。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1328.783s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 你能听到我吗？
 一切都好。
 极好的。
 嘿伙计们。
 我们与市政官员的最后一次会议就在六天前，即 20 日。
 我看到了大部分展示的内容。
 有一些差异，但很小。
 我想，我只是想强调我认为
 您可能已经注意到，到目前为止，我的大部分评论都与网站规划有关，这对我来说是正确的起点。
 在有大量建筑物之前，没有必要详细讨论建筑物的质量等，当然也没有必要讨论位置材料，甚至楼层平面图。
 直到足迹真正发挥作用，这主要是关于建筑物与周围街道的接触。
 而且从这​​个角度来说我一直非常支持这个项目的推进。
 我认为我们现在正在看到通往建筑本身的桥梁。
 这很重要。
 这些确实是概念性的。
 图纸，但我认为从我的角度来看，它们反映了该项目正在朝着正确的方向前进。
 当然，顶层的重大挫折确实至关重要。
 我又在谷歌街景上浏览了一下，只是为了记住阿玛兰斯的建筑规模。
 建筑物南北长立面的台阶与街对面建筑物的规模的关系如何。
 我想你从那里或从谷歌或从那里知道，那些建筑物
 事实上，我认为它的效果非常好，因为街对面的建筑物可占用的楼层较少，但它们实际上在建筑物上甚至在一些非常接近的邻近建筑物上有一条相当高的桥线。
 你上去到达一楼。
 通常有三层可居住的楼层和一个斜屋顶。
 所以我认为这种减少就规模而言
 它运行得很好。
 我将回顾上周会议结束后仍然悬而未决的一些事情，我认为这些事情对于如何推进建筑项目本身来说是非常好的线索。
 我想我们谈论的一件事是
 这是一座很大的建筑。
 现在，所有海拔高度都相似。
 我发现北侧的运动非常有效地突出入口旁边的入口，这对我来说非常有效。
 但请注意，该北立面东侧的其余部分也是公共空间。
 我认为值得研究的是，这个空间的更大差异化是否有用。
 我认为另一点是建筑的可持续性方面。
 我们正在谈论整个建筑的类似窗户处理。
 我认为这会是，
 确实值得继续将可持续发展的态度反映在建筑物的立面上。
 我认为确实有非常不同类型的处理方法，具体取决于您是看朝北的立面还是朝西的立面。
 可能与窗户的距离有关。
 建在墙上，或者放置微风，有助于控制阳光。
 但无论如何，我鼓励寻找通过认可来丰富建筑立面的方法，并且正如我所说，以某种方式能够解读建筑立面的可持续性态度。
 不过，我审阅了所有 27 页的影子研究。
 我会告诉董事会，我认为他们是正确的，据我所知，他们的准备是准确的。
 我很欣赏前后类型的分析，并将其缩小到甚至不同的主题。
 透视，即实际小时内阴影存在可测量差异的时间段。
 我认为这有助于正确看待事情。
 我想现在我
 我对站点规划的结果感到满意。
 具体细节还没有完全解决。
 我认为这张照片显示了在建筑物西侧所做的所有工作，这些工作真正改变了苋菜街。
 有很多关于建筑的图片我们还没有见过。
 从我的角度来看，我认为你现在看到的焦点实际上是建筑的物质性，以及如何实现规模。
 开始关注建筑本身。
 除了一份要求提供额外证据的简短备忘录外，我还没有写过任何东西。
 我之所以没有写任何东西，是因为它正在改变。
 该项目实际上发生了重大变化，我认为充实我的观点没有多大意义，直到
 大家一致认为事情相对稳定，并为最终的演示采取了某种方法。
 因此，您会看到我对建筑物的架构的更多评论，但也会看到它的位置和目前在现场的位置以及有关景观美化、保护和公共的初步想法。
 对于公众和居民来说，多功能空间或开放空间对我来说都是一个好地方。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1773.33s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我当然可以回答任何问题。
 一切都好。
 感谢您的更新。
 所以，麦科德先生，只是……是的，听起来不错。
 因此，在我们向董事会提出问题之前，我想澄清的一件事是……那么，我的理解正确吗？
 如果今晚这次会议的结果不会导致场地规划发生重大变化，那么此时，您已经要求的展品，也许您很快就会要求的一些展品，将是下一步。
 您会请求它们，然后查看它们。
 然后，在未来的会议中，我们将收到您对架构其他元素的详细反馈。
 是这样吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1819.794s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 对我来说，这是有道理的。
 我有评论，上周我就建筑的表达发表了一些评论。
 但这实际上取决于董事会中的您。
 这就是为什么我欣赏这种有节奏的方法。
 这样做，但是，是的，我的下一步，假设一般大众，大众的概念，如果它适用于你们的人民，这将有助于为我的下一个层次的分析提供信息，正如我所说，这实际上是关于物质性等，我对事物的现状做了一些其他评论，
 对我来说，我以高度的方式表达它，但我认为对你来说更重要的是你有自己的发言权，这就是我再次开始的地方，只是寻找我认为有帮助的方法。
 我认为，在这种规模的建筑中，确实值得讨论如何使该规模对建筑所在的位置有意义。
 如果质量正确并且网站上的位置正确，我认为您确实已经缩小了变量范围。
 我不知道我是否回答清楚了。
 如果我没有这样做，我深表歉意。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1918.027s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 对我来说足够清楚了，所以让我们接受它。
 谢谢。
 一切都好。
 接下来，我将向董事会提出问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1928.413s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的，迈克，这是安德烈。
 问问克里夫。
 我正在看这座大楼。
 这是一个巨大的块，一个长长的苋菜。
 它只是一堵坚固的、无差别的五层墙。
 它真的很长，我真的认为可以做更多的事情来将它分解一点，这样它就不会感觉像一堵大墙。
 我想知道你对此有什么想法吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=1975.908s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 我确实同意并且完全同意。
 我认为我引入基于方向差异化海拔处理的想法的原因之一是帮助打破大的无差异块的方法。
 还有其他的
 与引入更多垂直元素有关的策略可能会减少沿立面的入口和出口，并进行一些材料变化。
 但我同意。
 我认为选择一种节奏来打破建筑的长度并帮助它与街对面的开发项目联系起来会很有帮助。
 所以对我来说，这就是你开始的地方。
 如果地基适用于您距街道的距离以及一般您的身高，请开始雕刻该块以获得正确的平衡。
 它永远是一座大建筑，没有办法解决这个问题。
 但有一些方法可以让这个量表为您服务。
 我想，你知道，海湾、间隙，就像我说的，也许还有一些乐队。
 我没有说乐队，这更多的是横向分化，但我同意。
 还要记住，这座建筑有，所以我认为强调和改变这个入口是非常重要的
 一种穿孔的开口，可以接近北角下层的店面并向西移动。
 这有很大帮助，但不足以帮助分解其余部分的总体规模。
 这是一个很好的举动。
 我认为把它放在建筑物的那一侧是一件形状漂亮的作品。
 我同意。
 我认为上周有一些关于如何平衡工业外观的讨论。
 我的意思是，那栋建筑仍然附属于东边的仓库，这就是该地点的历史，它是一个工业用途。
 但与此同时，
 如果你看现在的建筑，实际上现在的建筑是一个附加结构。
 就好像它被分成了更小的部分。
 但无论哪种方式，对我来说，这是我现在建议研究的事情。让我们看一些分析封锁规模的方法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2163.382s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，埃里克，我认为你没有展示过你其他一些项目的图片。
 我不知道你是否想回到那张幻灯片，但是。
 然后。
 你知道，的。
 就像莫德拉·梅德福一样，还有更多。
 它看起来几乎就像不同的建筑物，对吧？
 所以我想了一下。
 该策略在这里非常有用。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2195.203s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 当然。
 我不想说我一定与这一点相矛盾，但我确实想提的一件事是，对于被动式房屋来说，在建筑物内做出更大的差异化更加困难。
 您在建筑物内设置的入口和出口越多，基本上是您在建筑物上添加的每一平方英尺的外墙，满足被动式房屋的要求就越困难。
 所以这是我们想到的事情，我们正在讨论，你知道，我们上周与规划委员会、艾丽西亚和丹妮尔以及团队的其他成员讨论了这个问题，这是一个
 梅德福选择的是专门的代码。
 这是我们非常关注的事情。
 这就是马萨诸塞州能源法规的未来。
 因此，需要记住的一件事是，越来越多的项目将有越来越少的衔接和分解，以符合能源法规的要求。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2251.474s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 您能为我解释一下什么是可扩展代码吗？
 这和被动房模式不一样吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2261.774s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 它不是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2262.635s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 所以你认为你已经超越了这个范围，对吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2265.457s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 嗯，梅德福选择了专门的能源规范，这是被动式房屋的先决条件。
 在梅德福，除了按照能源规范建造被动式房屋之外，您别无选择。
 这是一个新的要求，也是未来所有项目都必须满足的。
 好的。
 这对很多人来说都是新鲜事。
 它已经存在了一段时间了，主要是在欧洲，但它来到这里，很多人开始熟悉它，但它需要
 你知道，更好的隔热，你知道，外部建筑的连续隔热，更高的效率，更高效率的窗户，更好的机电系统。
 通常，通过被动式房屋，您通常会看到能源成本节省 90%，甚至 90%。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2320.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 我想补充一件事，正如埃里克提到的，他们有
 您办公室的三个主动被动式房屋项目。
 但我会提出一个建议，例如，因为我们也做了很多被动式房屋的建设。
 而且，您知道，如果您看看它们的外观，就会发现这是一个非常基于性能的系统。
 因此，可以对窗户和能量进行严格的建模。
 因此，如果你有很大的窗户，那么要获得出色的热性能要困难得多，如果你达到了可以做多少铰接的程度，那么很多铰接都是在实心墙中完成的。
 而且这些墙壁很容易隔热并且性能良好。
 例如，我认为解决此问题的一种方法是不一定需要与您所展示的窗口一样大的窗口。
 因此，如果从建模的角度稍微减小窗户的尺寸，则可以在隔热良好的周围区域中获得更多的效果。
 所以我同意你的观点，被动房有一些非常困难的方面。
 对所有施工文件进行连续建模。
 但我不这么认为，我认为我们现在已经建造了大约 18 或 19 栋被动式住宅楼。
 我认为你可以在体积铰接方面有更多的自由，并且仍然符合被动式房屋的要求。
 我们这样做了，我们对很多建筑物也这样做了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2439.664s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 我的意思是，我想补充的另一件事是，我始终大力支持尽可能多的单位拥有自己的户外空间和尽可能多的阳台。
 这是我肯定会研究的事情。
 我再次看到莫德拉·梅德福的这张照片。
 你知道，我认为那里有阳台，那里的阳台看起来比实际情况要清晰得多。
 也许想一下，你可以如何使用它们来做到这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2480.297s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 如果我可以添加一件事。
 我很感谢安德烈提出这个问题。
 我认为建筑的衔接是帮助将其与现有环境联系起来的另一种方式。
 不是字面上的意思，但这是帮助识别建筑物不同海拔差异的好方法。
 你已经在北边做了什么。
 是的，我们在西端有暴露的阳台，这些阳台也是后退的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2517.24s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 帕特·牛顿，你要讲话了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2520.463s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 抱歉，我只是想介入。
 谢谢。
 我只是想澄清一些事情，以便董事会在我们讨论被动式房屋时不会感到困惑。
 只是为了澄清埃里克在专门的能源法规合规途径方面提到的一些事情。
 我们不是一个集体
 能源法规专家认为，商业建筑还有其他出路。
 埃里克具体指的是住宅用被动式房屋的路径。
 所以我只是不想让董事会将我们的评论传达给其他受众并在未来造成混乱。
 我只是想向大家澄清这一点。
 我们就是这样。
 重申埃里克所说的话，坦率地说，我们对此感到兴奋。
 这是戴维斯公司的第三季度项目，该公司位于马萨诸塞州被动式房屋设计和施工的前沿。
 我们期待着这个机会，并将继续进一步自我教育，并以此设计过程为契机。
 但我只是想澄清一下，这是针对住宅领域的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2593.618s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 这是一个很好的观点。
 观察到。
 谢谢。
 谭律师，请讲。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2600.157s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 谢谢总统先生。
 以帕特所说的为基础，我认为如果成员拉鲁的关心和重点真的是提高苋菜的水平，我认为我们当然可以集中精力于此，因为我认为其他人
 我们所看到的这种增长显然是在这方面花费了大量的时间。
 但如果拉鲁先生关心的是苋菜红的一面，我认为我们没有理由不能花更多的时间在埃里克和克里夫一直在试图更好地阐明这一方面的观点上。
 这是一个概念证明。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2653.145s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 安德烈，你会说你最担心的是苋菜色的一面，还是这也适用于建筑物的正面，即北面？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2665.248s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 嗯，我的意思是，我希望看到更多这方面的工作，正如克里夫提到的，你知道，在所有海拔高度。
 我认为苋菜一侧对我来说特别突出，因为街对面有住宅物业，而且只是，
 你知道，在某些方面它看起来就像是一堵没有区别的立面墙。
 所以，你知道，显然东侧也有同样的东西，还有另一堵墙面向仓库大楼。
 所以我认为
 您可能需要适合自己的治疗方法。
 这也将是你从路上看到的。
 所以我认为所有的海拔可能都值得做一些额外的工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2719.771s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的，谢谢。
 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2728.738s">[Mary Lee]</a>: 这栋建筑有太阳能组件吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2739.42s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 我不知道，帕特，你是否想要那个。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2741.942s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的。
 是的。
 是的。
 对不起。
 此时我可以介入。
 这个我们不专门研究。
 我认为这是我们讨论过的事情。
 嗯，能够将其合并到项目中，但这还不是我们展示的东西。
 这不是我们可以具体分析的。
 你知道，就可行性而言，无论是从屋顶的空间角度还是场地的其他地方，或者任何类型的建筑角度。
 你知道，对项目的其他影响，无论是成本、设计还是其他方面，都是对的。
 这是一个开放式的回应，这一直是我们讨论的话题。
 至于我们是否计划在该项目中使用太阳能，我们还没有明确的答案。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2797.862s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 继续玛丽所说的，我认为在某些时候也提到了屋顶区域或绿色屋顶之类的东西。
 很高兴看看屋顶的处理会是什么样子，特别是因为大约有五层和六层。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2821.773s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，我认为我们可以继续改进设计并融入反映屋顶效果的元素。
 我想也许是为了消除一些混乱，我认为到目前为止我们称之为绿色的屋顶空间将位于二层庭院中，这在我们的一些平面图中可以在停车场顶部看到。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2856.742s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 很好，谢谢。
 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2868.589s">[Mary Lee]</a>: 所以我的理解是这只是一个计划草案，对吗？
 或者我们，我的意思是，这个计划处于什么阶段，这个计划是完成了 90%，还是完成了 70%？
 因为我倾向于同意安德烈的观点，因为当我看到这张照片时，它给我的第一印象是它给我的印象是仓库而不是住宅公寓。
 这是第一印象。
 但我认为，显然，如果这不是完整的计划，那么可能还有空间，
 进行修改。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2922.696s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，我明白。
 哦，请继续，蒂姆律师。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=2928.4s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 嗯，听到会员的问题，我只想回答一下。
 下面的计划和您的董事会也可以为您提供建议，但我知道该委员会已经通过了其中的几个一揽子许可证来解决这个问题。
 就完成百分比而言，综合许可法要求我们提交初步设计。
 我认为现阶段这些已经超出了基本标准。
 我认为您和您的团队了解我们可以完善并提供更多详细信息。
 例如，当拉鲁先生询问屋顶处理问题时，我们可以至少在概念上指出，我们认为屋顶上将有不同的设施，至少在概念上是这样。
 如果您想查看具体细节，
 我们可以克服它们。
 但我们希望与您合作，提供可预测未来项目和细节的条件的其他要素。
 因此，在这个综合许可级别上，你永远无法获得100%的设计图纸。
 等等，但是更大程度地表达的想法集中在这些敏感领域，例如苋菜。
 这是我们真正可以关注的事情，但仍停留在初步水平。
 只有当您获得建筑许可证时，您才能保证最终的项目，并且您的决定将反映这一点。
 我只是想非常直接地说明我们的具体程度。
 在许多城市和许多项目中，我认为在梅德福的其他项目中，这种水平的概念设计适合全面的许可审查和批准。
 我们显然希望在任何公众评论中解决理事会的担忧，并将继续这样做。
 但是，例如，埃里克审查的建筑布局规划在现阶段足以获得批准。
 我们真正谈论的是主观印象和设计美学，我们将在这个阶段发挥主导作用。
 但不会有，你知道，这就是你将得到的计划水平。
 如果您想了解更多设计特征和元素的详细信息，我们将尽力为您提供。
 是的，我们不会将施工文件作为其中的一部分。
 我想另一点是它是一座工业建筑的印象。
 嗯，有一座工业建筑及其足迹。
 这是一个工业区。
 隔壁有一个工业仓库。
 正如埃里克（Eric）所说，我们从这些技巧中借鉴了这个设计。
 我想每个人都会有自己的看法。
 我个人的看法是，它看起来就像市政府批准并建造的其他40B。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3166.823s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 一切都好。
 谢谢。
 我有一个需要澄清的问题要问克里夫·博默。
 我只是想确保我们今晚把所有事情都说清楚，这样如果有任何讨论，我们都可以达成共识。
 所以我们谈论物质性。
 我们已经讨论过衔接问题。
 我们已经讨论过屋顶视图中的其他细节。
 Bomer 先生，您对目前无法完成审核的详细信息有何具体期望？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3210.995s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 嗯，这是个好问题。
 我无法详细回答。
 让我放松一下。
 我认为谭律师的论点是合理的，因为法规本身谈到了初步计划。
 我认为我们在这位候选人身上看到的是愿意
 我想各方都同意这些是对大楼的改进。
 所以从我的角度来看，我认为这可能是我对谭律师有一些意见的地方，对我来说，建筑对现有环境的反应和适应发展模式的方式与美学有关。
 我相信，在面向公共领域的初级立面中，存在着一种义务。
 我真的很喜欢律师提到的概念验证概念。
 我完全同意这一点。我认为委员会需要知道的是他们看到的图像是
 放在一个好的地方并表明某些事情正在正确的轨道上。
 它们不会产生高水平的细节。
 这不是他们被要求做的，也没有必要这样做。
 我认为从我的角度来看，屋顶平面图和机械设备的放置很重要。
 我们不是在看机械设备吗？
 够了
 免受公共领域的影响。
 我想查看更多有关地面的信息，即地面停车场所在的位置，与建筑物的西立面有关。
 原来如此
 就像，我想看到，我真正想看到的是，我认为他们每次表演时都表现出他们真的在听你说的话。
 然后我会等待另一轮分析更多
 建筑的美学，但它们如何帮助建筑融入其中，或者在工业外观之间找到适当的平衡，但仍然可能与周围环境的一些节奏和规模相联系。
 所以我不能，我很难将这一切总结为一个，如果我有时间写一张纸条，我会期望看到什么，
 另外，至少达到我在许多社区中看到的水平，特别是当有候选人愿意与您合作时。
 我认为如果他们不继续本着这种精神并考虑其中一些关于如何结束弥撒的想法，这将是一个错失的机会。
 以及提供一些更基本的阐述。
 正如我所说，屋顶平面图在这种情况下非常重要，因为我们需要知道从街道上可以看到什么。
 如果这种观点不正确，那么我不会鼓励董事会据此做出决定，直到我真正相信候选人有义务。
 呈现准确的图像。
 它们实际上代表了非常接近议会和公众在实际建造时所看到的东西。
 因此，我们确实需要定义其中一些。
 因此，我鼓励您回来时提出一些有关如何工作的想法。
 更详细地了解建筑物的质量。
 至于植物，我同意它们非常接近，但正如我一开始所说的，我没有，因为我非常专注于场地规划，我没有详细查看平面图，但它们处于我通常看到的水平，我认为从这一点开始，在类型上。
 如果我看到严重的代码违规行为，您会期望从我这里得到反馈。
 你知道，那个级别的事情也算是盒子里的事实，你在示意图中看到的东西在规范下实际上是可行的，我希望有机会对此发表评论。
 我会指出，而且我知道建筑师也知道，
 我也很确定帕特牛顿知道这一点，在屋顶上有真正的建筑规范要求，确保建筑物将来可以过渡到屋顶太阳能，即使现在不这样做，也有要求屋顶的结构设计能够接收
 我认为今天所有的开发商都会确保他们有足够的通道通往电气室以容纳太阳能电池板，即使它们没有在最初的施工中安装。
 所以我走了一点，但我很高兴做好准备。
 一份关于重要事项的备忘录，我认为在推广概念验证的过程中可能会缺少这些事项。
 我只是想确保我有时间根据新材料思考这个问题。
 但除此之外，我建议进一步研究，进一步推进如何平衡的概念
 正如我之前所说，是的，目前每个酋长国都有一座商业商业城市，但它实际上是一种相当复杂、有趣、多样和铰接的形式。
 这是一个更好的城市景观。
 我认为你有机会拥有真正优越的城市景观，但我认为这是
 如果我们看看今晚听到的一些担忧，再进行一轮实际上会推进你自己的事业。
 所以，如果这有点迂回，我很抱歉，但我真的不能，你知道，在一个声明中，另一个声明是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3669.292s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: 总统先生，我会很快介入。
 根据记录，律师克里斯托弗·阿尔宾 (Christopher Albin) 是 MHP 的顾问。
 是的，请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3677.017s">[SPEAKER_16]</a>: 是的，我同意 Tam 律师和 Cliff 的评论，即这些似乎是根据 40B 提交的足够的建筑图纸和计划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3690.346s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 设计是一个重要的方面，我认为克里夫有一位优秀且有能力的评审员进行评审，他正在进行彻底的评审，候选人似乎正在回应他的评论。
 嗯,董事会的义务是确保这个项目是可以接受的,但是更重要的是,在全面的许可申请下,我们需要更多地研究项目的技术方面。
 我们谈论的是对交通、雨水和土木工程等公共服务的影响。
 我确信董事会知道这一点。
 我确信候选人知道这一点。
 我只是提到，董事会不会参与很长时间的讨论和许多设计听证会。
 而且，你知道，我们是按计划进行的。
 我们开始关注该项目的更多技术方面。
 我认为我们在设计方面取得了很大进步，这就是我所认为的。
 我想现在，如果有什么建议的话，你知道，你可能想看看一些东西，
 设计修改，也许还根据克里夫的附加意见进行一些更新，那么也许是时候说，好吧，我们需要审查土木工程，我们需要审查雨水，我们需要审查交通。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3770.168s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，谢谢你，埃尔芬律师。
 我今晚会议的目的是让董事会澄清他们希望看到更多细节或更改的任何剩余设计元素。
 我们已从鲍默先生那里得知了他的详细情况。
 我同意一般人的观点
 在不久的将来我也会很感激这份备忘录。
 所以，如果你能给我们寄一份，克里夫，我们将不胜感激。
 但我已经听到的是，你知道，关于屋顶的更多细节，关于重要性的细节，来自顾问的请求，以及来自，你知道的，
 鲍默谈结束弥撒的公平策略。
 我还在楼下听到了更多细节。
 我认为这些是引起我注意的主要领域。
 是的，正如鲍默先生所说，对计划的评论
 他们很接近。
 您似乎已经掌握了大部分所需的详细信息，但我们只想考虑一下。
 因此，我认为我们有一个关于设计的另一次会议的用例，也许考虑到这一切。
 但我同意阿尔芬律师的观点。
 我们不能让这成为一个永无止境的项目。
 在日历上，我们可能有
 我们还有空间再召开一次设计会议，然后我们将不得不做出一些决定以保持按计划进行。
 目前，在两周内安排的下一次会议上，除非有任何
 呃，所请求的更改或产生所需文档的问题实际上更多地关注于工程。
 嗯，所以我们可以根据今天的讨论讨论是否应该改变这一点，但是，是的，我们需要让设计收敛，这样我们也可以，嗯，
 为技术要素提供足够的细节，以便董事会能够评估我们必须在法律时间表中评估的所有内容。
 这就是我的意图。
 请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3927.624s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 不，我只是想，你知道，添加一件事，嗯，
 呃，平面图。
 它们很重要，而且克里夫正在审查它们是件好事，但实际上，根据全面的许可申请，这些平面图可以在决定后进行修改，无论是根据，嗯，嗯，州审查的监管协议，还是，呃，竣工图，它们都有可能被修改，如果它们不是重大修改，而且通常不是，
 考虑重要的修改，一般可以从40B开始进行。
 我们不应该在平面图和单元尺寸等问题上花费太多时间。
 有几个单位有卧室等，但这只是可以根据条件管理的一方面。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3984.346s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 如果可以的话，总统先生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3988.356s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，请安德烈。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=3990.077s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 我的意思是，我只想指出，几个月前，我们经历了另一个 40 B 许可流程，其中我们讨论了有关设计的一些重要细节，我认为这为社区带来了一个更好的项目。
 我认为我们继承了这个项目的规模。
 相信我，如果我从头开始，我不会在社区中间画一个巨大的矩形。
 但我认为我们有义务尽我们所能来确保这个项目。
 它的规模确实非常重要，并且以最佳方式集成。
 就我而言，我们不谈论它。
 我们并不真正分析或讨论停车问题。
 我们还没有讨论有多少自行车停放处。
 我们还没有谈到有多少电动汽车充电器。
 我们不谈论水平编程。
 除了你提到的所有技术问题之外，我们不谈论公共艺术。

 我可能记错了。

 我们可以讨论景观美化计划并讨论其中的一些操作问题。
 如果某些事情没有完全概念化，我们可能会提出一个标准。

 我知道我们很快就会召开会议，讨论其中一些其他问题，但这些是我关心的一些事情，我想确保我们讨论这些问题，如有必要，讨论条件。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4254.242s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 只是为了回应。
 只是为了回答，明确地说，我们将尝试解决每一点。

 我们已经讨论了其中的一些问题，正如您所强调的，停车一直是一个问题，我认为我们在之前的会议中已经详细介绍过。
 我们期望的只是全面审查。
 我想，从全面检讨开始以来，我们已经体会到了，也受益匪浅。
 但我确实...
 我想说，很多情况下都会有一些因素。
 我想到了公共艺术的想法。
 在向董事会提交此决定时，我们不一定知道详细程度。
 但我们当然可以为此设定一些标准。
 我认为这就是拉鲁先生的建议。</p>

 是的。
 艾维特？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4451.009s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4452.63s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 微？
 是的。
 好的，本次听证会的公开部分现已开放。
 我们现在正在接受公众意见。
 关于今天提出的概念项目。
 如果您是想谈论这个话题的观众，请随时在 Zoom 上举手，打开相机，举手，然后在聊天中输入一些内容。
 您还可以向 Medford-MA.gov 的 DennisDMcDougall 发送电子邮件。
 我会做的
 稍等片刻，然后如果有一位观众，嗯，我看到一位观众举起了手。
 所以我们先去找他们。
 请参阅 Allison D。请提供她的姓名和地址以供记录。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4499.191s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: 嘿伙计们。
 晚安。
 是的，艾莉森·达戈斯蒂诺。
 我代表 D'Agostino Trust，即 1022-1024 Fellsway 的所有者。
 我只是想重新开始，感谢您给我机会谈论和看到这一点。
 坦白说，在整个过程中我学到了很多东西。
 所以我非常感谢这次演讲和小组讨论。
 只是一些快速的事情。
 其实我会更加技术化。
 我只想接受这个
 你知道，我认为谭律师说得最好。
 这是一个工业空间。
 因此，虽然我很欣赏这是一个具有工业外观的建筑项目，但为什么不直接建造一座类似于戴维斯公司在切尔西亚马逊仓库所做的其他项目的工业建筑呢？
 这看起来很漂亮。
 这是空间设计的初衷，但我会将其作为评论留下。
 关于可用性的技术方面，上次会议中多次提到的，非常感谢
 戴维斯特许公司表示将拓宽默特尔街。
 我们在这里没有真正讨论的一件事是实用性方面。
 沿着默特尔的人行道上有很多电线杆和电线杆。
 拓宽街道，我真正关心的是，自从前几天我遛狗以来，
 在那里你可以到达管道公司，实际上，这家公司又位于默特尔和菲尔斯威的交叉路口。
 你的地界线就在人行道上。
 所以我认为只有几个问题，也许你还不知道细节，我很欣赏这一点，但是当你谈论弯曲街道时，电力和所有这些公用事业的初步规划是什么，然后你将如何通过该房产拓宽 Fellsway 和 Myrtle 实际交叉口的街道？
 可以这么说，和平，你不拥有那个小广场。
 话又说回来，我认为这些材料与其他项目非常一致。
 我真的认为这个项目是一条购物街，我为这个名字道歉，我想我笑了一点。
 我觉得材质看起来不错。
 我同意这是一栋又大又四四方方的建筑，不适合社区。
 这些只是我的评论。
 再次感谢您抽出时间。
 我真的很感激。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4672.525s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 所以我注意到了，我打算确保我们在听证会的民事会议上讨论这一点。
 因为这并不是这里真正的重点。
 我的意思是，如果候选人想简短地谈论一下这个问题，那当然是受欢迎的，但我不一定期望他们准备好答案。
 但我认为这是我们计划在听证会民事部分解决的问题。
 然后
 我知道这只是一条评论。
 当然，委员会没有责任建议土地的其他用途。
 所以是的，评论指出。
 这是公开记录的。
 但我们不会直接参与其中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4721.002s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 主席先生，我可以介入并至少提供一个简短的回应，这样我们就不会被留下
 让人们感觉我们正在解决出现的问题。
 我们可以而且肯定会在下次听证会上更深入地探讨具体问题。
 D'Agostino 女士，如果您无法参加，当前的计划要求接下来拓宽默特尔，因此，当您沿着默特尔向酋长街交叉口移动时，我们建议在街道一侧拓宽默特尔，越过管道大楼的地界线。
 所以从建筑界线来看，是的，这里很难看到。
 不是，这确实不是今晚表演的重点。
 但是，是的，从那时起上山，人行道线基本上会保持原样并下降。
 呃，计划向西推进，我们提议在我们拥有和控制的与电线杆相关的房产上拓宽默特尔街。
 我们可以在下次听证会上更详细地展示这一点，这也是上次听证会收到的信息，但人们无法清楚地看到场地平面图。
 那不是我们的意图。
 所以我们计划更详细地介绍这一点，但是，嗯。
 对于现有的实用程序组，我们计划将它们保留在原处。
 它们与默特尔街另一边的房产相连，我们不想这样做。
 我们不打算搬迁他们或停止向他们提供任何服务。
 然后是曲线。
 我们的搬迁计划围绕它们进行，实际上在默特尔街创建了凹槽，以便汽车停放在流通区域之外，但它也保留了人行道上的间隙，使柱子保持在原位。
 这又是简短的答案。
 我只是想提供一些东西。
 所以你的感觉和我们不一样。
 通过浏览这里，我们可以在两周内更详细地讨论这个问题。
 让每个人都清楚地了解我们关于桃金娘的建议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4856.667s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: 谢谢你，我只想说，谢谢你。
 我知道我不应该再打扰了，但是谢谢你。
 这有助于澄清其中一些问题。
 所以我谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4866.834s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 然后我看到另一位观众举手抓住克里斯蒂娜。
 您能提供您的姓名和地址进行注册吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4875.96s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 你好，克里斯蒂娜·卡奇，地址：梅德福默特尔街 130 号。
 我有一个快速澄清的问题，然后是一个设计问题。
 光和噪音污染的研究会成为土木工程或设计的一部分吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4898.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 所以我认为，关于光污染和噪音污染的研究，我不确定它们是否会定期进行。
 强制性展览。
 所以我认为照明计划将处于工程阶段。
 您在寻找特别的东西吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4919.395s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 嗯，是的。
 你要在我的公寓前面建造一座巨大的建筑。
 将会有更多的居民、噪音、动物、灯光。
 这条街上以前不存在的景观美化、公共照明将渗透到我们的日常生活中，尤其是对于我们这些在家工作的人来说。
 除了晚上之外，如果我们早点睡觉，这些单位还会产生光污染，不仅来自香桃木，还来自房屋中的苋菜。
 这就是为什么我必须相信噪音污染和光污染，应该进行研究。
 现有居民的生活质量。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=4964.733s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我懂了。
 感谢您的澄清。
 是的，这些主题分为几类。
 然后，民用人员将包括照明计划，该计划可以让人们了解灯光在哪里以及哪些区域可能会导致照明
 你知道，灯光会影响邻近的房产。
 这是我们当然可以考虑的事情。
 我认为窗户和类似的东西的位置更重要。
 建筑，然后，你知道，是否有隔音等，我知道有相关的代码，但我认为，这将是文明的。
 所以，是的，其中一些内容涵盖了这一点，但要非常清楚，如果我错了，提问者可以纠正我吗，我不这么认为。
 将会有专门详细介绍光污染研究和噪音污染研究的展览。
 相反，我们会谈论照明和隔音等。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5038.389s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 主席先生，这是正确的。
 土木工程师将审查的照明计划最终将包括光度计划。
 显示出光传输到外部照明的合规性和最小化。
 关于噪音，除了规范要求外，显然还有市政噪音立法。
 如果有特定的声音发射器怎么办
 屋顶设备等令人关注的问题通常可以成为建筑和土木审查的重点，以减轻这些影响。
 但这些是董事会通常会考虑的因素。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5097.163s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 克里斯蒂娜，这回答了你的问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5103.393s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 他回答了我的问题。
 我有点失望。
 不会对这些事情进行更深入的研究，但我将在民事之后对此进行任何进一步的评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5115.72s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的，我有那张图。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5118.462s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，我还有一个关于设计的具体问题。
 我认为这是针对 Cube 3 的。
 你提到过
 他在梅德福拥有四处房产，他还有一系列其他项目的工作要做。
 所以我想知道，因为您的四套顶层公寓有几个空置单位。
 将您之前项目中存在的一些缺陷纳入到这座建筑的设计中，以确保这些缺陷不会在这座新房产中再次发生。
 因此，我正在研究您如何利用对以前建筑物的事后审查来更好地为本单元的决策提供信息。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5166.021s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 所以在这种情况下，我会尝试
 将其置于理事会的权力之下。
 我将重新解释这个问题，因为您知道，该项目的这些计划中是否详细介绍了具体元素，其中包含了该领域其他项目的最佳实践和经验教训？
 因此，如果候选人想谈论任何这些细节，那就继续吧。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5188.814s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的。
 我的意思是，显然我们总是在不断学习并尝试从以前的项目中汲取经验教训。
 我认为需要记住的一件事是，我们在这里与不同的开发商合作，而不是与其他房产合作。
 因此，根据我们正在合作的客户和地点，我们在之前的酒店所做的一些事情并不适用于我们在这里所做的事情。
 但我们总是尝试从我们做错的事情和做对的事情中吸取教训，并尝试将它们带入下一个项目。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5222.194s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 总统先生，这只是一个信息问题。
 你真的能对今晚正在谈话和倾听的巴特斯居民说清楚吗？如果您对如何管理（例如光、噪音或景观的其他元素）有具体建议，您可以吗？
 请告知城市或我们，以便我们确保它是条件的一部分，或者，你知道，是我们分析的一部分。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5255.977s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，但我的意思是，我是一名工业工程师，而不是土木工程师。
 所以我需要土木工程师先给我一些可以合作的东西。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5265.004s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，好吧，为了详细阐述安德烈的观点，我认为总的来说，董事会，
 欢迎社会公众提出问题和意见。
 正如您在这些会议中所看到的，至少我希望这就是我正在寻找的，董事会正在努力确保，如果他们提出了问题或董事会尚未考虑或询问的问题，最终我们会与候选人合作，候选人会做出回应并提供这些详细信息，并且候选人到目前为止一直在做出回应。
 所以，是的，我想，谈到安德烈的观点，
 如果您有想法，无论是直接向市政府发表评论还是在公开听证会上发表评论，即使它不是来自专家场所，也能有所帮助。
 您能以注册评论的形式分享这个想法吗？
 然后，这可能会激发一场讨论或评论，其中包括体现该想法精神的特定领域的专家。
 所以，是的，我想如果我理解正确的话，安德烈，你想向居民明确表示，
 欢迎提出想法，并且有论坛，无论是在这里谈论还是与城市交谈，居民都可以在这里表达这些想法。
 特别是如果您将这些想法放在类似的时间表上或在与此相关的焦点讨论之前提出，那么董事会可能会与候选人讨论并进行头脑风暴。
 这公平吗，安德烈？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5367.772s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的。
 它可能很简单，比如，您不希望建筑物的灯光穿过街道照射到您的建筑物中，或者您可能想要更多的灯光，因为这对公共安全更好。
 我不知道。
 诸如此类的事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5381.754s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的。
 谢谢。
 其他公众的评论目前看到其他公众也想发言，但我是。
 我会等几秒钟以确定。
 一切都好。
 总统什么也没看到，正在等待关闭本次听证会公开部分的动议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5412.685s">[Unidentified]</a>: 非常感慨。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5416.007s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 让我们看一下另一个列表。
 艾维特？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5420.81s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5421.931s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 安德鲁？
 是的。
 杰米？
 是的。
 吉姆？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5427.958s">[Unidentified]</a>: 机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5429.399s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 微？
 是的，好的。
 因此，本次会议的公众评论已关闭。
 我们将在未来的听证会上接受公众对其他重要问题的意见。
 一切都好。
 我只是想再和董事会确认一下。
 关于我们今天看到的内容或今天出现的其他主题还有其他问题或评论吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5463.805s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 嗯，看到了，呃，是的，继续吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5467.25s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 为什么不呢？
 只有一件事：当建筑师正在研究这个时，我很想看看它是什么。
 该计划或计划适用于建筑物周围的一楼。
 你知道，我们再次关注更多。
 一边，但是。
 整个一楼都是空的。
 我想知道它是否可以成为壁画、其他公共艺术、一些绿墙的区域。
 我想知道那里会发生什么，这样它就不仅仅是一堵空白的墙。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5528.08s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我看到一些头部动作。
 我们可以在未来的听证会上解决这个问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5532.502s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，我们肯定会调查此事并计划在未来的听证会上做出回应。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5538.944s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 出色的。
 主席先生，我唯一要补充的是，我认为我们可以回应拉鲁先生，我们当然可以提供一些想法和可能的替代方案，让董事会在这个层面上考虑这些类型的设计元素。
 可以具有代表性，然后告知理事会最终计划可以反映哪些详细条件。
 所以你会有一个设计目标，关于你想要在检测、缓解或提供一些触发方面实现的目标，无论是在壁画中还是在最终的计划中。
 我不确定我们是否会再次拥有类似于公共艺术的概念，你知道，墙壁的 X 百分比将专门用于公共艺术。
 但我们当然可以提供一个标准和一些想法供董事会考虑。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5606.611s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，我认为代表性有帮助，至少它允许进行切实的讨论，这将为最终设计提供信息。
 一切都好。
 我们很感激。
 现在，太好了。
 现在让我们继续讨论物流。
 所以间接确认了，但我只是想再次确认一下。
 因此，在两周内，计划的重点区域是民用区域，看起来我们正在按计划审查该区域以及景观规划，以及
 今天讨论的任何更新可能不会以计划的形式体现，而只是两周后今天讨论的主题的一般更新。
 我们正走在实现这一目标的正确道路上。
 我理解正确吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5666.923s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，主席先生，这就是我们两周后返回继续进行公民讨论的计划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5675.13s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 一切都好。
 那么，鲍默先生，您是否预计何时会收到这份备忘录供董事会和候选人审查，仅就您希望看到的其他内容而言？
 可能是周一，类似的时间，一两天，下周。
 出色的。
 看起来不错。
 谢谢。
 如果候选人现在想说得更具体，我会和他谈谈。
 我目前的倾向是让我们暂时灵活一些，听证会安排在四个星期内，或多或少取决于项目和讨论在两周内的进展情况。
 看起来合理吗？
 或者是否希望现在就明确四个星期后会发生什么？
 议程将是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5736.39s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 我想我们可以灵活一点。
 我认为显然，根据两周后听证会的进展情况，如果有需要跟踪的事情，我们当然希望能够跟踪这些内容，以及今晚跟踪建筑元素。
 因此，我认为为此，如果可能的话，如果有需要跨多个主题清理的内容，也许它可能是一种实用受众，我们可以在其中涵盖多个主题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5766.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的，谢谢。
 我只是想让公众知道，所以下一个日历是，抱歉，我只是在我的日历上检查一下。
 然后于 4 月 11 日举行听证会。
 我们将在那里讨论民事事务。
 以及景观美化计划和基于这次听证会的一些更新。
 随后的听证会将于 4 月 23 日举行。
 这就是我们保持议程灵活性的地方，但我们希望将要讨论的主题之一更加详细。
 根据理事会和公众今天提到的内容以及鲍默先生的备忘录进行设计更新。
 是的，这就是我们接下来可以期待的，伙计们。
 一切都好。
 我认为我们涵盖了本次会议的所有四个主题领域。
 我只是想与候选人核实一下，看看是否还有其他情况。
 你希望我们今晚谈谈吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5855.69s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 总统先生，不是我们。
 感谢您的宝贵时间和评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5861.274s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，谢谢。
 我也很欣赏细节和时间。
 很高兴看到这里的持续进步。
 因此，我们期待两周后的会议。
 然后，
 目前，主席正在等待一项动议，以将此事继续进行到 4 月 11 日下午 6:30。
 我动了。
 还有第二个吗？
 第二。
 我去打电话。
 吉姆？
 是的。
 杰米？
 安德鲁？
 是的。
 艾维特？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5906.331s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5907.332s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 微？
 是的。
 这件事一直持续到4月11日。
 所以谢谢朋友们。
 因此，这是议程上唯一的主要项目。
 其中存在一些程序要素。
 丹尼斯，你能读一下下面的文章吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5923.985s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 当然。
 我们有一个行政更新，我想说的是，这仅供参考。
 我不会有空。
 我会在那里，我要走了。
 所以我会在下周一、周三或周四出去，具体取决于我什么时候回来。
 所以如果有什么进来的话，我会确保你得到所有进来的东西。
 所以，你知道，就像克里夫和贝塔以及所有人一样，他们会将它们转发给你，你知道，当我离开时，他们将在网站上更新它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5952.552s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 所以，一切都很好。
 所以，有一个计划让某人，嗯，成为，
 您外出时可以帮我们运送吗，还是我们应该等到您回来后再运送？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5967.744s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 不不。
 我的计划是找人。
 因此，当事情发生时，我将确保，你知道，我认为这个计划，即我离开时将实施的慷慨计划，可能更准确。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5980.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 出色地。
 看起来不错。
 但感谢您的更新。
 我认为下一点是会议纪要。
 我给你发了一份。
 日前。
 是的，等等。
 我看到哈斯主任举起了手。
 请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=5998.488s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我将利用一切机会提醒您，我们正在与分区顾问合作进行分区更新。
 如果有人想与她或她团队中的某人进行一对一的会面，我们可以安排。
 如果您有自己想看到的想法，我会很高兴。
 或者，如果您希望她参加会议，那么您可以在公开会议中进行，例如
 考虑一下您希望在分区变更中看到哪些内容。
 我只是想提醒您，这个过程正在向前推进，因为丹妮尔和我几乎每周都会与顾问会面，而市议会则在委员会会议上举行会议。
 大约每两周左右，也在一次公开会议上。
 所以我只是希望每个人都记住这一点来添加内容。
 让我们从行政事务开始。
 因此，如果您对分区管理有什么困扰，现在是告诉我们的好时机。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6063.775s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的，是的，谢谢你，亨特导演。
 需要明确的是，想要利用这个机会的顾问应该直接与您联系以安排这次时间。
 出色地。
 是的，我认为，作为理事会，我们当然可以在一次定期听证会上讨论我们是否要采取一些集体理事会行动。
 不，我认为我个人的偏见是在这个过程中的这一点上，
 也许，如果董事会成员已经知道您对某些事情有意见，他们应该直接与您和顾问合作。
 因此，是的，我们可以，任何理事会成员如果想就此进行更公开的集体讨论，都可以在未来的听证会上提出动议。
 嗯，看起来不错。
 感谢您的更新。
 出色地。
 丹尼斯，你开始做会议记录了。
 是的，我知道您发送了...我知道您发送了会议记录。
 我现在只是检查一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6127.072s">[Unidentified]</a>: 嗯，不，有一个单独的普通的，我有。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6148.938s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 3 月 14 日的那个，我知道他们把它发给了所有人，我只是想回复一下。
 我以为我已经全部发送了，但我发送了很多东西，所以我不确定。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6164.845s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 是的，我已经314岁了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6173.509s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 我知道，1 月 30 日它已发送给所有人。
 我只是要返回到已发送的电子邮件。
 而且有很多。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6187.912s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的，好的，我会和董事会核实一下。
 所以我们有1月30日、1月3日到1月14日的会议纪要。成员有机会审查它们吗？
 我得到了一些点头。
 好吧，杰米，我看到你在摇头。
 是的，在浏览完它们之后，您是如何找到评论的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6218.416s">[Unidentified]</a>: 分别是1月14日和3月14日。
 两者对我来说看起来都不错。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6225.443s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，是的，我也有机会回顾它们。
 他们看起来很准确。
 丹尼斯，我想确保如果我们丢失了会议纪要，它们会发送给我们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6239.775s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 这些都是 Rachel 制作的，所以只需她将它们发送给您即可。
 在您走之前，是的，也许我们可以将它们全部放在一个文件夹中，然后您可以将它们全部发送给我们。是的，它们实际上都在 Google 云端硬盘中，只是对于这些，我将在两个不同的文件夹中批准和未批准。我只会向您发送 Google 云端硬盘链接，您可以在那里登录。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6260.557s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 事实上，这会起作用。我想是的，那会很好，因为我找不到三月的那张。
 我有1月11日、25日和30日。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6271.473s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 但当我上周五把它寄给你们时，我没有看到另一个三月。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6276.139s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，那是最近的事。
 你本来想说点什么。
 不，我只是同意而已。
 是的，好的。
 好吧，现在我们正在讨论1月30日和3月14日。
 所以，是的，一些董事会成员似乎认为会议纪要是正确的。
 然后总统等待批准 1 月 30 日和 3 月 14 日会议纪要的动议。
 我还有第二个吗？
 好吧，我们打电话吧。
 吉姆？
 安德鲁？
 是的。
 杰米？
 是的。
 艾维特？
 是的。

 是的。
 好的，会议纪要已获得批准，提前致谢，丹尼斯。
 我们将密切关注其余问题，并在下一次会议中解决这些问题。
 让我们来看看。
 朋友们，谨提醒你们，我将缺席周四的听证会。
 杰米主动提出主持。
 杰米，我有一些详细信息要告诉您，我将在线下分享。
 但是，是的，除此之外，我希望周四一切顺利。
 然后我将在 4 月 11 日与大家见面。
 嗯，我想那就是，哦，继续吧，安德烈。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6371.794s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的。
 是的，只有一个问题，也许是问艾丽西亚或丹尼斯的。
 他是市里的40B顾问，我没见过他，我想我们也没有见过他吧？
 我想我的问题是，因为这涉及我们今天讨论的设计，它是什么？
 我们能否采取一些措施来更好地塑造这些正在出现的 40B 项目，使它们不再只是我们不断看到的旧的大型区块项目？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6413.833s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 安德烈，我认为哈弗蒂律师无法参加一些听证会，但他今天参加的同事克里斯，
 它是同一办公室的一部分。
 所以我们目前还没有它们，但它们正在聚集在一起。
 所以我建议有几个选择。
 董事会可以安排与我们的 40B 顾问举行执行会议，更详细地讨论这一问题，或者任何董事会成员都可以直接联系
 如有此类问题，请联系我们的 40B 顾问以获得澄清。
 我们唯一不能做的就是与一大群人私下讨论这个问题。
 是的，我建议您也许就这个问题直接联系哈弗蒂律师，然后我们可以在会议上公开讨论这个问题。
 在未来的听证会上。
 我们也可以公开询问这个问题。
 这是另一种选择。
 我认为这不一定符合执行会议的资格。
 然后我们也许能够确认哈弗蒂律师或他的一位同事将出席下一次听证会。
 我认为他们在场，我们可以直接在公开场合询问他们。
 那将是另一种选择。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6508.835s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 好吧，我对他们俩都很满意。
 也许在公众的眼光下我很高兴。
 我是说，我是说，在这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6516.687s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 所以，是的，也许考虑到您的好奇心以及距离我们下次听证会还有两周的时间，也许我会问这个问题。
 尤其是你自己，得到答案。
 然后，基于此，你可以再次公开询问，或者你可以告诉我你希望就这个问题进行公开讨论。
 我简单表达一下我的理解。
 我认为董事会可以做什么和不能做什么之间存在着微妙的平衡和一些限制。
 这就是为什么如果存在不确定性的话会更好
 我们实际上能做的事情，我想如果40B顾问在公开场合这么说的话会更好。
 我认为，总的来说，当地问题与可能使该项目不经济的因素之间的平衡，尤其是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6576.456s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 好的。
 只是因为我很好奇，我们怎样才能得到
 你知道，所有的谈判，比如单位数量、土地数量等等。
 我的意思是，我认为如果每个人都能更好地理解就好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6594.821s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 当然，是的，也许我们可以开始，因为这是一个更普遍的问题。
 我打算把它作为开场主题之一。
 在我们的下一次会议中，我们可能会联系 40 B 顾问并请他向观众提供一个简短的总结。
 作为 40B 流程一部分的董事会考虑因素类型。
 这对你有用吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6619.358s">[Unidentified]</a>: 当然。
 好的，太好了。
 另一件要记住的事情是，一旦这些项目完成，我认为他们会告上法庭，他们会让我们承担 10% 的税率。
 所以，祈祷吧，理论上我们不会再看到另外 40B 到达。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6639.593s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 我不在乎 40 个 B，我想支持住房。
 我只是想让它像那样。我希望看到他们达到 50% 的水平。
 我希望它能被精心设计，也许我们可以拥有更小的建筑物或不同的高度之类的东西，而不是这些巨型街区。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6660.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我看到亨特律师想说，对不起，亨特主任，哇，他想说点什么。
 所以，亨特主管，我只想说，我们正在遵循一条路线。
 我们不是在谈论这个具体项目，而是说我们已经取得了进展。
 所以真的
 我建议我们不要在这里深入研究细节。
 但是亨特导演，他会说什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6688.304s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好的。
 所以就获得另一个40B申请而言，因为现在我们有两年的安全港，
 我们不会将有争议的事情视为有争议的事情。
 我想说的是，我们正在与其他房地产开发商讨论将项目带到梅德福和分区以及事情如何运作。
 所以我们可以看到的是一个友好的 40B，但这将是一个非常不同的情况，因为他们没有权利站出来阻止我们。
 他们将有能力向我们提供并完成 40B 流程，而不是分区差异。
 是的，因为我们同意让他们经历 40B 流程，因为我们对 20% 的经济适用房或 25% 或 20% 的经济适用房感兴趣，这是我们可以做的事情，我会说这是我们可能与一些房地产开发商讨论的事情，
 对于他们来说，一个有趣的问题是，这么多的经济适用房是否会增加他们的成本太多，使他们正在考虑的特定项目变得难以负担，而不是要求差异，你可能会决定批准，但他们会有法律证据。
 他们可能会受到挑战，确实，他们比友好的 40B 更容易被吸引。
 所以我只想提供一些背景信息。
 这将是一个非常不同的情况。
 我认为在第三个 40B 中，我不清楚他们是否可以回去或者他们的诉讼时效是多少，因为他们将案件搁置，等待 HLC 的结果。
 他们已经过去六年没有回复我们了，距离案件解决已经过去了大约五六个月。
 所以，实际上，这是一个我们应该得到答案的法律问题。
 所以我只是想让你在思考这些事情时有这样的背景。
 安德烈提出的是一个长期问题。
 这不会在未来六个月或几年内发生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6835.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，这是正确的。
 据我了解，安全港只是大大增加了上诉法院拒绝项目的理由类型。
 所以它只是改变了权力动态。
 但原则上可以应用 4 dB 安全港。
 有了安全港，就有了他们通常很友好，因为董事会可能会出于各种原因拒绝您。
 是的，无论如何。
 然后总统等待休会动议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6880.275s">[Unidentified]</a>: 关闭会议的动议。
 第二。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6882.656s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 其次，一切都很好。
 我们打个电话吧。
 吉姆？
 是的。
 安德鲁？
 是的。
 杰米？
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6893.147s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000647&t=6894.089s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 迈克，是的。
 好吧，现在我们完成了。</p>
