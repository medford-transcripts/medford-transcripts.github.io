[SPEAKER_08]: Yvette Velez?

14
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,088
[SPEAKER_04]: present.

15
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm spacing out.

16
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I call you, Andre?

17
00:00:38,632 --> 00:00:39,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah, sorry.

18
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:41,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Caldera present.

19
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,895
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the full board present, so we can get started.

20
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:45,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, can you please kick us off?

21
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:57,823
[SPEAKER_13]: On March 29th, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill which, among other things, extends to temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law to March 31st, 2025.

22
00:00:58,443 --> 00:00:59,264
[SPEAKER_13]: And hold on a second.

23
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:00,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I recording?

24
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,774
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't sure if we were recording or not, and we are.

25
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:05,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, excuse me for that.

26
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:14,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at a meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

27
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:23,019
[SPEAKER_13]: The language that I'm making substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

28
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,660
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, great.

29
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dennis, can you read the first matter, please?

30
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:35,135
[SPEAKER_13]: 970 Felsway, case number 40B-2023-01, continues from March 14th.

31
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:49,707
[SPEAKER_13]: The resumption of consideration of the petition of DIV Felsway LLC, the Davis Company, is for a comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40B, for a multi-family, six-story apartment development located in approximately 3.4 acres of land at 970 Felsway, property ID 7-02-10.

32
00:01:51,708 --> 00:02:03,994
[SPEAKER_13]: This proposal will be developed as an approximately 289 units consisting of 278 units of multifamily housing and 11 townhomes with 73, 25% of the total units of them being designated as affordable housing to low or moderate income households.

33
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:06,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

34
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:07,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dennis.

35
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:12,703
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, folks, for those unfamiliar with the 40B process, this is a multi-session hearing.

36
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:16,707
[SPEAKER_09]: The board has been meeting on this matter since late last year.

37
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:19,990
[SPEAKER_09]: We have topical sessions.

38
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,294
[SPEAKER_09]: The topic for today's session is the design.

39
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:30,416
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I know the board received updates to the design packet recently.

40
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:34,018
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I believe the intent is to walk through that today.

41
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:36,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I see we have multiple representatives for the applicant.

42
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll turn it over to Pat Noon.

43
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

44
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:45,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

45
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:46,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us this evening.

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,803
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several members of the team here ready to present.

47
00:02:50,863 --> 00:03:00,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask Eric Samuelson from cube 3 to he will be sharing his screen and running through the majority of the presentation this evening.

48
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just wait for him to bring that up and I'll give a quick introduction and turn it over.

49
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

50
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone should be able to see that now.

51
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:23,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

52
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:25,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

53
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as I said, we are pleased to be here this evening.

54
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:32,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all again for making the time to have us on the agenda.

55
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:45,517
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be presenting this evening with a focus on the advancement of the design and the several elements of the of the architecture.

56
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:56,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We just as an update from our last hearing have continued to move this forward from our previous design focus hearing in February.

57
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:04,091
[SPEAKER_02]: The design team has met with cliff and members of planning staff and a follow up.

58
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:10,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Peer review session and collected feedback and incorporate that into our presentation this evening.

59
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:29,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking forward to presenting on several elements of the design floor plans, elevations and an update on the shadow study with a close out as a review and update to the overall site plan and public benefits related to that.

60
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:33,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Eric, I will turn it over to you to jump in and.

61
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,860
[SPEAKER_02]: present from here forward.

62
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,240
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

63
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:39,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Pat.

64
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:41,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everyone, for being here tonight.

65
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:50,749
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're excited to go over some updates that we've been working on for the last month or so, since the last time we had an architectural update in these hearings.

66
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So Pat kind of gave a brief overview of what we're expecting this agenda.

67
00:04:55,072 --> 00:05:01,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to spend a ton of time rehashing things we've already discussed, but always happy to talk further at the end of the presentation.

68
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:13,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So just reorienting everyone to the project site here, located here at the site corner of Amaranth and Myrtle Street.

69
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,106
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our current landscape plan.

70
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:25,252
[SPEAKER_05]: This was presented, I believe, last week or no, it may have been two weeks ago now at this point.

71
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:33,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is our current plan that we have been discussing for the last few meetings that we have had in some of our project objectives here.

72
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:40,821
[SPEAKER_05]: More public open space, less pervious area, less curb cuts, reducing the building height along Myrtle and Amaranth.

73
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:46,574
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, less surface parking along Amaranth, uh, and increasing that setback along Amaranth.

74
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:53,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another thing that we'll be touching on a few times tonight is the Passive House Sustainable Energy Goals, uh, that we are reviewing for this project.

75
00:05:53,835 --> 00:06:00,236
[SPEAKER_05]: We are aware that Medford has opted into the Specialized Energy Code, um, so we will certainly be touching on that a few times here.

76
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:09,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we do have a sustainability consultant on board that we have met with, and we have already started reviewing, uh, the project and project goals with them.

77
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:22,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So jumping into the site plan here, one thing I do want to quickly note is that this plan is rotated from the site plan that we just reviewed.

78
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:27,855
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see the north arrow here in the bottom left, which let me get a laser pointer on for everyone.

79
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:38,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is rotated at a degree, it's just in order to allow us to get these plans a little bit larger in scale on these sheets.

80
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:42,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is rotated just for ease of enlarging it.

81
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you'll see our ground floor plan.

82
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:49,936
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where we have the majority of our internal parking within the building.

83
00:06:51,177 --> 00:07:00,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Within here, you'll see we have back of house spaces for water, fire pumps, electrical rooms, teledata rooms, where our stair and elevator cores are coming to the ground.

84
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:05,206
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a trash located here in the bottom left of this building plan.

85
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:11,670
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be adjacent to where there's some loading for the adjacent industrial use there, the storage use.

86
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:16,194
[SPEAKER_05]: In pink, you'll see this is where we have leasing and amenity space.

87
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be facing towards the Amaranth Ave side and the Myrtle Street side.

88
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:24,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would be our front-facing leasing and amenity.

89
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:29,661
[SPEAKER_05]: This would include leasing offices, our kind of front reception.

90
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:30,982
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our bike storage.

91
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:38,946
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably have some lounge spaces and other kind of semi-active uses along this ground floor plan.

92
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,295
[SPEAKER_05]: In orange, you will see these are the townhomes.

93
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,129
[SPEAKER_05]: The lighter orange are the two-bed townhomes, and the brighter orange is the three-bed townhome.

94
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving up a floor plan, so this is the second floor.

95
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:54,481
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where we'll have two internal courtyards.

96
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:58,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll also have some private amenities here on the second floor.

97
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Within these, you'll find kind of connection between the two courtyards, you know, with more lounge spaces, maybe some kitchenettes.

98
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:09,385
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably have some fitness located up here.

99
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:16,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So there'll be a variety of different amenities that we haven't finalized yet, but, you know, that we'll be exploring for the residents of the building.

100
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,668
[SPEAKER_05]: The units are all encapsulated here.

101
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:23,510
[SPEAKER_05]: The yellow would be your studio units.

102
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,951
[SPEAKER_05]: The purple would be your one bed units.

103
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:30,973
[SPEAKER_05]: The green would be your two bed units.

104
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And then your kind of off blue units would be your three bed units.

105
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So moving up a floor plan.

106
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would be our typical floor three through five.

107
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:46,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here you'll find kind of a formalized floor plan.

108
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our most typical plan for three floors.

109
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:59,928
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I do want to call out that we had been working on with Cliff, our peer reviewer, that may look small and planned, but we think really helps kind of open up the corner as we notched the corner towards Amaranth and Myrtle.

110
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:04,169
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, this was the kind of closest point to the property line.

111
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:12,096
[SPEAKER_05]: So something we were reviewing with him and based on a comment we had heard many weeks ago, is we try to create a visual break there at that corner.

112
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see that a bit further in the conceptual design.

113
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:19,550
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the top floor plan that we have been discussing that we have set back.

114
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,712
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the top floor that set back from Amherst and from Myrtle Street.

115
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,933
[SPEAKER_05]: The Amherst setback actually increased a little bit.

116
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:34,715
[SPEAKER_05]: We had it further out in some of our initial sketches, but this was actually able to pull back even a little bit further than we originally had.

117
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:42,179
[SPEAKER_05]: So jumping into the concept design image.

118
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:48,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, recognizing this is not a final image, a final construction image of what this will look like.

119
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:50,184
[SPEAKER_05]: This is conceptual design.

120
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:55,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are still pieces and details that are being finalized.

121
00:09:55,367 --> 00:10:00,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want everyone to think that this is the, you know, construction ready per se.

122
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,513
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our concept image of what we are expecting for this project.

123
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,837
[SPEAKER_05]: In the bottom left, you'll see a key plan.

124
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:14,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're taking this from about the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle, looking at this corner of the building.

125
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:23,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you'll see that we really simplified the design from the original concept we had from a few years back.

126
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:34,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that we were really emphasizing was trying to do simple and strong kind of massive moves across this building rather than creating a lot of complicated pieces.

127
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:36,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of the reason for that is one,

128
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:46,348
[SPEAKER_05]: from a passive house standpoint, the more ins and outs that you do on a building, the harder it is to achieve a passive house standard.

129
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:51,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You do want a more simplified massing model for your project.

130
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:55,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So from a sustainability standpoint, it was something that we were really keeping in mind.

131
00:10:55,937 --> 00:11:01,902
[SPEAKER_05]: But two, we felt like it was a simple massing created just stronger design moves.

132
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:08,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you'll see on the ground floor, we're really looking to activate this kind of ground floor right at the corner of the property.

133
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:15,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So we created a band to pull you in towards the main entry, which would be here towards the center of the building.

134
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:21,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And this would be opposite of the turnaround that we have for visitors and for leasing.

135
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:26,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to create that front door entry and be able to pull people in from the corner towards there.

136
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:39,786
[SPEAKER_05]: There we have a simplified masonry look to pull off some of the industrial of the site, recognizing we don't want the whole building to feel industrial, but we did want to relate to that piece a bit.

137
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:45,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Then along the Amaranth side, we created a two-story datum line down the edge here.

138
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:56,400
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing we were thinking about there was mirroring what's happening across the street at the condos on the other side of Amaranth and try to mimic that datum line.

139
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:05,734
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll also notice some of the landscaping in here along the front, some sort of play areas.

140
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:23,447
[SPEAKER_05]: This might not be the exact equipment or selections being used, but just to get an idea of some spaces that we're thinking about, some bike parking along the front of the building that we're looking to create some activity, some seating areas, and maybe some outdoor

141
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:31,633
[SPEAKER_05]: gym equipment or other things may happen down this stretch that we have landscaped with this nice landscape buffer down Amherst.

142
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you can see we have the five-story piece.

143
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:41,181
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just see the very tip of the six-story setback back there.

144
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:47,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Then here we're just going to jump quickly into elevations.

145
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:52,631
[SPEAKER_05]: This north elevation is the elevation that's

146
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,622
[SPEAKER_05]: most facing Myrtle Street.

147
00:12:56,004 --> 00:13:05,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you'll see that that front door piece that I was discussing before, the amenity on the front, there is amenity as well on the left, but we really wanted to kind of create the focus of the band here.

148
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:12,992
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see that the six-story piece is showing here, but we faded this as it is in the background of this image.

149
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:17,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in elevation view, you do see it, even though it is set back from this facade.

150
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:21,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll notice that same along the west elevation of Amarith.

151
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:27,487
[SPEAKER_05]: You will see the sixth floor based on just the elevation view, but it is set back from the rest of this elevation.

152
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:32,489
[SPEAKER_05]: and here we'll have landscaping and such down the ground floor.

153
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:36,890
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really looking at doing fiber cement siding and masonry.

154
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:45,173
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be some metal panel towards the entry, but the majority of the building we're looking at doing a fiber cement siding.

155
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:53,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just the other two elevations for this building, the south elevation facing the rail trail.

156
00:13:55,318 --> 00:14:11,394
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, using a kind of the four-story element with just a break towards the back, and then the east elevation, which is, I say facing the Felsway, but really that's mostly internal to the site facing the industrial building that we are partially demoing here.

157
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:14,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would be facing that internal driveway that we have.

158
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:21,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just briefly the townhome elevations.

159
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would be the, what we're considering the north elevation that would be facing along Myrtle Street.

160
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:36,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the south elevation facing internal to the site with the garage entries into those units, and then the two side elevations as well.

161
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:57,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just an example of a few materials that I kind of referenced before, the fiber cement siding, a few of the colors we were looking at, the masonry, the metal panel at the entry, and then some, you know, maybe fiber cement wood panel that we're looking for, maybe at the townhomes.

162
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:12,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So just quickly rehashing some of the projects that we have done here in Medford before, just to get a feel of some of the examples of materials that we're using on these projects that we will also be using here.

163
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:15,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see a lot of these fiber center products and masonry.

164
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:18,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot of similar materials that we've done before.

165
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:24,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Designs are a little bit different, but just to get a flavor of kind of what we've been working on.

166
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:30,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also wanted to note some of, you know, what the passive house projects that cube three has been working on.

167
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:36,200
[SPEAKER_05]: We have three permitted projects with passive house right now, once in construction finishing later this year.

168
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are in new in Shrewsbury and Salem.

169
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:47,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have probably about a dozen more that are in design currently that we're planning to be permitted this year for Passive House.

170
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are very familiar with the standards for Passive House.

171
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:55,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are trying to get more and more people licensed within our office as we speak.

172
00:15:56,274 --> 00:16:03,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a big initiative for us here in not only Medford, but in Massachusetts as a whole and hopefully elsewhere.

173
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,621
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.

174
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,807
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so shadow study.

175
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:20,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went through these in a lot of detail last week with the planning board and with Cliff, our peer reviewer.

176
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to show three items here.

177
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:34,400
[SPEAKER_05]: We have others if we needed to review them, but I felt like these three times of year and the early morning time really highlighted what we're seeing from the site.

178
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:40,404
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of the shadows that we see cast on adjacent properties are from this early morning time.

179
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:48,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what I'm gonna show here is on the left, we have our existing condition.

180
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:52,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the right, we have our new condition with the existing condition highlighted still in red.

181
00:16:53,597 --> 00:17:00,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we also have timeframes at the top to correlate to how long the shadows are casting on the adjacent property.

182
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:07,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is March, September, which are very similar in shadow timeframes.

183
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the 9 a.m.

184
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:11,696
[SPEAKER_05]: condition that you're seeing in the images themselves.

185
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the existing condition at those times of year.

186
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:23,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the new condition, you can see in the blue line of where that shadow was cast for both multifamily as well as the townhomes.

187
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:26,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we also looked at it

188
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,844
[SPEAKER_05]: as far as how long is the shadow being cast on those adjacent properties.

189
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:35,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the existing, it's from sunrise to about 930 a.m.

190
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:43,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the new proposed buildings, the multifamily building is sunrise to about 10 a.m.

191
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:46,001
[SPEAKER_05]: and for the townhomes, it's sunrise to about 9 a.m.

192
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So from the existing addition to the new condition at this time of year, it's about a half hour more of shadow.

193
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:56,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't mean the shadow is fully casting over the building.

194
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:58,722
[SPEAKER_05]: That means there is any bit of shadow being cast.

195
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:00,636
[SPEAKER_05]: on those adjacent properties.

196
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:04,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not that until 10 a.m.

197
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,421
[SPEAKER_05]: you are in a cloud of darkness.

198
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,583
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of space between the buildings.

199
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:13,688
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of skylight still being put on these adjacent properties.

200
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:17,591
[SPEAKER_05]: There is just a slight shadow being a little bit longer than before.

201
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:26,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And so December is the worst time of year when it comes to shadows because the sun is at its lowest.

202
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So here you'll see the 9 a.m.

203
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:37,710
[SPEAKER_05]: condition for existing fairly large gas shadows and same for the new condition fairly large gas to shadows.

204
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:42,333
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the worst time of year you will see for shadows because of the angle of the sun.

205
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:46,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the existing it's about sunrise to about 9 30 a.m.

206
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,837
[SPEAKER_05]: and for the proposed the multi-families about till 10 15 a.m.

207
00:18:51,644 --> 00:19:00,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And the townhomes is about till 1230 just because it never is able to fully escape that just based on the angle of the sun.

208
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,892
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, that doesn't mean the townhomes are casting a full shadow on those townhomes.

209
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:08,055
[SPEAKER_05]: For sometimes a day, that's only a foot or two onto the base of that building.

210
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:15,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And then towards the summer, it's a lot different.

211
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,301
[SPEAKER_05]: The sun's a lot higher in the air.

212
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,084
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see a lot less shadow.

213
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:28,007
[SPEAKER_05]: And so still this is a 9am condition, you'll see very little shadow from the existing building, you'll see a bit more from the proposed building here in blue.

214
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:33,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So the existing is about sunrise to about 8-15am in the summer.

215
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:39,619
[SPEAKER_05]: summer sun, sorry, and the multifamily building is about 830.

216
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,482
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's about only a 15 minute difference.

217
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:46,246
[SPEAKER_05]: In the summertime, the townhomes do not cast a shadow.

218
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:54,135
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I can tell, there's any different that would be cast from any of the adjacent trees or buildings just from the sun rising.

219
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:10,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to kind of rehash some project amenities, so we have some numbers here on the left correlating to the plan on the right.

220
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:15,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So one, we have our kind of dog park here on the exterior.

221
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, the playground touching along Myrtle Street.

222
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:22,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, the potential rail trail connection here.

223
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:25,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Four, we have our internal courtyards.

224
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:26,157
[SPEAKER_05]: One's

225
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,681
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially a little bit more active with the pool.

226
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:34,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Another one might be a little bit more passive with just lounge and seating.

227
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, you'll have one doing one thing and one doing the other.

228
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:49,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Five, we have our landscape buffer between the building and Amarith, which connects to the whole idea that we've been really working on over the last few months with

229
00:20:51,763 --> 00:21:05,991
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the planning board, the ZBA, our peer reviewers, making sure that we're creating enough of a landscape buffer along Amaranth and along Myrtle to really increase the public realm condition from what's there today to what we originally proposed to now.

230
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:09,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've been improving that each step along the way.

231
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I think

232
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:15,191
[SPEAKER_05]: where we are now is much better than where we started.

233
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that landscape buffer has a lot of opportunity.

234
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:25,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anyone has ideas or other things that they think could help, that we're always interested.

235
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,485
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think creating that much of landscape buffer between the public realm and the building just gives us a lot of opportunity.

236
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:37,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't get to see that a lot in projects around this area.

237
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is all.

238
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:49,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I didn't go too fast or too slow, but if anyone wants to go over anything, please let me know.

239
00:21:54,237 --> 00:21:54,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

240
00:21:56,818 --> 00:22:04,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And so maybe it makes sense to go to Cliff Bomer next, just to love to get your overall thoughts, Cliff.

241
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:09,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?

242
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:09,983
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

243
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:12,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Terrific.

244
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:14,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello to everybody.

245
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:26,407
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last session that we had that did include town staff was, it was just six days ago, on the 20th.

246
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I have seen most of what was shown.

247
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,971
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some differences, but minor.

248
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:39,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the, I just want to emphasize that I think

249
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:52,185
[SPEAKER_11]: You probably have figured out that most of my comments have been related to site planning up to this point, which to me is the right place to start.

250
00:22:52,245 --> 00:23:04,029
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no point talking in detail about the buildings massing, et cetera, and certainly siting materials, even floor plans, until there's a massing.

251
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:14,987
[SPEAKER_11]: are until the footprint is really working that really primarily is about the building's engagement with the neighboring streets.

252
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:21,690
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been very supportive of where this project has gone from that perspective.

253
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:28,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we're seeing now the bridge over into the architecture itself.

254
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:31,273
[SPEAKER_11]: It is important.

255
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,994
[SPEAKER_11]: These really are conceptual

256
00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:43,135
[SPEAKER_11]: drawings, but I think they do reflect, from my perspective, that the project is moving in the right direction.

257
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:50,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly the significant setback of that top floor is really critical.

258
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:59,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did a little Google Street View walkthrough again, just to remind myself of the scale of the buildings on Amaranth.

259
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:09,602
[SPEAKER_11]: to what degree that step down on the north to south long elevation of the building worked relative to the scale of the buildings across the street.

260
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:17,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you know from being there or however you know it through Google or actually being there, those buildings

261
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:35,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I think it works very well because buildings across the street, they have fewer occupiable floors, but they have actually quite a high bridge line on the buildings and even some of the neighboring buildings very nearby.

262
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,728
[SPEAKER_11]: You step up to get into the first floor.

263
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:41,931
[SPEAKER_11]: There are often three habitable floors and then a sloped roof.

264
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:47,114
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that step down, as far as scale is concerned,

265
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:49,544
[SPEAKER_11]: is working really well.

266
00:24:50,945 --> 00:25:09,078
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go through some of the things that were still outstanding after our session last week that I think are really good cues about how to advance the design of the building itself.

267
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:13,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one thing that we did talk about was

268
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:15,955
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a large building.

269
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:23,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now, all of the elevations are similar.

270
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:33,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the moves on the north side are very effective at accentuating the entry piece right off of the driveway, which works very well for me.

271
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:40,413
[SPEAKER_11]: But do take note that the rest of the eastern side of that north elevation also is common space.

272
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:47,341
[SPEAKER_11]: and whether further differentiation of that space would be helpful or not, I think is worth studying.

273
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:56,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I think another point was the sustainability aspects of the building.

274
00:25:56,204 --> 00:26:03,266
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about kind of similar window treatments all the way around the building.

275
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:05,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it would be,

276
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:15,936
[SPEAKER_11]: really worth pursuing having the attitude towards sustainability reflected in the building elevations.

277
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:29,345
[SPEAKER_11]: And there really are very different types of treatment that I think can be considered depending upon whether you're looking at a north-facing elevation or a west-facing elevation.

278
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:32,607
[SPEAKER_11]: It might have to do with how far the windows are

279
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:39,408
[SPEAKER_11]: inset into the wall, whether they're small brisa laid that help with control of the sun.

280
00:26:39,828 --> 00:27:01,458
[SPEAKER_11]: But in any case, I did encourage looking at ways to enrich the building elevations through recognition, and like I said, sort of being able to read an attitude towards sustainability on the elevations of the building.

281
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:07,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I did go through all of the, however, 27 pages of shadow studies.

282
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:15,907
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would report to the board that I think they were accurately, as best I can tell, they were accurately prepared.

283
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:26,793
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate the analysis of certainly the kind of before and after analysis and narrowing that down even to a different

284
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:38,080
[SPEAKER_11]: perspective, that being time frame of what are the real hours where there's a measurable difference in the shadows.

285
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that helps put things in perspective.

286
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:46,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for now, I'm

287
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,877
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy with where the site plan is gone.

288
00:27:50,997 --> 00:27:53,481
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not completely worked out in detail.

289
00:27:53,521 --> 00:28:02,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this image shows all the work that's happened on the west side of the building that I think has really transformed Amaranth Street.

290
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:10,342
[SPEAKER_11]: There are lots of images that we still need to see about the architecture.

291
00:28:10,382 --> 00:28:21,931
[SPEAKER_11]: And from my perspective, I think the focus of what I would be looking at now is really the materiality of the building, how the scale is dealt with.

292
00:28:23,816 --> 00:28:26,498
[SPEAKER_11]: starting to focus in on the building itself.

293
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:34,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not yet written anything in the reason other than one small memo requesting additional exhibits.

294
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:39,967
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason I haven't written anything is because it's changing.

295
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:48,653
[SPEAKER_11]: The project has really changed significantly and I didn't think it really made a lot of sense to nail down my opinions until

296
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:58,490
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a consensus that things were relatively stable and some form of a closer to a final submission was made.

297
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:19,143
[SPEAKER_11]: So you will be seeing more comments from me as far as the architecture of the building, but as far as where it's gone and where it sits on the site right now and the preliminary ideas about landscaping and buffering and public

298
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:27,987
[SPEAKER_11]: space or open space that is multi-use, both for public and for the residents, to me, is in a good place.

299
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And certainly, I can answer any questions.

300
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:34,491
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

301
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the update.

302
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:39,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, Mr. McCord, just... Yeah, sounds good.

303
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:48,520
[SPEAKER_09]: So, one thing I just want to be clear about before we open it up to board questions is... So, am I correctly understanding that

304
00:29:49,753 --> 00:30:08,769
[SPEAKER_09]: If the outcome of this meeting tonight doesn't result in material changes to the site plan, then at that point, the exhibits you've already requested and maybe some exhibits you'll request shortly, that would be the next step.

305
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:11,451
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd request these, and then you'd review them.

306
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:17,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in a future meeting, we would get your detailed feedback on other elements of the architecture.

307
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:17,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that right?

308
00:30:19,794 --> 00:30:21,616
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, that makes sense.

309
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:31,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have comments, and I made some of the comments last week about the expression of the building.

310
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:38,931
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's up to you folks on the board, really.

311
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:42,975
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate this kind of paced approach.

312
00:30:43,580 --> 00:31:06,992
[SPEAKER_11]: to doing it, but yes, my next steps, assuming that the overall massing, the concept of the massing, if that's working for your folks, that will help inform my next level of analysis, which, like I said, is really about the materiality and other, I made some other comments about how things are,

313
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:23,285
[SPEAKER_11]: to me, expressed in the elevation, but I think it's more important for you folks to weigh in, and that's where I would start, again, just looking at ways that I think will help.

314
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:35,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know, a building of this scale, it's really worth talking about ways to make that scale make sense for where that building is sitting.

315
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:48,445
[SPEAKER_11]: If the massing is roughly right and the placement on the site is roughly right, you've really narrowed down the variables, I think.

316
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:52,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I answered that clearly or not.

317
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:54,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize if I didn't.

318
00:31:58,027 --> 00:32:00,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Clear enough for me, so we'll take it.

319
00:32:00,427 --> 00:32:00,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

320
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:01,748
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

321
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:03,728
[SPEAKER_09]: With that, I'll open it up to questions from the board.

322
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:09,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mike, this is Andre.

323
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:17,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Question for Cliff.

324
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:21,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at this building.

325
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:28,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a massive block and a long amaranth.

326
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:34,537
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a solid five-story undifferentiated wall.

327
00:32:35,684 --> 00:32:49,907
[SPEAKER_07]: very long, and I really think a lot more could be done to break it up a little bit so it doesn't come across as a big wall.

328
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if you have thoughts about that.

329
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:58,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, and I concur completely.

330
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:20,096
[SPEAKER_11]: that one of the reasons I brought up that idea of differentiating treatment of elevations based on orientation is one route, I think, to helping break down the undifferentiated large block.

331
00:33:20,637 --> 00:33:21,437
[SPEAKER_11]: There are other

332
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:33,152
[SPEAKER_11]: strategies that have to do with introducing more vertical elements that can be minor ins and outs along the facade, some changes of material.

333
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,795
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do concur.

334
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:49,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I think picking up a rhythm that does break down the length of the building that will help in another way to tie in with the development across the street would really help.

335
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:57,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is why, to me, this is kind of the block that you start with.

336
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:10,364
[SPEAKER_11]: If the fundamentals are working as far as how far away it is from the street and generally the height of it, then you start carving away on that block to get that balance right.

337
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:14,965
[SPEAKER_11]: It will always be a big building, and there's no way around that.

338
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:19,807
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are ways to make that scale work for you.

339
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:28,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I think through, you know, bays, recesses, as I said, maybe some banding.

340
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:35,231
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't say banding, that's more of a horizontal differentiation, but I do concur.

341
00:34:35,732 --> 00:34:47,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And note also that this building does have, which is why I think it's really important that that entryway be accentuated and changing from

342
00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:57,611
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of punched openings to more of a storefront approach on the lowest level in that north corner and moving towards the west.

343
00:34:59,412 --> 00:35:08,640
[SPEAKER_11]: That helps a lot, but it's not really enough to help break down the overall scale of the rest of it.

344
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:09,822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a nice movement.

345
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:14,566
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a nice shaped piece to have on that side of the building,

346
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:16,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I do agree.

347
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:24,869
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there was some discussion last week about kind of balancing a sort of industrial look.

348
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:35,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this building is still married to the storage facility to the east, and that's the history of the site is an industrial use.

349
00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:37,174
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time,

350
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:43,416
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at that current building, actually, the current building is an aggregated structure.

351
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:45,698
[SPEAKER_11]: It is kind of broken up into smaller pieces.

352
00:35:47,840 --> 00:36:00,210
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, to me, that is one thing I would encourage is looking at now, let's see some ways of breaking down the scale of the block.

353
00:36:03,382 --> 00:36:08,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I mean, Eric, I don't I think you showed an image of some of your other projects.

354
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you want to go back to that slide, but.

355
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:14,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

356
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:16,768
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the.

357
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the Modera Medford, there's a lot more.

358
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of reads as almost different buildings, right?

359
00:36:26,672 --> 00:36:29,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think some of that.

360
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,902
[SPEAKER_07]: strategy would be really helpful here.

361
00:36:35,203 --> 00:36:35,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

362
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:47,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say I'm necessarily countering it, but one thing I do want to mention is with passive house, it is harder to do more differentiation within your buildings.

363
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:57,596
[SPEAKER_05]: The more ins and outs you do within your building, every basically square foot of exterior wall you add to your building, it is harder to pass the passive house requirement.

364
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:10,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is something we're keeping in mind and something that we've been discussing and, you know, we had talked about it even last week with the planning board, Alicia and Danielle and the rest of the staff that it is a

365
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:14,405
[SPEAKER_05]: something that Medford opted into, it is a specialized code.

366
00:37:14,845 --> 00:37:16,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.

367
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:21,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of the future of the energy code here in Massachusetts.

368
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:31,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So something to keep in mind is that, you know, more and more projects are going to have less articulation and less breaking down in order to meet those energy code requirements.

369
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:36,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And can you just clarify for me is the the stretch code, is that

370
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:41,554
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the same as the passive house standard, right?

371
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:42,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not.

372
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So you think you're going beyond that, right?

373
00:37:45,457 --> 00:37:50,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Medford opted into the specialized energy code, which is a passive house prerequisite.

374
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:56,024
[SPEAKER_05]: In Medford, you cannot do anything besides passive house for the energy code.

375
00:37:56,905 --> 00:38:01,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a new requirement and something that all future projects will be required to meet.

376
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:02,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

377
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:06,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's something that is new to a lot of people.

378
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:18,785
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been around for a little while, especially in Europe, but it is making its way here and a lot of people are starting to get familiar with it, but it does require

379
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:29,334
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, higher insulation, you know, continuous insulation on the exterior buildings, higher efficiency, higher efficiency windows, better MEP systems.

380
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:37,981
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times with the, in order to pass passive house, you generally will see a 90%, up to a 90% savings in energy costs.

381
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:45,488
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I did want to add, and as Eric mentioned, they have

382
00:38:45,915 --> 00:38:48,736
[SPEAKER_11]: three active passive house projects in their office.

383
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:55,040
[SPEAKER_11]: But a suggestion I would make, for example, because we do a lot of passive house buildings as well.

384
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:04,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, if you were looking at the way that these are, it's a very performance-based system.

385
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:12,028
[SPEAKER_11]: So you may have windows modeled and it's rigorously energy modeled.

386
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:31,854
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have really big windows that are much more difficult to get terrific thermal performance out of, if you make, I mean, to that point of how much articulation can you do, a lot of the articulation that's done is in solid walls.

387
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:37,780
[SPEAKER_11]: And those walls are easy to insulate and get good performance out of.

388
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:49,801
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, for example, I think one way that you could approach this would be, I think you don't necessarily need windows quite as big as the windows you're showing.

389
00:39:49,901 --> 00:40:01,088
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you cut back a little bit on the window size from a modeling perspective, you can pick up more on well-insulated envelope area.

390
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:07,933
[SPEAKER_11]: So I agree with you, Passive House does have some really tough

391
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:14,751
[SPEAKER_11]: ongoing modeling that you have to do all the way through the construction documents.

392
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:23,333
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think we have, and I think we've done about 18 or 19 passive house buildings at this point.

393
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:35,695
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you can give yourself more freedom of volumetric articulation and still stay within the passive house requirements.

394
00:40:35,895 --> 00:40:38,276
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done it, and we've done it with a lot of buildings.

395
00:40:39,664 --> 00:40:51,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the other thing that I would just add to is that I am always a big, big proponent of having as many of the units have access to their own outdoor space as balconies as possible.

396
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that I would certainly be looking at.

397
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:57,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just, again, looking at this, the picture of the Modera Medford.

398
00:40:58,303 --> 00:41:07,713
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think you have the porches there, the balconies there, kind of read as much more articulated than it actually is.

399
00:41:08,153 --> 00:41:12,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And so maybe thinking about that a little bit, how you could use those to do that.

400
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,338
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could just add one thing.

401
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:24,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate Andre bringing this up.

402
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:36,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the articulation of the building is another way to just help tie into existing context.

403
00:41:36,446 --> 00:41:46,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Not literally, but it is a good way to help recognize the differences in the different elevations of the building.

404
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:48,796
[SPEAKER_11]: which you've already done on the north side.

405
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:54,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we do have balconies showing along the west edge that are recessed as well.

406
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So Pat Newton, you were going to speak.

407
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:02,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just wanted to interject.

408
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:02,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

409
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:09,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to clarify one thing so there's no future confusion for the board as we got into the passive house discussion.

410
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:19,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to clarify something that Eric mentioned in terms of compliance pathways for the specialized energy code.

411
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,982
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not collectively

412
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:27,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Energy code experts, there are other pathways for commercial buildings.

413
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:33,467
[SPEAKER_02]: The pathway that Eric specifically is referencing in terms of being required to be passive houses for residential.

414
00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:41,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just didn't want the board to take away our comments to other hearings and have there be any confusion going forward.

415
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:43,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to clarify that for everyone.

416
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:44,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are.

417
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:49,413
[SPEAKER_02]: To reiterate what Eric's saying, we are frankly, we're excited about this.

418
00:42:49,433 --> 00:43:00,535
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a project for the Davis companies, for Q3, just being on the frontier of designing and building passive house buildings in Massachusetts.

419
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:09,597
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking forward to this opportunity and continuing to get more informed and using this design process as an opportunity to do that.

420
00:43:09,677 --> 00:43:12,938
[SPEAKER_02]: But just wanted to clarify that it was specific to residential.

421
00:43:13,618 --> 00:43:14,098
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good point.

422
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:16,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Noted.

423
00:43:16,314 --> 00:43:16,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

424
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:18,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Attorney Tam, please go ahead.

425
00:43:20,157 --> 00:43:21,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

426
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:43,113
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to build on what Pat is saying, I think if Member LaRue's concern and focus is really on the Amaranth elevation, we can certainly, I think, focus our efforts on that because I think the other

427
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:50,691
[SPEAKER_14]: This elevation that we're all looking at is obviously a good deal of time has been spent on this.

428
00:43:50,851 --> 00:44:05,823
[SPEAKER_14]: But if Mr. LaRue's concern is that amaranth side, I see no reason why we can't spend more time to the points that both Eric and Cliff have been making to try to better articulate that side.

429
00:44:05,863 --> 00:44:08,345
[SPEAKER_14]: This is intended to be proof of concept.

430
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:14,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

431
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:23,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre, would you say it's the Amaranth side that you're most concerned about, or does this also apply to the front of the building, the north side?

432
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:31,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I'd like to see further work on it, as Cliff mentioned, you know, on all the elevations.

433
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:39,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, you know, the Amaranth side particularly strikes me because there's residential properties on the other side of the street, and it's just,

434
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:47,172
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and it kind of reads in the elevation as a undifferentiated wall.

435
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:58,137
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, obviously there's the same on the east side, there's another wall and that's facing, you know, the storage building.

436
00:44:58,217 --> 00:44:59,478
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that

437
00:45:00,844 --> 00:45:04,125
[SPEAKER_07]: probably needs its own type of treatment.

438
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:08,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also going to be what you can see from the highway.

439
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:15,189
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think all the elevations probably deserve some of their own further working.

440
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:20,631
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

441
00:45:21,992 --> 00:45:24,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions or comments from the board?

442
00:45:28,738 --> 00:45:33,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a solar component with this building?

443
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Pat, if you want that one.

444
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:42,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

445
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:42,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

446
00:45:42,963 --> 00:45:43,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

447
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:43,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

448
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:45,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I can jump in at this point.

449
00:45:45,506 --> 00:45:47,667
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't studied that specifically.

450
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:52,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's something that we have discussed.

451
00:45:53,473 --> 00:45:58,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, being able to incorporate that into the project, but it's not something that we're showing yet.

452
00:45:58,517 --> 00:46:01,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that we've specifically been able to analyze.

453
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:12,492
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in terms of its feasibility, whether that be architecturally from a space perspective on the roof or elsewhere on the site, or from any sort of.

454
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:21,481
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, other impacts to the project, whether that be cost or design or otherwise, so it's.

455
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:25,826
[SPEAKER_02]: An open ended answer we it's it's been a topic of discussion for us.

456
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:31,861
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't have a definitive answer yet on whether or not we're planning to have solar on the project.

457
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:45,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to build on what Mary was saying, I think there was also mentioned at some point of maybe some like a rooftop area or green roof.

458
00:46:45,227 --> 00:46:54,033
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be good to see like what the rooftop treatment is going to be, especially since there's some is, you know, five floors and some are six floors.

459
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:09,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we can absolutely continue to evolve the design and incorporate elements to reflect what would be on the roof.

460
00:47:09,516 --> 00:47:25,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just to maybe clarify some of the confusion, I think the roof spaces that we have referred to as green to date would be on the courtyards on level 2 that you see visible in some of our site planning on top of the parking deck.

461
00:47:36,742 --> 00:47:38,003
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you.

462
00:47:38,103 --> 00:47:41,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Other questions or comments from the board?

463
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:53,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So my understanding is that this is just a preliminary draft of the plan, right?

464
00:47:55,232 --> 00:48:03,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are we, I mean, at what stage is this plan, is this plan 90% complete, 70% complete or?

465
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:26,270
[SPEAKER_03]: because I do tend to agree with Andre, because the first impression when I look at this picture is it's very, it gives me that impression of a warehouse rather than a residential apartment.

466
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:27,931
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first impression.

467
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:36,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think obviously if this is not the complete plan, then there's probably room to,

468
00:48:37,713 --> 00:48:38,694
[SPEAKER_03]: make modifications.

469
00:48:42,696 --> 00:48:44,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I understand it.

470
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:46,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, go ahead, please, Attorney Tim.

471
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I just wanted to respond as I heard the members question.

472
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:03,486
[SPEAKER_14]: The plans under, and your council can advise as well, but I know this board has been through this with a number of these comprehensive permits.

473
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:13,591
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of percentage complete, the comprehensive permit law requires that we submit preliminary design.

474
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:21,594
[SPEAKER_14]: I think at this stage, these more than meet that basic standard.

475
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:33,613
[SPEAKER_14]: I think your staff and yourselves understand we can refine and provide additional detail.

476
00:49:34,153 --> 00:49:47,160
[SPEAKER_14]: For instance, when Mr. LaRue asked about roof treatment, we can provide at least conceptually where we think there's going to be different facilities located on the roof, at least at a conceptual level.

477
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,883
[SPEAKER_14]: If there are specifics that you'd like to see,

478
00:49:55,896 --> 00:49:56,936
[SPEAKER_14]: we can advance them.

479
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:14,143
[SPEAKER_14]: But other elements where it may be appropriate to provide for conditions that anticipate future design and future detail, these are items that we would like to work on with you.

480
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:19,565
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're never going to get, at this level of a comprehensive permit, 100% design drawings.

481
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:32,019
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, but the idea about further articulation with a focus on those areas of sensitivity, such as amaranth.

482
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,142
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something we can really focus on, but it's going to remain at a preliminary level.

483
00:50:38,843 --> 00:50:45,707
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only at the time you get to a building permit that you'll have a final design locked in and your decision will reflect that.

484
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:52,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to be very direct about how specific we can be.

485
00:50:53,067 --> 00:51:07,634
[SPEAKER_14]: In many municipalities and with many projects, and I think with other projects here in Medford, this level of conceptual design is adequate for review and approval of a comprehensive permit.

486
00:51:08,795 --> 00:51:14,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, we want to address the board's concerns in any comments from the public and we'll continue to do so.

487
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:29,525
[SPEAKER_14]: But for instance, the building layout plans that Eric went through are more than adequate at this stage for approval.

488
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:45,192
[SPEAKER_14]: We're really talking about subjective impressions and design aesthetics that we're going to take your lead from in terms of what we can do at this stage.

489
00:51:48,883 --> 00:51:52,985
[SPEAKER_14]: But there won't be, you know, this is the level of plan that you'll get.

490
00:51:53,606 --> 00:51:59,669
[SPEAKER_14]: If there are elements and design elements that you'd like to see further detail on, we'll do our best to provide them.

491
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:05,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we won't have construction documents as part of this.

492
00:52:07,803 --> 00:52:11,406
[SPEAKER_14]: The other point, I guess, is the impression that this is an industrial building.

493
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:14,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's an existing industrial building and its footprint.

494
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,411
[SPEAKER_14]: It is an industrial district.

495
00:52:16,711 --> 00:52:18,392
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an industrial building next door.

496
00:52:19,493 --> 00:52:27,380
[SPEAKER_14]: As Eric indicated, we were taking this design from those cues.

497
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,804
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everyone is going to have their own opinion.

498
00:52:35,776 --> 00:52:42,441
[SPEAKER_14]: My personal opinion is that it looks similar to other 40 B's that the city has approved and have been constructed.

499
00:52:46,823 --> 00:52:47,244
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

500
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:48,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

501
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:52,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a clarifying question for Cliff Bohmer.

502
00:52:52,227 --> 00:53:01,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure that we get it all out there tonight so that if there's any back and forth discussion, we can all be on the same page.

503
00:53:01,313 --> 00:53:03,955
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've talked about materiality.

504
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:07,395
[SPEAKER_09]: We've talked about articulation.

505
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:12,059
[SPEAKER_09]: We've talked about additional detail on the rooftop view.

506
00:53:15,502 --> 00:53:26,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Bomer, what specifically will you be expecting in terms of details that are currently absent to complete your review?

507
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:32,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's a good question.

508
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:36,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to be able to answer it in deep detail.

509
00:53:36,538 --> 00:53:38,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me unwind that a little bit.

510
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:51,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Attorney Tam's point is legitimate, I think, in the sense that the statute itself does talk about preliminary plans.

511
00:53:52,550 --> 00:54:01,597
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what we've seen from this applicant is a willingness to

512
00:54:02,418 --> 00:54:08,820
[SPEAKER_11]: advance what all parties, I think, ultimately agreed were improvements to the building.

513
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:31,008
[SPEAKER_11]: So from my perspective, it is a little more, I think, where I'd maybe take some issue with Attorney Tam is, to me, the way the building responds to the existing context and fits into the pattern of development is related to what can be classified as aesthetics.

514
00:54:31,856 --> 00:54:41,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that primary elevations that face the public realm, there is an obligation.

515
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:48,484
[SPEAKER_11]: And I actually really like that concept of proof of concept that the attorney brought up.

516
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:59,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree completely with that is what I think the board needs to know is that the images they're seeing are

517
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:05,120
[SPEAKER_11]: in a good place and they do prove that something is on the right track.

518
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,081
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to produce super levels of detail.

519
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:17,544
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not at all what they're required to do, nor is it necessary to do, really.

520
00:55:18,824 --> 00:55:24,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I think from my perspective, roof plans matter, placement of mechanical equipment.

521
00:55:25,587 --> 00:55:28,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we not seeing the mechanical equipment?

522
00:55:28,648 --> 00:55:29,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it sufficiently

523
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:34,227
[SPEAKER_11]: shielded from the public realm.

524
00:55:34,848 --> 00:55:51,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to see more information about the ground floor level, which is where it is parking that's at the ground floor level, and that is related to the west elevation of the building.

525
00:55:51,803 --> 00:55:52,484
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's

526
00:55:53,669 --> 00:56:08,063
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of, I would like to see, what I would really like to see is in the same way that I think every time that they've presented, they've demonstrated that they've really heard what you've said.

527
00:56:08,784 --> 00:56:14,510
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I would expect another round looking more at

528
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:32,722
[SPEAKER_11]: the aesthetics of the building, but how they do help the building tie into that or find that right balance between the industrial look, but still connecting with maybe some of the rhythms and scale of the surrounding context.

529
00:56:32,742 --> 00:56:42,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't, it's hard for me to encapsulate that all in one, if I had some time to write a memo, what I would expect to see,

530
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:58,453
[SPEAKER_11]: for addition, at least at a level that I do see in a lot of communities, and particularly when there are applicants who have been as willing to work with you.

531
00:56:58,473 --> 00:57:07,477
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it'd be a lost opportunity if they don't continue that spirit and look at some of these ideas about how to break down the massing.

532
00:57:08,523 --> 00:57:12,226
[SPEAKER_11]: as well as supplying a few more fundamental exhibits.

533
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:20,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, roof plans are very important in this case because we do need to know what is visible from the street.

534
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:34,667
[SPEAKER_11]: If this view is not accurate, then I don't, I wouldn't encourage a board to make a decision based on that until you're really, I think the applicant does have an obligation

535
00:57:36,074 --> 00:57:38,576
[SPEAKER_11]: to present images that are accurate.

536
00:57:38,616 --> 00:57:48,346
[SPEAKER_11]: They really do represent something very close to what the board and the public would see if this were actually constructed.

537
00:57:48,386 --> 00:57:53,811
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are a couple of those out there that we just really need to nail down.

538
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:58,976
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'd encourage them to come back with some ideas about how to work

539
00:58:00,272 --> 00:58:06,216
[SPEAKER_11]: on a more, you know, a finer grain detail with the massing of the building.

540
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:29,252
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as the floor plans, I agree those are pretty close, but as I said at the beginning, I haven't, because I've really been focused on site planning, I haven't really looked in any great detail about the floor plans, but they are at a level that I typically see, I think from this point, on the type

541
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:34,155
[SPEAKER_11]: feedback you'd expect from me would be if I see blatant code violations.

542
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:52,248
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, things on that level would also be kind of truth in packaging that what you see for schematic floor plans are actually feasible based on codes, and I would want to have the opportunity to comment on that.

543
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:56,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I will point out, and I know the architect knows this,

544
00:58:59,794 --> 00:59:25,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I also am pretty sure that Pat Newton knows this, that the rooftop, there are actual building code requirements that ensure that buildings can transition to rooftop solar in the future, even if they're not doing it now, there are requirements that the roof be designed structurally to receive

545
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:41,332
[SPEAKER_11]: panels, and I think all developers nowadays ensure that they have sufficient chases down to electrical rooms to accommodate solar panels, even if they're not being installed at the initial construction.

546
00:59:41,352 --> 00:59:48,175
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've kind of wandered around, but I'm happy to prepare

547
00:59:49,098 --> 00:59:59,022
[SPEAKER_11]: a memo of kind of things that were fundamentals that I think may be missing that further this notion of proof of concept.

548
00:59:59,942 --> 01:00:06,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just want to make sure that I've had a moment to think about that based on the new materials.

549
01:00:06,785 --> 01:00:16,969
[SPEAKER_11]: But otherwise, I would encourage some further study that does further advance that notion of how do you balance

550
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:36,633
[SPEAKER_11]: articulation, and as I said earlier, yes, there is a commercial enterprise city along Emirates right now, but it's actually a pretty complex form along there that is interesting and varied and articulated.

551
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:41,237
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a far better streetscape.

552
01:00:41,277 --> 01:00:47,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you have the opportunity to have a really superior streetscape, but I do think it

553
01:00:48,736 --> 01:00:57,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at some of the concerns that we've heard tonight, do another round would really advance your own cause.

554
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:08,632
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm sorry if that's kind of meandering, but I can't really, you know, in one statement, what's the other statement?

555
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:11,533
[SPEAKER_17]: And Mr. Chairman, I'm just going to chime in real quick.

556
01:01:11,994 --> 01:01:15,736
[SPEAKER_17]: For the record, Attorney Christopher Albin, MHP Consultant.

557
01:01:15,836 --> 01:01:16,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, please go ahead.

558
01:01:17,017 --> 01:01:27,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I agree with the comments from Attorney Tam and Cliff that these appear to be sufficient architectural drawings and plans submitted under 40B.

559
01:01:30,346 --> 01:01:42,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Design is an important aspect, and I think you have an able and great peer review in Cliff and doing a review, and he's doing an exhaustion review, and the applicant seems to be responding to their comments.

560
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:56,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the board's obligation is to make sure that the design is acceptable, but more importantly, under a comprehensive permit application, we need to look at more of the technical aspects of the project.

561
01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:00,492
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about traffic utility impacts, stormwater and civil design.

562
01:02:00,532 --> 01:02:02,133
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sure the board is aware of that.

563
01:02:02,213 --> 01:02:04,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure the applicant is aware of it.

564
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:12,998
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just mentioning that the board doesn't get too caught up in having a very long discussion and many hearings about design.

565
01:02:13,758 --> 01:02:15,859
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, we're under a timeline.

566
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:19,540
[SPEAKER_15]: We start to focus on more of the technical aspects of the project.

567
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,802
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've made a lot of progress with the design, so it appears to me.

568
01:02:24,682 --> 01:02:30,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think now if the board is somewhat, you know, may want to see some,

569
01:02:31,025 --> 01:02:44,245
[SPEAKER_15]: modifications to design and maybe some updates based on Cliff's additional comments, then it may be time to say, okay, we need to review the civil, we need to review stormwater, we need to review traffic.

570
01:02:50,168 --> 01:02:51,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you, Attorney Elfin.

571
01:02:52,068 --> 01:03:08,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So my intention with tonight's meeting is I would like the board to make clear any remaining design elements where they would like to see additional details or changes.

572
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:14,393
[SPEAKER_09]: We've heard from Mr. Bowmer with his details.

573
01:03:15,413 --> 01:03:17,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I concur with the general

574
01:03:18,914 --> 01:03:24,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also appreciate that memo in the near future.

575
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:29,597
[SPEAKER_09]: So please, if you could plan to send us one, Cliff, we'd appreciate that.

576
01:03:30,257 --> 01:03:42,200
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I heard already is, you know, more details on the roof, details on the materiality, a request from members of the board, and from, you know,

577
01:03:43,108 --> 01:03:48,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Bowmer on just strategies to break down the massing.

578
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:54,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard additional details on the ground floor as well.

579
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:58,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I think those were kind of the main areas that stood out to me.

580
01:03:58,892 --> 01:04:07,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, as Mr. Bowmer said, the comments on the floor plans

581
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:09,608
[SPEAKER_09]: are forthcoming.

582
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:16,231
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like he has the most of the details he would need, but we just would want to consider those.

583
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:24,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we have a use case for another session on design, perhaps, in light of all this.

584
01:04:24,535 --> 01:04:27,816
[SPEAKER_09]: But I agree with Attorney Alfin.

585
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:30,237
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't have this be the endless design thing.

586
01:04:31,057 --> 01:04:32,518
[SPEAKER_09]: In the schedule, we maybe have

587
01:04:33,138 --> 01:04:42,651
[SPEAKER_09]: the latitude for one more meeting session on design, and then we kind of have to make some decisions to stick to the timeline.

588
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:49,440
[SPEAKER_09]: So currently, the next scheduled meeting in two weeks, the intent, barring any

589
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:59,887
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, requested changes or issues producing the required documentation is for that to really focus more on the engineering.

590
01:05:00,468 --> 01:05:10,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so we can discuss whether to change that in light of today's discussion, but yeah, we do need to, uh, get the design to converge so that we can also, um,

591
01:05:13,046 --> 01:05:20,775
[SPEAKER_09]: give enough detail to the technical elements so that the board's assessing everything we're expected to assess in the, uh, in the statutory timeline.

592
01:05:20,896 --> 01:05:23,479
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my intention.

593
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, please go ahead.

594
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:30,587
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I was just gonna, you know, add one thing about, um,

595
01:05:32,481 --> 01:05:33,202
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, floor plans.

596
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:57,273
[SPEAKER_15]: They're important, and it's good that Cliff is reviewing them, but really under a comprehensive permit application, those floor plans could be modified post-decision, uh, either under, um, um, the regulatory agreement that is reviewed by the state, or, uh, as-as built plans, they could be potentially modified, and if they're not major modifications, and usually they're not,

597
01:05:57,973 --> 01:06:05,057
[SPEAKER_15]: determined to be major modifications, that they usually can be done as of right under 40B.

598
01:06:05,457 --> 01:06:11,440
[SPEAKER_15]: We shouldn't spend too much time on things like floor plans and sizes of units.

599
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:19,524
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a unit count with bedrooms and things like that, but that's just one aspect that can be handled by conditions.

600
01:06:24,346 --> 01:06:25,767
[SPEAKER_07]: If you may, Mr. Chair.

601
01:06:28,356 --> 01:06:29,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, please, Andre.

602
01:06:30,077 --> 01:06:46,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, I just want to point out that we just went through a few months ago, another 40 B permitting process where we got into some significant details about the design, which I think resulted in a much better project for the community.

603
01:06:47,608 --> 01:06:54,392
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that we're in a position where we kind of inherit how large this project is and.

604
01:06:56,625 --> 01:07:01,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe me, if I was starting from scratch, I wouldn't design a gigantic rectangle in the middle of a neighborhood.

605
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:08,170
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that we have an obligation to do what we can to make sure that this project.

606
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:12,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Of really significant scale kind of integrates as best as it can.

607
01:07:13,313 --> 01:07:15,674
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as I'm concerned, we haven't talked about.

608
01:07:16,814 --> 01:07:20,715
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't really looked or discussed the parking.

609
01:07:21,255 --> 01:07:24,236
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't talked about how much bike parking.

610
01:07:24,276 --> 01:07:26,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't talked about how many EV chargers.

611
01:07:26,997 --> 01:07:29,577
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't talked about landscape programming.

612
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:34,618
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't talked about public art, in addition to all of the technical things that you mentioned.

613
01:07:35,238 --> 01:07:41,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am just going to plant a flag in the ground and saying that those are things that we should talk about.

614
01:07:45,017 --> 01:07:45,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Andre.

615
01:07:46,237 --> 01:07:47,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I may be misremembering.

616
01:07:47,618 --> 01:08:00,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought some of the parking and bike parking discussions in the last hearing we covered under engineering, but I completely agree those should absolutely be discussed, as well as landscaping.

617
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:03,561
[SPEAKER_07]: How are people going to move in and out?

618
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:05,482
[SPEAKER_07]: How is the trash going to move in and out?

619
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:06,542
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those kinds of things.

620
01:08:07,662 --> 01:08:10,743
[SPEAKER_07]: The last 40B that we did, it resulted in improvements.

621
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:19,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but so that one in the last 40B, my recollection is that was covered under civil engineering.

622
01:08:20,213 --> 01:08:31,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be misremembering, but yeah, if there weren't plans already for the applicant to present those details, please plan to present those details.

623
01:08:31,318 --> 01:08:33,619
[SPEAKER_09]: The board does need those details.

624
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:37,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're essential to the functioning of the building.

625
01:08:38,096 --> 01:08:38,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

626
01:08:38,676 --> 01:08:43,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that information is carried on our ground floor plan that was in this package as well.

627
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:45,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to answer any questions on that.

628
01:08:50,222 --> 01:08:52,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, so I guess to that point.

629
01:08:53,575 --> 01:08:55,577
[SPEAKER_09]: We can certainly open it to questions on that.

630
01:08:56,117 --> 01:09:01,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there an intention in a future hearing to walk through that with us in greater detail?

631
01:09:02,082 --> 01:09:08,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you looking for the board to come to you with specific questions on it and then we'll address them that way?

632
01:09:10,809 --> 01:09:13,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Chairman, I can speak for the Davis companies.

633
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:14,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I think

634
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:25,471
[SPEAKER_14]: We hear you loud and clear, I think, beginning at the next session, in addition to civil, we can be talking about some of these operational issues and we can quantify.

635
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:33,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Or identify the standard we're meeting for parking for charges for public art in terms of location, at least in terms of byte storage.

636
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:38,560
[SPEAKER_14]: can update you on the landscaping plan, and we can talk about some of these operational issues.

637
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:46,822
[SPEAKER_14]: There may be a standard that we propose if something isn't fully conceptualized.

638
01:09:48,062 --> 01:09:53,383
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, whether it's a ratio or a size or an approximation, that could become part of a condition.

639
01:09:56,177 --> 01:09:59,379
[SPEAKER_14]: That is appropriate at this level of design.

640
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:16,752
[SPEAKER_14]: But, and we're not at all ignoring, I think we'll look forward to reviewing Cliff's memo and following up on further design details based on his comments and recommendations.

641
01:10:20,455 --> 01:10:21,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

642
01:10:22,605 --> 01:10:26,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre, does that at least partially alleviate your concern?

643
01:10:27,229 --> 01:10:35,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just wanted to push back on the notion a little bit that we are going to kind of just skip over a thorough review.

644
01:10:36,396 --> 01:10:50,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I know we have sessions coming forward where we're going to talk about some of these other items, but those are some things that I'm concerned about and want to make sure we talk about, and if necessary, condition.

645
01:10:54,242 --> 01:10:54,783
[SPEAKER_14]: just to respond.

646
01:10:57,465 --> 01:11:03,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to respond, to be clear, we will absolutely attempt to address each of those items.

647
01:11:03,686 --> 01:11:04,686
[SPEAKER_14]: We've heard them before.

648
01:11:05,686 --> 01:11:13,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of them we have addressed, and as you point out, parking has been an item, I think, that we've detailed in past sessions.

649
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:17,988
[SPEAKER_14]: And we expect nothing more than a thorough review.

650
01:11:18,048 --> 01:11:24,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we've been experiencing and benefiting from the beginnings of a thorough review.

651
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,190
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do...

652
01:11:27,537 --> 01:11:32,118
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say that in a number of instances, there will be items.

653
01:11:32,558 --> 01:11:34,779
[SPEAKER_14]: The public art idea comes to mind.

654
01:11:36,019 --> 01:11:43,621
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not necessarily going to know that level of detail at the time that this decision is before the board.

655
01:11:44,981 --> 01:11:46,942
[SPEAKER_14]: But we can certainly put some standards to it.

656
01:11:46,982 --> 01:11:48,902
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's what Mr. LaRue is suggesting.

657
01:11:55,214 --> 01:11:55,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

658
01:11:56,794 --> 01:12:03,296
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this point, I'm going to check in with members of the board if there's other questions or comments.

659
01:12:04,496 --> 01:12:13,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Once we've gone through the board questions and comments, I do intend to open for public comment on these conceptual designs.

660
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:23,580
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, I just want to make sure if there is a member of the board who has additional questions or comments that they have a chance to hear those.

661
01:12:25,665 --> 01:12:26,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a question.

662
01:12:26,945 --> 01:12:32,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a comment that I'm fully supportive of what Andre has talked about and brought up.

663
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:35,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just him.

664
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make sure that we're clear.

665
01:12:37,549 --> 01:12:41,090
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like I think the majority of the board would agree with him.

666
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:44,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

667
01:12:44,911 --> 01:12:46,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would agree as well.

668
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:50,712
[SPEAKER_06]: My expectation was most of those items would be in civil engineering.

669
01:12:50,852 --> 01:12:53,293
[SPEAKER_06]: The other item I'll add to that list is obviously the lighting plan.

670
01:12:55,207 --> 01:12:59,528
[SPEAKER_06]: but the technical items that the other attorney raised as well.

671
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:01,169
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the goal.

672
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:05,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

673
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for clarifying that.

674
01:13:07,251 --> 01:13:09,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I share that expectation.

675
01:13:10,872 --> 01:13:15,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just ask if the landscape, is that something for today or for a future meeting?

676
01:13:18,054 --> 01:13:23,916
[SPEAKER_09]: If I understood correctly, the intention would be to present some of those details at our next session.

677
01:13:26,451 --> 01:13:26,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

678
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:30,994
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

679
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions or comments from members of the board?

680
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:49,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, the chair awaits the motion to open public comment on the concept design for this project.

681
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:49,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I move.

682
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:51,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

683
01:13:51,986 --> 01:13:52,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a second?

684
01:13:53,547 --> 01:13:53,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

685
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:56,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're going to take a roll call.

686
01:13:58,343 --> 01:13:58,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

687
01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:00,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

688
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:02,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim?

689
01:14:02,845 --> 01:14:02,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

690
01:14:05,766 --> 01:14:06,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Andre?

691
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:06,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

692
01:14:07,247 --> 01:14:09,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yvette?

693
01:14:11,009 --> 01:14:11,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

694
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:12,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

695
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:13,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

696
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:18,752
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, the public portion of this session of the hearing is now open.

697
01:14:19,273 --> 01:14:21,954
[SPEAKER_09]: We are now taking public comment.

698
01:14:22,785 --> 01:14:26,168
[SPEAKER_09]: on the concept design that was presented today.

699
01:14:26,188 --> 01:14:37,496
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a member of the public who would like to speak on this matter, please feel free to raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand, type something in the chat.

700
01:14:38,397 --> 01:14:42,300
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also email DennisDMcDougall at Medford-MA.gov.

701
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:42,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I will

702
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:53,186
[SPEAKER_09]: wait a few moments, and then if there's a member of the public who, okay, I see a member of the public who raised their hand.

703
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:54,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll go to them first.

704
01:14:55,528 --> 01:14:59,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I see an Allison D. Please state your name and address for the record.

705
01:14:59,191 --> 01:15:01,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everybody.

706
01:15:02,254 --> 01:15:02,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

707
01:15:03,015 --> 01:15:04,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Allison D'Agostino.

708
01:15:05,477 --> 01:15:09,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent the D'Agostino Trust, the owners of 1022-1024 Fellsway.

709
01:15:12,531 --> 01:15:19,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to start with, again, thank you always for the opportunity to speak and kind of view this.

710
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:22,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned a lot, quite frankly, through the process.

711
01:15:22,736 --> 01:15:28,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate the presentation and the board.

712
01:15:28,978 --> 01:15:31,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a couple quick things.

713
01:15:31,139 --> 01:15:33,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be more technical, actually.

714
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to agree that

715
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:40,430
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think Attorney Tam said it best.

716
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:41,750
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an industrial space.

717
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:54,278
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I appreciate it's an industrial looking building design, why not just build an industrial building similar to other projects that Davis Company has done with the Amazon Warehouse in Chelsea?

718
01:15:54,618 --> 01:15:56,019
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks beautiful.

719
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:01,382
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the designed intent for the space, but I'll leave that at a comment.

720
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:11,380
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding just technical aspects as far as utility something that was mentioned before and again last meeting I was very thankful for the

721
01:16:13,506 --> 01:16:16,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Concessions Davis Company has said to widen the street of Myrtle.

722
01:16:17,528 --> 01:16:22,651
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we really didn't touch on here was the utility aspect.

723
01:16:22,671 --> 01:16:28,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of utility poles, electrical poles right on the sidewalk along Myrtle.

724
01:16:30,435 --> 01:16:35,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Widening the street, my concern really, as I was walking the other day with my dogs,

725
01:16:36,698 --> 01:16:47,580
[SPEAKER_01]: where you get to the plumbing company, which is really, again, at kind of the intersection of Myrtle and Felsway.

726
01:16:48,887 --> 01:16:51,830
[SPEAKER_01]: their property line is right against the sidewalk.

727
01:16:51,930 --> 01:17:16,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess a couple of questions really just, and maybe they don't know the details yet, and I appreciate that, but when you talk about winding the street, what is the preliminary planning as far as electrical and all those utilities, and then how exactly will you be able to widen the street at the actual intersection of Felsway and Myrtle with that property?

728
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:22,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace where you're not owning that little square, if you will.

729
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:28,442
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, materials, I think, very consistent with the other projects.

730
01:17:29,623 --> 01:17:34,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think commercial street that project and I apologize the name, I think river something.

731
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:39,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I think material wise looks fine.

732
01:17:39,095 --> 01:17:44,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I do agree it's a big square building that doesn't fit in a neighborhood.

733
01:17:44,218 --> 01:17:45,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was just my comments.

734
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,781
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, thank you for the time.

735
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:49,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I really always appreciate it.

736
01:17:52,525 --> 01:17:52,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

737
01:17:54,006 --> 01:18:04,713
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've made a note, and I do intend to make sure we cover that in the civil session of the hearing.

738
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that wasn't really the focus here.

739
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:16,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if the applicant wants to speak briefly to it, they're certainly welcome to, but I don't necessarily expect them to have that answer at the ready.

740
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:23,728
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do think that's something that we will plan to cover in the civil session of the hearing.

741
01:18:23,748 --> 01:18:25,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And then

742
01:18:26,434 --> 01:18:27,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's just a comment.

743
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:32,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's of course not within the board's purview to recommend alternative uses for the land.

744
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, comment noted.

745
01:18:35,019 --> 01:18:36,099
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the public record.

746
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:39,701
[SPEAKER_09]: But we won't engage with that one directly.

747
01:18:41,002 --> 01:18:46,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I can jump in, Mr. Chair, and just offer at least a brief response so we're not

748
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:51,592
[SPEAKER_02]: making people feel like we are kicking the can on questions as they come up.

749
01:18:52,672 --> 01:18:58,293
[SPEAKER_02]: We can and certainly will elaborate on the specific question at our next hearing.

750
01:18:59,294 --> 01:19:18,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Mrs. D'Agostino, if you're not able to make it, the current plan contemplates widening Myrtle after, so as you are coming down Myrtle towards the Emirates Street intersection, we're proposing to widen Myrtle on our side of the street after the plumbing building property line.

751
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:24,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So, from the property line out towards, yeah, you can it's challenging to see here.

752
01:19:24,883 --> 01:19:27,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the, it really wasn't the focus of the presentation this evening.

753
01:19:28,205 --> 01:19:35,730
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, from that point out to the fells way, the curb line would essentially remain as is and down.

754
01:19:38,532 --> 01:19:48,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, plan left heading West, we are proposing to widen myrtle street on the property that we do and are in control of with respect to the utility poles.

755
01:19:49,181 --> 01:20:00,611
[SPEAKER_02]: What we what we can show in much greater detail at the next hearing and this was a message received from the last hearing as well, just with people not really able to see the site plan clearly.

756
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,052
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't our intention.

757
01:20:02,072 --> 01:20:06,036
[SPEAKER_02]: So we plan to present in much greater and finer detail on this, but, um.

758
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:11,020
[SPEAKER_02]: The utility pools that are existing, we do we are planning to leave them in place.

759
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:16,986
[SPEAKER_02]: They do connect to properties on the other side of Myrtle street and we don't want to.

760
01:20:17,226 --> 01:20:20,909
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not planning to relocate them or interrupt any service with them.

761
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:21,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So the curve.

762
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:40,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Relocation plan that we have works around them and really creates indentations in Myrtle street for cars to to park out of the driving area, but also maintain that curb space there that that allows the utility posts remain in place.

763
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:42,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the short answer again.

764
01:20:42,998 --> 01:20:44,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to offer something.

765
01:20:44,478 --> 01:20:45,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't feel like we were.

766
01:20:46,219 --> 01:20:50,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Punting here, and we, we can get into this in much better detail in 2 weeks.

767
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:55,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So, everybody has a clear understanding of what we're proposing on myrtle and.

768
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:57,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, I just want to say, thank you.

769
01:20:58,008 --> 01:21:01,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I know shouldn't interrupt again, but thank you.

770
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:03,552
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps clarify some of those questions.

771
01:21:03,612 --> 01:21:05,413
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate it.

772
01:21:06,834 --> 01:21:07,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

773
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:12,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I see another member of the public has their hand raise Christina catch.

774
01:21:12,398 --> 01:21:14,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you please state your name and address for the record?

775
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Christina Katch, 130 Myrtle Street, Medford.

776
01:21:20,802 --> 01:21:25,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a quick clarification question, and then I have a question on design.

777
01:21:27,085 --> 01:21:35,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Would the light pollution and noise pollution study be part of civil engineering or design?

778
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:45,453
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think, well, light pollution and noise pollution studies, I'm not sure if those are customarily

779
01:21:48,428 --> 01:21:49,689
[SPEAKER_09]: required exhibits.

780
01:21:50,049 --> 01:21:54,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lighting plan would be under the engineering, I believe.

781
01:21:54,832 --> 01:21:58,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you looking for something in particular?

782
01:21:59,395 --> 01:22:00,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yes.

783
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:05,279
[SPEAKER_10]: You're putting a huge building across the street from my apartment.

784
01:22:05,299 --> 01:22:10,523
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be a lot more residents, noise, animals, lights.

785
01:22:11,445 --> 01:22:23,148
[SPEAKER_10]: landscaping, streetlights that aren't previously existing here on this street that will bleed into our day to days, especially those of us that work from home.

786
01:22:23,928 --> 01:22:32,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And as well as nighttime, if we go to bed early, there's going to be light pollution from those those units, not just to myrtle, but amaranth in the townhouses.

787
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:38,111
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to believe in noise pollution and light pollution study would have to be conducted.

788
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:41,230
[SPEAKER_10]: for quality of life of the existing residents.

789
01:22:44,733 --> 01:22:45,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

790
01:22:45,313 --> 01:22:46,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for clarifying.

791
01:22:46,854 --> 01:22:51,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, these topics are kind of split across a few categories.

792
01:22:52,018 --> 01:23:06,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So civil would include the lighting plan, which might give a sense of kind of where the lights are and which areas might result in a

793
01:23:08,014 --> 01:23:12,022
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, lights that impact neighboring properties.

794
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:15,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something we could certainly consider.

795
01:23:15,048 --> 01:23:19,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the positioning of windows and things of that nature, that's more of the

796
01:23:20,302 --> 01:23:31,808
[SPEAKER_09]: the architecture, and then, you know, whether there's soundproofing and so on, which I know there's code surrounding this, but that would be, I guess, civil.

797
01:23:32,788 --> 01:23:39,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's kind of covered across a few of these, but just to be crystal clear, and the applicant can correct me if I'm wrong, I don't believe

798
01:23:40,663 --> 01:23:48,946
[SPEAKER_09]: there will be exhibits specifically detailing a study of light pollution and a study of noise pollution.

799
01:23:48,986 --> 01:23:55,568
[SPEAKER_09]: There would be instead a discussion of lighting and a discussion of soundproofing and so on.

800
01:23:58,389 --> 01:23:59,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Chairman, that's correct.

801
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:08,353
[SPEAKER_14]: The lighting plans that the civil engineer will review will include ultimately a photometrics plan.

802
01:24:09,786 --> 01:24:18,970
[SPEAKER_14]: that shows compliance and the minimization of light trespass for exterior sight lighting.

803
01:24:20,271 --> 01:24:26,293
[SPEAKER_14]: And with respect to noise, in addition to the code requirements, there's obviously the city's noise ordinance.

804
01:24:26,874 --> 01:24:31,576
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there are specific sound emitters

805
01:24:33,063 --> 01:24:44,372
[SPEAKER_14]: that are of concern, like rooftop equipment, that's often can be the focus of architectural and civil review to mitigate those impacts.

806
01:24:45,954 --> 01:24:51,518
[SPEAKER_14]: But those are the typical considerations that a board would have.

807
01:24:57,163 --> 01:24:57,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

808
01:24:58,364 --> 01:24:59,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Christina, did that answer your question?

809
01:25:03,393 --> 01:25:04,414
[SPEAKER_10]: It did answer my question.

810
01:25:06,255 --> 01:25:07,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little disappointed.

811
01:25:07,095 --> 01:25:12,778
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not going to be a more in-depth study on those things, but I will hold back further comments on it until after Civil.

812
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have that design.

813
01:25:18,462 --> 01:25:20,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I had a design-specific question as well.

814
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:27,767
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess this is for Cube 3.

815
01:25:27,947 --> 01:25:29,048
[SPEAKER_10]: You mentioned that

816
01:25:29,928 --> 01:25:38,115
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the four properties existing in Medford, you are, you have a pipeline of work coming up for other projects.

817
01:25:39,136 --> 01:25:45,242
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I was wondering, since you're all four of your covering properties do have multiple units of vacancy.

818
01:25:46,884 --> 01:25:55,551
[SPEAKER_10]: built into your design of this building, some of the shortcomings that you had in your previous designs to make sure they don't happen again to this new property.

819
01:25:55,571 --> 01:26:02,417
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm kind of looking at how you used your after action reviews from previous buildings to inform better decision making on this unit.

820
01:26:06,021 --> 01:26:06,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

821
01:26:06,341 --> 01:26:08,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So on that one, I'm just going to try to

822
01:26:09,565 --> 01:26:11,686
[SPEAKER_09]: keep it within board purview.

823
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:24,432
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to reinterpret that question as, you know, are there specific elements detailed in these plans for this project that are incorporating best practices and learnings from other projects in the area?

824
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:28,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the applicant wants to speak to any of those details, please go ahead.

825
01:26:28,354 --> 01:26:28,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

826
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:29,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

827
01:26:29,214 --> 01:26:34,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're obviously always continuously learning and trying to take on lessons learned from prior projects.

828
01:26:36,097 --> 01:26:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one thing to note is we are working with a different developer here than we have on those other properties.

829
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:49,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the things that we did on prior properties are not applicable to what we're doing here based on client and location with who we're working with.

830
01:26:50,462 --> 01:26:57,725
[SPEAKER_05]: But we always try to take our lessons learned from things we did poorly and things we did well and try to carry those on to the next project.

831
01:27:02,194 --> 01:27:04,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a point of information, Mr. Chairman.

832
01:27:05,356 --> 01:27:22,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Could I just be really explicit with the residents of Butters who are speaking and listening tonight that if you have specific suggestions for how to manage, for example, the light or the noise or other elements of the landscape, can you

833
01:27:23,527 --> 01:27:33,695
[SPEAKER_07]: let the city know, or us know, so that we can make sure that it's part of the conditions or, you know, part of our review.

834
01:27:34,476 --> 01:27:34,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

835
01:27:35,977 --> 01:27:38,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I mean, I'm an industrial engineer, not a civil engineer.

836
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:41,402
[SPEAKER_10]: So I kind of need the civil engineers to give me something to work with first.

837
01:27:45,004 --> 01:27:51,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, so just to elaborate on Andre's point, I think the in general, so the board,

838
01:27:52,492 --> 01:27:56,615
[SPEAKER_09]: appreciates both questions and comments from the public.

839
01:27:56,655 --> 01:28:19,051
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you've seen over these sessions, at least I hope this is what I'm striving towards, the board is trying to make sure that if you do bring up a question or something the board hasn't considered or asked that ultimately we're working with the applicant and the applicant's responding and providing those details and the applicant has been responding so far.

840
01:28:19,452 --> 01:28:21,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, to Andre's point, I think,

841
01:28:22,371 --> 01:28:34,529
[SPEAKER_09]: where a comment, whether that's made directly to the city or in a public hearing or something else, even if it's not coming from a place of expertise, could help is if you do have an idea.

842
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:39,936
[SPEAKER_09]: you could, in the form of a comment on the record, share that idea.

843
01:28:40,636 --> 01:28:51,140
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that might inspire a discussion or a review that includes an expert in that particular area that incorporates the spirit of that idea.

844
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:59,022
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I think if I understood you correctly, Andre, you wanted to make it clear to the residents that

845
01:29:00,602 --> 01:29:09,747
[SPEAKER_09]: ideas are welcome and there are forums, whether it's speaking here or talking to the city, where residents could make those ideas known.

846
01:29:09,907 --> 01:29:24,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And then especially if you make those ideas known on a similar timeline or in advance of a focal discussion related to that, then it could be something that the board discusses with the applicant and brainstorms around.

847
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:26,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that fair, Andre?

848
01:29:27,772 --> 01:29:27,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

849
01:29:28,012 --> 01:29:38,774
[SPEAKER_07]: And it could be as simple as like, you don't want the lights from the building shining across the street, you know, on your buildings, or maybe you want more lights because that would be better for public safety.

850
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:39,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

851
01:29:39,894 --> 01:29:40,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Things like that.

852
01:29:41,754 --> 01:29:41,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

853
01:29:42,114 --> 01:29:42,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

854
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:56,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Other comments from members of the public currently see any other members of the public who would like to speak, but I'm.

855
01:29:57,135 --> 01:30:00,517
[SPEAKER_09]: going to wait a few seconds just to make sure.

856
01:30:06,461 --> 01:30:06,721
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

857
01:30:07,321 --> 01:30:12,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of this session of the hearing.

858
01:30:12,685 --> 01:30:14,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

859
01:30:16,007 --> 01:30:17,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to take another roll call.

860
01:30:17,568 --> 01:30:18,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Yvette?

861
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:20,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

862
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:22,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

863
01:30:22,471 --> 01:30:22,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

864
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:24,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

865
01:30:25,733 --> 01:30:25,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

866
01:30:26,578 --> 01:30:26,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

867
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:28,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

868
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:29,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

869
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:30,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

870
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:31,720
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

871
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So public comment for this session is now closed.

872
01:30:35,801 --> 01:30:41,903
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be taking public comment on other focal topics in future sessions of the hearing.

873
01:30:43,964 --> 01:30:44,424
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

874
01:30:45,964 --> 01:30:48,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to check back in with the board one more time.

875
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:56,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions or comments on what we've seen today or other topics that have come up today?

876
01:31:03,805 --> 01:31:07,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, seeing, uh, yeah, go ahead.

877
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:07,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

878
01:31:08,191 --> 01:31:20,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, just one thing as where, as the architect is kind of looking at this, I would really love to see kind of what the.

879
01:31:21,493 --> 01:31:27,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Plan or program is for the 1st floor wrapping around the building.

880
01:31:27,301 --> 01:31:31,567
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, again, we looked more at the.

881
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:32,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Side, but.

882
01:31:35,425 --> 01:31:40,888
[SPEAKER_07]: There's that whole first floor is blank.

883
01:31:40,908 --> 01:31:51,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if that could be an area for murals, other public art, some green wall.

884
01:31:53,055 --> 01:32:01,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to know what's going to go on there so that it's not just a blank wall.

885
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm seeing some head nods.

886
01:32:09,961 --> 01:32:11,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something we could get into in a future hearing?

887
01:32:12,502 --> 01:32:16,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll certainly look into that and plan to answer that in future hearings.

888
01:32:18,944 --> 01:32:19,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

889
01:32:20,484 --> 01:32:35,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Chairman, the only thing I'll add is we can, I think to respond to Mr. LaRue, we can certainly offer some ideas and possible alternatives for the board to consider on those types of design elements at this level.

890
01:32:37,378 --> 01:32:49,128
[SPEAKER_14]: may be representative and then may inform the board in terms of what the final plans as a detailed condition might reflect.

891
01:32:50,830 --> 01:33:04,822
[SPEAKER_14]: So you'd have a design objective about what you want to accomplish in terms of screening or mitigating or providing for some activation, whether it's murals or, you know, on the final plans.

892
01:33:06,587 --> 01:33:15,209
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure we're going to have a, again, similar to the sort of public art concept, you know, X percentage of the wall shall be devoted to public art.

893
01:33:15,309 --> 01:33:23,150
[SPEAKER_14]: But we can certainly offer a standard and some ideas for consideration of the board.

894
01:33:26,611 --> 01:33:35,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think representative helps, at least it allows for a tangible discussion, which would then inform the final design.

895
01:33:39,112 --> 01:33:39,332
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

896
01:33:39,372 --> 01:33:39,953
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate that.

897
01:33:40,593 --> 01:33:43,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So now, OK, great.

898
01:33:43,936 --> 01:33:47,358
[SPEAKER_09]: So now let's move on to logistics.

899
01:33:48,379 --> 01:33:54,303
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was indirectly confirmed, but I just want to doubly confirm.

900
01:33:54,363 --> 01:34:07,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So in two weeks, the planned focus area was civil, and it sounds like we are indeed on track to review that, as well as the landscape plan, as well as

901
01:34:08,533 --> 01:34:19,939
[SPEAKER_09]: any updates from today's discussion, you know, maybe not all reflected in plan form, but just a general update on the topics discussed today in two weeks.

902
01:34:19,999 --> 01:34:22,621
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on track for that.

903
01:34:22,641 --> 01:34:24,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I correctly understanding?

904
01:34:26,923 --> 01:34:33,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. Chair, that's the plan for us to be back in two weeks to follow up on our civil discussion.

905
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:35,430
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

906
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:47,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, Mr. Bowmer, do you have an estimate as to when you could have that memo for the board and the applicants review, just in terms of the additional things you'd like to see?

907
01:34:49,994 --> 01:34:55,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably like Monday, something like that, a day or two, so the next week.

908
01:34:56,877 --> 01:34:57,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

909
01:34:57,937 --> 01:34:58,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

910
01:34:58,717 --> 01:34:59,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

911
01:35:02,461 --> 01:35:06,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll check in with the applicant if they'd like to get more specific now.

912
01:35:06,343 --> 01:35:21,388
[SPEAKER_09]: My current inclination is let's be a little bit flexible for the time being with the agenda of the four weeks from now hearing, kind of based on how the project develops and the discussion in two weeks.

913
01:35:21,408 --> 01:35:23,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that seem reasonable?

914
01:35:23,529 --> 01:35:30,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is there a desire to make specific now what the four weeks from now

915
01:35:31,686 --> 01:35:32,357
[SPEAKER_09]: agenda would be.

916
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:37,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we can be flexible.

917
01:35:37,891 --> 01:35:51,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I think obviously pending how the hearing goes in two weeks, if there are things to follow up on, we'd certainly like to be able to follow up on them as well as following up on the architectural items from this evening.

918
01:35:51,715 --> 01:36:05,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that to that end, if it's possible, if there are things that need to be cleaned up on multiple topics, maybe it could be somewhat of a utility type of hearing where we're able to cover multiple subject matters.

919
01:36:06,518 --> 01:36:08,459
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

920
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:25,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I did want to just state for awareness for members of the public, so the upcoming schedule is there is a, sorry, I'm just verifying this on my calendar.

921
01:36:27,705 --> 01:36:30,386
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is a hearing on April 11th.

922
01:36:31,046 --> 01:36:35,088
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one where we're going to be discussing civil.

923
01:36:35,914 --> 01:36:40,096
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as the landscaping plan and some updates based on this hearing.

924
01:36:40,657 --> 01:36:45,999
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the hearing after that is April 23rd.

925
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:57,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's the one where we're keeping the agenda flexible, but we're expecting one of the topics that would be discussed is a more detailed

926
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:11,816
[SPEAKER_09]: updates to the design based on what the board and the public mentioned today, as well as Mr. Bowmer's memo.

927
01:37:13,237 --> 01:37:16,339
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that's what to expect next, folks.

928
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:17,660
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

929
01:37:20,122 --> 01:37:24,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've covered the four topic areas for this meeting.

930
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:27,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to check back in with the applicant if there's anything else

931
01:37:29,306 --> 01:37:31,288
[SPEAKER_09]: you're expecting us to discuss tonight?

932
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:37,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Not from us, Mr. Chair.

933
01:37:37,131 --> 01:37:39,933
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate the time and the comments.

934
01:37:41,274 --> 01:37:42,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

935
01:37:42,795 --> 01:37:46,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the details and the time as well.

936
01:37:46,457 --> 01:37:49,499
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really great to see the continued progress here.

937
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:54,382
[SPEAKER_09]: So, looking forward to our session in two weeks.

938
01:37:56,504 --> 01:37:57,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And so,

939
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:10,058
[SPEAKER_09]: At this point, a chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to April 11th at 6.30 p.m.

940
01:38:10,078 --> 01:38:11,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I move.

941
01:38:13,441 --> 01:38:14,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second?

942
01:38:14,102 --> 01:38:14,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

943
01:38:14,942 --> 01:38:17,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take a roll call.

944
01:38:17,684 --> 01:38:18,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

945
01:38:18,085 --> 01:38:18,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

946
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:20,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

947
01:38:21,868 --> 01:38:21,968
Aye.

948
01:38:23,009 --> 01:38:23,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

949
01:38:23,429 --> 01:38:23,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

950
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:25,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Yvette?

951
01:38:26,331 --> 01:38:26,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

952
01:38:27,332 --> 01:38:27,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

953
01:38:28,253 --> 01:38:28,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

954
01:38:29,122 --> 01:38:32,363
[SPEAKER_09]: This matter is now continued to April 11th.

955
01:38:32,543 --> 01:38:33,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, folks.

956
01:38:33,543 --> 01:38:38,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So this was the only main item on the agenda.

957
01:38:38,044 --> 01:38:39,964
[SPEAKER_09]: There were some procedural items.

958
01:38:40,024 --> 01:38:41,805
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dennis, could you read the next item, please?

959
01:38:43,985 --> 01:38:44,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

960
01:38:46,246 --> 01:38:51,547
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have an administrative update, which the only thing I'll tell you is that this is more just an FYI.

961
01:38:52,341 --> 01:38:54,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I will be not available.

962
01:38:54,402 --> 01:38:55,283
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be, I'm going away.

963
01:38:55,303 --> 01:38:59,305
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll be out next Monday through Wednesday or Thursday, depending on what time I get back.

964
01:38:59,865 --> 01:39:03,987
[SPEAKER_13]: So if anything does come in, I'm going to make sure that, you know, you'll get whatever comes in.

965
01:39:04,848 --> 01:39:11,432
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, like cliff and beta and everybody else, they'll get forwarded to you, you know, while I'm gone and they'll get updated on the website.

966
01:39:12,552 --> 01:39:14,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay.

967
01:39:14,313 --> 01:39:21,077
[SPEAKER_09]: And so just so there, there is a, there is a plan that someone would, um, be,

968
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:26,843
[SPEAKER_09]: available to help forward that to us while you're out, or should we just expect it once you're back?

969
01:39:27,744 --> 01:39:28,264
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.

970
01:39:28,525 --> 01:39:29,625
[SPEAKER_13]: My plan is to get someone.

971
01:39:29,685 --> 01:39:40,353
[SPEAKER_13]: So when stuff comes in, I'll just make sure that, you know, I think the plan is, is generous plan will be in existence by the time I leave is probably more accurate.

972
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:42,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

973
01:39:42,874 --> 01:39:43,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

974
01:39:43,515 --> 01:39:44,596
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks for the update.

975
01:39:45,676 --> 01:39:47,718
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the next item I think was meeting minutes.

976
01:39:49,222 --> 01:39:51,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did send you one.

977
01:39:51,604 --> 01:39:53,805
[SPEAKER_09]: A few days ago.

978
01:39:54,225 --> 01:39:55,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hold on.

979
01:39:55,206 --> 01:39:56,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Director Haas has her hand raised.

980
01:39:57,187 --> 01:39:57,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Please go ahead.

981
01:39:58,488 --> 01:40:04,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take every opportunity to remind you that we're working with a zoning consultant on zoning updates.

982
01:40:05,132 --> 01:40:10,075
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody would like to meet individually with her or someone from her staff, we could arrange that.

983
01:40:10,115 --> 01:40:12,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have ideas of thoughts that you'd like to see.

984
01:40:13,997 --> 01:40:18,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you'd like to have her attend a meeting so you can in a public session sort of

985
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,223
[SPEAKER_00]: brainstorm things you'd like to see in zoning changes.

986
01:40:22,744 --> 01:40:35,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to remind you that that process is moving forward in that Danielle and I are meeting with the consultant almost weekly and the city council is meeting in a committee meeting.

987
01:40:36,966 --> 01:40:41,650
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately every two weeks or so as well in a public meeting.

988
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:49,177
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted you all to have that on your radar to add stuff.

989
01:40:49,557 --> 01:40:55,803
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start with administrative-y type things.

990
01:40:55,863 --> 01:41:02,409
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anything is a pet peeve administratively that's in zoning, this is a good time to tell us.

991
01:41:03,775 --> 01:41:05,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah, thank you, Director Hunt.

992
01:41:05,616 --> 01:41:16,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And so just so we're clear, members of the board who want to take that opportunity, you should just reach out to you directly to set up that time.

993
01:41:16,462 --> 01:41:16,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

994
01:41:17,422 --> 01:41:24,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think we can certainly as a board in one of our regular hearings discuss if we want to do some collective board action.

995
01:41:25,106 --> 01:41:29,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I think my personal inclination is at this point in the process,

996
01:41:31,148 --> 01:41:39,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe if members of the board already know things that they have opinions on, they should just work directly with you and the consultant.

997
01:41:39,331 --> 01:41:52,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, yeah, we can, any member of the board is welcome to make a motion in a future hearing if they'd like to have a more focused collective discussion in public on that.

998
01:41:55,283 --> 01:41:55,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, sounds good.

999
01:41:55,924 --> 01:41:56,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the update.

1000
01:41:56,644 --> 01:41:56,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1001
01:41:56,944 --> 01:42:00,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so Dennis, you were, uh, starting to say meeting minutes.

1002
01:42:00,607 --> 01:42:03,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know you sent, uh, I know you sent meeting minutes.

1003
01:42:03,769 --> 01:42:06,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just double checking now.

1004
01:42:07,072 --> 01:42:24,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, there's separate for the, for the regular, I have the.

1005
01:42:28,938 --> 01:42:32,820
[SPEAKER_13]: The March 14th one, I know that you all have been sent those, and I'm just trying to go back.

1006
01:42:34,701 --> 01:42:44,825
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought I sent them all, but I was sending a lot of things, so I'm not sure.

1007
01:42:44,845 --> 01:42:53,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have 314.

1008
01:42:53,509 --> 01:42:55,550
[SPEAKER_13]: January 30th got sent to you all, I know that.

1009
01:42:57,470 --> 01:43:00,051
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just sort of going back to my sent emails things.

1010
01:43:00,951 --> 01:43:03,071
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a lot.

1011
01:43:07,912 --> 01:43:10,613
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, well, I'm going to check in with the board.

1012
01:43:10,713 --> 01:43:21,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have the meeting minutes for Jan 30, and then for 3-14, have members had a chance to review those?

1013
01:43:21,315 --> 01:43:25,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting some head nods.

1014
01:43:27,185 --> 01:43:30,769
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Jamie, I saw your head nodding.

1015
01:43:30,849 --> 01:43:38,396
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, having reviewed those, how did you find the reviews?

1016
01:43:38,416 --> 01:43:43,141
[SPEAKER_06]: They were January and March 14th.

1017
01:43:43,761 --> 01:43:44,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Both looked good to me.

1018
01:43:45,443 --> 01:43:48,206
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, yeah, I had a chance to review them as well.

1019
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:49,687
[SPEAKER_09]: They looked accurate.

1020
01:43:52,285 --> 01:43:58,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, I do want to make sure that if we're missing meeting minutes that we get those sent to us.

1021
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:02,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Rachel's done them all, so it's just a matter of me sending them to you.

1022
01:44:05,904 --> 01:44:20,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Before I go, yeah, maybe we can put them all in a folder and then you can just kind of send us the whole thing Yeah, that's actually everyone on the Google Drive just straight just for those and I'll have approved and unapproved in two different folders And I'll just send you the Google Drive Google Drive link and you can just get in there.

1023
01:44:20,557 --> 01:44:25,641
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually that'll work I think yeah, that'd be good because I can't find the March one.

1024
01:44:25,741 --> 01:44:27,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I have January 11th 25th 30th

1025
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:35,318
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't see the other March when I sent you all on the last Friday.

1026
01:44:36,139 --> 01:44:37,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was more recent.

1027
01:44:37,701 --> 01:44:40,365
[SPEAKER_09]: You were going to say something.

1028
01:44:40,385 --> 01:44:43,409
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was just agreeing.

1029
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:45,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, okay.

1030
01:44:46,691 --> 01:44:52,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so right now we're discussing Jan 30th and March 14th.

1031
01:44:52,457 --> 01:44:59,383
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it sounds like several members of the board found the meeting minutes to be in order.

1032
01:44:59,463 --> 01:45:06,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So Chair awaits a motion to approve the meeting minutes for January 30th and March 14th.

1033
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:09,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a second?

1034
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:16,052
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

1035
01:45:16,152 --> 01:45:16,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

1036
01:45:17,313 --> 01:45:17,473
Aye.

1037
01:45:18,233 --> 01:45:18,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

1038
01:45:18,713 --> 01:45:18,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1039
01:45:21,756 --> 01:45:22,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

1040
01:45:22,196 --> 01:45:22,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1041
01:45:23,357 --> 01:45:24,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Yvette?

1042
01:45:25,798 --> 01:45:25,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1043
01:45:27,099 --> 01:45:27,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

1044
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:27,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1045
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,622
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, the meeting minutes are approved, and thank you in advance, Dennis.

1046
01:45:32,043 --> 01:45:36,786
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be on the lookout for the remainder, and we can deal with those at our next session.

1047
01:45:40,076 --> 01:45:40,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1048
01:45:41,317 --> 01:45:48,163
[SPEAKER_09]: So just as a reminder, folks, our Thursday hearing, I'm going to be absent.

1049
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:50,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie has volunteered to chair.

1050
01:45:50,205 --> 01:45:55,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, I have some details for you, which I'll just tie out with you offline about.

1051
01:45:57,311 --> 01:46:02,655
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, otherwise, hope everything goes well on Thursday.

1052
01:46:02,716 --> 01:46:06,299
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll see you all on April 11th.

1053
01:46:09,612 --> 01:46:11,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I think that's, oh, go ahead, Andre.

1054
01:46:11,794 --> 01:46:11,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1055
01:46:11,954 --> 01:46:15,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just a question, and maybe this is for Alicia or Dennis.

1056
01:46:17,319 --> 01:46:29,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the city's 40B consultant, I haven't seen him, is, and I don't think we ever actually met with him, right?

1057
01:46:29,589 --> 01:46:35,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess my question is, because this is coming up in terms of the design that we talked about today, is what,

1058
01:46:36,863 --> 01:46:51,071
[SPEAKER_07]: can we do anything to kind of better shape these 40B projects that come along and so that they're not just these same old massive block projects that we keep seeing?

1059
01:46:53,833 --> 01:47:04,539
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Andre, I think it's been a couple of hearings where Attorney Haverty wasn't able to join, but his colleague who joined today, Chris,

1060
01:47:06,877 --> 01:47:08,719
[SPEAKER_09]: is part of the same office.

1061
01:47:08,739 --> 01:47:12,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't have them on currently, but they have been joining.

1062
01:47:12,662 --> 01:47:20,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would recommend there's a couple of options.

1063
01:47:21,989 --> 01:47:34,198
[SPEAKER_09]: The board could schedule an executive session with our 40B consultant to talk about that in greater detail, or any member of the board is welcome to directly reach out

1064
01:47:35,038 --> 01:47:40,562
[SPEAKER_09]: to our 40B consultant with these sorts of questions to get those clarifications.

1065
01:47:40,602 --> 01:47:46,565
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing we can't do is discuss it as a large group in private.

1066
01:47:47,966 --> 01:47:59,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I would recommend maybe for that question, you could reach out directly to Attorney Haverty and then we could discuss it in public at a

1067
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:01,331
[SPEAKER_09]: at a future hearing.

1068
01:48:01,351 --> 01:48:03,994
[SPEAKER_09]: We could also ask it in public.

1069
01:48:04,014 --> 01:48:04,774
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the other option.

1070
01:48:04,794 --> 01:48:09,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it wouldn't necessarily qualify as executive session.

1071
01:48:09,139 --> 01:48:17,247
[SPEAKER_09]: So it could just be, we could confirm that Attorney Haverty or one of his colleagues is going to be present at the next hearing.

1072
01:48:17,467 --> 01:48:21,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they have been attending and we could just ask them directly in public.

1073
01:48:21,171 --> 01:48:22,192
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be the other option.

1074
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:30,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm happy either one.

1075
01:48:31,038 --> 01:48:33,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to maybe in light of public.

1076
01:48:33,682 --> 01:48:35,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I mean, here.

1077
01:48:36,687 --> 01:48:43,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, maybe in light of your curiosity and the two weeks until our next hearing, maybe ask the question.

1078
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:48,131
[SPEAKER_09]: in private, yourself, get an answer.

1079
01:48:48,211 --> 01:48:56,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And then based on that, you could ask it again in public, or you could let me know that you'd like there to be a public discussion of that.

1080
01:48:57,075 --> 01:48:58,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just state my understanding.

1081
01:48:58,656 --> 01:49:08,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there is a delicate balance, and there are some limits in terms of what the board can and can't do.

1082
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:13,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it would be best to, if there's uncertainty about

1083
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:21,345
[SPEAKER_09]: what we really can do, I think it would be best to have the 40B consultant just in public state that.

1084
01:49:22,125 --> 01:49:31,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, in general, the trade-off is local concerns versus something that might render the project uneconomical, especially.

1085
01:49:36,456 --> 01:49:36,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1086
01:49:37,817 --> 01:49:40,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because I'm curious, how do we get

1087
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:48,549
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the whole negotiation, like where the number of units for the amount of size of the land and all of that stuff.

1088
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:53,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just feel like it'd be good for everybody to understand that better.

1089
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:58,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, yeah, maybe maybe we can lead off since it's a more general question.

1090
01:49:59,405 --> 01:50:02,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll plan to as 1 of the opening topics.

1091
01:50:03,428 --> 01:50:11,214
[SPEAKER_09]: For our next session, we can just check in with the 40 B consultant and have them provide a brief summary for the public about.

1092
01:50:13,195 --> 01:50:17,877
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of the board's consideration as part of the 40B process.

1093
01:50:17,917 --> 01:50:19,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that work for you?

1094
01:50:19,358 --> 01:50:20,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1095
01:50:20,798 --> 01:50:22,519
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

1096
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:30,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Another aspect to keep in mind is once these projects are complete, and I believe walk in court, is those are going to put ourselves at 10%.

1097
01:50:30,723 --> 01:50:37,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So we, fingers crossed, shouldn't see another 40B coming in, theoretically.

1098
01:50:39,593 --> 01:50:43,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't mind 40 Bs and I want to support housing.

1099
01:50:43,796 --> 01:50:48,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I just would like it to be- I want to see them at the 50% level myself.

1100
01:50:49,239 --> 01:51:00,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love it if it was kind of a sensitively designed, and maybe instead of these mega blocks, we could have smaller buildings or different heights and things like that.

1101
01:51:00,968 --> 01:51:06,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see Attorney Hunt wants to say, sorry, Director Hunt, wow, wants to say something.

1102
01:51:07,950 --> 01:51:14,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So in just a second, Director Hunt, I do want to just say we're towing a line.

1103
01:51:14,492 --> 01:51:19,373
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not talking about this specific project, but like we did already continue matters.

1104
01:51:19,413 --> 01:51:19,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So we really

1105
01:51:21,681 --> 01:51:25,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm recommending we don't go too deep into details here.

1106
01:51:25,803 --> 01:51:27,864
[SPEAKER_09]: But Director Hunt, what were you going to say?

1107
01:51:28,304 --> 01:51:28,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1108
01:51:28,984 --> 01:51:35,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of getting another 40B application, because we have Safe Harbor for two years right now,

1109
01:51:38,645 --> 01:51:44,687
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't see one that's controversial like argumentative debatable.

1110
01:51:45,267 --> 01:51:53,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you that we are talking to other housing developers about how to bring projects to Medford and zoning and how things work.

1111
01:51:54,190 --> 01:52:05,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we could see would be a friendly 40B, but that would be a very different situation because they wouldn't have the right to bring it to us and jam it through.

1112
01:52:06,377 --> 01:52:16,062
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have the ability to bring it to us and go through the 40B process as instead of zoning variances.

1113
01:52:16,702 --> 01:52:39,221
[SPEAKER_00]: right, because we agree to let them go through the 40B process because we are interested in the 20% affordable housing or 25% or 20% more deeply affordable, that is something that we could, and I will say it is something that we have discussed potentially with some housing developers,

1114
01:52:39,922 --> 01:53:01,379
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is an interesting question for them as to will that amount of affordable housing raise their costs too much to make the specific project they're thinking about not affordable versus applying for variances, which you might decide to grant, but they would have legal tests and.

1115
01:53:02,723 --> 01:53:08,368
[SPEAKER_00]: they could be challenged, right, could be appealed more easily than a friendly 40B.

1116
01:53:08,649 --> 01:53:10,511
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to give you some context there.

1117
01:53:10,631 --> 01:53:12,532
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a very different situation.

1118
01:53:14,254 --> 01:53:26,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the third 40B, it's unclear to me that they can just come back or what their statute of limitations is because they had stayed that case pending the outcome of the HLC.

1119
01:53:27,278 --> 01:53:35,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have not come back to us in the last six, it's about five or six months since that case was settled.

1120
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:40,602
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually a legal question we should probably get answered.

1121
01:53:41,462 --> 01:53:45,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted you to have that context as you're thinking about these things.

1122
01:53:45,883 --> 01:53:49,704
[SPEAKER_00]: What Andre is raising is a long-term question.

1123
01:53:49,724 --> 01:53:53,425
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that's gonna happen in the next six months or year.

1124
01:53:55,762 --> 01:53:56,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's right.

1125
01:53:56,542 --> 01:54:10,788
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding is Safe Harbor just dramatically increases the types of reasons that the appeals court would accept for denying a project.

1126
01:54:10,828 --> 01:54:13,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So it just changes the power dynamics.

1127
01:54:13,529 --> 01:54:17,710
[SPEAKER_09]: But in principle, someone could bring a 4 dB Safe Harbor.

1128
01:54:18,931 --> 01:54:20,352
[SPEAKER_09]: With Safe Harbor, there's a

1129
01:54:22,107 --> 01:54:28,950
[SPEAKER_09]: typically they're friendly because the board could reject it for a wide variety of reasons.

1130
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:30,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, anyway.

1131
01:54:33,212 --> 01:54:36,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

1132
01:54:40,275 --> 01:54:40,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

1133
01:54:42,076 --> 01:54:42,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1134
01:54:42,656 --> 01:54:43,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, OK.

1135
01:54:43,196 --> 01:54:44,797
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a roll call.

1136
01:54:44,857 --> 01:54:45,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

1137
01:54:45,237 --> 01:54:46,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1138
01:54:47,238 --> 01:54:47,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

1139
01:54:47,578 --> 01:54:47,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1140
01:54:47,698 --> 01:54:48,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

1141
01:54:49,259 --> 01:54:49,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1142
01:54:53,147 --> 01:54:53,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1143
01:54:54,089 --> 01:54:55,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, aye.

1144
01:54:55,511 --> 01:54:57,354
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we are now adjourned.
