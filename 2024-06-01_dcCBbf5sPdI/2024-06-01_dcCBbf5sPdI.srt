00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:50,737
[SPEAKER_08]: And at this point, I will turn it over to our CPC manager and our CPC chair, Teresa Dupont and Roberta Cameron, to give a short presentation, and then we'll hear from the applicants, or at least some of them.

35
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:52,258
[SPEAKER_08]: The floor is yours.

36
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, and thank you, everybody.

37
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:56,362
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Teresa Dupont.

38
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:58,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the CPA manager here for the city of Method.

39
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberta Cameron, chair of the CPC.

40
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:05,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

41
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:09,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So tonight before you, we have our annual funding round appropriations.

42
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:14,558
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that we've been doing every year for the past six years now.

43
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:22,541
[SPEAKER_06]: So typically, just for everybody's information, this is discussed at the committee meetings held by the Community Preservation Committee.

44
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,802
[SPEAKER_06]: We make recommendations to fund.

45
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:31,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at that point, the paper comes before the city council, and you actually vote on the appropriations.

46
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we're here today, to talk about these applications in particular.

47
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:45,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just like to say a couple words about how the applications come to be recommended to the City Council.

48
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:58,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year the Community Preservation Committee holds a grant funding round where we invite people to submit applications for CPA funding.

49
00:03:58,254 --> 00:03:59,695
[SPEAKER_05]: The Community Preservation Committee

50
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:09,023
[SPEAKER_05]: reviews those applications and discerns which applications meet the community needs that have been studied and identified.

51
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:18,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And the committee then recommends the funding for the city council to approve.

52
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:25,060
[SPEAKER_05]: and so the funds cannot be spent unless they are first recommended by the CPC and approved by City Council.

53
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:35,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And this year, we had an unusually large amount of funds that were requested off-cycle before the regular funding round completed.

54
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:44,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So those were early applications that we were asked to consider early because they had an urgent need.

55
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:53,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those early applications included the Walkling Court Development Project, which requested $800,000 for affordable housing.

56
00:04:53,896 --> 00:05:03,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And another was the McGlynn School Playground, which requested $400,000 for the renovation of the McGlynn School Playground.

57
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:10,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there were also some additional smaller projects that were received earlier.

58
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:15,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the remainder of the projects that applied for funding this funding round.

59
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:16,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

60
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:17,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

61
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:22,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to go in order of the letter you sent in here from applicants and ask questions?

62
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:22,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly.

63
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:26,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so you know, the applicants are unavailable tonight.

64
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:30,648
[SPEAKER_06]: There was really only two that were exterior to outside of this building.

65
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:35,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately, they were unable to make tonight, but I'm happy to answer any questions on behalf of the applicants.

66
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we do that, do we have any general questions from the council about this funding round?

67
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:43,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

68
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:47,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got 28 people.

69
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:48,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

70
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:26,518
[SPEAKER_02]: that will really help us understand this is the portion that goes to true form of power.

71
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,185
[SPEAKER_02]: right?

72
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:51,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Affordable Housing Trust Fund was just established this past year, and actually, the Affordable Housing Trust Board itself has not yet been appointed.

73
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:57,359
[SPEAKER_05]: There hasn't been anyone to apply on behalf of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund yet.

74
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:06,588
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the committee anticipates that that will be a factor in the future and anticipates future applications

75
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:13,451
[SPEAKER_05]: for funds to the Affordable Housing Trust, but that hasn't occurred yet, because it hasn't existed up until now.

76
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:16,032
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.

77
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:26,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, if it wasn't set up, could there be a certain amount of money expected that this is already an issue, this is already a problem, that we can start feeding this money?

78
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:36,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a figure that we can hold to make sure that, with the question we have right now, the question I'm trying to receive, is the funding that's going off to legal services,

79
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:51,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It's truly, you know, there's other avenues for legal services or issues when it comes to housing, but when it comes to helping out homeless or accessibility, it's really just, you know, this would be a great way to bring it out.

80
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,939
[SPEAKER_05]: points to respond to that question.

81
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:05,165
[SPEAKER_05]: First, there we have in the past set aside funds when we didn't have any applications for affordable housing projects in that year.

82
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:11,530
[SPEAKER_05]: We have elected to set aside funds to put in the affordable housing reserve to spend in the future.

83
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:17,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of those funds that we set aside in the past have gone to help the walk link port project, for example.

84
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:18,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

85
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:35,477
[SPEAKER_05]: yes yeah that was already funded this year so it didn't appear in this round I mean that what on your agenda today because that was already approved at a previous meeting yeah

86
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:05,254
[SPEAKER_02]: those are the three categories a minimum of 10% a year has to go to each of those three and then the remaining is can go to any of those three

87
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:35,550
[SPEAKER_02]: when we can now have an identified system that's already been set up that we know can get action.

88
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:46,503
[SPEAKER_11]: we know that we can actually go and that there's always gonna be at least 10% or maybe more that will support the housing concerns we have in the community.

89
00:09:46,523 --> 00:09:49,244
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate some of these questions.

90
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:54,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to answer a couple of things in response to your question.

91
00:09:55,268 --> 00:10:00,211
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is that this year with these projects that are on the slate today,

92
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:05,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about an even split between the three program areas, which has been our goal.

93
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:15,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally, the other thing that I wanted to mention was with with respect to housing families, the CPC actually cannot CPA funds cannot go to legal services.

94
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,240
[SPEAKER_05]: What these funds are going for is to

95
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:25,763
[SPEAKER_05]: to pay rental arrears that their legal services are helping with.

96
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:45,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they have a pro bono client tenant who comes to them, they, through other funding sources, not CPA, have a pro bono lawyer available, but sometimes they need to pay back rent in order to settle a case, and the CPA funds can go toward paying the rental arrears.

97
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,872
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, thank you for the clarity, I think that's important, so appreciate that.

98
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

99
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:54,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Clerk, could you note that Councilor Callaghan is here on Zoom?

100
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,967
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll go to Councilor Leming.

101
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:58,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

102
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:14,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of this is not so much to ask questions, but I previously was on the CPC, so I just felt like adding a little bit more context about the nature of the potential relationship between the CPC and the Affordable Housing Trust.

103
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:20,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Typically, affordable housing projects that come before the CPC are just

104
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,654
[SPEAKER_10]: you'll get like a big project once every couple of years.

105
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:38,468
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Walkling Court development was, I mean, I think that that would, the final price tag for that would be over 100 million, of which the CBC is donating $800,000 this year.

106
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:44,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And the trouble with the CBC, and please correct me if any of this is inaccurate, but it's just, you know,

107
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:52,105
[SPEAKER_10]: is that they have to spend a certain amount from taxes every year.

108
00:11:52,125 --> 00:12:06,409
[SPEAKER_10]: The benefit of the Affordable Housing Trust in this case is that it allows money to be collected over time so that when one of those projects does come along, you could end up then putting towards a greater amount of capital towards that project.

109
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:13,811
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a bit of trouble with multi-year funding towards the Walkland Court redevelopment that the CPC was running into during my time there.

110
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:14,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that

111
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:24,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the issue that we're sort of seeing with the Affordable Housing Trust and potential revenue streams into it is volume.

112
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:30,058
[SPEAKER_10]: So the CBC will be a very important feeder into it.

113
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:39,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It is, however, like I said, the walk-in core, just for an example, I believe, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's something over $100 million the CBC takes in

114
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:51,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, just ballpark here around $2 million-ish a year, of which a third of that can go to affordable housing.

115
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:59,533
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we are going to be able to fund affordable housing developments like that, the CPC could be an important source of funds.

116
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:03,015
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it is necessary to have that coming from

117
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:06,794
[SPEAKER_10]: different areas.

118
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:14,139
[SPEAKER_10]: So this will come up in the regular meeting, so I don't want to just sort of clarify the CBC and the Affordable Housing Trust.

119
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

120
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

121
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:18,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions from members of the Council?

122
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,867
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's go through in order.

123
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:41,160
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our first one, which we already got into, but the 69,002 Housing Families for Homelessness Prevention Pro Bono Legal Services Program.

124
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you want to add?

125
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:43,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know we've done it in the past.

126
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:56,466
[SPEAKER_06]: have funded it in the past and right now it is one of the very few resources that the city can offer to folks that are facing homelessness challenges and rental arrears.

127
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:04,394
[SPEAKER_06]: With COVID pandemic there came a large surge of funding that helped with those type of programs but since the pandemic

128
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:12,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember the exact word, but officially, thank you, emergency order is officially over.

129
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,002
[SPEAKER_06]: That funding has dried up.

130
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:18,606
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are fewer and fewer resources available for folks in this type of situation.

131
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:24,911
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very happy with the service that Housing Families is providing to our residents.

132
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally was the head clerk of the planning department and fielded a lot of those calls.

133
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:33,879
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say that Housing Families, nobody's ever called to complain about that service.

134
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally feel strongly about this resource that is provided to our residents.

135
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,772
[SPEAKER_06]: But any other questions?

136
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:44,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from councilors on that item number one?

137
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:48,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng?

138
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:54,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a question, but as you noted, we've been funding this for a while and there have been no complaints.

139
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:57,408
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone pretty smoothly, so I feel very comfortable with this.

140
00:14:58,309 --> 00:14:58,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

141
00:14:58,749 --> 00:14:59,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

142
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:09,455
[SPEAKER_08]: On the second, the appropriation of $50,000 for the Cemetery Division from the Historic Preservation Reserve for the Oak Grove Cemetery Access Road Study.

143
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:23,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so Oak Grove has been a victim of deferred maintenance for many, many years, including looking into an access road to the historic section of the cemetery.

144
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:27,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently right now, it's challenging for accessibility.

145
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:35,259
[SPEAKER_06]: So this access road study would expand the potential access to this section via vehicular traffic.

146
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:45,328
[SPEAKER_06]: We are looking into a full master plan for Oak Grove TBD on that one, but this would be incorporated into that full master plan.

147
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,370
[SPEAKER_06]: We want the cemetery to be accessible.

148
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:54,076
[SPEAKER_06]: We want everybody to enjoy it, be able to visit their family members that are there, as well as enjoy it as recreation space.

149
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:55,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

150
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from councilors on that item?

151
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:09,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, the appropriation of $200,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the Cemetery Division for the Cemetery Access Buildings Restoration Project.

152
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:30,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so the purpose for this project in a prior funding round the CPC funded study for the restoration actually two studies for the restoration of the caretakers residence, which houses, the office for the cemetery division in the basement.

153
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:35,006
[SPEAKER_05]: and the garage, which is a historic building.

154
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:39,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're going to combine those into a single project.

155
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:49,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the next request of funds, we'll begin working toward the actual restoration implementation of the studies for those buildings.

156
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:50,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

157
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:53,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to be clear, no CPA funds.

158
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:57,375
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a provision of the funding.

159
00:16:57,535 --> 00:17:01,055
[SPEAKER_06]: No CPA funds will be used on the residential portion of the caretaker's building.

160
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:02,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to point that out.

161
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:05,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

162
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:06,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions on that item?

163
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:09,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none.

164
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:18,219
[SPEAKER_08]: The fourth item, 229,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability for the Logan Park Natural Play Area project.

165
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:25,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So this project would update some of the playground elements that are currently there at Logan Park.

166
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:29,743
[SPEAKER_06]: The theme there would be to use natural resources.

167
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:40,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Forgive me, our planner has a specific theme in mind for it, but essentially it would be utilizing tree trunks, boulders for natural play for our children.

168
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin, can you just shut off your microphone?

169
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:43,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

170
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't have too many open mics.

171
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:48,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, once you get out there, they're like behind the speakers.

172
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:49,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, sure.

173
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:56,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a playground that hasn't been touched in a while, and we're getting some fun play elements there.

174
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:58,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli, if I can, thank you for that.

175
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,291
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great.

176
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:09,915
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what you see the excitement with, when people can see the tangible changes, the upgrades to important pieces like parks and playgrounds, I think it's important.

177
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:24,422
[SPEAKER_11]: But do you know a part of this is for accessibility apparatus, so our kids with special needs can have an opportunity to play in all these playgrounds, just the one at the McGlynn, I think the one at Carr Park maybe too, is it?

178
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:36,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of current building and playground standards, any new playground construction is going to have to meet basic accessibility standards.

179
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:47,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The McGlynn School playground was designed to go beyond to really make an integrated play space for the children, but this is going to be more of a natural play space, but it will be accessible.

180
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:48,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

181
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:58,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And another provision of the award was that the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability will seek community feedback on the final design.

182
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:01,390
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you live in the Logan Park area, keep an eye out.

183
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:03,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

184
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:06,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions?

185
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:12,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, on the fifth item, appropriation of $10,000 for the Salem Street Burying Ground Conditions Assessment.

186
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:21,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is for the Salem Street Burying Ground, which is the one that's right here in Medford Square.

187
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:25,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And the wall of the burying ground needs restoration.

188
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:29,560
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take a close look at it, it's looking very rough in a lot of places.

189
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:35,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just the first step toward restoration before we actually bring someone out there to fix it.

190
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:41,307
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to understand exactly what the treatment plan is needed for that.

191
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

192
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from members of the council?

193
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:51,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, number 6, 205,525,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the Parks Division for Tufts Park Basketball Court.

194
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:04,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, it's kind of the same story as well as Cape and Park, so I'll kind of speak to both of these applications.

195
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:09,702
[SPEAKER_06]: These were applications that we received in the 2022 funding round, I believe.

196
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:12,885
[SPEAKER_06]: They were not funded at that point because of just budget.

197
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:18,751
[SPEAKER_06]: We deferred those and invited the Parks Department to reapply in following years.

198
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:19,432
[SPEAKER_06]: This is that.

199
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:21,955
[SPEAKER_06]: those two projects there.

200
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, parks are in desperate need of resurfacing on those clay surfaces.

201
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions on that one?

202
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll just say the same thing for Cape and Park.

203
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:37,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Cape and Park as well?

204
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:37,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

205
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:38,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

206
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:39,658
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the next one.

207
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:43,359
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $106,625 from the General Reserve CPA to the Parks Division for Cape and Park.

208
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:43,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

209
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,740
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

210
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Number eight.

211
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:55,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Requesting the appropriation of $99,965 from the Historic Preservation Reserve to Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust for ADA pathways and parking improvements.

212
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:56,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you do it.

213
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:57,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I might be better.

214
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:00,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

215
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:06,117
[SPEAKER_05]: This is again a continuation of a project that we have been funding in the past.

216
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:15,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Previously, the CPA program funded design of a driveway and parking area to serve the Brooks estate.

217
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:22,769
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a critical piece to making this city owned property actually serve the public.

218
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:28,012
[SPEAKER_05]: At the moment, it's very difficult to use the building because it's hard to get there.

219
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:40,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And with restoration of the driveway and creation of accessible parking and parking to serve the building, it can actually be used as a public building as it should be.

220
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:46,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is, again, the first step toward construction to help us get there.

221
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:48,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.

222
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:54,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only thing I'll add is that it's partially being matched by state funding through the ARPA program.

223
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:57,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only reason I know that is because I'm the city council appointee to the MBELT board.

224
00:21:58,094 --> 00:22:00,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm very involved and invested in the project.

225
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:03,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from councilors on Brooks Estate?

226
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:14,449
[SPEAKER_08]: On the next project for Brooks Estate is the $98,275 from the Historic Preservation Reserve for the East Elevation ADA improvements.

227
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:25,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Brooks Manor, Shepard's Brooks Manor, there is an elevation, east side elevation that is in need of some drainage updating as well as accessibility.

228
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:30,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now it's a concrete sidewalk that is kind of broken up and again, deferred maintenance.

229
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:37,197
[SPEAKER_06]: So this would bring it up to accessibility standards to make this building accessible to folks.

230
00:22:37,537 --> 00:22:40,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it's the main accessible entrance.

231
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

232
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:43,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, any questions on that one?

233
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:54,386
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, last one, $4,800 from the Historic Preservation Reserve to the Cemetery Trustees for the Cross Street Cemetery Conditions Assessment.

234
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:55,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

235
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:58,512
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a what we

236
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:10,619
[SPEAKER_05]: considered to be a small grant application, so it was received out of cycle, but it happens to align with when these other projects were being considered by City Council anyway.

237
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:18,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have a streamlined process for people to apply for small grants.

238
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:30,428
[SPEAKER_05]: grants have to meet all of our other eligibility requirements, but for projects that have less than, are requesting less than $5,000, they can go through this expedited process.

239
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:44,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So this application is to conduct a condition assessment to restore a section of the historic, a historic section of the cemetery at Oak Grove.

240
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:55,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And not to editorialize, but Cross Street Cemetery was what used to be, it was displaced by the construction of Interstate 93, so all those graves were moved to Oak Grove.

241
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct, exactly.

242
00:23:58,912 --> 00:23:59,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic, well that's the 10.

243
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:01,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions on Cross Street Cemetery?

244
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:05,193
[SPEAKER_08]: for members of the council.

245
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:08,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, any general questions from members of the council?

246
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:10,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Councilor Tseng.

247
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:11,035
[SPEAKER_09]: General question.

248
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:22,878
[SPEAKER_09]: So could you give us some ideas to, when you're going through these every year, how many applicants do you get versus how much money are you able to award?

249
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:29,700
[SPEAKER_05]: In most years, up until now, we have been able to fund

250
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:37,632
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the projects that had applications that made it all the way through the application cycle.

251
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:44,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes in the vetting process, we might determine that a project wasn't ready to go yet, needed some more planning.

252
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:54,658
[SPEAKER_05]: needed more coordination between the stakeholders, but all of the projects that have made it through the funding cycle so far have been able to be funded.

253
00:24:55,178 --> 00:25:02,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, we had a couple of very large requests, and we ended up having to

254
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,864
[SPEAKER_05]: break two of the requests, ask them to come back.

255
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:14,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year they requested more than we could fund, so we asked them to break it into two asks and come back this year.

256
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:20,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And those were two of the projects that we funded early in the funding cycle.

257
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:28,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we are this year able to fund projects that were postponed last year.

258
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:29,698
[SPEAKER_05]: There were three projects that were

259
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,749
[SPEAKER_05]: postponed in order to make room for those big projects last year.

260
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:49,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been able to fund everything so far that were really viable projects, helping the grantees, the applicants through the grant cycle to make sure that their project really met the community needs and was going to be a successful project.

261
00:25:50,302 --> 00:25:55,005
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm hearing that sometimes there's a delay in how quickly people can inquire.

262
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:57,867
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a limit to how much funding we have, realistically.

263
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:03,651
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not a limit to how much money we need to fix everything in Medford, and we can't do it all at once.

264
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:10,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have so far been fortunate enough to be able to respond to all of the requests as they come.

265
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,858
[SPEAKER_05]: But the requests have increased every year.

266
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:19,782
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of funding requested has increased every year faster than the rate of

267
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:22,385
[SPEAKER_05]: revenue growth.

268
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:27,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're going to have tough choices ahead of us, absolutely.

269
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:31,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to continue to be able to fund everything.

270
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,986
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to, yeah.

271
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:37,587
[SPEAKER_05]: like I said, make some tough choices going forward.

272
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,369
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really helpful to hear.

273
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:51,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the future, if we have projects coming on board, like what we anticipate some projects that we've already mentioned in this meeting, seems like we might not be able to meet the full need of those projects through CPA funding.

274
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:51,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Potentially.

275
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:52,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

276
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:53,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

277
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:57,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

278
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:58,653
[SPEAKER_11]: That brings up a good point.

279
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:10,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Miss Cameron, I think that especially this evening, as we vet other issues out the affordable housing give us give us some ideas of some some of the projects that were denied for affordable housing this round.

280
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:14,703
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't denied any projects for affordable housing.

281
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:27,111
[SPEAKER_05]: We have funded the full amount requested for two housing construction projects over the six years that the CPA program has been in existence.

282
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:38,399
[SPEAKER_05]: That was for Medford Community Housing, which is building a three-unit building on Felsway West, and the Walkling Court Redevelopment Project over

283
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:42,615
[SPEAKER_05]: off of Auburn Street and North Street.

284
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:51,203
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have in the past funded an emergency rental assistance program during the pandemic.

285
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:54,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've funded this the

286
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:02,343
[SPEAKER_05]: the funds to supplement the pro bono legal services program at Housing Families.

287
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:12,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was also one affordable housing construction project that we approved early on that fell through because of their own

288
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,216
[SPEAKER_05]: problems unrelated to the city support.

289
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:32,386
[SPEAKER_11]: So I only bring this up because what the tone we're seeing lately, rent control, the tax question this evening, and Community Preservation Act has funded all of our affordable housing issues so far today.

290
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:33,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's amazing.

291
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:35,068
[SPEAKER_11]: So that that speaks a lot.

292
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:37,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that speaks volumes of what

293
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:46,522
[SPEAKER_11]: direction we should really be considering when you talk about affordable housing needs and in how it affects the rest of this community.

294
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:47,083
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

295
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:48,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think.

296
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:50,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

297
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:51,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

298
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So I go to Councilor Callahan and Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins.

299
00:28:56,274 --> 00:28:59,396
[SPEAKER_08]: and I will note that the value of properties in the city of Minnesota.

300
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,077
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't note anything as the chair.

301
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I can state a fact, George.

302
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,080
[SPEAKER_08]: You can step off, but George, what's the fact?

303
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,781
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot.

304
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I can state facts.

305
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:07,642
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot.

306
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:08,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Read Robert's rules.

307
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:09,283
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot.

308
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:15,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fact that the property value of the city is $13 billion, and we've spent a couple million.

309
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:16,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand your role.

310
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:17,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I do, sir.

311
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,470
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli.

312
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:29,177
[SPEAKER_08]: and can state facts sir and don't don't know outbursts you're wrong i'm not councillor callahan

313
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:31,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

314
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:38,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really commend the CPC for all the work that you do and, you know, the whole approval process and researching all these projects.

315
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to understand a little bit better the process.

316
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:44,957
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are applications that come in.

317
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:51,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those applications ones that have been, do people go through the planning department?

318
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it all simply, are these

319
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:58,795
[SPEAKER_04]: organizations coming to you directly?

320
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:12,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there what is and I guess what I'm asking about is I've been hearing from constituents about sort of equity across the city, folks in Barrie Park, Barrie Park playground, thinking that they maybe are not getting as much attention and as much funding.

321
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:16,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just curious if like who who's

322
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:29,047
[SPEAKER_04]: job would it be to look across the city and determine which of these sort of resurfacing projects or any of these projects are the ones that are most needed and ensure that those applications are getting in.

323
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:34,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of the process, thank you Councilor Callaghan for your question.

324
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:39,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now it's a little bit of everything.

325
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:41,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Applications come to us.

326
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:51,248
[SPEAKER_06]: We also identify needs in the community and perhaps approach folks about, you know, just awareness of CPA in general as a potential funding opportunity.

327
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,331
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of

328
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,569
[SPEAKER_06]: The equity of it, we hear you.

329
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:10,506
[SPEAKER_06]: This year for our funding round, we intend to add additional information and listening sessions in our outreach to folks to hear from residents, hear from the community, hear from leaders in the community, what they would like to see.

330
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:12,268
[SPEAKER_06]: That's outside of City Hall.

331
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:21,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Inside of City Hall, we do have a capital improvements projects tracking as well as park projects, specifically to park projects.

332
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:26,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hear about Berry Park, and that has been identified in our park project spreadsheet.

333
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:29,196
[SPEAKER_06]: The issue comes to staffing.

334
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,277
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to do park projects everywhere.

335
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:32,217
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funding and staffing.

336
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:38,139
[SPEAKER_06]: We just don't have enough folks right now or money to be doing all these projects simultaneously.

337
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that Berry Park has been identified.

338
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:48,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say exactly which year, but in the coming soon-ish years, that has been identified as a major park project to take on.

339
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we're in the midst of Carr Park, Gillis Park,

340
00:31:52,364 --> 00:31:55,747
[SPEAKER_06]: McGlynn, so we've got some serious projects going right now.

341
00:31:56,208 --> 00:32:03,474
[SPEAKER_06]: But in terms of the equity of the application process, I mean, my name is Teresa DuPont, T. DuPont at Medford-MA.gov.

342
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:12,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to hear from folks about what they want to see this money going towards in the community, as well as, again, from anybody who has an idea.

343
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:13,744
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to hear from folks.

344
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:15,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Teresa.

345
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:16,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng, Councilor Collins.

346
00:32:17,063 --> 00:32:21,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think what I'm hearing from that is the need is deeper than just the applicants themselves.

347
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:28,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Oftentimes there are projects that aren't even applied for or aren't considered great enough just because we don't have the money for that in the first place.

348
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:39,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And the city departments know and applicants know that it's not realistic to get that money at this point in the project process.

349
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that be correct?

350
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, that would be correct.

351
00:32:44,642 --> 00:32:53,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Also add that the city, in addition to CPA funds for these larger projects, the city is relying on funding from multiple sources to come in.

352
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:58,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the past year, we've been able to apply ARPA funding to some of these projects.

353
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:04,511
[SPEAKER_05]: but we also receive grants from the state that are matched with the CPA funds.

354
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:10,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And the state grant funding, we may be able to address one park a year.

355
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:16,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not a matter of if but when can we get to the parks that are next in line for improvement.

356
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:21,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So for big projects, oftentimes, most times, we need multiple revenue sources.

357
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,599
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's helpful to know, I think, as well.

358
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:42,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think when we think about the parks that are on our list, if we have other strong revenue channels to fund certain projects that cover some of these, that might free up funding to do some of the other really important work.

359
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:43,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that be accurate?

360
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,542
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be accurate.

361
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:46,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bit of a dance.

362
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:50,171
[SPEAKER_06]: We're always doing funding dances here in City Hall.

363
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:52,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But there have been instances where

364
00:33:53,598 --> 00:34:02,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I had a better term besides Rob Peter to pay Paul, but we have shifted money around to be able to balance it all out because CPA can only be used for certain things.

365
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:05,930
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of restrictions about what you can spend that money on.

366
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing with CBBG and ARPA and all the other fun acronyms that float around here at City Hall.

367
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:13,677
[SPEAKER_06]: There are rules about how we can spend that money.

368
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:16,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes we just balance it out and help each other out.

369
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:18,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's helpful context.

370
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:25,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I think like the CPA projects are all excellent, that they really help our community know that, you know, this isn't the end all be all.

371
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's so much more need than what we see on the paper.

372
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:32,489
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really helpful context for us to consider other policies going forward.

373
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:34,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

374
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

375
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:36,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

376
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:38,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Bears.

377
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Teresa, Roberta, for your presentation.

378
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:46,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I always look forward to these meetings once or twice a year because the

379
00:34:48,388 --> 00:35:03,268
[SPEAKER_07]: always does such a great job of putting together, you know, not just gassing up but it's always a really great set of projects that I think, you know, we can be really proud to fund and, you know, looking at this list of the award summary for fiscal year 24 these projects are spread out all across the community like you said,

380
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:07,312
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a pretty good mix between those three eligibility categories.

381
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's always really great to see.

382
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:22,285
[SPEAKER_07]: It's exciting to have a mix of projects that are in their inception and those study phases and then ones where we can see that we've been investing in these projects over years and pushing them forward to completion and being even better resources for the city to enjoy.

383
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:27,890
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just, you know, it's nice when you tee us up like that, we just get to vote on good stuff.

384
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,591
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always great.

385
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:50,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's, it's always good to have the conversation about when we're talking about investing in capital projects, investing in open space, investing in affordable housing, you know, to have that conversation about what role does the CPA funding in that because it's like you said, that's, you know, that's a that that scope can be, you know, as big as we're willing to open our eyes to see.

386
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:53,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's good to have the conversation about

387
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,042
[SPEAKER_07]: What role can this play?

388
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:57,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Where can we put this money?

389
00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:58,844
[SPEAKER_07]: How far does that get us?

390
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:05,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And to continue to have that conversation about contextualizing, what else would we do if the limit was higher?

391
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:10,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for this great set of awardees.

392
00:36:10,356 --> 00:36:11,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the context.

393
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Much appreciation.

394
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

395
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:16,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

396
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:17,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions?

397
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:23,090
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, seeing none, we'll open it up to members of the public.

398
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:32,796
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a comment on a specific item under this CPC request for appropriation, you may come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

399
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:41,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelly Catalo, 23 Salem Street in Medford.

400
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to point out a point of information.

401
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:47,936
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't make points of information, but you can give public comment.

402
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:48,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't?

403
00:36:48,877 --> 00:36:49,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, can I just speak regular?

404
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:50,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

405
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:51,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

406
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm red, I'll face it.

407
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:59,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's here because of the sales tax thing, but I get that you want some money for affordable housing.

408
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:03,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went back through from the CPA site.

409
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:03,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

410
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,732
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a great job.

411
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:15,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last seven years, they have estimatedly collected $7 million from the taxpayers in Medford, which was an extra one and a half percent that was added onto their property tax.

412
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,185
[SPEAKER_01]: They have spent $1,187,000 on housing, which is about 25%.

413
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:41,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep hearing Medford needs affordable housing, and there could have been a larger portion of that, but I'm not surprised to hear that the majority of the applications that they got were for the parks and for the recreation stuff like that Medford is most 40% conservation land.

414
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:44,498
[SPEAKER_01]: which we have Alicia to thank for protecting that.

415
00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:46,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the people of Medford love.

416
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,019
[SPEAKER_01]: They love their history.

417
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,260
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the fourth oldest English settlement in the country.

418
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:53,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, they want to protect their history.

419
00:37:54,041 --> 00:38:04,365
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not seeing applications for affordable housing, but the point of information that I want to make is that the application that came in for $69,500, it says in their request that it was for attorney fees

420
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:13,709
[SPEAKER_01]: to defend tenants that were being evicted.

421
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:19,432
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are, if you don't have the money for your rent, you're considered indigent.

422
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:25,156
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to district court, you can fill out the application and they will need an attorney of the day.

423
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,718
[SPEAKER_01]: The courthouse, and I did check this with housing attorneys today,

424
00:38:29,298 --> 00:38:34,961
[SPEAKER_01]: still has a two tier system where it's mediation before it goes into court.

425
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,502
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody's being thrown there.

426
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:42,906
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that we need $69,500 to create housing, that would be wonderful.

427
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:45,988
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that we need to be paying attorneys with it.

428
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:49,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do have the affordable housing trust right now.

429
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:59,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And cities do have the right to earmark a certain percentage of CPA funds actually above your one third if it's going to affordable housing.

430
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:03,195
[SPEAKER_01]: And this committee, your body has the right to do that.

431
00:39:04,015 --> 00:39:12,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're not seeing that it's needed now, I question if there's any need to charge the taxpayers another 2% when they sell their house as well.

432
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:13,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd ask you.

433
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:24,197
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a lot in your plate, I get it.

434
00:39:24,317 --> 00:39:39,481
[SPEAKER_01]: You have full time jobs, but before you approve this round of CPA funding, I would ask that you go back and you actually read the request from these people because $69,500, it's a lot of money to a first time buyer.

435
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:45,402
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of money to somebody that doesn't have the money to pay their mortgage because their rent's not being paid by their tenant.

436
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:47,823
[SPEAKER_01]: The homeowners in the community matter just as much.

437
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:48,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

438
00:39:52,153 --> 00:39:53,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

439
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:54,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comments?

440
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:01,040
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

441
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Any motions on the floor?

442
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:06,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins?

443
00:40:06,964 --> 00:40:08,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I would motion to report out favorably.

444
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:14,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to report the paper out of committee by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.

445
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:20,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we have a member on Zoom, all votes will be roll call votes.

446
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:22,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.
