I just wanted to, uh, I've known the Monte Cavo family for a long time and, um,

29
00:13:55,356 --> 00:14:05,480
And when you hear the news of such a wonderful anniversary of 50 years of marriage, I think it's something we should celebrate.

30
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:11,983
They've been lifelong Method residents that have been a huge part of our community.

31
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:16,505

50
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:30,497
That's a scarpelli counter saying President bears.

56
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:09,965
Council is our council living.

57
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:10,686

58
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:15,992
I'll just go Pelley counter saying, President bears, yes, affirmative, then the negative emotion.

59
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:23,881
25049 offered under suspension by Councillor Scarpelli in memory of William Billy Oganeski.

60
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:36,409
Whereas the Medford City Council is deeply saddened by the passing of William M. Billy Oganeski, a lifelong resident of Medford and devoted public servant who passed away on March 15th, 2025 at the age of 73.

61
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:47,617
And whereas Billy was a beloved husband of 51 years to Paula, a loving father to Tiffany Marino and her husband, Tori, and to Gerald and his wife, Danielle, a proud and devoted papa to Devin, Jerrica, Isabel,

62
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,291
Tori and Nathan.

63
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,603
and a caring brother, uncle, and friend to many.

64
00:16:51,904 --> 00:17:03,293
And, whereas, Billy honorably served the city of Medford at Oak Grove Cemetery for 50 years, during which time he became a familiar kind presence to many residents, forming lasting friendships and embracing the natural beauty and wildlife around him.

65
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:17,764
And, whereas, Billy found joy in the simple pleasures of life, spending time with family, tending to his garden, enjoying a good breakfast at Polar Bear Restaurant, sharing laughter, cheering on Boston sports teams, and spreading warmth and kindness to those around him.

66
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:27,967
And whereas Billy will be remembered for the most for the love he had for his grandchildren, whom he supported wholeheartedly in their endeavors, often with a smile, a kind word, and a shared chocolate chip cookie.

67
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:47,312
And whereas the passing of Billy Oganoski is a profound loss to his family, friends, colleagues, and the entire Medford community, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford City Council sends its deepest condolences to the Oganoski family and honors the life and legacy of William M. Billy Oganoski for his dedication, service, and unwavering commitment to the community he loved.

68
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,473
Thank you, Council President.

69
00:17:51,334 --> 00:18:05,921
Billy Organowski, when we talk about a marriage for 51 years, but you look at what he gave our community, 50 years of service working for the city of Medford.

70
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:15,390
I know Paula, Tiffany, and Jerry, this was a shock, a very unexpected passing.

71
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,772
Hardworking man, worked up until the day he passed.

72
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:34,196
So I think that our community lost a very good man and hardworking individual that did his job every single day and left a mark with so many people that he encountered.

73
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:48,113
send the family of the Ogonowski family condolences and that we thank Billy for his services and he should never be forgotten.

74
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:48,653
So thank you.

75
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:50,682
Thank you.

76
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:56,805
And did we have a further amendment to dedicate the cemetery way and his name?

77
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:57,385
It would be.

78
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:04,548
It would be nice to ask the mayor of the process of, um, that 51 years never had another job.

79
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:08,850
One interview he's ever had for a full time job, and he drove.

80
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:18,034
He made that ride for 51 years, and, uh, I think would be fitting, uh, for his service that we find some sort of, um,

81
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,323
respectful honor, and especially in that area.

82
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:28,149
And if we can ask the mayor and if that could be possible, I appreciate that.

83
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,390
Council President apologize.

84
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,212
No, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

85
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:34,135
I just wanted to make sure that was heard.

86
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:34,976
Councilor Sang.

87
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,381
Thank you, President Behrs.

88
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:42,025
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for introducing this under suspension.

89
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:53,214
It's always difficult when someone who has dedicated so many years, 50 years, to our city as a public servant passes away.

90
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,196
It's even more difficult when it comes as a shock.

91
00:19:57,017 --> 00:20:02,422
I want to extend my deep condolences to Billy Oganoski's family and

92
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:09,724
add my voice to the course of support to dedicate the cemetery way in his honor.

93
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:16,326
I think it's a very fitting tribute to his life of service and his work for our city.

94
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:17,186
Thank you.

95
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:19,167
Thank you.

On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

Vice President Collins.

107
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:25,295
Thank you president bears some of these topics have been discussed before this council before I've been going back and forth with the chief of staff and our parking director to try to find a date for the entire council to meet in committee of the whole about these topics with our parking director.

108
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:29,797
We landed on this date for the topic specifically the ordinance change.

109
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:32,278
that hadn't been brought up and assigned a paper number before.

110
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:53,287
I wanted to make sure that councilors had advanced notice about the matter and that we could all gather in committee of the whole to begin the discussion about the parking department's use of technology, as well as a general update about the GLX program and other parking-related updates before our next regular meeting.

111
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:54,208
Thank you.

112
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:55,989

Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:03,739
I appreciate Councilor Collins bringing this forward.

118
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:04,880
I know we talked before the meeting.

119
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:24,292
I had a resolution similar in similar fashion to have a meeting with the traffic, the new traffic commissioner, and discuss a few other important topics like the South Method G parking, get an update on that situation, the policies and procedures of

120
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:36,419
appealing a ticket and understanding the nuances for some community questions that members that have gone through a very difficult time with that.

121
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:47,761
So if we could simultaneously move those meetings together to hear both resolutions if we can, Mr. President, thank you.

00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:24,306
Great.

162
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:27,669
And we're going to try to have a further meeting on enforcement.

163
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:28,189
Great.

164
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:40,077
On the motion of Council Zahra to join and approve, seconded by Councilor Callahan, I'll go to Vice President Collins for the Planning and Permitting Committee report.

165
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:55,371
Thank you, president bears at this meeting, we reviewed a draft framework for updating the city is accessory dwelling units ordinance and we took a very first look at a zoning proposal for Medford square.

166
00:25:55,831 --> 00:26:03,493
Both of these topics will be met about again, including at the planning and permitting committee tomorrow night at 6 PM on zoom.

167
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:05,493
Thank you motion to approve.

168
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:11,646
Thank you, and on 25 or three nine committee of the whole March 18 2024 and 2025 sorry.

169
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:23,853
This was when we discussed budget recommendations, and we can see the combined budget recommendations and other budget documents in the agenda tonight.

170
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:30,517
On the motion of Council is our to join and approve seconded by counselor Callahan Mr. Clark, please call it.

171
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,919
That's Kelly and Vice President Collins.

172
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,300
Yes.

173
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:37,047
Councilor Lazaro?

174
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:37,207
Yes.

175
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:38,588
Councilor Lemming?

176
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:39,308
Yes.

177
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:40,629
Councilor Scarpelli?

178
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:40,729
Yes.

179
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:41,810
Councilor Sang?

180
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,910
Yes.

181
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:43,091
President Behrs?

182
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:43,472
Yes.

183
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:45,553
I have affirmative, no negative, the motion passes.

184
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:51,178
Hearings 25-032, proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance, 10 and 20 Revere Beach Parkway.

185
00:26:52,519 --> 00:27:04,649
The Community Development Board held a public hearing on this Wednesday, March 19th, relative to a petition by Nutter, McLennan, and Fish representing trends of real estate to amend the text of the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District.

186
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:26,862
to amend the table of dimensional standards in section E, to add a footnote regarding front yard setbacks that coincide with restrictions for public agency buildings, to change the incentive bonus from certified to certifiable for LEED status, and to amend the definition section to add clarifying text to the definition of building coverage.

187
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,694
to make it clear that it doesn't include building overhangs.

188
00:27:31,474 --> 00:27:37,216
A subsequent public hearing will be held on the same matter by the Medford City Council on March 25th, 2025 at 7 p.m.

189
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:43,779
in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.

190
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,060
A link to the public hearing will be posted no later than March 21st, 2025.

191
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,201
Signed, Adam Herdeby, City Clerk.

192
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:54,062
We did get a memo back from Community Development Board.

193
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:55,583
They have recommended

194
00:27:57,564 --> 00:28:07,014
Approval, but they did unanimously 60 recommended approval of the zoning amendment with the following recommended revision to the definition of building coverage to be incorporated.

195
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:16,195
And that reads as follows, building coverage, the maximum area of the lot that can be attributed to the footprint of the building's principle and accessory on that lot.

196
00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:19,097
Building coverage does not include surface parking.

197
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:24,441
Building coverage also does not include any portion of the building above the ground floor that overhangs such ground floor.

198
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:31,807
If the overhang does not exceed 10% of the footprint of the ground floor of the building, then the overhang is not part of the calculation of the building coverage.

199
00:28:31,907 --> 00:28:34,970
Overhangs greater than 10% are counted as part of the building coverage.

200
00:28:36,438 --> 00:28:44,788
And with that, I will open the public hearing to comments for, against, or in any other way on this project.

201
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:55,101
And I noticed we have counsel from Nutter, McLennan, and Fish here, if you'd like to share anything and speak in favor, I'm assuming, of the project.

202
00:28:56,947 --> 00:29:01,310
Yes, thank you very much and thank you all for your time and considering the proposed amendment.

203
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:07,794
I'm Valerie more of Narva Clinton and fish 155 support Boulevard in Boston for the record.

204
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:19,962
We worked with the Community Development Board to propose a slight modification to the language as President bears read to further clarify the limits on building overhangs.

205
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:25,786
And with that, we are in agreement with the proposed language that's set forth in the report.

206
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:30,889
So with that, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about the proposed language.

207
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:32,170
Thank you.

208
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,190
Do we have any questions?

209
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:38,194
Seeing none, I know we've already heard from you once here, so thank you.

210
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,396
I'll open it up again to anyone else who'd like to speak.

211
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:50,602
As part of this public hearing in favor in opposition or otherwise you can come to the podium, or raise your hand on zoom and I will recognize you.

212
00:29:50,622 --> 00:30:05,013
All right, seeing none of the coin the public hearing closed.

213
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:14,208
On the motion to approve by Councillor Callahan, seconded by Councillor Sang.

214
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,349

215
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:17,709

216
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:28,174
Mr. Clerk.

217
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:30,375
Just right.

218
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:30,535
Okay.

219

223
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:44,374
Yes.

224
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:45,857
Councilor Lemming?

225
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:46,638
Yes.

226
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,260
Councilor Scarpelli?

227
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,360
Yes.

228
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:50,643
Councilor Sang?

229
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:50,724
Yes.

230
00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:52,166
President Behrs?

231
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:52,466
Yes.

232
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,629
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

233
00:30:56,993 --> 00:31:00,294
Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

234

25045, Appeal of a Signed Permit Refusal, 42 Fulbright Street.

242
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:49,115
And I will recognize the petitioner.

243
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:50,275
Name and address for the record, please.

244
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:57,452
Good evening Councilor Bayer, City Councilors, Kathleen A. Desmond, 335 Main Street Stoneham, lower office of Kathleen A. Desmond.

245
00:31:57,812 --> 00:32:04,014
I'm here this evening on behalf of in Realty Medford LLC and Scrub-A-Dub Auto Wash Centers.

246
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:16,758
I did provide you, I know that the package is at home, but really there's 10 pages that deal with the issues themselves and then the remainder exhibits.

247
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:30,774
We had, we had dealt with some of the issues previously with the former building commissioner as to use in special permit whether it was a pre existing non conforming use or a special permit use.

248
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:32,896
So I wanted you to have that.

249
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:41,979
that submission that we had submitted to the building commissioner at the time, and that's probably about half of what you have before you.

250
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,940
There's essentially two issues in this regard.

251
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:56,102
The first is relative to notice of the denial and the sufficiency of the denial that was issued by the building department.

252
00:32:56,822 --> 00:33:03,404
And the second issue is the more substantive issue that deals with whether or not this was an abandoned

253
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:04,344
use.

254
00:33:05,004 --> 00:33:22,270
The commissioner had determined, I believe, based on what we have, although the site isn't specific, that because the car wash had been out of use for two years, he determined it to be out of use for two years, that the sign

255
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,692
which was a nonconforming structure associated with the use, was also abandoned.

256
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:30,272
We had gone through a lot of this.

257
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:37,275
And just by way of background, 42 Fulbright Street is a 12,716 square foot parcel of land.

258
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,776
It sits at the end of Fulbright Street, adjacent to Route 93.

259
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:42,336
It's a very small strip of land.

260
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:50,419
The double-sided pylon sign sits on the southeasterly portion of the lot and is approximately 31.9 feet in height.

261
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:59,567
and 100 square feet in the sign face itself.

262
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:01,468
It's a 10 by 10 sign.

263
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:07,555
The existing sign is readily visible from Route 93 and somewhat visible from Mystic Avenue.

264
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:11,999
But honestly, with all the construction and the work that is going on in the buildings that are anticipated,

265
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:24,931
in that specific area, the sign is not visible, and if it were reduced in size, it's unclear whether you could even see the sign from Mystic Avenue.

266
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:36,743
You would be able to see it from 93, which would show the location, but it would be smaller, and the roofing of Scrub-a-Dub may also be in the way based on where the sign is situated.

267
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:41,705
The application, as I said, to reface, and that's all that was intended in this case.

268
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:45,986
So there was no intent to change the structure of the sign at all.

269
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:53,209
It was simply to take out the plastic panels which are in the existing sign and replace the Minuteman

270
00:34:54,869 --> 00:35:12,180
Minuteman sign with the scrub-a-dub sign, which I provided in your materials, the Barron Chevrolet case, which indicates that even if this were a non-conforming pre-existing structure, that this is not a change or an alteration to that structure.

271
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:18,665
It's simply refacing the sign, the identification of the language within the sign panel.

272
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:26,049
such as if you had a Dunkin' Donuts and it was changed to a Starbucks, it's only changing the interfacing of the sign.

273
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:34,213
There were two separate issues outlined in the memorandum that I filed with council as to abandonment.

274
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:39,236
The first being that this car was granted a special permit in 1966.

275
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:46,100
And there were no conditions associated with that permit that would limit the duration.

276
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,304
of the special permit.

277
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:57,231
And so the two-year abandonment rule with respect to a pre-existing non-conforming

278
00:35:57,968 --> 00:35:59,788
structure would not apply.

279
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:02,409
And I put two cases in there.

280
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:08,831
The Cumberland Farms case, which distinguishes between a special permit and a non-conforming use.

281
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:24,574
And then the Labisser Building Corp case, which I think is very much on point because that was a condominium development where they initiated the first phase of the condominium within the two years required under Chapter 48, Section 9.

282
00:36:24,914 --> 00:36:27,135
But then there was a 17-year lapse in time

283
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:46,151
When that first phase of the development was initiated to when they continued development, and the court indicated in that case that we have a special permit with no conditions, as long as they satisfy the chapter 48 section nine, two year requirement of beginning.

284
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:55,615
construction or taking some activity on the special permit within two years of it first being granted, that the 17-year lapse has no impact whatsoever.

285
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:58,717
And that's not what we're talking about here.

286
00:36:59,657 --> 00:37:08,061
This is a case where, and we didn't have the affidavit of Peter Silk at the time we submitted to building because it was Christmas time.

287
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:12,743
They didn't have any ability to get ahold of him.

288
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:23,126
He did eventually return their call and I produced an affidavit to the council, which shows that it had been operational up until December 31 of 2021.

289
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:28,411
It goes through his affidavit goes through the fact that there was a fire in 2018 late in 2018, which closed the premises for a while.

290
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:50,868
At that point, they brought it back up and they were operating and then I think people sometimes forget or want to put it out of their minds that there was a thing called COVID, which happened in 2020, which might explain why there wasn't any activity from

291
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:59,611
from a late 2019 to 2020, the summer of 2020, because many car washes were shut down.

292
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:05,733
And in his affidavit, he indicates that he complied with the city of Medford's requirements that he remained in a shutdown.

293
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:10,915
He did open up again after that per his affidavit and continued business.

294
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:16,177
It was less than what it had been pre-COVID, but I think that happened to a lot of businesses.

295
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:19,659
And he ceased operations of the,

296
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,484
of the car wash itself on December 31st, except for washing, you know, friends' cars and whatnot.

297
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:37,529
But at that time, and his affidavit indicates that, and I've provided you with a copy of the listing agreement, he listed the property for sale in March of 2022.

298
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:43,413
And in that listing also included the sign and the,

299
00:38:45,598 --> 00:38:53,320
the building itself and I believe that was provided to the, to the building department the listing itself is evidence that there was some continuation.

300
00:38:54,561 --> 00:39:06,984
And then my clients purchased the property in September of 22, and they, they filed after that permits in order to renovate the project, and we had worked with

301
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:20,395
the prior building commissioner from I think October of 2022, we eventually we had gone through all these issues again with whether this was a special permit or a pre-existing non-conforming use.

302
00:39:20,756 --> 00:39:29,823
And you know they can't be both because it's either allowed by special permit or it's something that's not allowed by the ordinance or the statute at all.

303
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:30,544
So

304
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:46,236
And then I provided to you as well the case of, let me just find the case, Stone J. Fitch, which is in your materials, which deals with abandonment and non-use.

305
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:59,245
And that case clearly indicates that the definition of abandonment and non-use is, let me get that, generally non-use,

306
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:07,515
of a non-conforming structure requires both vacancy and the lack of any attempt to rent, sell, or maintain the structure.

307
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:10,236
So in this case, it's clearly a continuum.

308
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,517
He operated the business until December 31st.

309
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:19,359
March, he put that, March of the following year, March 22, he put the building up for sale.

310
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,741
And also, and the sign was part of that listing.

311
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:26,462
The sale went through on September of 2022.

312
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:27,602
And from that point,

313
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:36,691
my client undertook the permitting process to renovate that building and put it back into a car wash.

314
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:54,806
So although I don't believe that this is a pre-existing use and that that whole analysis does not apply because it was a special permit and the use does not lapse, I think that even if you looked at it as a pre-existing non-conforming use,

315
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,459
that this hasn't been abandoned.

316
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:11,049
And certainly there hasn't been two years between the time of, there isn't actually any span of time which it wasn't in use.

317
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:15,572
The building inspector determined that he couldn't find anything that would indicate

318
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:18,876
that the use extended beyond 2019.

319
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:33,330
But we did have at that time Yelp reviews which I provided to the building department, and I also provided fiscal year 2022 records of not only real estate taxes but also

320
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:41,578
personal property taxes that were paid by the business, which would indicate that there was equipment that was in there which was being utilized.

321
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:52,250
As I said, we didn't have the affidavit of Peter Silk at that point because we hadn't been able to make contact with him, but we did make contact with him and he provided

322
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:53,563
the affidavit.

323
00:41:54,524 --> 00:42:01,832
I think after I also received notice that there was a contract in fact with the Medford Police Department to wash cars that extended beyond 2019.

324
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:14,186
So, you know, this isn't a situation where there's an abandoned use and, and, you know, my client simply just wants to change the facing of the sign to change the name from

325
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:17,683
minute man car wash to scrub a job.

326
00:42:19,184 --> 00:42:37,977
With regard to the second issue and and notice, I detailed it in my memorandum but essentially, the ordinance requires 6.2 point six requires that there be specific provisions, which are denied, and and that that you have notices to what is actually being

327
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:39,098
denied.

328
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:45,603
And none of the information that we received gave a specific denial with specific sections.

329
00:42:45,683 --> 00:42:57,594
And in fact, it varied somewhat from the January 8th when it was clear that this was a denial because there are emails within which indicate that there hadn't been a formal denial.

330
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:01,437
January 8th, they received an email that it had been denied.

331
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:15,587
But again, there were different sections cited in that as opposed to what, what was received from community development and there was no formal denial issue by the building department on this.

332
00:43:16,148 --> 00:43:19,150
And the only denial that I have is that January 8 where it was clear.

333
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:28,839
that we weren't trying to converse in terms of what what we had in terms of evidence that in fact this was a continuing operation but that it was denied.

334
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:35,205
So, that's the second argument that the denial doesn't meet the requirements of the ordinance.

335
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:41,411
And, you know, I appealed on January 8 because it was clear at that point that it was a denial from the building department.

336
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,153
So that is, in essence, what our case is.

337
00:43:50,014 --> 00:43:56,899
When we went through the Zoning Board of Appeals case, there was never, at that point, an issue discussed as to abandonment.

338
00:43:56,919 --> 00:44:03,605
The issue at that point was, is this a sleepy car wash going to a more

339
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:11,063
more active car wash, and does that require some modification of a special permit?

340
00:44:11,663 --> 00:44:21,550
And that's where we got into the discussion with the prior building commissioner, Bill Forde, and that memo you have to him.

341
00:44:22,991 --> 00:44:25,173
And the sign was always included within our plans.

342
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:28,923
Thank you, Kathy.

343
00:44:29,184 --> 00:44:32,546
I'll go to Councillor Scarpelli, then I have a couple of questions of other Councillors.

344
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,127
I'll go to Councillor Scarpelli, other Councillors, then I have a couple of questions.

345
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:35,867
Councillor Scarpelli.

346
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:36,828
Thank you, Mr. President.

347
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:37,748
I thank Ms.

348
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:38,849
Desmond for being here tonight.

349
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:50,196
You make a compelling case, but unfortunately, like I told you, I've reached out to the building department and I'm trying to get some legal support.

350
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:57,220
Unfortunately, this Council, none of us have a legal background yet.

351
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,673
Unless Justin can hurry up and get over with it.

352
00:45:02,294 --> 00:45:03,976
But that school's very difficult.

353
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:06,118
Can I scare him straight?

354
00:45:06,158 --> 00:45:14,769
Yeah, so I think that ultimately, you know, tabling this motion until we get some legal contact from

355
00:45:18,312 --> 00:45:35,408
the mayor's legal teams to assist us with any questions we have, because right now, I'd have to support building departments as the professionals in this entity, but I don't want to rule on something without the proper knowledge or understanding.

356
00:45:35,448 --> 00:45:39,992
So my recommendation that we table this, Mr. President, until we have legal

357
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:42,826
legal response.

358
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:47,691
Um, what Mrs with Miss Desmond has, uh, shared with us.

359
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:48,913
So thank you.

360
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:51,155
Got it.

361
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,158
Um, any further discussion second on the motion?

362
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:55,880
Councilor Callahan.

363
00:45:58,883 --> 00:45:59,103
Thanks.

364
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,926
Um, I'm gonna say something somewhat similar.

365
00:46:02,207 --> 00:46:02,287
Um,

366
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:05,350
This is not our specialty.

367
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,754
We have a building department that it is their specialty.

368
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:13,220
I don't quite understand why this has come to us.

369
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:15,923
It seems like

370
00:46:17,247 --> 00:46:26,530
at a minimum, like, I don't know if this is the proper process that like, at some point, if we are the appeal authority, we are the final authority.

371
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:26,770
Great.

372
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:35,994
I think having, you know, the someone from the building department here would be incredibly helpful to understand the final issue.

373
00:46:36,934 --> 00:46:40,995
You know, I have not read any word in this large town.

374
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:41,575
So

375
00:46:44,598 --> 00:46:47,940
On the face of it, I mean, you just want to change the sign.

376
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,401
It seems pretty reasonable.

377
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:52,343
But again, this is not our specialty.

378
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:55,025
We are not the people who normally do this.

379
00:46:55,065 --> 00:47:03,250
So I would at least want to have at least a little someone from the building department chime in to understand why have they not approved this.

380
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:03,931
So thank you.

381
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:07,273
Thank you.

382
00:47:09,683 --> 00:47:11,145
I just had a couple questions.

383
00:47:12,447 --> 00:47:17,274
One, I know that the sales now about two and a half, three years.

384
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,520
Have they done any construction at the site.

385
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:39,576
So what's happened is they had issues with national grid and lines had to be moved in order to do that we didn't finish the permitting process probably until I want to say, July or September of 2023, and then they had some issues they did their permitting.

386
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:59,332
submitted for a building permit they have a building permit, but they're delayed and actually I think they're just starting demolition today because National Grid had to move some poles and order them for them to bring in the equipment that they needed to do when they had to do a design of the of the project before that so it was an extended period of time, Matt.

387
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:10,048
Matt is on, Matt Paisner is on Zoom, and he can probably better explain to you what the delays have been in moving forward.

388
00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:12,549
I'll ask you to unmute.

389
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,051
If you could just give us your name and address for the record, please.

390
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:20,814
Matthew Paisner, 17 Commerce Ave, Newton, Massachusetts.

391
00:48:21,755 --> 00:48:26,216
It's my home address, Scrub-A-Dub headquarters, 172 Worcester Street, Natick, Massachusetts.

392
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:30,517
Obviously this property is to Fulbright Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

393
00:48:30,977 --> 00:48:32,578
Not sure which address you needed, sorry.

394
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:35,258
And any of those was fine.

395
00:48:36,118 --> 00:48:36,658
Thank you.

396
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,459
I'm a third generation family business owner in Scrub-A-Dub.

397
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:48,481
As Kathy alluded to, we acquired this property shortly after the Silk family listed it for sale.

398
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:51,262
Peter Silk is a fourth generation car washer.

399
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:58,345
He closed the business and listed it for sale a couple months later and we bought it.

400
00:48:58,986 --> 00:49:03,608
I went through a very lengthy permitting process with the former Building Commissioner Forte.

401
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:13,313
Our plan was initially to demolish the entire structure and we were not allowed to do that, so we had to work through plans to remodel the existing structure.

402
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:17,075
We invested over $3 million to buy a 12,000 square foot

403
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:24,541
parcel, partly due to the iconic pylon sign, which is a landmark off the highway.

404
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:34,531
Our vision is simply to renovate and restore the car wash to its former glory and give the city a beautiful car wash like it deserves.

405
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:35,292
So after we

406
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:48,969
were approved with the zoning board and all of our plans did include a copy of the existing pylon sign, which I can share, just showing that we were changing the face from Minuteman Car Wash to Scrub-a-Dub Car Wash.

407
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:59,034
In fact, there's bold annotations on all the site plans reviewed by the former building commissioner and the zoning board that says protect existing pylon sign in its current format.

408
00:49:59,055 --> 00:50:02,376
Simply replace the plastic panel inside that says Minuteman to Scrub-a-Dub.

409
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:18,651
We went to go for our building permit and we were bringing in contractors and the subcontractors were not able to bring in certain equipment needed for demolition due to power lines that were too close to the building.

410
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:27,994
It took us over a year and close to $100,000 with National Grid to get them to move those power lines and adjust some poles.

411
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:30,975
We've just installed construction fencing this week.

412
00:50:31,873 --> 00:50:35,716
and we're looking to start our demolition and construction as soon as possible.

413
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:48,024
It was a major surprise to our family when we submitted our sign permit package and we were given notice that all of a sudden the pylon sign was being viewed as abandoned.

414
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,327
The sign was in fact even left on from the time that

415
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:57,130
Peter Silk closed the business to the time that we acquired it and we continued to leave it on.

416
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,832
And so this was a huge surprise.

417
00:50:59,892 --> 00:51:04,775
And then as Kathy alluded to, we were never given any formal denial letter or notice.

418
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:07,776
Kathy did represent us with the Zoning Board of Appeals.

419
00:51:08,237 --> 00:51:12,339
So we engaged her again on this matter to say, hey, we know there's a new building commissioner.

420
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,801
We're not sure if there's a misunderstanding or what's going on here.

421
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:21,265
But we spent a lot of money on this property and planned on keeping the existing sign in place.

422
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:22,887
So.

423
00:51:27,149 --> 00:51:27,569
Thank you.

424
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:30,010
I appreciate that context.

425
00:51:34,452 --> 00:51:38,895
It looks like there's some improvements to the private way as part of the site plan as well.

426
00:51:41,328 --> 00:51:51,192
Well it's, there's improvements to the, how it, it works in terms of traffic and whatnot I don't recall.

427
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:59,535
Yeah, right and the parking is not because you can park on the private way so we had, we had an extended discussion during that whole site plan about the whole use and

428
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:03,597
and the parking and all of that that came into this.

429
00:52:03,877 --> 00:52:23,229
And I know, you know, I don't have a note specific, but I know that there was a question at one point as to what was happening with the sign, and it was only that we were, you know, taking the plastic out and putting new plastic in, which under the Barron Chevrolet case is not even a change of structure or anything that would extend to an alteration.

430
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:23,769
Yeah.

431
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:24,650
Okay.

432
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:28,252
Any further questions by members of the Council?

433
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:32,925
It was the motion of counselors.

434
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:34,226
I mean, my two senses.

435
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:43,332
We could, and no offense Kathy, we could pay lawyers more money to talk about the sign more, but I don't think we're really going to get.

436
00:52:45,294 --> 00:52:48,176
It seems to me that we're just changing out the name of the car wash on a sign.

437
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:53,500
And so my, my perspective is that I don't have a problem with that.

438
00:52:54,441 --> 00:53:00,165
But we do have a motion by Councilor Scarpelli to table pending for the legal review.

439
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:02,556
Councilor Callahan.

440
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:11,967
I guess my first question is, if this waits a week or two is that gonna be horrible like is there some is there some great urgency.

441
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:19,007
No, I don't have any issue with what the city council decides to do.

442
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:24,111
I don't think I raised that as an issue, no.

443
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:25,252
Great, awesome.

444
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:31,797
Yeah, I'm just saying we could go to KP Law and we could pay them to give us an answer, but that's just my perspective.

445
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:33,579
Okay.

446
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:45,229
The motion by Councilor Scavaglia was to table, I think it was for legal review by the legal, the mayor's legal team, which is KP.

447
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,830
Do we wanna adjust that?

448
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:52,031
Do we wanna include the first, just get something from the building department?

449
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,832
Sorry, let me just unmute you, George.

450
00:53:56,973 --> 00:53:59,073
That's my confusion, building department ruled on it.

451
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,414
That's in their brief.

452
00:54:01,494 --> 00:54:05,615
So I'm not saying that I don't agree with, I don't agree or disagree with them,

453
00:54:06,372 --> 00:54:13,838
Unfortunately, we don't have a city solicitor, and unfortunately, we do have to pay an outside legal team to answer some of our questions.

454
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:25,367
If my fellow counselors would move on that, that's their purview, but I really think that it's still strong that we need legal, not that I don't trust or respect you, Ms.

455
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:25,727
Desmond.

456
00:54:27,513 --> 00:54:29,314
I work for the city of Medford and that's great.

457
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:31,895
Department works for us for the city.

458
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,436
So I think it's important that we do get a legal response.

459
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:42,999
Um, we've spent a lot of money on frivolous, uh, law questions for many, many years here.

460
00:54:43,419 --> 00:54:51,962
And, uh, I, I feel council president bears his philosophy on, um, giving KP law any more money than we don't have to.

461
00:54:52,721 --> 00:55:12,650
I think that it leaves us with, without a city solicitor, it leaves us with the only option, which is to have our legal team to make sure that what was provided with our building department and what you provided us gives us a better understanding so we can make the proper decision.

462
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:18,673
So, like I said, if it's two weeks, we wait for our next city council meeting.

463
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:21,975
Hopefully we have an answer and we move on this as quickly as possible.

464
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:24,470
scrub-a-dub can start working.

465
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,473
So I know Councilor Beza's car is filthy and he's been waiting for it to open.

466
00:55:29,914 --> 00:55:32,956
I can't wait to go through either.

467
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,597
So I understand his frustration.

468
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:35,437
So thank you.

469
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:39,260
Councilor Lemming.

470
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:47,105
I was just gonna say that I would side with Councilor Scarpelli on this one.

471
00:55:47,145 --> 00:55:51,248
I think that there is, it would be appropriate to get some

472
00:55:52,795 --> 00:55:56,278
legal review from the city side on this.

473
00:55:57,118 --> 00:56:10,247
I didn't hear if his motion had a second or not, because on Zoom, I don't hear anybody unless they turn their microphone on, but if there hasn't been a second, I'd like to second that.

474
00:56:13,128 --> 00:56:15,630
What did we just say?

475
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,911
Oh, all right.

476
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:20,013
I'll go to Councilor Saint and Councilor Callahan.

477
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:31,933
Um, um, I would support going to the building departments first seeing if they have an opinion on this for their ruling, their opinion is in here.

478
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:35,496
It's just that it doesn't meet the current size of the sign ordinance.

479
00:56:35,536 --> 00:56:43,023
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if they have something more about it, because I think that there is compelling enough case law to challenge that.

480
00:56:43,103 --> 00:56:44,364
So, okay.

481
00:56:44,945 --> 00:56:45,605
Yeah, I mean,

482
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:52,100
for clarifying that we are in fact the appropriate body for this to come to after the building department.

483
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,544
Given that, I would actually prefer rather than paying the, I don't think we need to pay a legal team.

484
00:56:57,604 --> 00:57:07,872
I think that we want to honestly hear from the building department and whether they show up here or whether, you know, at the thing so we can ask them questions or whether, you know, we can have an understanding.

485
00:57:07,953 --> 00:57:12,136
Like, I read it and it's like, they just want to change what's on the side.

486
00:57:12,156 --> 00:57:17,220
Like, it seems like a no-brainer and I just want to understand from the building department, like, why is it that

487
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:23,763
They can't like I've read the legalese, but like I would love to have the building department chime in.

488
00:57:23,903 --> 00:57:32,596
I don't think we need the law offices particularly but I'm going to go to Kathy in just a second but I've talked to Scott not about this specifically but.

489
00:57:33,357 --> 00:57:44,706
I think he's saying because they're saying that it's an expired special permit and not a pre-existing non-conforming use, that because it is a sign that is bigger than the signs allowed by the sign ordinance, he's required to deny it.

490
00:57:45,186 --> 00:57:47,348
That's how I'm reading what is presented here.

491
00:57:47,368 --> 00:57:49,189
And ultimately, that's a legal issue.

492
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:51,871
I don't know where the expired special permit comes from.

493
00:57:51,931 --> 00:57:56,615
And I've provided cases which indicate that, in fact, you have a 17 year span before a

494
00:57:57,055 --> 00:58:04,217
a development, as long as you meet the section nine, you start action within two years of approval of the special permit.

495
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:14,881
If there's no conditions and I think that's every special permit has conditions now, but in 1966, there were no conditions on that special permit as to duration or activity

496
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:23,969
or anything, and because that is the case and that's the best for case that if there's no conditions, then there's no conditions on the special permit.

497
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,974
So it's our position isn't it's a legal position that it's not expired.

498
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:36,060
But yeah, I think either we can just go forward or we have to go to the legal, I think that's kind of where we're at.

499
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,722
So we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli.

500
00:58:38,676 --> 00:58:48,380
to table this and request legal review of the petition, seconded by Councilor Lemming, and I will go to Councilor Singh.

501
00:58:49,241 --> 00:59:05,328
Since you've had more conversations about this, just to that one point, just what you said before, I think I would feel comfortable voting on it tonight because I think this is, you know, it's just a sign that's already there.

502
00:59:06,634 --> 00:59:10,836
All they want is this permit.

503
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:17,478
And I don't think this changes the manner, the purpose, or the effect of the sign.

504
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:26,421
And that's my stance on it, rather than pay lawyers to discuss this even more and to end up in a very similar place in two weeks.

505
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:28,081
So that's my view on it.

506
00:59:28,582 --> 00:59:29,582
But I understand.

507
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:39,907
Um, the desire to table and, um, I think just just to save us money, I'll vote no on tabling and yes on the question if it gets that.

508
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:41,408
All right.

509
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:48,974
We have the motion and second of Councilor Scarapelli and Councilor Lemming to table and refer to legal for review of the petition.

510
00:59:49,854 --> 00:59:50,755
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

511
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:53,777
Councilor Callahan.

512
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:56,839
Vice President Collins.

513
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:57,540
Yes.

514
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:00,979
Councilor Lazaro?

515
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:01,760
Yes.

516
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:03,601
Councilor Lemming?

517
01:00:04,161 --> 01:00:04,421
Yes.

518
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:06,822
Councilor Scarpelli?

519
01:00:07,282 --> 01:00:07,482
Yes.

520
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:08,623
Councilor Sang?

521
01:00:08,643 --> 01:00:08,683
No.

522
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:10,404
President Behrs?

523
01:00:10,604 --> 01:00:10,824
No.

524
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:12,525
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

525
01:00:12,705 --> 01:00:16,366
The motion passes and is tabled pending your review.

526
01:00:17,687 --> 01:00:18,708
Thank you for your patience tonight.

527
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:19,088
Thank you.

528
01:00:19,168 --> 01:00:21,729
And you only have to read the first 10 pages and then look at what you want.

529
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:38,818
25040 offered by Vice President Collins resolution in support of the full time lecturers at Tufts University and their fight for a fair contract.

530
01:00:39,658 --> 01:00:41,400
Let me get the actual language here.

531
01:00:43,775 --> 01:01:00,713
Whereas the 125 full-time lecturers in the School of Arts and Sciences at Tufts have been unionized with SEIU 509 since 2016 and have been bargaining for their third contract since April 2024, seeking a fair contract that allows for both livable salaries and manageable workloads.

532
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:17,699
Whereas FTLs at Tufts create and teach classes, grade exams, advise and mentor students, and perform essential services that keep Tufts running, including, in the case of many FTLs, coordinating academic programs, directing graduate admissions and degrees, and supporting extra and co-curricular activities.

533
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:27,802
And whereas Tufts University prides itself on the high-quality educational experience provided to students, and valuing a quality educational experience means investing in teachers,

534
01:01:28,741 --> 01:01:51,381
And whereas lectures working conditions are students learning environments, and whereas the cost of living has increased 21% since 2020, while the average FTL salary has increased only 13.1%, and salaries for FTLs at Tufts ranked 12th out of 13 university among its institutional peers in the integrated post-secondary education data system IPEDS, and

535
01:01:52,222 --> 01:02:04,087
Whereas from 2019 to 2023, undergraduate enrollment in the School of Arts and Sciences grew by 12.4%, while full-time faculty growth was only 6.4%, leading to FTLs increasingly being overworked.

536
01:02:05,068 --> 01:02:20,335
And whereas Tufts promises a student-faculty ratio of 9 to 1 and an average class size of approximately 20, while in reality, many entry-level courses taught by FTLs have enrollments between 100 and 400 students, in which FTLs often serve as informal and formal advisors.

537
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:46,139
and whereas Tufts University charges undergraduates the highest college tuition in Massachusetts and the fifth highest in the country and reported a $34 million surplus in the School of Arts and Sciences in academic year 2023-2024, and whereas Tufts leadership has continued to offer bargaining proposals that prioritize budget austerity over workers' health and livelihoods and has continued to reject proposals to increase salaries

538
01:02:47,022 --> 01:02:52,787
and make modest improvements in the direction of a living wage without adding to the burden of already unmanageable workloads.

539
01:02:53,487 --> 01:03:10,622
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support the Tufts University Full-Time Lecturers Union, SEIU 509, and call upon Tufts University to prioritize investing in its teachers because both livable wages and sustainable workloads are essential to workers and to the university more broadly.

540
01:03:11,202 --> 01:03:12,143
Vice President Collins.

541
01:03:13,497 --> 01:03:17,260
Thank you president bears for reading out the full text of the resolution.

542
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:30,331
I'm glad to have collaborated with members of 509 on this resolution and I thank them for bringing their fight for a fair contract to our attention.

543
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:38,159
I was talking about this resolution with some community members before the meeting and over the weekend and they said, you know, why is this a Medford issue?

544
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:43,244
And to that I say, you know, Tufts is a huge employer in our community.

545
01:03:43,565 --> 01:03:46,247
So many members of our community are involved with Tufts.

546
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,531
In various ways, perhaps they work at Tufts or teach at Tufts.

547
01:03:50,032 --> 01:03:51,974
Tufts is a major employer in our community.

548
01:03:52,014 --> 01:03:53,817
It has a major footprint in our community.

549
01:03:53,837 --> 01:04:00,866
And when it comes to fair employment, fair wages, and the right to collectively bargain, this is a rising tide lifts all boats issue.

550
01:04:02,307 --> 01:04:23,533
And with a large, ostensibly non-for-profit that is such an outsized presence and an outsized footprint in our community, I think it's the least that we can do to say we must participate in holding you accountable to treating all workers with fairness, and at the very least, participating in good faith with efforts to collectively bargain.

551
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:29,095
Our relationship with Tufts University and the city of Medford overlaps in many ways.

552
01:04:31,015 --> 01:04:39,099
We've spoken at length in these chambers about the payment in lieu of tax agreement that the city of Medford has with Tufts.

553
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:59,288
What we are talking about is a very large, extremely well-endowed, very powerful institution that absolutely has the resources to pay its workers commensurate with their value, to pay them competitively, and to pay them so that they can comfortably live in this community.

554
01:05:00,088 --> 01:05:12,633
And so I hope that my fellow councillors will join me tonight in urging them to do just that and to engage in a good faith negotiation process with these essential Tufts University workers.

555
01:05:13,433 --> 01:05:24,138
But more importantly, I understand that there are a couple members of the bargaining unit that are attending the city council meeting tonight, and I'm sure that they can speak to their efforts much more eloquently than I could.

556
01:05:24,498 --> 01:05:24,738
Thank you.

557
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:30,768
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

558
01:05:30,868 --> 01:05:33,109
Any comments from members of the Council at this time?

559
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:38,971
Councilor Scarpelli.

560
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:40,372
One second.

561
01:05:40,412 --> 01:05:40,772
There you go.

562
01:05:41,352 --> 01:05:42,132
Thank you, Mr. President.

563
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:44,013
Thank you, Vice President Collins, for bringing this forward.

564
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:50,695
I think that we know the support of this Council supports all of our unions, and bringing this forward is so important, but I would

565
01:05:51,988 --> 01:05:57,129
recommend or I would I would request that we amend this resolution.

566
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:05,011
I received a bunch of phone calls today after members of our workforce here in method read this resolution.

567
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:16,394
And if we could amend it to also read that that the City Council support the city administration priorities, municipal unions that have been working without a contract for some over three years.

568
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:17,934
I think that

569
01:06:18,513 --> 01:06:40,758
as we're talking with one breath, a city entity that we're going to support and making sure that there's fair wages, which I totally support a thousand percent, but I would also in the same breath, keep our municipal workers that are working without a contract in the forefront along with this resolution.

570
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:43,199
If you could, Mr. President, thank you.

571
01:06:44,259 --> 01:06:45,599
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

572
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,020
Any further comments by members of the council?

573
01:06:49,935 --> 01:06:52,377
Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

574
01:06:53,919 --> 01:07:00,385
You provide your name and address for the record at the podium, raise your hand on Zoom, and you'll have three minutes.

575
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:04,562
All right, thank you so much for considering this resolution.

576
01:07:04,622 --> 01:07:08,626
My name is Helen McCreary, 200 College Ave, Medford, 02155.

577
01:07:09,627 --> 01:07:15,133
So I'm a full-time lecturer in the biology department at Tufts.

578
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:18,056
This is my third year at that job.

579
01:07:18,156 --> 01:07:22,220
I'm here tonight because the status quo at Tufts is simply not working for lecturers.

580
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:29,546
As you know, or as you may know, we've been negotiating for almost a year to gain a livable wage and a reasonable workload.

581
01:07:29,566 --> 01:07:32,969
I'm going to talk very briefly about each of those issues, starting with workload.

582
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:38,413
Right now, I am teaching 480 students in one introductory biology course.

583
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:44,237
This is bigger than that course has ever been, in large part because the number of students has been increasing, as you've heard.

584
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:46,518
Last year, I had 430 students.

585
01:07:46,539 --> 01:07:47,779
That was also a record.

586
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:58,967
The increase in the number of students and the tuition dollars coming to Tufts has not been matched by an adequate increase in support provided for the learning of those students.

587
01:07:59,908 --> 01:08:10,296
So I simply cannot provide the kind of education that I want to, the kind of education that's promised by Tufts, and that Tufts students' tuition ought to pay for when I have that many students in my course.

588
01:08:11,036 --> 01:08:18,642
In the fall semester as a whole, the roughly 120 lecturers in the School of Arts and Sciences taught a total of about 10,000 students in their courses.

589
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:23,927
The top notch education that Tufts is known for is delivered largely on our backs.

590
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:28,646
But my colleagues that have a lot much smaller courses are just as overworked.

591
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:34,087
By teaching, they often teach, they generally teach more courses at a time and also by other responsibilities.

592
01:08:34,507 --> 01:08:35,647
Our work is not just teaching.

593
01:08:36,168 --> 01:08:40,068
Over the next two weeks, I'll be meeting individually, personally with 30 students.

594
01:08:40,108 --> 01:08:47,770
My advisees about the courses they're going to take in the fall, that's 30 meetings over the next two weeks on top of all of my other regular meetings, teaching and responsibilities.

595
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:54,672
Written 23 letters of recommendation for students so far this year, have more outstanding that I need to write, more requests coming in.

596
01:08:55,352 --> 01:09:03,799
We serve on committees within our departments across the university where we provide all sorts of formal and informal advising and mentorship coordinate programs, etc.

597
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:11,005
So my main point is that we provide us with a ton of valuable labor, and I am talking about monetary value.

598
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:13,581
It's no secret Tufts tuition is high.

599
01:09:13,661 --> 01:09:17,945
The all-in cost of attendance for this year is over $92,000.

600
01:09:18,145 --> 01:09:22,289
That's a lot more money than I make per year, by the way.

601
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:29,536
So with all these courses and students that lecturers teach, we are bringing in a huge portion of that money.

602
01:09:30,217 --> 01:09:35,301
And most Tufts lecturers can't afford to live in Medford or other nearby communities.

603
01:09:36,568 --> 01:09:37,829
I live nearby, in fact.

604
01:09:37,949 --> 01:09:39,689
My commute is less than 15 minutes.

605
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:47,012
And that proximity has a major benefit for my quality of life and to the quality of education that I can provide.

606
01:09:47,032 --> 01:09:48,473
I have more time for my students.

607
01:09:48,513 --> 01:09:52,595
I have more time for my family because I'm not commuting over an hour like most of my colleagues.

608
01:09:53,115 --> 01:09:56,956
The reason I have that benefit has nothing to do with my paycheck from Tufts.

609
01:09:57,477 --> 01:10:00,438
That's because of my partner's paycheck, which is about twice mine.

610
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:07,347
My own paycheck can't even hope to touch the cost of housing, right?

611
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:15,398
So I have one kid in daycare, and with groceries and a credit card bill, my paycheck on a good month maybe covers that, and that's about it.

612
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:26,585
So Tufts faculty should not be required to have a highly paid partner or other independent financial privilege to live in the community in which we teach.

613
01:10:27,326 --> 01:10:28,046
We deserve better.

614
01:10:28,366 --> 01:10:44,978
So wrapping up here, speaking for myself, it seems like the specific administrators who really control the purse strings at Tufts, who could, if they wanted to, immediately end negotiations by offering us a contract that adequately values our contributions to the university,

615
01:10:46,278 --> 01:10:50,000
Those specific administrators don't seem to be interested in this conversation at all.

616
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:53,022
And I don't believe it's because they can't find the money.

617
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:57,904
Last year, the School of Arts and Sciences had a $34 million surplus.

618
01:10:58,644 --> 01:11:04,347
In my view, they simply aren't valuing our labor, which again, sustains so much of their mission.

619
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,268
So I really thank you for your time.

620
01:11:07,348 --> 01:11:13,851
I hope you'll really consider and pass this resolution to help show the administration that they need to pay attention.

621
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:14,892
Thank you very much.

622
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:16,278
Thank you.

623
01:11:27,168 --> 01:11:28,089
One second here.

624
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:30,551
Name and address for the record, please.

625
01:11:30,571 --> 01:11:31,632
You have three minutes.

626
01:11:32,533 --> 01:11:37,878
My name is Pan Lo and I work at 503 Boston Ave in Medford.

627
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:47,834
I teach in the Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning at Tufts and have been doing so full time since 2009.

628
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:54,679
Really want to thank all of you for entertaining this resolution, the connections between

629
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:59,187
Tufts and especially my department and Medford are deep.

630
01:12:00,227 --> 01:12:11,791
In fact, Vice President Collins was a former student when she was at Tufts, and we send plenty of students out to do work with the Medford planning department and.

631
01:12:12,651 --> 01:12:25,916
our students get so much out of being both living here and having this city be a place that they are really learning about what it means to build just and sustainable communities.

632
01:12:26,056 --> 01:12:27,657
So I want to thank you all for that.

633
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:37,901
A lot has already been said, but I think for me the bottom line is that we have been increasingly overworked and underpaid.

634
01:12:41,363 --> 01:12:46,686
The situation has been going on long enough that we have been getting very frustrated.

635
01:12:49,587 --> 01:12:59,693
We are about a third of the full-time teaching faculty in the School of Arts and Sciences, but yet we teach way more students than that.

636
01:13:00,653 --> 01:13:05,079
Last fall, we taught over 10,000 students in over 300 courses.

637
01:13:05,379 --> 01:13:11,326
On average, every undergrad was taking about one and a half courses from courses taught by full-time lecturers.

638
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:19,757
As Helen mentioned, the university is in a situation where it can pay.

639
01:13:21,411 --> 01:13:29,779
It just seems like it has been choosing not to, and that's where the support from our community has been so important.

640
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:37,047
We organized and conducted a two-day strike at the end of January.

641
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:49,312
And what we learned from that is just how much support that we have from both people in our community as students, faculty, alumni, and families, but also our surrounding communities.

642
01:13:50,132 --> 01:13:56,953
The community partners from Medford, from Somerville, the support there has been invaluable to us.

643
01:13:57,674 --> 01:14:02,274
It's given us hope and inspiration that we can get to a deal that we deserve.

644
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:19,262
You know I'll conclude by just saying that you know it is it is really unconscionable that many of us cannot actually afford to live in a great community like Medford and you know if I hadn't moved and.

645
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:24,382
actually bought a place back in the mid 90s, I wouldn't be close to campus now either.

646
01:14:25,183 --> 01:14:38,688
So, you know, so this contract is really important, not just for us as individuals, but for really sustaining the kind of employment and employer that Medford deserves in a Tufts.

647
01:14:40,528 --> 01:14:59,672
Last thing I'll say is that while we also support all the other folks who work and are part of unions and really believe in that solidarity, we think that this resolution, having a clean resolution would have a little more impact on our administration.

648
01:14:59,772 --> 01:15:02,553
So, you know, with due respect to the idea that

649
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:11,332
Councilor Scarpelli put out there, I do think it's a little cleaner if we keep this just as a resolution that supports the union of Tufts.

650
01:15:12,332 --> 01:15:12,612
Thank you.

651
01:15:14,472 --> 01:15:15,033
Thank you.

652
01:15:16,013 --> 01:15:19,874
Any further comment from members of the public in the chamber or on Zoom?

653
01:15:21,034 --> 01:15:27,916
Seeing one in the chamber, not seeing any hands on Zoom, so we'll stay at the podium.

654
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:29,796
Name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.

655
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:31,740
Is this on?

656
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,300
You're on.

657
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:35,242
Okay, Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

658
01:15:37,462 --> 01:15:44,165
As someone who's worked in academia all my life, I think it's so important.

659
01:15:44,865 --> 01:15:47,266
We're put so much value on education.

660
01:15:48,707 --> 01:15:53,769
We charge now so much for higher education, that it's very important that we

661
01:15:56,257 --> 01:16:02,441
pay and we remunerate those who are teaching our children, we remunerate them well.

662
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:17,970
I think that one of the side effects of this kind of exploitation of scholars for Medford is that, as someone noted, people can't live in the community.

663
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:28,073
And the richness of these intellectuals, these scholars, is lost to us then.

664
01:16:28,513 --> 01:16:30,233
And this is something very important.

665
01:16:30,293 --> 01:16:32,794
I mean, these people bring so much into the community.

666
01:16:33,454 --> 01:16:41,777
And if they're not paid at a level that allows them to live in the community, then that's a loss for the whole community.

667
01:16:42,137 --> 01:16:43,457
So I very much support this.

668
01:16:44,377 --> 01:16:44,717
Thank you.

669
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:46,518
Thank you.

670
01:16:47,827 --> 01:16:51,830
Any further comment by folks in the chamber or on Zoom?

671
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,811
I'll go to Councilor Lemming.

672
01:16:57,253 --> 01:17:10,561
Well, if there's no other folks from the public looking to speak, I'd just like to add that supporting the full-time lecturers and Tufts is particularly important because I

673
01:17:14,307 --> 01:17:20,414
I spent most of my life in academia, last five years in a postdoc.

674
01:17:20,574 --> 01:17:33,649
It's a system that really relies on under-compensated labor from folks who have

675
01:17:36,392 --> 01:17:39,313
a lot of training.

676
01:17:41,013 --> 01:18:02,937
It's the full-time lecturers, the junior academics that run large institutions like Tufts, and it's really the passion for what they do that ends up being exploited by the academic system that keeps these institutions and most of higher education in the country running.

677
01:18:04,286 --> 01:18:10,850
We're going through a time right now where the academic system in the U.S.

678
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:24,618
is being particularly strained by the federal government, so it's incredibly important to show these full-time lecturers our full support because it's going to be very important for

679
01:18:25,738 --> 01:18:37,149
uh, institutions like Tufts to offer more local support, uh, to, uh, to the junior academics that are in their institution.

680
01:18:37,329 --> 01:18:47,698
So I have my, this resolution has my full support and I'd like to thank all the folks, um, in the chambers tonight for coming out to speak.

681
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,161
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

682
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:59,665
Seeing no further comment, I'll just throw in my two cents here.

683
01:19:02,387 --> 01:19:08,872
One of the most important lessons in political economy I learned is that we're basically living

684
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:17,062
inside of a 75 year scam to disembed the economy from society.

685
01:19:17,802 --> 01:19:27,025
It's this idea that the economy exists outside of any context of humanity or community or sociology or anything else.

686
01:19:27,605 --> 01:19:31,026
And certainly we're seeing some of the worst effects of that now.

687
01:19:31,807 --> 01:19:39,229
And very often when we talk about Tufts University, it feels like they are trying to disembed themselves from our community.

688
01:19:40,654 --> 01:19:43,757
I think Tufts University itself is a community issue.

689
01:19:44,257 --> 01:20:05,093
When we talk about the dormitory argument or the many other unions who have come before this council to talk about how Tufts is treating them as an institution, or the students who have come before this council who had those same concerns, or the neighbors, the Medford residents who have serious concerns with how Tufts

690
01:20:06,357 --> 01:20:08,879
treats their immediate neighbors in the hillside.

691
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:21,087
Students and workers and Medford residents together have very clear alignment and opposition, in my opinion, to how Tufts is choosing to act as an institution.

692
01:20:21,707 --> 01:20:28,572
And I can think of nothing more salient to that point than the idea that we are a host community and not a home.

693
01:20:30,473 --> 01:20:31,014
And I think

694
01:20:31,988 --> 01:20:43,330
whether you're a student or a worker or a neighbor or just someone who lives here in Medford, we would all do better if Tufts administration did better.

695
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,270
So that's where I stand.

696
01:20:46,911 --> 01:20:54,852
And I'll probably have to make that speech a couple dozen more times in the next few months, depending, we'll see.

697
01:20:56,172 --> 01:20:57,753
But it's just how things go.

698
01:20:58,713 --> 01:20:58,973
And it's,

699
01:21:00,373 --> 01:21:01,454
you hear these same stories.

700
01:21:01,694 --> 01:21:05,216
So thank you for the folks who commented.

701
01:21:06,597 --> 01:21:10,539
We do have a motion to approve by Vice President Collins.

702
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:13,700
There is an amendment by Councilor Scarpelli.

703
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:18,003
Vice President Collins, do you accept the amendment?

704
01:21:18,103 --> 01:21:25,747
We could also do it as a B paper so that we could keep a clean resolution and have Councilor Scarpelli's item as a separate vote.

705
01:21:28,469 --> 01:21:29,149
Councilor Collins.

706
01:21:35,505 --> 01:21:39,810
Thank you for the bears 1st, I apologize if my audio isn't coming through.

707
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:41,592
Well, my Internet is unstable right now.

708
01:21:41,612 --> 01:21:50,242
I. I hear the counts are appreciate him bringing that up.

709
01:21:51,263 --> 01:21:53,045
Preference would be to.

710
01:21:57,938 --> 01:21:59,779
Vote on that as a B paper.

711
01:21:59,799 --> 01:22:11,382
I would certainly be in favor since these workers requested that the most persuasive to this employer.

712
01:22:11,402 --> 01:22:13,903
I'd like to honor sentiment for our bargaining units here in the city.

713
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:18,188
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

714
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,009
It came in a little funky, but I think we got the picture.

715
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,090
You'd prefer a B paper.

716
01:22:22,151 --> 01:22:25,353
I'm seeing a nod from Councilor Scarpelli that that's all right.

717
01:22:26,133 --> 01:22:27,054
So we'll have two votes.

718
01:22:27,074 --> 01:22:39,122
We'll have a B paper, which is to resolve to the mayor to settle the contracts that are outstanding, including some workers who've been without a contract for three years.

719
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:46,748
And when you're ready on that, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

720
01:22:50,534 --> 01:22:51,495
The second on the paper.

721
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:59,039
Councilor saying, Yes, this is on the beat.

722
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,141
On the beat paper Council Callahan.

723
01:23:03,362 --> 01:23:04,182
Vice President Collins.

724
01:23:05,943 --> 01:23:06,163
Yes.

725
01:23:07,664 --> 01:23:08,525
Councilors are.

726
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:11,747
Yes.

727
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:13,207
Councilor Lemming.

728
01:23:13,848 --> 01:23:14,128
Yes.

729
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:16,029
Councilor Scarpelli.

730
01:23:18,187 --> 01:23:32,018
President bears yes 70 affirmative no negative the motion passes on the a paper which is the original resolution by Vice President Collins seconded by second by Councillor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

731
01:23:36,501 --> 01:23:38,743
Council Callahan, Vice President Collins.

732
01:23:43,907 --> 01:23:44,567
Vice President calls.

733
01:23:47,091 --> 01:23:47,571
Yes.

734
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:49,112
Yes.

735
01:23:49,572 --> 01:23:49,852
Yes.

736
01:23:50,412 --> 01:23:51,533
Yes.

737
01:23:53,734 --> 01:23:53,994
Yes.

738
01:23:54,974 --> 01:23:56,395
Yes.

739
01:23:56,495 --> 01:23:56,795
Yes.

740
01:23:57,195 --> 01:23:57,435
Yes.

741
01:23:58,316 --> 01:23:59,356
Seven or eight in the affirmative.

742
01:23:59,396 --> 01:24:03,538
The motion passes, and we can move to the next item.

743
01:24:03,878 --> 01:24:04,178
Thank you.

744
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:19,487
25.041 offered by Councillor saying resolution public engagement plan for FYI 26 budget be it resolved that the resident services and public engagement committee design implement a public engagement plan for the upcoming FYI 2026 budget Councillor saying.

745
01:24:21,032 --> 01:24:21,432
Thank you.

746
01:24:22,033 --> 01:24:37,701
This resolution is really quite a simple one, it goes back to our fund of one of our fundamental guiding principles that we want City Hall to be more accessible to all that we want to bring City Hall to the people and not force people to come to have to come to City Hall.

747
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:42,224
I think the budget process is a perfect encapsulation of that process.

748
01:24:42,824 --> 01:24:46,506
where the budget is a statement of the city's values.

749
01:24:46,806 --> 01:24:49,948
It is what runs our city, what makes us tick.

750
01:24:50,549 --> 01:25:00,555
And it's really important, I believe, to me, and I believe to the city council, too, that we get as much input as we can and that people feel heard in this process.

751
01:25:01,275 --> 01:25:05,418
Over the last few years, we've experimented doing different things with public engagement.

752
01:25:06,418 --> 01:25:10,841
Years ago, I put out a survey, too, which I have thoughts about how to

753
01:25:12,462 --> 01:25:25,812
how to make better this time around, asking for input from residents about what they would want to see in our city budget and then explaining some of the challenges that we see on the city council with getting what everyone wants.

754
01:25:27,266 --> 01:25:30,667
in recent years on the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

755
01:25:30,787 --> 01:25:35,189
We have been doing more with actively going out into the community to hear from residents.

756
01:25:36,209 --> 01:25:43,651
We've been doing more with publishing a newsletter that goes out every month detailing what we do on the City Council.

757
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:46,912
So there are more means by which we can gather feedback now.

758
01:25:46,932 --> 01:25:50,473
I know there are Councillors who are very passionate about getting

759
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:55,414
public feedback and engaging more members of the public in our processes as well.

760
01:25:56,094 --> 01:26:06,577
So I'm looking forward to a very fruitful discussion on the Resident Services Committee, and I'll motion to send this paper to that committee.

761
01:26:08,318 --> 01:26:15,759
On the motion of Councilor Sang to refer paper 25041 to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

762
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,500
Is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

763
01:26:20,814 --> 01:26:21,695
Councilor Lazzaro.

764
01:26:23,176 --> 01:26:28,619
I just thank Councilor Teng for bringing this forward and I look forward to discussing it in committee.

765
01:26:28,659 --> 01:26:29,080
Thank you.

766
01:26:31,501 --> 01:26:34,683
Any discussion by members of the public either in the chamber or on Zoom?

767
01:26:38,846 --> 01:26:44,410
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

768
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:46,671
Second is Councilor Calderon.

769
01:26:52,077 --> 01:26:52,637
Councilor Callahan.

770
01:26:53,718 --> 01:26:54,479
Vice President Collins.

771
01:26:54,879 --> 01:26:55,100
Yes.

772
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,661
Councilor Lazaro.

773
01:26:56,701 --> 01:26:56,801
Yes.

774
01:26:57,662 --> 01:26:58,182
Councilor Lemming.

775
01:26:58,643 --> 01:26:58,903
Yes.

776
01:27:00,064 --> 01:27:00,705
Councilor Scarpelli.

777
01:27:00,725 --> 01:27:00,785
Yes.

778
01:27:02,246 --> 01:27:02,746
Councilor Hsing.

779
01:27:02,766 --> 01:27:02,826
Yes.

780
01:27:03,347 --> 01:27:03,867
President Paris.

781
01:27:03,887 --> 01:27:06,029
Yes, I'm affirmative then the negative the motion passes.

782
01:27:06,049 --> 01:27:17,599
25044 offered by Vice President Collins proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance neighborhood and residential, never heard residential and urban residential districts for referral to the Community Development Board.

783
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:29,276
These are the NR and UR proposals referred out of the Planning and Permitting Committee for referral to the Community Development Board for their review and recommendation.

784
01:27:29,296 --> 01:27:35,079
And this would amend sections 94-2.1, 94-3.2, 94-4.1, and 94-12 of the zoning ordinance to create these districts.

785
01:27:45,763 --> 01:27:50,884
Again, this is just a referral, a legally required referral to the Community Development Board.

786
01:27:51,504 --> 01:27:57,245
There is a question and answer session on Thursday in this room on the matter.

787
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:08,207
Community Development Board will hold a public hearing, and then the Council will hold a public hearing where we will hear whatever recommendations were made by the Community Development Board.

788
01:28:09,148 --> 01:28:10,748
Vice President Collins, anything you'd like to add?

789
01:28:12,065 --> 01:28:13,566
Thank you, president bears for the overview.

790
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,970
I was going to just summarize much in the same way that you did.

791
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:26,919
I thank my colleagues and city planning staff for their collaboration on this draft proposal over 4 meetings in January and February in committee.

792
01:28:27,499 --> 01:28:36,548
And I was also going to take the opportunity like you did to promote the public Q and a session that will be this Thursday at 6 PM in the city council chambers.

793
01:28:37,709 --> 01:28:38,629
This will be in person.

794
01:28:38,669 --> 01:28:39,710
There will be big graphs.

795
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:50,377
It's a great opportunity for people to learn more and ask questions and state their ideas and concerns about the proposal before the Community Development Board public hearings.

796
01:28:50,857 --> 01:28:56,721
I also heard from Director Hunt just earlier today that this Q&A will no longer be only in person.

797
01:28:56,741 --> 01:28:59,663
There will also be a Zoom option.

798
01:28:59,803 --> 01:29:04,005
So just encourage people to take advantage of that opportunity.

799
01:29:04,085 --> 01:29:06,307
And with that, I motion for referral to the CDB.

800
01:29:08,214 --> 01:29:12,798
On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang, any further discussions?

801
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,881
Any discussion by members of the public?

802
01:29:18,642 --> 01:29:22,846
Either in the chamber or on Zoom, you can come to the podium in the chamber or raise your hand on Zoom.

803
01:29:29,151 --> 01:29:34,315
Seeing none, I just wanna also thank Vice President Collins, Chair of the Planning and Permitting Committee,

804
01:29:36,212 --> 01:29:47,795
No spoilers, but I've heard that the Mass Municipal Association is interested in writing a feature on the zoning updates website page and the engagement process around this.

805
01:29:47,895 --> 01:29:52,516
So that has a lot to do with your work, Councilor Collins.

806
01:29:52,536 --> 01:29:53,237
So thank you for that.

807
01:29:55,277 --> 01:29:55,557
Thank you.

808
01:29:57,198 --> 01:29:59,638
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

809
01:29:59,658 --> 01:30:02,359
This is to refer to the CD board.

810
01:30:02,539 --> 01:30:02,719
Yes.

811
01:30:03,059 --> 01:30:03,680
Councilor Callahan.

812
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,140
Vice President Collins.

813
01:30:05,842 --> 01:30:06,042
Yes.

814
01:30:07,124 --> 01:30:07,945
Councilor Lazaro.

815
01:30:08,786 --> 01:30:09,307
Councilor Lemming.

816
01:30:09,888 --> 01:30:10,108
Yes.

817
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,751
Councilor Scarpelli.

818
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:14,214
Councilor Singh.

819
01:30:14,855 --> 01:30:15,436
President Behrs.

820
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:15,817
Yes.

821
01:30:15,837 --> 01:30:17,439
60 affirmative, one of the negatives.

822
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:18,120
The motion passes.

823
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:20,522
I will be brief.

824
01:30:20,542 --> 01:30:23,983
If folks have had a chance to review the letter that I wrote up summarizing the decisions that we came up with last week.

825
01:30:44,587 --> 01:30:48,569
And if folks have any comments, certainly, or edits, they're much appreciated.

826
01:30:49,469 --> 01:30:54,972
But we have first recommendation, maintain level service funding for the Medford public schools and city departments.

827
01:30:56,092 --> 01:31:03,556
Two, this is under new ongoing expenditures to increase the funding for the assessing department to implement the residential exemption.

828
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:12,180
Three, increase funding for DPW engineering and facilities departments for improved road and bike safety, tree planting, and capital improvements.

829
01:31:13,247 --> 01:31:20,472
Four, fund a therapeutic recreation specialist and office manager in the recreation department and a citywide inclusion specialist.

830
01:31:21,373 --> 01:31:24,915
Five, fund a fire department dive team training and equipment.

831
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:28,618
Six, increase funding for the city solicitor position.

832
01:31:29,459 --> 01:31:31,340
And then two, one-time expenses.

833
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:38,065
One, or sorry, seven, the nexus studies for inclusionary zoning, linkage fees, and transportation demand management.

834
01:31:38,845 --> 01:31:42,288
And eight, planning to update the city's financial software.

835
01:31:45,172 --> 01:31:55,461
If folks read that, so that will be sent along along with everyone's individual the recommendations of all the individual counselors that were submitted by memorandum or by email.

836
01:31:56,962 --> 01:31:57,863
What a counselor saying.

837
01:31:58,943 --> 01:31:59,344
Thank you.

838
01:31:59,364 --> 01:32:11,073
Um, this is something I always look forward to in the city council year when we get have that meeting committee the whole meeting get together and then sent over this letter to the mayor.

839
01:32:11,544 --> 01:32:23,548
I believe that we are stronger when we negotiate together, when we work together to fight for the values that we want to see in the budget, to fight for the items that we want to see in the budget together.

840
01:32:24,929 --> 01:32:28,670
I thank President Behrs for his work on putting together this letter.

841
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:31,531
I think it's very comprehensive.

842
01:32:31,911 --> 01:32:32,551
It's very clear.

843
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,841
I think it's very well done, so thank you so much.

844
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:37,841
Thank you.

845
01:32:37,861 --> 01:32:44,625
And the letter is addressed to the Mayor with a copy to Chief of Staff Nazarian and Director Dickinson.

846
01:32:46,606 --> 01:32:49,707
Any further discussion by members of the Council on our recommendations?

847
01:32:52,969 --> 01:32:54,150
Seeing none, is there a motion?

848
01:32:55,630 --> 01:33:00,593
Motion to approve and refer to the Mayor by Councillor Sang, seconded by Councillor Callaghan.

849
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:08,573
Is there any discussion by members of the public on the council's budget recommendations for fiscal year 2026?

850
01:33:10,454 --> 01:33:14,196
Either the podium or raising your hand on Zoom.

851
01:33:21,599 --> 01:33:23,640
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

852
01:33:27,262 --> 01:33:27,842
Councilor Callahan.

853
01:33:28,783 --> 01:33:29,523
Vice President Collins.

854
01:33:34,262 --> 01:33:34,942
Vice President Collins?

855
01:33:35,102 --> 01:33:36,783
Looks like Vice President Collins has stepped away.

856
01:33:37,223 --> 01:33:37,383
Okay.

857
01:33:39,883 --> 01:33:40,443
Councilor Lazaro?

858
01:33:40,483 --> 01:33:40,583
Yes.

859
01:33:41,904 --> 01:33:42,424
Councilor Lemming?

860
01:33:43,024 --> 01:33:43,284
Yes.

861
01:33:45,064 --> 01:33:45,785
Councilor Scarpelli?

862
01:33:46,025 --> 01:33:46,205
Yes.

863
01:33:48,605 --> 01:33:49,045
Councilor Sang?

864
01:33:49,065 --> 01:33:49,125
Yes.

865
01:33:49,745 --> 01:33:50,306
President Behrs?

866
01:33:50,446 --> 01:33:50,686
Yes.

867
01:33:50,806 --> 01:33:52,246
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

868
01:33:52,286 --> 01:33:53,226
The motion passes.

869
01:33:53,246 --> 01:33:55,127
Communications from the Mayor.

870
01:33:55,147 --> 01:34:00,968
25-047, offered by Mayor Brianna Lingo-Kerns, appropriation of free cash and retained earnings.

871
01:34:02,443 --> 01:34:12,768
Dear President Behrs and city councilors, I respect the request that your honorable body approves the appropriations of one, excuse me, free cash in the amount of $737,927.88 on the following items, $680,927.88 for fire station planning.

872
01:34:12,788 --> 01:34:17,610
This covers expenses spent under city council resolution 19-484, which used short-term borrowing to start design work.

873
01:34:31,337 --> 01:34:39,845
and $57,000 to fund Vision Government Solutions contract to provide revaluation services for the assessor estate mandated 2026 revaluation.

874
01:34:40,566 --> 01:34:42,348
The balance of free cash before this vote is $28,343,997.

875
01:34:47,012 --> 01:34:58,974
2.

876
01:34:47,232 --> 01:34:58,974
Retained earnings from the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund in the amount of $1,700,000.00 for a water main replacement project to mitigate lead or unknown services and improve capacity.

877
01:34:59,054 --> 01:35:05,335
The balance in retained earnings in the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund before this vote is $12,653,475.00.

878
01:35:05,395 --> 01:35:12,317
Finance Director Robert Dickinson and City Engineer Owen Wartella will be available to answer any questions respectfully.

879
01:35:12,357 --> 01:35:13,737
Submitted Brianne Alengo Kern-Mayer.

880
01:35:14,781 --> 01:35:17,822
Bob Owen.

881
01:35:18,163 --> 01:35:28,227
So, is there anything else you'd like to add your own, not really planning for fire stations.

882
01:35:33,665 --> 01:35:38,988
Obviously, the debt exclusion did not pass for that.

883
01:35:39,048 --> 01:35:43,931
So that project is on hold, but we need to pay off the expenses that were incurred.

884
01:35:44,691 --> 01:35:48,274
It seems foolish to simply borrow that or to roll the debt.

885
01:35:48,714 --> 01:35:56,898
So we're asking for free cash to be able to be used to pay off the expenses that we have so far.

886
01:35:56,919 --> 01:36:02,402
In terms of the revaluation, every five years, the city is

887
01:36:03,697 --> 01:36:07,578
required to do a full reval of all the assessed properties.

888
01:36:08,979 --> 01:36:11,460
This is a five-year expense.

889
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,081
Half of it will be this year.

890
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:15,781
The other half will be next year.

891
01:36:15,801 --> 01:36:19,142
It seems an appropriate use of free cash because it's kind of outside.

892
01:36:19,162 --> 01:36:27,225
It's a longer-term thing that's kind of outside the ordinary operational budget of the assessment department.

893
01:36:29,766 --> 01:36:30,686
You want to speak on that?

894
01:36:36,526 --> 01:36:54,659
Hello, the Arlington Street Water Main Project is something we're trying to focus on for not only capacity in a low flow, low area, but it's the first step of like a five year kind of initiative that we're going to start moving.

895
01:36:55,540 --> 01:37:05,607
This area was targeted because it has a high probability of unknowns and lead, and it'll also give us better pressure for fire safety and head loss.

896
01:37:07,731 --> 01:37:08,191
Thank you.

897
01:37:09,072 --> 01:37:28,959
Director Dickinson, just on the fire station, essentially, my understanding of this is that short-term borrowing was done under a council resolution, and then the idea is that that money would have been rolled over into the debt for the project, but because the debt exclusion failed, there's not gonna be debt for the project?

898
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,760
Yes, that's correct.

899
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,421
Okay.

900
01:37:32,661 --> 01:37:36,062
We had a $1.5 million authorization to do the planning,

901
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:40,215
What would ordinarily happen is we would have done the planning.

902
01:37:40,235 --> 01:37:43,455
We would have done short-term borrowing.

903
01:37:43,475 --> 01:37:49,696
We did actually borrow $1.5 million short-term to cover the planning process.

904
01:37:50,417 --> 01:37:52,157
And then we would have closed out that debt.

905
01:37:52,757 --> 01:38:06,940
And had we gotten the authorization to build the full fire station, we would have borrowed enough to pay off the short-term debt and all the planning costs, roll that into the long-term debt we would have had for the fire station.

906
01:38:07,869 --> 01:38:12,111
So right now we have to pay off the debt.

907
01:38:12,891 --> 01:38:18,413
What is actually been spent is the money that we're asking for from pre-cash.

908
01:38:18,553 --> 01:38:21,214
The rest of the money is still sitting in the city's accounts.

909
01:38:21,654 --> 01:38:21,815
So.

910
01:38:21,855 --> 01:38:27,237
All right, I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Lazaro.

911
01:38:27,977 --> 01:38:29,958
Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Hickson.

912
01:38:29,998 --> 01:38:34,139
I know that, so these plans, they've already done the work.

913
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:35,540
We owe them the money.

914
01:38:37,158 --> 01:38:42,663
So instead of paying it off, and with an interest moving forward, we pay it off up front now.

915
01:38:43,543 --> 01:38:47,967
And these plans are ours to keep, so they're already done, right?

916
01:38:48,367 --> 01:38:52,030
Yes, these are expenses we've actually, we've already paid the contractors.

917
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:54,192
All of those POs are closed.

918
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:57,274
So that's the end of this part of the project.

919
01:38:57,334 --> 01:39:02,058
We still have the plans, obviously, that were produced by the contractors.

920
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:03,799
No, there were total plans.

921
01:39:05,336 --> 01:39:07,958
there was a final plan that was presented.

922
01:39:08,579 --> 01:39:21,128
And then one of the reasons why I think it failed was the rank and file and the fire department realized that, and the former chief who was part of the planning team mentioned that it was inadequate.

923
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:33,258
But we still have all of the plans, even the original plans that had the footprint that worked with the former chief, with the team that put that together, that's everything?

924
01:39:33,813 --> 01:39:34,793
as far as I know, yes.

925
01:39:34,893 --> 01:39:36,354
Okay, all right.

926
01:39:37,114 --> 01:39:42,596
And I know as we move forward, just understanding people are very confused with the free cash.

927
01:39:42,696 --> 01:39:51,160
So we've certified free cash last year, and we spent down some of that money to be put into different pots, correct?

928
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:51,920
Yes.

929
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:56,442
Now, this is the new number, we're back up to $28 million, just for clarity sakes?

930
01:39:56,742 --> 01:39:56,962
Yes.

931
01:39:57,182 --> 01:39:57,442
Okay.

932
01:39:58,922 --> 01:39:59,243
Thank you.

933
01:40:00,283 --> 01:40:02,144
Thank you.

934
01:40:04,763 --> 01:40:05,604
Thank you.

935
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:10,007
I think this is a rational ask.

936
01:40:10,287 --> 01:40:10,988
I'm curious.

937
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:19,194
We have $28 million in pre-cash.

938
01:40:20,575 --> 01:40:24,918
The fire station remains in a difficult state.

939
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:29,202
I am curious about where

940
01:40:31,857 --> 01:40:33,878
It's not really, it's frustrating.

941
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:34,878
I feel frustrated.

942
01:40:36,318 --> 01:40:37,118
This is not your fault.

943
01:40:37,278 --> 01:40:38,539
It's not anybody's fault.

944
01:40:38,859 --> 01:40:44,800
We, I don't know how we can use what's at our disposal to help the fire station.

945
01:40:46,101 --> 01:40:57,103
I just want to put a statement into the public statement into the ether that it would be nice if we could do some improvements on the fire station somehow.

946
01:40:58,764 --> 01:40:59,004
Thank you.

947
01:41:00,538 --> 01:41:01,799
Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

948
01:41:03,819 --> 01:41:05,860
Any other questions or discussion on this paper?

949
01:41:08,422 --> 01:41:10,182
Seeing none, are there any motions?

950
01:41:14,844 --> 01:41:17,386
On a motion to approve by Councilor Callahan, seconded by.

951
01:41:18,566 --> 01:41:20,007
Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

952
01:41:20,367 --> 01:41:23,388
Is there any discussion by members of the public on this paper?

953
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:27,010
You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium in the chambers.

954
01:41:31,656 --> 01:41:31,856
Yes.

955
01:41:36,118 --> 01:41:38,520
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

956
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:41,541
Councilor Callahan.

957
01:41:43,002 --> 01:41:46,904
Vice President Collins.

958
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:49,965
Councilor Lazaro.

959
01:41:50,586 --> 01:41:50,746
Yes.

960
01:41:51,406 --> 01:41:51,967
Councilor Lemming.

961
01:41:52,547 --> 01:41:52,827
Yes.

962
01:41:53,868 --> 01:41:54,588
Councilor Scarpelli.

963
01:41:54,928 --> 01:41:55,048
No.

964
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:00,161
President Behrs?

965
01:42:00,201 --> 01:42:03,743
Yes, five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

966
01:42:05,263 --> 01:42:15,487
We received a communication regarding McCormick Avenue parcels, and we do have the MWRA loan order eligible for third reading.

967
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:18,848
Both items?

968
01:42:19,629 --> 01:42:19,889
Okay.

969
01:42:20,169 --> 01:42:23,870
On the motion of councilor saying to take papers 25-020 and 25-028 off the table, seconded by?

970
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:30,902
Second.

971
01:42:31,783 --> 01:42:33,124
Seconded by Councillor Lemming.

972
01:42:33,164 --> 01:42:34,245
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

973
01:42:49,137 --> 01:42:49,738
Councillor Callahan.

974
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:53,461
Vice President Collins is absent.

975
01:42:54,582 --> 01:42:55,263
Councillor Lozaro.

976
01:42:57,845 --> 01:42:58,345
Councillor Lemming.

977
01:42:58,906 --> 01:42:59,146
Yes.

978
01:43:00,128 --> 01:43:04,289
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Seng, President Behrs.

979
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:09,111
Yes, 70 affirmative, 60 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

980
01:43:09,131 --> 01:43:11,552
25-020, transfer and conveyance of McCormick Avenue parcels.

981
01:43:12,532 --> 01:43:13,673
Give me one second here.

982
01:43:26,733 --> 01:43:34,842
So we, I believe, have tabled this requesting further information from the Affordable Housing Trust and the administration.

983
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:45,473
And I have here, to the Honorable President and members of the City Council, from Lisa Ann Davidson, Chair, Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund, date March 21, 2025.

984
01:43:48,023 --> 01:43:59,611
Dear President Behrs and members of the City Council, on March 5th, 2025, the MAHTF met to discuss and review the resolution offered by the Mayor to the City Council to transfer and convey McCormick Avenue parcels.

985
01:44:00,452 --> 01:44:17,304
The MAHTF approved a motion to support the sale and transfer of the McCormick Avenue parcels, F1337 and F1338, subject to the City Council's approval for the purpose of funding the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund to establish an affordable housing linkage through a nexus study and support affordable housing developments.

986
01:44:18,114 --> 01:44:23,858
Regarding the McCormick Avenue parcels, the assessor's office is valuing the two parcels individually at $350,000 each.

987
01:44:24,599 --> 01:44:27,340
The two parcels individually are undersized lots and not developable.

988
01:44:28,361 --> 01:44:32,624
The assessor's office has not factored in this condition, which would lower its assessed value.

989
01:44:33,485 --> 01:44:40,390
If the two McCormick Avenue parcels were combined through the doctrine of merger, the land would become developable, and according to the assessor's office, its value would be approximately $435,000.

990
01:44:43,054 --> 01:44:45,519
Board of Trustees would be pleased to discuss this matter further.

991
01:44:45,559 --> 01:44:47,122
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

992
01:44:47,182 --> 01:44:51,091
Sincerely, Lisa Ann Davidson, Chair, Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

993
01:44:51,932 --> 01:44:52,514
Councillor Callahan.

994
01:44:54,848 --> 01:44:55,108
Thank you.

995
01:44:56,569 --> 01:45:11,077
I definitely agree in the need for us to support to find money to do these, the nexus study so that we can update the linkage fees especially for affordable housing which I think we should do first.

996
01:45:12,278 --> 01:45:19,182
I'm absolutely supportive of that, but I will not vote in favor of selling off public lands, which we'd never get back.

997
01:45:20,119 --> 01:45:25,601
when we have $28 million sitting in free cash, let alone the money that is in stabilization funds.

998
01:45:26,861 --> 01:45:38,885
I cannot understand why we are selling off public lands when we clearly have many times that amount of money in free cash that we do not know what that is planned to be used for.

999
01:45:39,225 --> 01:45:42,526
So I will not vote to sell off public lands at this point in time.

1000
01:45:43,987 --> 01:45:44,707
Councilor Lazaro.

1001
01:45:46,685 --> 01:45:46,885
Councilor.

1002
01:45:46,905 --> 01:45:51,286
Um Councilor Callahan said exactly what I was going to say.

1003
01:45:51,406 --> 01:45:51,766
Thank you.

1004
01:45:52,026 --> 01:45:54,467
Um it means exactly.

1005
01:45:54,667 --> 01:45:58,168
Yes Um, no, I would not be in favor of selling these parcels.

1006
01:45:58,488 --> 01:46:08,611
I also know that it was these parcels were toured by, um, an affordable housing developer and architect prior to this discussion that they were

1007
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:24,424
basically gives these lands as owned by the city to affordable housing developers directly.

1008
01:46:24,444 --> 01:46:28,066
It doesn't need to be, and then we have them, and then they're affordable housing.

1009
01:46:28,086 --> 01:46:35,750
We don't need to sell them to a private person for, this doesn't, I would not support this as it is right now.

1010
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:36,911
Thank you.

1011
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:37,991
Thank you.

1012
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:38,892
Any further discussion?

1013
01:46:40,953 --> 01:46:41,453
Councilor Sang.

1014
01:46:43,318 --> 01:46:48,542
Um, I think folks who've been following this issue know I've been of two minds about it.

1015
01:46:48,602 --> 01:46:53,866
My instinct is with my fellow counselors that we shouldn't sell public land.

1016
01:46:54,126 --> 01:46:57,448
I also appreciate the letter that was sent to us.

1017
01:46:58,068 --> 01:47:05,774
I think the subtext of that letter is asking us to think bigger picture about, um, you know, getting that next study, I think will help

1018
01:47:06,254 --> 01:47:15,056
affordability in the long term by telling us exactly how we can achieve the bigger picture goals that we've set out.

1019
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:26,758
I think that's why I'm inclined to support it, but I did want to take this off the table because I wanted to hear the discussion after we got that letter from the Affordable Housing Trust as well.

1020
01:47:26,798 --> 01:47:29,219
So I wanted to hear from my fellow Councillors too.

1021
01:47:31,559 --> 01:47:31,980
Thank you.

1022
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,080
Any further discussion?

1023
01:47:37,167 --> 01:47:38,530
Is there a motion.

1024
01:47:38,730 --> 01:47:39,572
I have my hand raised.

1025
01:47:39,993 --> 01:47:40,413
Oh, sorry.

1026
01:47:40,433 --> 01:47:40,574
Yeah.

1027
01:47:40,634 --> 01:47:42,097
I mean, I'm, I do agree that.

1028
01:47:49,946 --> 01:47:55,347
we should be using free cash for some of these one-time expenses.

1029
01:47:55,427 --> 01:48:12,550
On the other hand, this is, I mean, this is an official communication from the Affordable Housing Trust where they're telling us that these parcels are individually undersized and they're saying they're not able to be developed.

1030
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:18,591
And I am disappointed

1031
01:48:19,578 --> 01:48:30,007
and my colleagues for not supporting, indicating that they wouldn't support the recommendation of the Affordable Housing Trust.

1032
01:48:31,067 --> 01:48:37,032
I'm also disappointed in some of my colleagues for stepping off prior to this discussion.

1033
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:40,635
I would really like to see this

1034
01:48:42,222 --> 01:48:46,685
Uh, this nexus study, uh, this nexus study actually funded.

1035
01:48:46,705 --> 01:48:47,445
It was.

1036
01:48:48,566 --> 01:48:55,290
In some of the budget recommendations that we put forward, and I would like to see this council.

1037
01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:59,013
Uh, get in the pattern of supporting.

1038
01:48:59,902 --> 01:49:05,003
the Affordable Housing Trust when it gives us a recommendation.

1039
01:49:05,023 --> 01:49:24,749
I mean, if they're going to tell us that they can't use two parcels of land and so we should have a bit more of a longer term view when it comes to selling them off so that we can actually fund the nexus study, then I'm inclined to support them.

1040
01:49:25,229 --> 01:49:27,710
So that's all I have to say.

1041
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:28,070
Thank you.

1042
01:49:29,809 --> 01:49:31,590
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1043
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:32,510
Thank you, Mr. President.

1044
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:35,672
Appreciate my colleagues thoughts on this.

1045
01:49:35,732 --> 01:49:42,696
I think that as we look at the parcels being small, I think that they are important.

1046
01:49:42,736 --> 01:49:53,222
I think they are valuable for the fact that you might not see a four story development, but you'll see a butters that would take up that land relatively quickly.

1047
01:49:54,233 --> 01:49:57,014
then move that money into the Affordable Housing Trust.

1048
01:49:57,054 --> 01:50:06,458
So I concur with my fellow colleague, Councilor Lemming, in understanding that we finally have a revenue source that we can start feeding into that.

1049
01:50:06,998 --> 01:50:17,482
And the fact that we've heard tonight that the use of free cash to be used for anything is pretty frightening, considering this Council spoke

1050
01:50:18,392 --> 01:50:36,305
a year ago on a number that was relatively the same number to keep us out of an override that really is affecting so many of our homeowners and affecting now a lot of our renters because of the increase in taxing that fall back onto our renters.

1051
01:50:36,843 --> 01:50:50,253
So I think that I made a motion and I'll bring it back up soon because I think maybe my council colleagues understand the importance of maybe an audit and putting that back out to a vote.

1052
01:50:50,293 --> 01:50:57,898
Because again, I know that one of my council colleagues mentioned that it's nobody's fault, but it is somebody's fault.

1053
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:05,224
When you continually have millions and millions and millions of dollars

1054
01:51:06,127 --> 01:51:08,309
Again $28 million in free cash.

1055
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:10,111
There's something going wrong.

1056
01:51:10,952 --> 01:51:14,215
Again, repeat this so people don't take this out of context.

1057
01:51:14,615 --> 01:51:26,706
I'm not saying that someone's doing something illegal in the city, but there's a blatant misuse of our funds that we keep we keep increasing this free cash amount

1058
01:51:27,465 --> 01:51:29,426
to a number that's astronomical.

1059
01:51:30,187 --> 01:51:36,271
What was put forth during the override is the understanding the process of free cash is seeing most communities that are

1060
01:51:37,093 --> 01:51:52,900
trying to eliminate free cash or keeping it at that level for the bond rating, which I believe at the time for metric was close to, I believe, seven and $11 million, keeping it there that keeps us at the bond rating that we have today and using that money appropriately.

1061
01:51:53,020 --> 01:52:00,183
So I appreciate the, the, the highlight of the misuse of free cash, excuse me, the highlight of the free cash.

1062
01:52:00,643 --> 01:52:05,105
And I highlight the fact that that again, something has to be done.

1063
01:52:05,406 --> 01:52:06,246
We have to look at

1064
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:16,575
the way we're spending our money in our community because we see and hear over and over again that we can't do A, B, and C because we don't have the funding.

1065
01:52:17,836 --> 01:52:21,738
But we obviously have the funding when we have $28 million in free cash.

1066
01:52:22,099 --> 01:52:32,485
Again, free cash is money that is voted by this council for the previous budget season to move our projects forward, to move our city forward.

1067
01:52:32,825 --> 01:52:36,567
And if that money is not being spent properly, this is where we are.

1068
01:52:37,812 --> 01:52:39,532
$28 million in free cash.

1069
01:52:41,353 --> 01:52:58,696
So again, even if it's not spent, putting it into a high-interest account that brings us money so it's not sitting in account for the whole year, maybe there's another way that we can look at creating revenue for our community just out of interest, out of $28 million.

1070
01:52:58,956 --> 01:53:01,677
There are so many avenues to look at this process, but

1071
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:31,564
I'm going to vote in favor of this paper, because I think this is something we've talked about in supporting our affordable housing trust, something that the previous council, before this council started, Council Falco's wishes and his resolution, and I believe Council Behrs and I were on that council, that again, these are parcels that we're looking at purchasing and then building, dropping in a development,

1072
01:53:32,157 --> 01:53:43,242
There are small parcels that could be hopefully taken by the abutters and then used to add some housing and then build the affordable trust account.

1073
01:53:43,262 --> 01:53:44,423
So thank you, Mr. President.

1074
01:53:45,423 --> 01:53:45,983
Thank you.

1075
01:53:46,003 --> 01:53:52,646
I do want to note when it comes to the free cash, what we heard last week was

1076
01:53:54,935 --> 01:54:01,559
that there was 1 million in turnbacks, so underspending, and 6 million in unexpected local receipts.

1077
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:10,544
And a large amount of that was from exactly what you just said, Councilor Scarpelli, the investment of ARPA funds and city's cash balances in high interest accounts.

1078
01:54:11,165 --> 01:54:13,766
They earned more than was expected in the budget.

1079
01:54:14,567 --> 01:54:17,489
And again, that free cash number is as of 6-30-2024.

1080
01:54:17,529 --> 01:54:18,309
I'm also inclined to say that,

1081
01:54:22,725 --> 01:54:28,830
Yes, there's a lot of free cash right now and using it on one-time projects is what it's intended for, right?

1082
01:54:29,331 --> 01:54:30,592
There's two truths.

1083
01:54:30,712 --> 01:54:36,597
We have an operating budget that has a very tight margin when we look at the budget.

1084
01:54:37,398 --> 01:54:45,465
And so recurring expenses, especially in an era of inflation and contracts and the compounding effect of

1085
01:54:46,384 --> 01:54:56,827
the city's biggest expense, which is personnel contracts, that the operating budget can be very tight and we can have little to no money to spend on new recurring expenses.

1086
01:54:57,407 --> 01:55:13,212
But essentially because of ARPA and the underestimating of some of the local receipts, basically the assumption that the economy will be worse than it ended up being, we did not lose as much money as we thought we would from the pandemic.

1087
01:55:13,372 --> 01:55:15,713
And that's why we've ended up with the free cash balances that we have.

1088
01:55:17,233 --> 01:55:23,174
And then because we had those balances and because interest rates were high, we made money on those balances we weren't expecting to make.

1089
01:55:23,534 --> 01:55:25,635
So that's why we ended up with the balance that we have.

1090
01:55:26,875 --> 01:55:38,117
I'm inclined to say that, you know, one-time expenses like a study is exactly what the one-time funds from a free cash thing should be used for.

1091
01:55:40,937 --> 01:55:43,958
I'm also inclined to say that Corbett Avenue is a residential neighborhood where

1092
01:55:45,655 --> 01:55:47,396
I don't know what you get from leasing the land.

1093
01:55:48,617 --> 01:55:58,344
And, you know, I don't know how much more benefit you get from leasing the land in the long term and having two or three affordable housing units versus the sale of it for this purpose now.

1094
01:55:58,484 --> 01:55:59,865
So I'm just going to say that.

1095
01:56:00,786 --> 01:56:01,066
Councilor

1096
01:56:02,862 --> 01:56:03,242
Thank you.

1097
01:56:03,422 --> 01:56:10,847
I mean, I think the last things that both Councillor Scarpelli and President Behrs said I think way on my mind.

1098
01:56:11,507 --> 01:56:13,488
I think about the practical effects of this.

1099
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:16,310
And, you know, I think

1100
01:56:17,253 --> 01:56:32,948
There's the benefit to having two or three affordable units in that neighborhood, but does that is that outweighed by having an exit study that helps really advance affordable housing trusts work to get many more affordable units in Medford over a longer period of time.

1101
01:56:33,508 --> 01:56:37,552
I think, in my mind, it weighs in favor of that.

1102
01:56:39,821 --> 01:56:43,042
I'm not completely sure how many votes, this needs.

1103
01:56:43,743 --> 01:56:50,505
It's possible that we, it might be wiser to wait until Vice President Collins is online with us.

1104
01:56:51,566 --> 01:56:55,728
I know she was saying that she had some technical difficulties with their computers I don't.

1105
01:56:58,005 --> 01:57:15,890
if, you know, if it's important to have that last voice on the Council, I think it might be wise to retable this, but I did want to have this discussion tonight to hear from Councillors while this paper was still, while the response that we got was on our minds.

1106
01:57:16,391 --> 01:57:20,932
Yeah, I'm almost 100% sure that the conveyance of property is a two thirds of majority.

1107
01:57:21,552 --> 01:57:22,152
Councillor Callahan.

1108
01:57:26,443 --> 01:57:34,526
First, I completely agree that one-time expenses, just like this nexus fee, is exactly what Free Cash is designed for.

1109
01:57:34,546 --> 01:57:35,887
It is what it should be used for.

1110
01:57:36,347 --> 01:57:37,348
We have plenty of free cash.

1111
01:57:37,368 --> 01:57:38,548
We should be using free cash for this.

1112
01:57:38,948 --> 01:57:40,869
Once you sell public lands, it is gone forever.

1113
01:57:40,889 --> 01:57:44,471
I have yet to see that there has been any

1114
01:57:45,451 --> 01:57:52,155
that we're going to have to sort of brainstorming or real in depth study of what could be done with those parcels.

1115
01:57:52,776 --> 01:57:56,378
Uh it isn't simply that there could be permanently affordable housing on them.

1116
01:57:56,618 --> 01:57:58,720
There are many other things that can be done with public lands.

1117
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:07,045
Um and II really urge my city counselors to not rush through to sell public lands when it has not been thought through.

1118
01:58:08,146 --> 01:58:11,208
And to urge the mayor to pay for the next study as soon as

1119
01:58:27,987 --> 01:58:34,351
Is there, I may be missing it in the documentation, but is there a cost for the study that we know?

1120
01:58:34,371 --> 01:58:36,572
Do you know how much the study costs, the nexus?

1121
01:58:36,592 --> 01:58:45,776
The letter that we received from the Affordable Housing Trust, I know numbers have been thrown around.

1122
01:58:47,057 --> 01:58:49,318
Personally, I think we should do all of these nexus studies at once.

1123
01:58:50,459 --> 01:58:52,620
We should do the linkage, the inclusionary,

1124
01:58:53,511 --> 01:59:05,700
whatever's needed for TDM and all the other linkage fees, I think we should just do them all.

1125
01:59:06,061 --> 01:59:12,946
I guess what I'm saying is that the studies, it seems, are not very expensive.

1126
01:59:14,647 --> 01:59:22,313
And I really couldn't agree more with Councilor Callahan that when you sell

1127
01:59:22,921 --> 01:59:25,142
land that's owned by the city.

1128
01:59:25,442 --> 01:59:28,384
You can't, you don't get it back.

1129
01:59:28,764 --> 01:59:30,144
We own these parcels.

1130
01:59:31,245 --> 01:59:35,327
We have a history of selling off lands that we've owned.

1131
01:59:37,988 --> 01:59:41,389
And I think it's a sacrifice that we shouldn't make lately.

1132
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:45,611
And I think there's more potential in these parcels than we're giving them credit for.

1133
01:59:49,482 --> 01:59:58,488
I just I would not be prepared to sell them for the purpose of beginning a study that we could very easily begin in other ways.

1134
01:59:58,508 --> 02:00:04,412
I'm going to go to Councilor Lemming then Councilor Sang and then we do have a DT on on zoom with their hand as well.

1135
02:00:07,113 --> 02:00:12,738
I mean, I'm on the, I'm on the community land trust, which actually is looking at.

1136
02:00:12,758 --> 02:00:16,101
I mean, it's, it's, it's still pretty early stages.

1137
02:00:16,141 --> 02:00:31,994
We're working with some, with some consultants on forming a community land trust for the city and the McCormick Avenue parcels aren't even on the list of city owned land that we would be looking at to build up any sort of,

1138
02:00:33,505 --> 02:00:35,366
Any any sort of affordable housing.

1139
02:00:35,866 --> 02:00:45,109
So there are parcels of land that the city owns that we would be seriously looking into for that purpose.

1140
02:00:45,169 --> 02:00:48,770
But again, these are, I mean, these are too small.

1141
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:56,562
For for that purpose, um, and this clearly has been deliberated specifically at the.

1142
02:00:56,582 --> 02:01:02,924
Uh, within the affordable housing trust, and we received an official communication recommending that.

1143
02:01:03,784 --> 02:01:06,044
Uh, they'd be sold off for this purpose.

1144
02:01:06,705 --> 02:01:14,807
Um, so I would 2nd, the motion to table that, um, I.

1145
02:01:15,451 --> 02:01:21,272
I think that Vice President Collins did seem to be having some internet connectivity issues.

1146
02:01:21,352 --> 02:01:25,493
So this could potentially be taken up at a later time.

1147
02:01:26,614 --> 02:01:31,955
But given that, I would also like to hear what Ms.

1148
02:01:31,975 --> 02:01:33,455
McGor thinks, Ms.

1149
02:01:33,475 --> 02:01:34,515
McGor has to say as well.

1150
02:01:34,956 --> 02:01:35,256
Thank you.

1151
02:01:36,356 --> 02:01:36,676
Thanks.

1152
02:01:36,776 --> 02:01:41,677
There is no motion to table unless someone makes it and that motion is undebatable.

1153
02:01:41,717 --> 02:01:44,338
So if someone makes it, we can't hear from Ms.

1154
02:01:44,358 --> 02:01:44,618
McGor.

1155
02:01:46,406 --> 02:01:46,966
never mind then.

1156
02:01:47,607 --> 02:01:48,968
Sorry, I thought he made a motion to table.

1157
02:01:50,069 --> 02:01:51,130
Councilor Singh suggested it.

1158
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:57,335
Aditi, we'd love to hear from you with what your thoughts are.

1159
02:01:59,376 --> 02:02:00,257
Oh, I have to ask you on mute.

1160
02:02:08,303 --> 02:02:11,806
Good evening, President Bess and members of the city council.

1161
02:02:12,146 --> 02:02:12,807
Am I audible?

1162
02:02:13,667 --> 02:02:14,448
Yes, we can hear you.

1163
02:02:15,147 --> 02:02:17,529
Yeah, thank you for this discussion.

1164
02:02:18,990 --> 02:02:36,461
First to respond to the question about the cost of the nexus study, it would be approximately $80,000, and this would include adding affordable housing linkage and reviewing our existing inclusionary zoning percentages as well.

1165
02:02:37,382 --> 02:02:43,286
And regarding the McCormick Avenue parcels, the two parcels,

1166
02:02:43,979 --> 02:02:48,861
individually, I believe, are assessed at around $35,000 to $40,000.

1167
02:02:48,901 --> 02:02:51,823
This is because they are undevelopable.

1168
02:02:53,324 --> 02:03:10,132
And PDS's recommendation is if they were to be sold or conveyed, it's best if these two parcels are merged by ANR, and then that would increase the assessed value to approximately $435,000.

1169
02:03:14,808 --> 02:03:15,208
Thank you.

1170
02:03:15,268 --> 02:03:17,130
What would we have to do to merge them?

1171
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:19,972
Is there a vote of the council required to do that?

1172
02:03:20,272 --> 02:03:34,484
And... I think, I'm not very sure, but I think it would have to go before the CD board and an ANR process would be required, but I'd have to check with my colleague, Daniel.

1173
02:03:34,504 --> 02:03:36,245
Okay.

1174
02:03:36,545 --> 02:03:37,406
And it sounds like

1175
02:03:40,143 --> 02:03:46,747
just it sounds like that probably, whichever way we end up on this, it's probably not going to hurt us to have the parcels be merged or not merged.

1176
02:03:49,188 --> 02:03:53,951
To clarify, if they're not merged, then the value would be much lower.

1177
02:03:54,251 --> 02:03:55,572
So for each parcel.

1178
02:03:55,592 --> 02:04:05,017
I meant to say that if we end up choosing not to sell the parcels, like let's say the ANR process goes forward and they're merged and then the council doesn't want to convey them.

1179
02:04:05,857 --> 02:04:07,118
That's, it's not really,

1180
02:04:09,223 --> 02:04:10,464
that's not a problem, is it?

1181
02:04:11,365 --> 02:04:13,646
No, that wouldn't be a problem, I believe, yeah.

1182
02:04:14,767 --> 02:04:17,688
All right, I'll go to Councillor, thank you, and I'll go to Councillor Zara.

1183
02:04:18,129 --> 02:04:20,110
You're welcome.

1184
02:04:20,190 --> 02:04:20,550
Thank you.

1185
02:04:21,591 --> 02:04:37,340
Can you clarify for me, undevelopable, does that mean separately as two parcels, or if they were made, because they're next to each other, correct?

1186
02:04:42,048 --> 02:04:42,328
Yes.

1187
02:04:43,449 --> 02:04:48,592
Yes, they are undevelopable because each of these parcels are undersized lots.

1188
02:04:49,393 --> 02:04:53,455
So based on our zoning, these lots are not developable.

1189
02:04:54,236 --> 02:04:54,556
Right.

1190
02:04:54,776 --> 02:05:04,022
So as they are, as our zoning is right now, the two lots, the size that they are now, are undevelopable as the two separate lots.

1191
02:05:04,122 --> 02:05:10,826
But if we put them into one lot, then they are a normal size for something to be put on them

1192
02:05:11,387 --> 02:05:11,727
together?

1193
02:05:14,169 --> 02:05:29,297
Yes, based on our current zoning overhaul and the proposed zoning change, I think once the two parcels are merged, it would allow us to have one single family unit and an ADU.

1194
02:05:30,498 --> 02:05:30,678
right?

1195
02:05:30,978 --> 02:05:32,839
So I think that's an important thing to note here.

1196
02:05:33,019 --> 02:05:39,843
It's that it's there's a somewhat arbitrariness to the fact that this is an undevelopable undevelopable lot.

1197
02:05:39,903 --> 02:05:41,664
It's not that you cannot build something on it.

1198
02:05:41,764 --> 02:05:47,888
It's that because of the way that they're that the lines are drawn because of the way our zoning ordinances are right now.

1199
02:05:48,468 --> 02:05:56,033
Technically, you can't put two houses on these two lots, but that does not mean that you can't physically build something on this space.

1200
02:05:56,453 --> 02:06:00,195
It just means that it's a wonky weird thing right now.

1201
02:06:02,164 --> 02:06:09,986
it does not mean that there is not potential for this to hold a building that could house humans in it eventually.

1202
02:06:10,006 --> 02:06:12,747
Thank you.

1203
02:06:12,787 --> 02:06:12,967
Yes.

1204
02:06:14,808 --> 02:06:15,808
Give us one second here.

1205
02:06:15,828 --> 02:06:17,028
We're having a technical issue.

1206
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:26,491
Yeah, but I don't know if we're broadcasting anymore, at least to YouTube.

1207
02:06:47,548 --> 02:06:51,464
Well, let me just make sure we get this fixed.

1208
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:21,030
Oh, still going.

1209
02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:21,550
All right.

1210
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:30,532
If you click here.

1211
02:07:37,914 --> 02:07:38,754
Okay, I think we're good.

1212
02:07:39,374 --> 02:07:40,175
Is there a motion on the floor.

1213
02:07:42,615 --> 02:07:47,696
On the motion of Councilor saying to table seconded by seconded by Councilor Callahan, any further.

1214
02:07:54,970 --> 02:07:55,570
That's a cow.

1215
02:07:57,352 --> 02:07:58,533
Vice President Collins is absent.

1216
02:07:59,093 --> 02:07:59,674
Councils are.

1217
02:07:59,694 --> 02:07:59,814
Yes.

1218
02:07:59,834 --> 02:08:02,255
That's a lemon.

1219
02:08:03,176 --> 02:08:03,436
Yes.

1220
02:08:04,917 --> 02:08:05,638
Councilor Scarpelli.

1221
02:08:06,919 --> 02:08:09,201
Councilor saying, President bears.

1222
02:08:09,241 --> 02:08:10,161
Yes.

1223
02:08:10,221 --> 02:08:16,346
Negative motions to 5028 loan order MWRA water bonds first reading February 25 2025.

1224
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:22,513
Advertised for second reading March 13th, 2025 in the Medford Transcript of the Somerville Journal.

1225
02:08:23,074 --> 02:08:24,475
Eligible for third reading March 25th, 2025.

1226
02:08:24,555 --> 02:08:28,418
Is there a motion or any further discussion?

1227
02:08:28,998 --> 02:08:39,006
This is for the loan order for the MWRA zero interest plus rebate program to replace lines.

1228
02:08:43,429 --> 02:08:46,151
On the motion to approve for third reading by Councilor Sang seconded by.

02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:49,211
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1230
02:08:49,611 --> 02:08:50,492

Councilor Callahan.

1232
02:08:58,017 --> 02:08:58,137
Yes.

1233
02:08:58,998 --> 02:09:01,759
Vice President Collins is absent, sorry.

1234
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:02,960

Yes.

1236

Councilor Lemming.

1237
02:09:05,402 --> 02:09:05,682
Yes.

1238
02:09:06,583 --> 02:09:07,323
Councilor Scarpelli.

1239
02:09:07,703 --> 02:09:07,863
Yes.

1240
02:09:08,664 --> 02:09:09,204
Councilor Singh.

1241
02:09:09,465 --> 02:09:09,565
Yes.

1242
02:09:09,945 --> 02:09:10,425
President Beers.

1243
02:09:10,445 --> 02:09:10,645
Yes.

1244
02:09:10,685 --> 02:09:11,886
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1245
02:09:11,906 --> 02:09:12,767
The motion passes.

1246
02:09:13,855 --> 02:09:16,537
and the loan order is approved for third reading.

1247
02:09:17,238 --> 02:09:18,159
Public participation.

1248
02:09:18,199 --> 02:09:24,344
If anyone would like to participate on anything for three minutes, they can.

1249
02:09:24,684 --> 02:09:25,785
And I have a hand on Zoom.

1250
02:09:26,786 --> 02:09:29,148
Eunice Brown, name and address for the record, please.

1251
02:09:29,168 --> 02:09:29,928
You have three minutes.

1252
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:32,491
Hi, thanks.

1253
02:09:32,591 --> 02:09:34,092
Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Ave.

1254
02:09:35,426 --> 02:09:43,292
I am asking or looking for an update on the timeline to send the charter to the state legislature.

1255
02:09:44,473 --> 02:09:51,700
As I understand it, two weeks ago on Tuesday, March 11th, the city council voted to send their version to the mayor.

1256
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,742
Presumably she got that within a day or two.

1257
02:09:56,043 --> 02:10:02,089
That means then that she's had the city council version for review for almost two weeks.

1258
02:10:03,308 --> 02:10:06,772
Um, the 2 versions of the charter are markedly different.

1259
02:10:07,413 --> 02:10:09,195
And some very critical elements.

1260
02:10:10,016 --> 02:10:14,361
Including, but not limited to the composition of the city council.

1261
02:10:14,982 --> 02:10:20,288
The mayor is the chair of the school committee and article 8, which is the citizen.

1262
02:10:20,989 --> 02:10:23,312
Participation mechanisms among others.

1263
02:10:24,485 --> 02:10:29,427
Both the mayor and the city council need to agree on a document that gets sent to the state legislature.

1264
02:10:30,447 --> 02:10:37,309
The timeline has the mayor sending the charter to the state by the end of March, the 1st of April, which is next week.

1265
02:10:38,609 --> 02:10:50,393
President Behrs, as you said on the 11th, if there is negotiating to be done to arrive at a final document, there may need to be another committee of the whole and then a vote at a regular meeting.

1266
02:10:51,033 --> 02:10:53,234
And that pushes us well into April.

1267
02:10:54,391 --> 02:10:56,473
So my questions are as follows.

1268
02:10:57,834 --> 02:10:59,015
Where do things stand?

1269
02:10:59,896 --> 02:11:03,379
Are you both actively negotiating to iron out the differences?

1270
02:11:03,959 --> 02:11:06,381
Or is one party acquiescing to the other?

1271
02:11:06,401 --> 02:11:09,404
Are additional meetings planned?

1272
02:11:10,505 --> 02:11:12,806
When will the document be sent to the state?

1273
02:11:13,547 --> 02:11:22,855
And is there a drop dead date where it has to go to the state legislature in time for their review and return so that it gets placed on the ballot?

1274
02:11:24,299 --> 02:11:28,924
And will there be a final copy available to the public?

1275
02:11:29,885 --> 02:11:44,140
And then assuming all of that happens, and I don't know if this is your bailiwick or the mayor's office or what, but this is a very dense document, a dense project, a lot of

1276
02:11:45,651 --> 02:11:53,015
you know, things went into it, how is the public going to be educated on the charter for them to make an informed vote?

1277
02:11:53,575 --> 02:11:58,437
Will there be more education, more than just a ballot question?

1278
02:11:59,758 --> 02:12:00,819
So thank you very much.

1279
02:12:00,859 --> 02:12:02,119
I look forward to your response.

1280
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:04,821
Thank you for the question.

1281
02:12:06,081 --> 02:12:09,203
We did submit the amended draft to the mayor

1282
02:12:10,284 --> 02:12:24,974
I think the Thursday the 13th, so two days after the regular meeting, we have not received back anything in writing formally from the mayor about her proposed changes.

1283
02:12:25,855 --> 02:12:36,061
My understanding certainly is, you know, that did pass this council six to zero with one absent, and the mayor could send it off as amended right now.

1284
02:12:37,502 --> 02:12:39,464
When we hear back from the mayor about

1285
02:12:40,527 --> 02:12:52,431
Uh, if she wants to negotiate further, if there are changes, um, that she wants to make, uh, to the amendments that we proposed, we would definitely schedule another meeting to discuss that.

1286
02:12:53,031 --> 02:13:00,674
Um, but that's the status of it now in terms of what happens in terms of a drop dead date and what happens before an elect a vote on a ballot.

1287
02:13:00,694 --> 02:13:02,974
Uh, there's technically no drop dead date.

1288
02:13:03,275 --> 02:13:07,276
Uh, this is all about will the legislature take it up and, uh, you know,

1289
02:13:09,272 --> 02:13:11,694
it's kind of a black box.

1290
02:13:11,734 --> 02:13:13,415
They don't have any disclosure or anything.

1291
02:13:15,036 --> 02:13:25,623
Certainly they could, we could send it to them, you know, the first week in April, they could take it up the second week in April and we could have it done the third week in April, but that really all depends on them taking action.

1292
02:13:27,324 --> 02:13:38,112
What we know basically from the Collins Center is that both drafts, the draft from the CSC as changed by the mayor and then the draft that from the mayor that we amended

1293
02:13:39,105 --> 02:13:44,016
that there's nothing in any of those that is outside the scope of what the legislature generally approves for.

1294
02:13:46,752 --> 02:13:52,854
for charters so we didn't include anything like rank choice voting or budget authority for the council or any of those types of things.

1295
02:13:54,034 --> 02:14:09,298
We also have been told that the legislature prefers supermajority or near unanimity on homeworld petitions of this matter so it was sent you know our we voted six to zero with one absent in the past when we had sent up

1296
02:14:09,878 --> 02:14:12,200
home rule petitions to create an elected charter commission.

1297
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:14,082
Those have been by votes of four to three.

1298
02:14:14,582 --> 02:14:16,864
And so the legislature chose not to act on them.

1299
02:14:18,386 --> 02:14:34,400
In terms of an education campaign, I don't know what the mayor's team would have planned around that or what information would be put forward on the city website, or what private entities, individuals or groups that might form around the ballot questions would do.

1300
02:14:37,164 --> 02:14:51,648
Okay, because my understanding was that the whole idea of getting it to the legislature sooner than later was because once they get bogged down in their budget stuff, they just don't have time for this.

1301
02:14:52,769 --> 02:14:57,190
That is kind of the reading of the tea leaves that we're trying to match up with.

1302
02:14:57,270 --> 02:15:02,132
But end of March, early April is kind of what we were told.

1303
02:15:02,192 --> 02:15:05,933
I think House Ways and Means generally puts out their

1304
02:15:07,108 --> 02:15:11,451
draft, it's either the week before Patriots Day or the week of Patriots Day.

1305
02:15:12,652 --> 02:15:17,395
So certainly if we could get it in before then, that might be sufficient.

1306
02:15:18,195 --> 02:15:23,139
But Collins Center said last week of March, first week of April would be ideal.

1307
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:34,186
OK, so basically at this point, I would expect that there would probably be some negotiating

1308
02:15:36,041 --> 02:15:37,442
know, between the two groups.

1309
02:15:38,123 --> 02:15:40,005
So sounds like there's a bit more to come then.

1310
02:15:40,025 --> 02:15:45,970
Yeah, when we receive a formal response from the mayor, we'll schedule whatever's needed.

1311
02:15:46,411 --> 02:15:52,516
Unless of course, that is that she sent the draft that we sent to her to the legislature, in which case there would not need to be any further meetings.

1312
02:15:53,797 --> 02:15:55,259
Yeah, we'll see.

1313
02:15:55,719 --> 02:15:56,740
Okay, thank you very much.

1314
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:57,441
I appreciate it.

1315
02:15:58,182 --> 02:15:58,542
Thank you.

1316
02:16:04,303 --> 02:16:05,904
Any further public participation.

1317
02:16:10,849 --> 02:16:17,935
Seeing none, are there any motions on the floor on the motion of adjourned by Councilor Callahan seconded by Councilor saying, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1318
02:16:19,917 --> 02:16:24,481
Council Callahan, Vice President Collins is absent Council is our Council Lemming.

1319
02:16:24,841 --> 02:16:25,061
Yes.

1320
02:16:30,989 --> 02:16:34,333
Yes 60 affirmative one absent the motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
