    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1910.79s">Good</a>  evening Councilor Bayer, City Councilors, Kathleen A. Desmond, 335 Main Street Stoneham, lower office of Kathleen A. Desmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1917.812s">I'm</a>  here this evening on behalf of in Realty Medford LLC and Scrub-A-Dub Auto Wash Centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1925.094s">I</a>  did provide you, I know that the package is at home, but really there's 10 pages that deal with the issues themselves and then the remainder exhibits. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1937.559s">We</a>  had, we had dealt with some of the issues previously with the former building commissioner as to use in special permit whether it was a pre existing non conforming use or a special permit use. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1951.394s">So</a>  I wanted you to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1954.017s">that</a>  submission that we had submitted to the building commissioner at the time, and that's probably about half of what you have before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1963.519s">There's</a>  essentially two issues in this regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1965.96s">The</a>  first is relative to notice of the denial and the sufficiency of the denial that was issued by the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1976.822s">And</a>  the second issue is the more substantive issue that deals with whether or not this was an abandoned <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1984.104s">use.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1985.004s">The</a>  commissioner had determined, I believe, based on what we have, although the site isn't specific, that because the car wash had been out of use for two years, he determined it to be out of use for two years, that the sign <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2002.71s">which</a>  was a nonconforming structure associated with the use, was also abandoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2008.492s">We</a>  had gone through a lot of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2010.592s">And</a>  just by way of background, 42 Fulbright Street is a 12,716 square foot parcel of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2017.315s">It</a>  sits at the end of Fulbright Street, adjacent to Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2020.896s">It's</a>  a very small strip of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2022.976s">The</a>  double-sided pylon sign sits on the southeasterly portion of the lot and is approximately 31.9 feet in height. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2032.9s">and</a>  100 square feet in the sign face itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2040.067s">It's</a>  a 10 by 10 sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2042.129s">The</a>  existing sign is readily visible from Route 93 and somewhat visible from Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2047.655s">But</a>  honestly, with all the construction and the work that is going on in the buildings that are anticipated, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2053.36s">in</a>  that specific area, the sign is not visible, and if it were reduced in size, it's unclear whether you could even see the sign from Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2065.792s">You</a>  would be able to see it from 93, which would show the location, but it would be smaller, and the roofing of Scrub-a-Dub may also be in the way based on where the sign is situated. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2077.963s">The</a>  application, as I said, to reface, and that's all that was intended in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2082.145s">So</a>  there was no intent to change the structure of the sign at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2086.426s">It</a>  was simply to take out the plastic panels which are in the existing sign and replace the Minuteman <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2094.869s">Minuteman</a>  sign with the scrub-a-dub sign, which I provided in your materials, the Barron Chevrolet case, which indicates that even if this were a non-conforming pre-existing structure, that this is not a change or an alteration to that structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2112.821s">It's</a>  simply refacing the sign, the identification of the language within the sign panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2119.525s">such</a>  as if you had a Dunkin' Donuts and it was changed to a Starbucks, it's only changing the interfacing of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2127.29s">There</a>  were two separate issues outlined in the memorandum that I filed with council as to abandonment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2134.694s">The</a>  first being that this car was granted a special permit in 1966. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2140.657s">And</a>  there were no conditions associated with that permit that would limit the duration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2146.9s">of</a>  the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2151.165s">And</a>  so the two-year abandonment rule with respect to a pre-existing non-conforming <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2157.968s">structure</a>  would not apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2160.129s">And</a>  I put two cases in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2162.929s">The</a>  Cumberland Farms case, which distinguishes between a special permit and a non-conforming use. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2168.971s">And</a>  then the Labisser Building Corp case, which I think is very much on point because that was a condominium development where they initiated the first phase of the condominium within the two years required under Chapter 48, Section 9. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2184.914s">But</a>  then there was a 17-year lapse in time <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2188.155s">When</a>  that first phase of the development was initiated to when they continued development, and the court indicated in that case that we have a special permit with no conditions, as long as they satisfy the chapter 48 section nine, two year requirement of beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2207.151s">construction</a>  or taking some activity on the special permit within two years of it first being granted, that the 17-year lapse has no impact whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2215.635s">And</a>  that's not what we're talking about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2219.657s">This</a>  is a case where, and we didn't have the affidavit of Peter Silk at the time we submitted to building because it was Christmas time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2228.621s">They</a>  didn't have any ability to get ahold of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2233.337s">He</a>  did eventually return their call and I produced an affidavit to the council, which shows that it had been operational up until December 31 of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2243.206s">It</a>  goes through his affidavit goes through the fact that there was a fire in 2018 late in 2018, which closed the premises for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2255.542s">At</a>  that point, they brought it back up and they were operating and then I think people sometimes forget or want to put it out of their minds that there was a thing called COVID, which happened in 2020, which might explain why there wasn't any activity from <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2271.328s">from</a>  a late 2019 to 2020, the summer of 2020, because many car washes were shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2279.671s">And</a>  in his affidavit, he indicates that he complied with the city of Medford's requirements that he remained in a shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2286.554s">He</a>  did open up again after that per his affidavit and continued business. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2291.356s">It</a>  was less than what it had been pre-COVID, but I think that happened to a lot of businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2297.198s">And</a>  he ceased operations of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2301.0s">of</a>  the car wash itself on December 31st, except for washing, you know, friends' cars and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2307.644s">But</a>  at that time, and his affidavit indicates that, and I've provided you with a copy of the listing agreement, he listed the property for sale in March of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2318.17s">And</a>  in that listing also included the sign and the, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2325.598s">the</a>  building itself and I believe that was provided to the, to the building department the listing itself is evidence that there was some continuation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2334.561s">And</a>  then my clients purchased the property in September of 22, and they, they filed after that permits in order to renovate the project, and we had worked with <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2347.344s">the</a>  prior building commissioner from I think October of 2022, we eventually we had gone through all these issues again with whether this was a special permit or a pre-existing non-conforming use. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2360.756s">And</a>  you know they can't be both because it's either allowed by special permit or it's something that's not allowed by the ordinance or the statute at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2369.843s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2372.626s">And</a>  then I provided to you as well the case of, let me just find the case, Stone J. Fitch, which is in your materials, which deals with abandonment and non-use. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2386.876s">And</a>  that case clearly indicates that the definition of abandonment and non-use is, let me get that, generally non-use, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2400.192s">of</a>  a non-conforming structure requires both vacancy and the lack of any attempt to rent, sell, or maintain the structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2408.095s">So</a>  in this case, it's clearly a continuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2411.076s">He</a>  operated the business until December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2414.097s">March,</a>  he put that, March of the following year, March 22, he put the building up for sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2420.5s">And</a>  also, and the sign was part of that listing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2424.821s">The</a>  sale went through on September of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2426.962s">And</a>  from that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2429.905s">my</a>  client undertook the permitting process to renovate that building and put it back into a car wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2436.911s">So</a>  although I don't believe that this is a pre-existing use and that that whole analysis does not apply because it was a special permit and the use does not lapse, I think that even if you looked at it as a pre-existing non-conforming use, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2455.538s">that</a>  this hasn't been abandoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2457.92s">And</a>  certainly there hasn't been two years between the time of, there isn't actually any span of time which it wasn't in use. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2471.169s">The</a>  building inspector determined that he couldn't find anything that would indicate <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2476.714s">that</a>  the use extended beyond 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2479.216s">But</a>  we did have at that time Yelp reviews which I provided to the building department, and I also provided fiscal year 2022 records of not only real estate taxes but also <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2493.79s">personal</a>  property taxes that were paid by the business, which would indicate that there was equipment that was in there which was being utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2502.499s">As</a>  I said, we didn't have the affidavit of Peter Silk at that point because we hadn't been able to make contact with him, but we did make contact with him and he provided <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2512.742s">the</a>  affidavit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2514.524s">I</a>  think after I also received notice that there was a contract in fact with the Medford Police Department to wash cars that extended beyond 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2523.073s">So,</a>  you know, this isn't a situation where there's an abandoned use and, and, you know, my client simply just wants to change the facing of the sign to change the name from <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2535.141s">minute</a>  man car wash to scrub a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2539.184s">With</a>  regard to the second issue and and notice, I detailed it in my memorandum but essentially, the ordinance requires 6.2 point six requires that there be specific provisions, which are denied, and and that that you have notices to what is actually being <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2558.657s">denied.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2559.318s">And</a>  none of the information that we received gave a specific denial with specific sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2565.683s">And</a>  in fact, it varied somewhat from the January 8th when it was clear that this was a denial because there are emails within which indicate that there hadn't been a formal denial. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2578.655s">January</a>  8th, they received an email that it had been denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2582.739s">But</a>  again, there were different sections cited in that as opposed to what, what was received from community development and there was no formal denial issue by the building department on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2596.148s">And</a>  the only denial that I have is that January 8 where it was clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2599.59s">that</a>  we weren't trying to converse in terms of what what we had in terms of evidence that in fact this was a continuing operation but that it was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2609.82s">So,</a>  that's the second argument that the denial doesn't meet the requirements of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2616.206s">And,</a>  you know, I appealed on January 8 because it was clear at that point that it was a denial from the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2624.41s">So</a>  that is, in essence, what our case is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2630.014s">When</a>  we went through the Zoning Board of Appeals case, there was never, at that point, an issue discussed as to abandonment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2636.919s">The</a>  issue at that point was, is this a sleepy car wash going to a more <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2645.439s">more</a>  active car wash, and does that require some modification of a special permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2651.663s">And</a>  that's where we got into the discussion with the prior building commissioner, Bill Forde, and that memo you have to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2662.991s">And</a>  the sign was always included within our plans.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2668.103s">Thank</a>  you, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2669.184s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Scarpelli, then I have a couple of questions of other Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2672.586s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Scarpelli, other Councilors, then I have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2675.147s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2675.947s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2676.848s">I</a>  thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2677.768s">Desmond</a>  for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2679.87s">You</a>  make a compelling case, but unfortunately, like I told you, I've reached out to the building department and I'm trying to get some legal support. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2691.116s">Unfortunately,</a>  this Council, none of us have a legal background yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2698.729s">Unless</a>  Justin can hurry up and get over with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2702.294s">But</a>  that school's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2704.016s">Can</a>  I scare him straight? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2706.158s">Yeah,</a>  so I think that ultimately, you know, tabling this motion until we get some legal contact from <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2718.312s">the</a>  mayor's legal teams to assist us with any questions we have, because right now, I'd have to support building departments as the professionals in this entity, but I don't want to rule on something without the proper knowledge or understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2735.448s">So</a>  my recommendation that we table this, Mr. President, until we have legal <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2742.025s">legal</a>  response. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2743.387s">Um,</a>  what Mrs. with Miss Desmond has, uh, shared with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2747.892s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2750.875s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2751.415s">Um,</a>  any further discussion second on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2755.159s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2758.883s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2759.123s">Um,</a>  I'm gonna say something somewhat similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2762.207s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2764.208s">This</a>  is not our specialty. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2766.331s">We</a>  have a building department that it is their specialty. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2769.916s">I</a>  don't quite understand why this has come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2775.202s">It</a>  seems like <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2777.247s">at</a>  a minimum, like, I don't know if this is the proper process that like, at some point, if we are the appeal authority, we are the final authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2786.57s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2787.951s">I</a>  think having, you know, the someone from the building department here would be incredibly helpful to understand the final issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2796.934s">You</a>  know, I have not read any word in this large town. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2801.015s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2804.598s">On</a>  the face of it, I mean, you just want to change the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2808.24s">It</a>  seems pretty reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2809.741s">But</a>  again, this is not our specialty. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2812.403s">We</a>  are not the people who normally do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2815.065s">So</a>  I would at least want to have at least a little someone from the building department chime in to understand why have they not approved this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2823.291s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2826.873s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2829.683s">I</a>  just had a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2832.447s">One,</a>  I know that the sales now about two and a half, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2839.537s">Have</a>  they done any construction at the site.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2842.05s">So</a>  what's happened is they had issues with national grid and lines had to be moved in order to do that we didn't finish the permitting process probably until I want to say, July or September of 2023, and then they had some issues they did their permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2860.035s">submitted</a>  for a building permit they have a building permit, but they're delayed and actually I think they're just starting demolition today because National Grid had to move some poles and order them for them to bring in the equipment that they needed to do when they had to do a design of the of the project before that so it was an extended period of time, Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2881.804s">Matt</a>  is on, Matt Paisner is on Zoom, and he can probably better explain to you what the delays have been in moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2891.749s">I'll</a>  ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2892.59s">If</a>  you could just give us your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Paisner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2896.251s">Matthew</a>  Paisner, 17 Commerce Ave, Newton, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2901.755s">It's</a>  my home address, Scrub-A-Dub headquarters, 172 Worcester Street, Natick, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2907.296s">Obviously</a>  this property is to Fulbright Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2910.977s">Not</a>  sure which address you needed, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2913.478s">And</a>  any of those was fine.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Paisner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2916.118s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2917.599s">I'm</a>  a third generation family business owner in Scrub-A-Dub. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2921.34s">As</a>  Kathy alluded to, we acquired this property shortly after the Silk family listed it for sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2929.001s">Peter</a>  Silk is a fourth generation car washer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2932.682s">He</a>  closed the business and listed it for sale a couple months later and we bought it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2938.986s">I</a>  went through a very lengthy permitting process with the former Building Commissioner Forte. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2944.108s">Our</a>  plan was initially to demolish the entire structure and we were not allowed to do that, so we had to work through plans to remodel the existing structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2954.354s">We</a>  invested over $3 million to buy a 12,000 square foot <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2959.436s">parcel,</a>  partly due to the iconic pylon sign, which is a landmark off the highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2964.561s">Our</a>  vision is simply to renovate and restore the car wash to its former glory and give the city a beautiful car wash like it deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2974.571s">So</a>  after we <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2976.143s">were</a>  approved with the zoning board and all of our plans did include a copy of the existing pylon sign, which I can share, just showing that we were changing the face from Minuteman Car Wash to Scrub-a-Dub Car Wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2989.029s">In</a>  fact, there's bold annotations on all the site plans reviewed by the former building commissioner and the zoning board that says protect existing pylon sign in its current format. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=2999.055s">Simply</a>  replace the plastic panel inside that says Minuteman to Scrub-a-Dub. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3004.266s">We</a>  went to go for our building permit and we were bringing in contractors and the subcontractors were not able to bring in certain equipment needed for demolition due to power lines that were too close to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3019.391s">It</a>  took us over a year and close to $100,000 with National Grid to get them to move those power lines and adjust some poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3028.494s">We've</a>  just installed construction fencing this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3031.873s">and</a>  we're looking to start our demolition and construction as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3036.456s">It</a>  was a major surprise to our family when we submitted our sign permit package and we were given notice that all of a sudden the pylon sign was being viewed as abandoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3049.785s">The</a>  sign was in fact even left on from the time that <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3052.667s">Peter</a>  Silk closed the business to the time that we acquired it and we continued to leave it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3057.83s">And</a>  so this was a huge surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3059.892s">And</a>  then as Kathy alluded to, we were never given any formal denial letter or notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3065.135s">Kathy</a>  did represent us with the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3068.237s">So</a>  we engaged her again on this matter to say, hey, we know there's a new building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3072.359s">We're</a>  not sure if there's a misunderstanding or what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3074.901s">But</a>  we spent a lot of money on this property and planned on keeping the existing sign in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3082.687s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3087.149s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3087.589s">I</a>  appreciate that context. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3094.452s">It</a>  looks like there's some improvements to the private way as part of the site plan as well.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3101.328s">Well</a>  it's, there's improvements to the, how it, it works in terms of traffic and whatnot I don't recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3111.512s">Yeah,</a>  right and the parking is not because you can park on the private way so we had, we had an extended discussion during that whole site plan about the whole use and <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3120.215s">and</a>  the parking and all of that that came into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3123.877s">And</a>  I know, you know, I don't have a note specific, but I know that there was a question at one point as to what was happening with the sign, and it was only that we were, you know, taking the plastic out and putting new plastic in, which under the Barron Chevrolet case is not even a change of structure or anything that would extend to an alteration.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3143.549s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3144.41s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3146.571s">Any</a>  further questions by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3151.764s">It</a>  was the motion of Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3153.005s">I</a>  mean, my two senses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3155.427s">We</a>  could, and no offense Kathy, we could pay lawyers more money to talk about the sign more, but I don't think we're really going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3165.294s">It</a>  seems to me that we're just changing out the name of the car wash on a sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3168.496s">And</a>  so my, my perspective is that I don't have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3174.441s">But</a>  we do have a motion by Councilor Scarpelli to table pending for the legal review. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3181.835s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3185.679s">I</a>  guess my first question is, if this waits a week or two is that gonna be horrible like is there some is there some great urgency.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3193.322s">No,</a>  I don't have any issue with what the city council decides to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3199.367s">I</a>  don't think I raised that as an issue, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3204.131s">Great,</a>  awesome.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3205.552s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just saying we could go to KP Law and we could pay them to give us an answer, but that's just my perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3213.359s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3217.287s">The</a>  motion by Councilor Scavaglia was to table, I think it was for legal review by the legal, the mayor's legal team, which is KP. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3227.81s">Do</a>  we wanna adjust that? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3228.85s">Do</a>  we wanna include the first, just get something from the building department? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3234.272s">Sorry,</a>  let me just unmute you, George.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3236.973s">That's</a>  my confusion, building department ruled on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3239.153s">That's</a>  in their brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3241.494s">So</a>  I'm not saying that I don't agree with, I don't agree or disagree with them, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3246.372s">Unfortunately,</a>  we don't have a city solicitor, and unfortunately, we do have to pay an outside legal team to answer some of our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3254.318s">If</a>  my fellow Councilors would move on that, that's their purview, but I really think that it's still strong that we need legal, not that I don't trust or respect you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3265.407s">Desmond.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3267.513s">I</a>  work for the city of Medford and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3269.434s">Department</a>  works for us for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3271.935s">So</a>  I think it's important that we do get a legal response. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3275.776s">Um,</a>  we've spent a lot of money on frivolous, uh, law questions for many, many years here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3283.419s">And,</a>  uh, I, I feel council president bears his philosophy on, um, giving KP law any more money than we don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3292.721s">I</a>  think that it leaves us with, without a city solicitor, it leaves us with the only option, which is to have our legal team to make sure that what was provided with our building department and what you provided us gives us a better understanding so we can make the proper decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3312.71s">So,</a>  like I said, if it's two weeks, we wait for our next city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3318.713s">Hopefully</a>  we have an answer and we move on this as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3322.869s">scrub-a-dub</a>  can start working. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3324.91s">So</a>  I know Councilor Beza's car is filthy and he's been waiting for it to open.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3329.914s">I</a>  can't wait to go through either.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3332.996s">So</a>  I understand his frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3334.657s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3338.159s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3341.341s">I</a>  was just gonna say that I would side with Councilor Scarpelli on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3347.145s">I</a>  think that there is, it would be appropriate to get some <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3352.795s">legal</a>  review from the city side on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3357.118s">I</a>  didn't hear if his motion had a second or not, because on Zoom, I don't hear anybody unless they turn their microphone on, but if there hasn't been a second, I'd like to second that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3373.128s">What</a>  did we just say?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3375.99s">Oh,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3378.052s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Saint and Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3382.845s">Um,</a>  um, I would support going to the building departments first seeing if they have an opinion on this for their ruling, their opinion is in here.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3391.973s">It's</a>  just that it doesn't meet the current size of the sign ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3395.536s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I don't know if they have something more about it, because I think that there is compelling enough case law to challenge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3403.103s">So,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3404.945s">Yeah,</a>  I mean,</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3408.657s">for</a>  clarifying that we are in fact the appropriate body for this to come to after the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3412.72s">Given</a>  that, I would actually prefer rather than paying the, I don't think we need to pay a legal team. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3417.604s">I</a>  think that we want to honestly hear from the building department and whether they show up here or whether, you know, at the thing so we can ask them questions or whether, you know, we can have an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3427.953s">Like,</a>  I read it and it's like, they just want to change what's on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3432.156s">Like,</a>  it seems like a no-brainer and I just want to understand from the building department, like, why is it that <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3438.315s">They</a>  can't like I've read the legalese, but like I would love to have the building department chime in.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3443.903s">I</a>  don't think we need the law offices particularly but I'm going to go to Kathy in just a second but I've talked to Scott not about this specifically but. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3453.357s">I</a>  think he's saying because they're saying that it's an expired special permit and not a pre-existing non-conforming use, that because it is a sign that is bigger than the signs allowed by the sign ordinance, he's required to deny it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3465.186s">That's</a>  how I'm reading what is presented here.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3467.368s">And</a>  ultimately, that's a legal issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3469.509s">I</a>  don't know where the expired special permit comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3471.931s">And</a>  I've provided cases which indicate that, in fact, you have a 17 year span before a <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3477.055s">a</a>  development, as long as you meet the section nine, you start action within two years of approval of the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3484.618s">If</a>  there's no conditions and I think that's every special permit has conditions now, but in 1966, there were no conditions on that special permit as to duration or activity <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3495.341s">or</a>  anything, and because that is the case and that's the best for case that if there's no conditions, then there's no conditions on the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3505.13s">So</a>  it's our position isn't it's a legal position that it's not expired.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3510.135s">But</a>  yeah, I think either we can just go forward or we have to go to the legal, I think that's kind of where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3516.1s">So</a>  we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3518.676s">to</a>  table this and request legal review of the petition, seconded by Councilor Leming, and I will go to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3529.241s">Since</a>  you've had more conversations about this, just to that one point, just what you said before, I think I would feel comfortable voting on it tonight because I think this is, you know, it's just a sign that's already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3546.634s">All</a>  they want is this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3551.376s">And</a>  I don't think this changes the manner, the purpose, or the effect of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3558.798s">And</a>  that's my stance on it, rather than pay lawyers to discuss this even more and to end up in a very similar place in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3566.721s">So</a>  that's my view on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3568.582s">But</a>  I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3570.34s">Um,</a>  the desire to table and, um, I think just just to save us money, I'll vote no on tabling and yes on the question if it gets that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3581.208s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3581.889s">We</a>  have the motion and second of Councilor Scarapelli and Councilor Leming to table and refer to legal for review of the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3589.854s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="../resolutions/25-040.pdf"><font color="green">25-040</font></a> offered by Vice President Collins resolution in support of the full time lecturers at Tufts University and their fight for a fair contract.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3639.658s">Let</a>  me get the actual language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3643.775s">Whereas</a>  the 125 full-time lecturers in the School of Arts and Sciences at Tufts have been unionized with SEIU 509 since 2016 and have been bargaining for their third contract since April 2024, seeking a fair contract that allows for both livable salaries and manageable workloads. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3661.834s">Whereas</a>  FTLs at Tufts create and teach classes, grade exams, advise and mentor students, and perform essential services that keep Tufts running, including, in the case of many FTLs, coordinating academic programs, directing graduate admissions and degrees, and supporting extra and co-curricular activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3678.539s">And</a>  whereas Tufts University prides itself on the high-quality educational experience provided to students, and valuing a quality educational experience means investing in teachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3688.741s">And</a>  whereas lectures working conditions are students learning environments, and whereas the cost of living has increased 21% since 2020, while the average FTL salary has increased only 13.1%, and salaries for FTLs at Tufts ranked 12th out of 13 university among its institutional peers in the integrated post-secondary education data system IPEDS, and <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3712.222s">Whereas</a>  from 2019 to 2023, undergraduate enrollment in the School of Arts and Sciences grew by 12.4%, while full-time faculty growth was only 6.4%, leading to FTLs increasingly being overworked. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3725.068s">And</a>  whereas Tufts promises a student-faculty ratio of 9 to 1 and an average class size of approximately 20, while in reality, many entry-level courses taught by FTLs have enrollments between 100 and 400 students, in which FTLs often serve as informal and formal advisors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3741.475s">and</a>  whereas Tufts University charges undergraduates the highest college tuition in Massachusetts and the fifth highest in the country and reported a $34 million surplus in the School of Arts and Sciences in academic year 2023-2024, and whereas Tufts leadership has continued to offer bargaining proposals that prioritize budget austerity over workers' health and livelihoods and has continued to reject proposals to increase salaries <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3767.022s">and</a>  make modest improvements in the direction of a living wage without adding to the burden of already unmanageable workloads. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3773.487s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support the Tufts University Full-Time Lecturers Union, SEIU 509, and call upon Tufts University to prioritize investing in its teachers because both livable wages and sustainable workloads are essential to workers and to the university more broadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3791.202s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3793.497s">Thank</a>  you president bears for reading out the full text of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3797.28s">I'm</a>  glad to have collaborated with members of 509 on this resolution and I thank them for bringing their fight for a fair contract to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3811.271s">I</a>  was talking about this resolution with some community members before the meeting and over the weekend and they said, you know, why is this a Medford issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3818.219s">And</a>  to that I say, you know, Tufts is a huge employer in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3823.565s">So</a>  many members of our community are involved with Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3826.948s">In</a>  various ways, perhaps they work at Tufts or teach at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3830.032s">Tufts</a>  is a major employer in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3832.014s">It</a>  has a major footprint in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3833.837s">And</a>  when it comes to fair employment, fair wages, and the right to collectively bargain, this is a rising tide lifts all boats issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3842.307s">And</a>  with a large, ostensibly non-for-profit that is such an outsized presence and an outsized footprint in our community, I think it's the least that we can do to say we must participate in holding you accountable to treating all workers with fairness, and at the very least, participating in good faith with efforts to collectively bargain. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3865.174s">Our</a>  relationship with Tufts University and the city of Medford overlaps in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3871.015s">We've</a>  spoken at length in these chambers about the payment in lieu of tax agreement that the city of Medford has with Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3879.599s">What</a>  we are talking about is a very large, extremely well-endowed, very powerful institution that absolutely has the resources to pay its workers commensurate with their value, to pay them competitively, and to pay them so that they can comfortably live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3900.088s">And</a>  so I hope that my fellow councillors will join me tonight in urging them to do just that and to engage in a good faith negotiation process with these essential Tufts University workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3913.433s">But</a>  more importantly, I understand that there are a couple members of the bargaining unit that are attending the city council meeting tonight, and I'm sure that they can speak to their efforts much more eloquently than I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3924.498s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3929.428s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3930.868s">Any</a>  comments from members of the Council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3938.151s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3939.851s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3940.412s">There</a>  you go.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3941.352s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3942.172s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3944.033s">I</a>  think that we know the support of this Council supports all of our unions, and bringing this forward is so important, but I would <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3951.988s">recommend</a>  or I would I would request that we amend this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3958.17s">I</a>  received a bunch of phone calls today after members of our workforce here in method read this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3965.311s">And</a>  if we could amend it to also read that that the City Council support the city administration priorities, municipal unions that have been working without a contract for some over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3977.474s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3978.513s">as</a>  we're talking with one breath, a city entity that we're going to support and making sure that there's fair wages, which I totally support a thousand percent, but I would also in the same breath, keep our municipal workers that are working without a contract in the forefront along with this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4001.598s">If</a>  you could, Mr. President, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4004.259s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4006.46s">Any</a>  further comments by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4009.935s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4013.919s">You</a>  provide your name and address for the record at the podium, raise your hand on Zoom, and you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Helen McCreery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4021.218s">All</a>  right, thank you so much for considering this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4024.622s">My</a>  name is Helen McCreary, 200 College Ave, Medford, 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4029.627s">So</a>  I'm a full-time lecturer in the biology department at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4035.413s">This</a>  is my third year at that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4038.156s">I'm</a>  here tonight because the status quo at Tufts is simply not working for lecturers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4042.921s">As</a>  you know, or as you may know, we've been negotiating for almost a year to gain a livable wage and a reasonable workload. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4049.566s">I'm</a>  going to talk very briefly about each of those issues, starting with workload. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4053.809s">Right</a>  now, I am teaching 480 students in one introductory biology course. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4059.333s">This</a>  is bigger than that course has ever been, in large part because the number of students has been increasing, as you've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4064.957s">Last</a>  year, I had 430 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4066.539s">That</a>  was also a record. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4068.92s">The</a>  increase in the number of students and the tuition dollars coming to Tufts has not been matched by an adequate increase in support provided for the learning of those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4079.908s">So</a>  I simply cannot provide the kind of education that I want to, the kind of education that's promised by Tufts, and that Tufts students' tuition ought to pay for when I have that many students in my course. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4091.036s">In</a>  the fall semester as a whole, the roughly 120 lecturers in the School of Arts and Sciences taught a total of about 10,000 students in their courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4099.523s">The</a>  top notch education that Tufts is known for is delivered largely on our backs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4105.345s">But</a>  my colleagues that have a lot much smaller courses are just as overworked. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4109.146s">By</a>  teaching, they often teach, they generally teach more courses at a time and also by other responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4114.507s">Our</a>  work is not just teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4116.168s">Over</a>  the next two weeks, I'll be meeting individually, personally with 30 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4120.108s">My</a>  advisees about the courses they're going to take in the fall, that's 30 meetings over the next two weeks on top of all of my other regular meetings, teaching and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4128.17s">Written</a>  23 letters of recommendation for students so far this year, have more outstanding that I need to write, more requests coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4135.352s">We</a>  serve on committees within our departments across the university where we provide all sorts of formal and informal advising and mentorship coordinate programs, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4144.56s">So</a>  my main point is that we provide us with a ton of valuable labor, and I am talking about monetary value. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4151.979s">It's</a>  no secret Tufts tuition is high. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4153.661s">The</a>  all-in cost of attendance for this year is over $92,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4158.145s">That's</a>  a lot more money than I make per year, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4163.11s">So</a>  with all these courses and students that lecturers teach, we are bringing in a huge portion of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4170.217s">And</a>  most Tufts lecturers can't afford to live in Medford or other nearby communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4176.568s">I</a>  live nearby, in fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4177.949s">My</a>  commute is less than 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4180.35s">And</a>  that proximity has a major benefit for my quality of life and to the quality of education that I can provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4187.032s">I</a>  have more time for my students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4188.513s">I</a>  have more time for my family because I'm not commuting over an hour like most of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4193.115s">The</a>  reason I have that benefit has nothing to do with my paycheck from Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4197.477s">That's</a>  because of my partner's paycheck, which is about twice mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4201.719s">My</a>  own paycheck can't even hope to touch the cost of housing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4208.288s">So</a>  I have one kid in daycare, and with groceries and a credit card bill, my paycheck on a good month maybe covers that, and that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4219.02s">So</a>  Tufts faculty should not be required to have a highly paid partner or other independent financial privilege to live in the community in which we teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4227.326s">We</a>  deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4228.366s">So</a>  wrapping up here, speaking for myself, it seems like the specific administrators who really control the purse strings at Tufts, who could, if they wanted to, immediately end negotiations by offering us a contract that adequately values our contributions to the university, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4246.278s">Those</a>  specific administrators don't seem to be interested in this conversation at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4250.02s">And</a>  I don't believe it's because they can't find the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4253.182s">Last</a>  year, the School of Arts and Sciences had a $34 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4258.644s">In</a>  my view, they simply aren't valuing our labor, which again, sustains so much of their mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4265.427s">So</a>  I really thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4267.348s">I</a>  hope you'll really consider and pass this resolution to help show the administration that they need to pay attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4274.292s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4275.777s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4287.168s">One</a>  second here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4289.47s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4290.571s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Penn Loh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4292.533s">My</a>  name is Pan Lo and I work at 503 Boston Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4299.649s">I</a>  teach in the Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning at Tufts and have been doing so full time since 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4309.135s">Really</a>  want to thank all of you for entertaining this resolution, the connections between <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4316.066s">Tufts</a>  and especially my department and Medford are deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4320.227s">In</a>  fact, Vice President Collins was a former student when she was at Tufts, and we send plenty of students out to do work with the Medford planning department and. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4332.651s">our</a>  students get so much out of being both living here and having this city be a place that they are really learning about what it means to build just and sustainable communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4346.056s">So</a>  I want to thank you all for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4348.577s">A</a>  lot has already been said, but I think for me the bottom line is that we have been increasingly overworked and underpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4361.363s">The</a>  situation has been going on long enough that we have been getting very frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4369.587s">We</a>  are about a third of the full-time teaching faculty in the School of Arts and Sciences, but yet we teach way more students than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4380.653s">Last</a>  fall, we taught over 10,000 students in over 300 courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4385.379s">On</a>  average, every undergrad was taking about one and a half courses from courses taught by full-time lecturers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4393.729s">As</a>  Helen mentioned, the university is in a situation where it can pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4401.411s">It</a>  just seems like it has been choosing not to, and that's where the support from our community has been so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4410.86s">We</a>  organized and conducted a two-day strike at the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4417.95s">And</a>  what we learned from that is just how much support that we have from both people in our community as students, faculty, alumni, and families, but also our surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4430.132s">The</a>  community partners from Medford, from Somerville, the support there has been invaluable to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4437.674s">It's</a>  given us hope and inspiration that we can get to a deal that we deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4445.475s">You</a>  know I'll conclude by just saying that you know it is it is really unconscionable that many of us cannot actually afford to live in a great community like Medford and you know if I hadn't moved and. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4460.221s">actually</a>  bought a place back in the mid 90s, I wouldn't be close to campus now either. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4465.183s">So,</a>  you know, so this contract is really important, not just for us as individuals, but for really sustaining the kind of employment and employer that Medford deserves in a Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4480.528s">Last</a>  thing I'll say is that while we also support all the other folks who work and are part of unions and really believe in that solidarity, we think that this resolution, having a clean resolution would have a little more impact on our administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4499.772s">So,</a>  you know, with due respect to the idea that <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4503.55s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli put out there, I do think it's a little cleaner if we keep this just as a resolution that supports the union of Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4512.332s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4514.472s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4516.013s">Any</a>  further comment from members of the public in the chamber or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4521.034s">Seeing</a>  one in the chamber, not seeing any hands on Zoom, so we'll stay at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4527.956s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4531.24s">Is</a>  this on?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4531.86s">You're</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4532.541s">Okay,</a>  Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4537.462s">As</a>  someone who's worked in academia all my life, I think it's so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4544.865s">We're</a>  put so much value on education. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4548.707s">We</a>  charge now so much for higher education, that it's very important that we <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4556.257s">pay</a>  and we remunerate those who are teaching our children, we remunerate them well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4563.401s">I</a>  think that one of the side effects of this kind of exploitation of scholars for Medford is that, as someone noted, people can't live in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4578.59s">And</a>  the richness of these intellectuals, these scholars, is lost to us then. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4588.513s">And</a>  this is something very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4590.293s">I</a>  mean, these people bring so much into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4593.454s">And</a>  if they're not paid at a level that allows them to live in the community, then that's a loss for the whole community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4602.137s">So</a>  I very much support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4604.377s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4606.158s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4607.827s">Any</a>  further comment by folks in the chamber or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4611.85s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4617.253s">Well,</a>  if there's no other folks from the public looking to speak, I'd just like to add that supporting the full-time lecturers and Tufts is particularly important because I <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4634.307s">I</a>  spent most of my life in academia, last five years in a postdoc. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4640.574s">It's</a>  a system that really relies on under-compensated labor from folks who have <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4656.392s">a</a>  lot of training. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4661.013s">It's</a>  the full-time lecturers, the junior academics that run large institutions like Tufts, and it's really the passion for what they do that ends up being exploited by the academic system that keeps these institutions and most of higher education in the country running. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4684.286s">We're</a>  going through a time right now where the academic system in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4690.93s">is</a>  being particularly strained by the federal government, so it's incredibly important to show these full-time lecturers our full support because it's going to be very important for <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4705.738s">uh,</a>  institutions like Tufts to offer more local support, uh, to, uh, to the junior academics that are in their institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4717.329s">So</a>  I have my, this resolution has my full support and I'd like to thank all the folks, um, in the chambers tonight for coming out to speak.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4733.3s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4735.522s">Seeing</a>  no further comment, I'll just throw in my two cents here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4742.387s">One</a>  of the most important lessons in political economy I learned is that we're basically living <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4749.94s">inside</a>  of a 75 year scam to disembed the economy from society. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4757.802s">It's</a>  this idea that the economy exists outside of any context of humanity or community or sociology or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4767.605s">And</a>  certainly we're seeing some of the worst effects of that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4771.807s">And</a>  very often when we talk about Tufts University, it feels like they are trying to disembed themselves from our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4780.654s">I</a>  think Tufts University itself is a community issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4784.257s">When</a>  we talk about the dormitory argument or the many other unions who have come before this council to talk about how Tufts is treating them as an institution, or the students who have come before this council who had those same concerns, or the neighbors, the Medford residents who have serious concerns with how Tufts <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4806.357s">treats</a>  their immediate neighbors in the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4810.28s">Students</a>  and workers and Medford residents together have very clear alignment and opposition, in my opinion, to how Tufts is choosing to act as an institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4821.707s">And</a>  I can think of nothing more salient to that point than the idea that we are a host community and not a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4830.473s">And</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4831.988s">whether</a>  you're a student or a worker or a neighbor or just someone who lives here in Medford, we would all do better if Tufts administration did better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4843.67s">So</a>  that's where I stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4846.911s">And</a>  I'll probably have to make that speech a couple dozen more times in the next few months, depending, we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4856.172s">But</a>  it's just how things go. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4858.713s">And</a>  it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4860.373s">you</a>  hear these same stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4861.694s">So</a>  thank you for the folks who commented. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4866.597s">We</a>  do have a motion to approve by Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4871.359s">There</a>  is an amendment by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4875.241s">Vice</a>  President Collins, do you accept the amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4878.103s">We</a>  could also do it as a B paper so that we could keep a clean resolution and have Councilor Scarpelli's item as a separate vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4888.469s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4895.505s">Thank</a>  you for the bears 1st, I apologize if my audio isn't coming through. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4899.83s">Well,</a>  my Internet is unstable right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4901.612s">I.</a>  I hear the counts are appreciate him bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4911.263s">Preference</a>  would be to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4917.938s">Vote</a>  on that as a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4919.799s">I</a>  would certainly be in favor since these workers requested that the most persuasive to this employer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4931.402s">I'd</a>  like to honor sentiment for our bargaining units here in the city.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4937.187s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4938.208s">It</a>  came in a little funky, but I think we got the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4940.97s">You'd</a>  prefer a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4942.151s">I'm</a>  seeing a nod from Councilor Scarpelli that that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4946.133s">So</a>  we'll have two votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4947.074s">We'll</a>  have a B paper, which is to resolve to the mayor to settle the contracts that are outstanding, including some workers who've been without a contract for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4964.826s">And</a>  when you're ready on that, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4970.534s">The</a>  second on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4972.676s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, Yes, this is on the beat.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5062.033s">This</a>  resolution is really quite a simple one, it goes back to our fund of one of our fundamental guiding principles that we want City Hall to be more accessible to all that we want to bring City Hall to the people and not force people to come to have to come to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5078.201s">I</a>  think the budget process is a perfect encapsulation of that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5082.824s">where</a>  the budget is a statement of the city's values. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5086.806s">It</a>  is what runs our city, what makes us tick. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5090.549s">And</a>  it's really important, I believe, to me, and I believe to the city council, too, that we get as much input as we can and that people feel heard in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5101.275s">Over</a>  the last few years, we've experimented doing different things with public engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5106.418s">Years</a>  ago, I put out a survey, too, which I have thoughts about how to <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5112.462s">how</a>  to make better this time around, asking for input from residents about what they would want to see in our city budget and then explaining some of the challenges that we see on the city council with getting what everyone wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5127.266s">in</a>  recent years on the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5130.787s">We</a>  have been doing more with actively going out into the community to hear from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5136.209s">We've</a>  been doing more with publishing a newsletter that goes out every month detailing what we do on the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5143.931s">So</a>  there are more means by which we can gather feedback now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5146.932s">I</a>  know there are Councilors who are very passionate about getting <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5151.193s">public</a>  feedback and engaging more members of the public in our processes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5156.094s">So</a>  I'm looking forward to a very fruitful discussion on the Resident Services Committee, and I'll motion to send this paper to that committee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5789.766s">You</a>  want to speak on that?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5796.526s">Hello,</a>  the Arlington Street Water Main Project is something we're trying to focus on for not only capacity in a low flow, low area, but it's the first step of like a five year kind of initiative that we're going to start moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5815.54s">This</a>  area was targeted because it has a high probability of unknowns and lead, and it'll also give us better pressure for fire safety and head loss.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5827.731s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5829.072s">Director</a>  Dickinson, just on the fire station, essentially, my understanding of this is that short-term borrowing was done under a council resolution, and then the idea is that that money would have been rolled over into the debt for the project, but because the debt exclusion failed, there's not gonna be debt for the project?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5849.92s">Yes,</a>  that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5852.16s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5852.661s">We</a>  had a $1.5 million authorization to do the planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5857.434s">What</a>  would ordinarily happen is we would have done the planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5860.235s">We</a>  would have done short-term borrowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5863.475s">We</a>  did actually borrow $1.5 million short-term to cover the planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5870.417s">And</a>  then we would have closed out that debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5872.757s">And</a>  had we gotten the authorization to build the full fire station, we would have borrowed enough to pay off the short-term debt and all the planning costs, roll that into the long-term debt we would have had for the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5887.869s">So</a>  right now we have to pay off the debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5892.891s">What</a>  is actually been spent is the money that we're asking for from pre-cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5898.553s">The</a>  rest of the money is still sitting in the city's accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5901.654s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5901.855s">All</a>  right, I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5907.977s">Thank</a>  you for explaining that, Mr. Hickson. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5909.998s">I</a>  know that, so these plans, they've already done the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5914.8s">We</a>  owe them the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5917.158s">So</a>  instead of paying it off, and with an interest moving forward, we pay it off up front now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5923.543s">And</a>  these plans are ours to keep, so they're already done, right?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5928.367s">Yes,</a>  these are expenses we've actually, we've already paid the contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5932.471s">All</a>  of those POs are closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5935.013s">So</a>  that's the end of this part of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5937.334s">We</a>  still have the plans, obviously, that were produced by the contractors.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5942.458s">No,</a>  there were total plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5945.336s">there</a>  was a final plan that was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5948.579s">And</a>  then one of the reasons why I think it failed was the rank and file and the fire department realized that, and the former chief who was part of the planning team mentioned that it was inadequate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5962.129s">But</a>  we still have all of the plans, even the original plans that had the footprint that worked with the former chief, with the team that put that together, that's everything?</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5973.813s">as</a>  far as I know, yes.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5974.893s">Okay,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5977.114s">And</a>  I know as we move forward, just understanding people are very confused with the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5982.696s">So</a>  we've certified free cash last year, and we spent down some of that money to be put into different pots, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5991.72s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5992.12s">Now,</a>  this is the new number, we're back up to $28 million, just for clarity sakes? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5996.742s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5997.182s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5998.922s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6000.283s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6004.763s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6005.624s">I</a>  think this is a rational ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6010.287s">I'm</a>  curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6014.49s">We</a>  have $28 million in pre-cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6020.575s">The</a>  fire station remains in a difficult state. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6026.86s">I</a>  am curious about where <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6031.857s">It's</a>  not really, it's frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6034.158s">I</a>  feel frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6036.318s">This</a>  is not your fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6037.278s">It's</a>  not anybody's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6038.859s">We,</a>  I don't know how we can use what's at our disposal to help the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6046.101s">I</a>  just want to put a statement into the public statement into the ether that it would be nice if we could do some improvements on the fire station somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6058.764s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6294.848s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6296.569s">I</a>  definitely agree in the need for us to support to find money to do these, the nexus study so that we can update the linkage fees especially for affordable housing which I think we should do first. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6312.278s">I'm</a>  absolutely supportive of that, but I will not vote in favor of selling off public lands, which we'd never get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6320.119s">when</a>  we have $28 million sitting in free cash, let alone the money that is in stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6326.861s">I</a>  cannot understand why we are selling off public lands when we clearly have many times that amount of money in free cash that we do not know what that is planned to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6339.225s">So</a>  I will not vote to sell off public lands at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6403.318s">Um,</a>  I think folks who've been following this issue know I've been of two minds about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6408.602s">My</a>  instinct is with my fellow Councilors that we shouldn't sell public land. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6414.126s">I</a>  also appreciate the letter that was sent to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6418.068s">I</a>  think the subtext of that letter is asking us to think bigger picture about, um, you know, getting that next study, I think will help <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6426.254s">affordability</a>  in the long term by telling us exactly how we can achieve the bigger picture goals that we've set out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6435.596s">I</a>  think that's why I'm inclined to support it, but I did want to take this off the table because I wanted to hear the discussion after we got that letter from the Affordable Housing Trust as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6446.798s">So</a>  I wanted to hear from my fellow Councilors too.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6451.559s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6453.44s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6457.167s">Is</a>  there a motion.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6460.634s">I</a>  mean, I'm, I do agree that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6469.946s">we</a>  should be using free cash for some of these one-time expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6475.427s">On</a>  the other hand, this is, I mean, this is an official communication from the Affordable Housing Trust where they're telling us that these parcels are individually undersized and they're saying they're not able to be developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6494.71s">And</a>  I am disappointed <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6499.578s">and</a>  my colleagues for not supporting, indicating that they wouldn't support the recommendation of the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6511.067s">I'm</a>  also disappointed in some of my colleagues for stepping off prior to this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6517.052s">I</a>  would really like to see this <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6522.222s">Uh,</a>  this nexus study, uh, this nexus study actually funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6526.705s">It</a>  was. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6528.566s">In</a>  some of the budget recommendations that we put forward, and I would like to see this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6535.31s">Uh,</a>  get in the pattern of supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6539.902s">the</a>  Affordable Housing Trust when it gives us a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6545.023s">I</a>  mean, if they're going to tell us that they can't use two parcels of land and so we should have a bit more of a longer term view when it comes to selling them off so that we can actually fund the nexus study, then I'm inclined to support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6565.229s">So</a>  that's all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6567.77s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6569.809s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6571.61s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6572.53s">Appreciate</a>  my colleagues thoughts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6575.732s">I</a>  think that as we look at the parcels being small, I think that they are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6582.736s">I</a>  think they are valuable for the fact that you might not see a four story development, but you'll see a butters that would take up that land relatively quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6594.233s">then</a>  move that money into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6597.054s">So</a>  I concur with my fellow colleague, Councilor Leming, in understanding that we finally have a revenue source that we can start feeding into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6606.998s">And</a>  the fact that we've heard tonight that the use of free cash to be used for anything is pretty frightening, considering this Council spoke <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6618.392s">a</a>  year ago on a number that was relatively the same number to keep us out of an override that really is affecting so many of our homeowners and affecting now a lot of our renters because of the increase in taxing that fall back onto our renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6636.843s">So</a>  I think that I made a motion and I'll bring it back up soon because I think maybe my council colleagues understand the importance of maybe an audit and putting that back out to a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6650.293s">Because</a>  again, I know that one of my council colleagues mentioned that it's nobody's fault, but it is somebody's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6658.399s">When</a>  you continually have millions and millions and millions of dollars <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6666.127s">Again</a>  $28 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6668.73s">There's</a>  something going wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6670.952s">Again,</a>  repeat this so people don't take this out of context. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6674.615s">I'm</a>  not saying that someone's doing something illegal in the city, but there's a blatant misuse of our funds that we keep we keep increasing this free cash amount <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6687.465s">to</a>  a number that's astronomical. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6690.187s">What</a>  was put forth during the override is the understanding the process of free cash is seeing most communities that are <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6697.093s">trying</a>  to eliminate free cash or keeping it at that level for the bond rating, which I believe at the time for metric was close to, I believe, seven and $11 million, keeping it there that keeps us at the bond rating that we have today and using that money appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6713.02s">So</a>  I appreciate the, the, the highlight of the misuse of free cash, excuse me, the highlight of the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6720.643s">And</a>  I highlight the fact that that again, something has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6725.406s">We</a>  have to look at <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6727.09s">the</a>  way we're spending our money in our community because we see and hear over and over again that we can't do A, B, and C because we don't have the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6737.836s">But</a>  we obviously have the funding when we have $28 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6742.099s">Again,</a>  free cash is money that is voted by this council for the previous budget season to move our projects forward, to move our city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6752.825s">And</a>  if that money is not being spent properly, this is where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6757.812s">$28</a>  million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6761.353s">So</a>  again, even if it's not spent, putting it into a high-interest account that brings us money so it's not sitting in account for the whole year, maybe there's another way that we can look at creating revenue for our community just out of interest, out of $28 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6778.956s">There</a>  are so many avenues to look at this process, but <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6782.567s">I'm</a>  going to vote in favor of this paper, because I think this is something we've talked about in supporting our affordable housing trust, something that the previous council, before this council started, Council Falco's wishes and his resolution, and I believe Council Bears and I were on that council, that again, these are parcels that we're looking at purchasing and then building, dropping in a development, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6812.157s">There</a>  are small parcels that could be hopefully taken by the abutters and then used to add some housing and then build the affordable trust account. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6823.262s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6825.423s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6826.003s">I</a>  do want to note when it comes to the free cash, what we heard last week was <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6834.935s">that</a>  there was 1 million in turnbacks, so underspending, and 6 million in unexpected local receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6842.159s">And</a>  a large amount of that was from exactly what you just said, Councilor Scarpelli, the investment of ARPA funds and city's cash balances in high interest accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6851.165s">They</a>  earned more than was expected in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6854.567s">And</a>  again, that free cash number is as of 6-30-2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6857.529s">I'm</a>  also inclined to say that, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6862.725s">Yes,</a>  there's a lot of free cash right now and using it on one-time projects is what it's intended for, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6869.331s">There's</a>  two truths. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6870.712s">We</a>  have an operating budget that has a very tight margin when we look at the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6877.398s">And</a>  so recurring expenses, especially in an era of inflation and contracts and the compounding effect of <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6886.384s">the</a>  city's biggest expense, which is personnel contracts, that the operating budget can be very tight and we can have little to no money to spend on new recurring expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6897.407s">But</a>  essentially because of ARPA and the underestimating of some of the local receipts, basically the assumption that the economy will be worse than it ended up being, we did not lose as much money as we thought we would from the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6913.372s">And</a>  that's why we've ended up with the free cash balances that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6917.233s">And</a>  then because we had those balances and because interest rates were high, we made money on those balances we weren't expecting to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6923.534s">So</a>  that's why we ended up with the balance that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6926.875s">I'm</a>  inclined to say that, you know, one-time expenses like a study is exactly what the one-time funds from a free cash thing should be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6940.937s">I'm</a>  also inclined to say that Corbett Avenue is a residential neighborhood where <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6945.655s">I</a>  don't know what you get from leasing the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6948.617s">And,</a>  you know, I don't know how much more benefit you get from leasing the land in the long term and having two or three affordable housing units versus the sale of it for this purpose now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6958.484s">So</a>  I'm just going to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6960.786s">Councilor</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6962.862s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6963.422s">I</a>  mean, I think the last things that both Councilor Scarpelli and President Bears said I think way on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6971.507s">I</a>  think about the practical effects of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6974.009s">And,</a>  you know, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6977.253s">There's</a>  the benefit to having two or three affordable units in that neighborhood, but does that is that outweighed by having an exit study that helps really advance affordable housing trusts work to get many more affordable units in Medford over a longer period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6993.508s">I</a>  think, in my mind, it weighs in favor of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6999.821s">I'm</a>  not completely sure how many votes, this needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7003.743s">It's</a>  possible that we, it might be wiser to wait until Vice President Collins is online with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7011.566s">I</a>  know she was saying that she had some technical difficulties with their computers I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7018.005s">if,</a>  you know, if it's important to have that last voice on the Council, I think it might be wise to retable this, but I did want to have this discussion tonight to hear from Councilors while this paper was still, while the response that we got was on our minds.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7036.391s">Yeah,</a>  I'm almost 100% sure that the conveyance of property is a two thirds of majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7041.552s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7046.443s">First,</a>  I completely agree that one-time expenses, just like this nexus fee, is exactly what Free Cash is designed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7054.546s">It</a>  is what it should be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7056.347s">We</a>  have plenty of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7057.368s">We</a>  should be using free cash for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7058.948s">Once</a>  you sell public lands, it is gone forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7060.889s">I</a>  have yet to see that there has been any <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7065.451s">that</a>  we're going to have to sort of brainstorming or real in depth study of what could be done with those parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7072.776s">Uh</a>  it isn't simply that there could be permanently affordable housing on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7076.618s">There</a>  are many other things that can be done with public lands. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7079.28s">Um</a>  and II really urge my city Councilors to not rush through to sell public lands when it has not been thought through. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7088.146s">And</a>  to urge the mayor to pay for the next study as soon as</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7107.987s">Is</a>  there, I may be missing it in the documentation, but is there a cost for the study that we know? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7114.371s">Do</a>  you know how much the study costs, the nexus?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7116.592s">The</a>  letter that we received from the Affordable Housing Trust, I know numbers have been thrown around. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7127.057s">Personally,</a>  I think we should do all of these nexus studies at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7130.459s">We</a>  should do the linkage, the inclusionary, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7133.511s">whatever's</a>  needed for TDM and all the other linkage fees, I think we should just do them all.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7146.061s">I</a>  guess what I'm saying is that the studies, it seems, are not very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7154.647s">And</a>  I really couldn't agree more with Councilor Callahan that when you sell <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7162.921s">land</a>  that's owned by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7165.442s">You</a>  can't, you don't get it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7168.764s">We</a>  own these parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7171.245s">We</a>  have a history of selling off lands that we've owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7177.988s">And</a>  I think it's a sacrifice that we shouldn't make lately. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7181.65s">And</a>  I think there's more potential in these parcels than we're giving them credit for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7189.482s">I</a>  just I would not be prepared to sell them for the purpose of beginning a study that we could very easily begin in other ways.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7198.508s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Leming then Councilor Tseng and then we do have a DT on on zoom with their hand as well.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7207.113s">I</a>  mean, I'm on the, I'm on the community land trust, which actually is looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7212.758s">I</a>  mean, it's, it's, it's still pretty early stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7216.141s">We're</a>  working with some, with some consultants on forming a community land trust for the city and the McCormick Avenue parcels aren't even on the list of city owned land that we would be looking at to build up any sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7233.505s">Any</a>  any sort of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7235.866s">So</a>  there are parcels of land that the city owns that we would be seriously looking into for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7245.169s">But</a>  again, these are, I mean, these are too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7249.76s">For</a>  for that purpose, um, and this clearly has been deliberated specifically at the. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7256.582s">Uh,</a>  within the affordable housing trust, and we received an official communication recommending that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7263.784s">Uh,</a>  they'd be sold off for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7266.705s">Um,</a>  so I would 2nd, the motion to table that, um, I. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7275.451s">I</a>  think that Vice President Collins did seem to be having some internet connectivity issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7281.352s">So</a>  this could potentially be taken up at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7286.614s">But</a>  given that, I would also like to hear what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7291.975s">McGor</a>  thinks, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7293.475s">McGor</a>  has to say as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7294.956s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7296.356s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7296.776s">There</a>  is no motion to table unless someone makes it and that motion is undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7301.717s">So</a>  if someone makes it, we can't hear from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7304.358s">McGor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7306.406s">never</a>  mind then. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7307.607s">Sorry,</a>  I thought he made a motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7310.069s">Councilor</a>  Tseng suggested it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7311.47s">Aditi,</a>  we'd love to hear from you with what your thoughts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7319.376s">Oh,</a>  I have to ask you on mute.</p>

    <p>[Adithi Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7328.303s">Good</a>  evening, President Bess and members of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7332.146s">Am</a>  I audible?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7333.667s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Adithi Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7335.147s">Yeah,</a>  thank you for this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7338.99s">First</a>  to respond to the question about the cost of the nexus study, it would be approximately $80,000, and this would include adding affordable housing linkage and reviewing our existing inclusionary zoning percentages as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7357.382s">And</a>  regarding the McCormick Avenue parcels, the two parcels, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7363.979s">individually,</a>  I believe, are assessed at around $35,000 to $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7368.901s">This</a>  is because they are undevelopable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7373.324s">And</a>  PDS's recommendation is if they were to be sold or conveyed, it's best if these two parcels are merged by ANR, and then that would increase the assessed value to approximately $435,000.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7394.808s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7395.268s">What</a>  would we have to do to merge them? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7397.87s">Is</a>  there a vote of the council required to do that?</p>

    <p>[Adithi Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7400.272s">And...</a>  I think, I'm not very sure, but I think it would have to go before the CD board and an ANR process would be required, but I'd have to check with my colleague, Daniel.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7414.504s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7416.545s">And</a>  it sounds like <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7420.143s">just</a>  it sounds like that probably, whichever way we end up on this, it's probably not going to hurt us to have the parcels be merged or not merged.</p>

    <p>[Adithi Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7429.188s">To</a>  clarify, if they're not merged, then the value would be much lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7434.251s">So</a>  for each parcel.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7435.592s">I</a>  meant to say that if we end up choosing not to sell the parcels, like let's say the ANR process goes forward and they're merged and then the council doesn't want to convey them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7445.857s">That's,</a>  it's not really, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7449.223s">that's</a>  not a problem, is it?</p>

    <p>[Adithi Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7451.365s">No,</a>  that wouldn't be a problem, I believe, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7454.767s">All</a>  right, I'll go to Councilor, thank you, and I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7458.129s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7460.19s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7461.591s">Can</a>  you clarify for me, undevelopable, does that mean separately as two parcels, or if they were made, because they're next to each other, correct?</p>

    <p>[Adithi Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7482.048s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7483.449s">Yes,</a>  they are undevelopable because each of these parcels are undersized lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7489.393s">So</a>  based on our zoning, these lots are not developable.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7494.236s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7494.776s">So</a>  as they are, as our zoning is right now, the two lots, the size that they are now, are undevelopable as the two separate lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7504.122s">But</a>  if we put them into one lot, then they are a normal size for something to be put on them <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7511.387s">together?</a> </p>

    <p>[Adithi Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7514.169s">Yes,</a>  based on our current zoning overhaul and the proposed zoning change, I think once the two parcels are merged, it would allow us to have one single family unit and an ADU.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7530.498s">right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7530.978s">So</a>  I think that's an important thing to note here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7533.019s">It's</a>  that it's there's a somewhat arbitrariness to the fact that this is an undevelopable undevelopable lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7539.903s">It's</a>  not that you cannot build something on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7541.764s">It's</a>  that because of the way that they're that the lines are drawn because of the way our zoning ordinances are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7548.468s">Technically,</a>  you can't put two houses on these two lots, but that does not mean that you can't physically build something on this space. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7556.453s">It</a>  just means that it's a wonky weird thing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7562.164s">it</a>  does not mean that there is not potential for this to hold a building that could house humans in it eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7570.006s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7572.787s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7771.41s">Hi,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7772.591s">Eunice</a>  Brown, Greenleaf Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7775.426s">I</a>  am asking or looking for an update on the timeline to send the charter to the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7784.473s">As</a>  I understand it, two weeks ago on Tuesday, March 11th, the city council voted to send their version to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7792.32s">Presumably</a>  she got that within a day or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7796.043s">That</a>  means then that she's had the city council version for review for almost two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7803.308s">Um,</a>  the 2 versions of the charter are markedly different. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7807.413s">And</a>  some very critical elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7810.016s">Including,</a>  but not limited to the composition of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7814.982s">The</a>  mayor is the chair of the school committee and article 8, which is the citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7820.989s">Participation</a>  mechanisms among others. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7824.485s">Both</a>  the mayor and the city council need to agree on a document that gets sent to the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7830.447s">The</a>  timeline has the mayor sending the charter to the state by the end of March, the 1st of April, which is next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7838.609s">President</a>  Bears, as you said on the 11th, if there is negotiating to be done to arrive at a final document, there may need to be another committee of the whole and then a vote at a regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7851.033s">And</a>  that pushes us well into April. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7854.391s">So</a>  my questions are as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7857.834s">Where</a>  do things stand? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7859.896s">Are</a>  you both actively negotiating to iron out the differences? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7863.959s">Or</a>  is one party acquiescing to the other? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7866.401s">Are</a>  additional meetings planned? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7870.505s">When</a>  will the document be sent to the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7873.547s">And</a>  is there a drop dead date where it has to go to the state legislature in time for their review and return so that it gets placed on the ballot? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7884.299s">And</a>  will there be a final copy available to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7889.885s">And</a>  then assuming all of that happens, and I don't know if this is your bailiwick or the mayor's office or what, but this is a very dense document, a dense project, a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7905.651s">you</a>  know, things went into it, how is the public going to be educated on the charter for them to make an informed vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7913.575s">Will</a>  there be more education, more than just a ballot question? <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7919.758s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7920.859s">I</a>  look forward to your response.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7923.72s">Thank</a>  you for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7926.081s">We</a>  did submit the amended draft to the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7930.284s">I</a>  think the Thursday the 13th, so two days after the regular meeting, we have not received back anything in writing formally from the mayor about her proposed changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7945.855s">My</a>  understanding certainly is, you know, that did pass this council six to zero with one absent, and the mayor could send it off as amended right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7957.502s">When</a>  we hear back from the mayor about <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7960.527s">Uh,</a>  if she wants to negotiate further, if there are changes, um, that she wants to make, uh, to the amendments that we proposed, we would definitely schedule another meeting to discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7973.031s">Um,</a>  but that's the status of it now in terms of what happens in terms of a drop dead date and what happens before an elect a vote on a ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7980.694s">Uh,</a>  there's technically no drop dead date. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7983.275s">Uh,</a>  this is all about will the legislature take it up and, uh, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7989.272s">it's</a>  kind of a black box. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7991.734s">They</a>  don't have any disclosure or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7995.036s">Certainly</a>  they could, we could send it to them, you know, the first week in April, they could take it up the second week in April and we could have it done the third week in April, but that really all depends on them taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8007.324s">What</a>  we know basically from the Collins Center is that both drafts, the draft from the CSC as changed by the mayor and then the draft that from the mayor that we amended <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8019.105s">that</a>  there's nothing in any of those that is outside the scope of what the legislature generally approves for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8026.752s">for</a>  charters so we didn't include anything like rank choice voting or budget authority for the council or any of those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8034.034s">We</a>  also have been told that the legislature prefers supermajority or near unanimity on homeworld petitions of this matter so it was sent you know our we voted six to zero with one absent in the past when we had sent up <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8049.878s">home</a>  rule petitions to create an elected charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8052.22s">Those</a>  have been by votes of four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8054.582s">And</a>  so the legislature chose not to act on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8058.386s">In</a>  terms of an education campaign, I don't know what the mayor's team would have planned around that or what information would be put forward on the city website, or what private entities, individuals or groups that might form around the ballot questions would do.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8077.164s">Okay,</a>  because my understanding was that the whole idea of getting it to the legislature sooner than later was because once they get bogged down in their budget stuff, they just don't have time for this.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8092.769s">That</a>  is kind of the reading of the tea leaves that we're trying to match up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8097.27s">But</a>  end of March, early April is kind of what we were told. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8102.192s">I</a>  think House Ways and Means generally puts out their <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8107.108s">draft,</a>  it's either the week before Patriots Day or the week of Patriots Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8112.652s">So</a>  certainly if we could get it in before then, that might be sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8118.195s">But</a>  Collins Center said last week of March, first week of April would be ideal.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8124.92s">OK,</a>  so basically at this point, I would expect that there would probably be some negotiating <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8136.041s">know,</a>  between the two groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8138.123s">So</a>  sounds like there's a bit more to come then.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8140.025s">Yeah,</a>  when we receive a formal response from the mayor, we'll schedule whatever's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8146.411s">Unless</a>  of course, that is that she sent the draft that we sent to her to the legislature, in which case there would not need to be any further meetings.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8153.797s">Yeah,</a>  we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8155.719s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8156.76s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8158.182s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8164.303s">Any</a>  further public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8170.849s">Seeing</a>  none, are there any motions on the floor on the motion of adjourned by Councilor Callahan seconded by Councilor Tseng, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=8179.917s">Council</a>  Callahan, Vice President Collins is absent Council is our Council Leming.</p>
