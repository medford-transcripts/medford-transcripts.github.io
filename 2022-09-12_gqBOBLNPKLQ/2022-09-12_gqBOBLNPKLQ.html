    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=33.282s">Medford</a>  High School for its incredible staff and student body. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=36.223s">This</a>  year has started at a great note and we are excited for the coming months and events that will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=41.466s">My</a>  peers and I are eager to speak about any problems in the school environment as well as start discussions for changes that are needed to improve the quality of our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=50.663s">We</a>  hope to gain knowledge about important matters, and we are honored to be able to participate and attend the school committee meetings for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=57.406s">This</a>  is an amazing opportunity for us, and we hope to get as much out of this experience as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=62.588s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=73.173s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=73.433s">If</a>  we could all please rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=76.254s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=80.1s">and</a>  to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=87.664s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=89.104s">We</a>  have number three, good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=91.586s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=96.158s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=97.379s">I</a>  just wanted to, for good of the order, since it's the first meeting of the month and we typically have it, last year we talked about setting some goals for a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=107.345s">And</a>  I just want to think about, put it out to my colleagues about what we want those to be and when we can schedule a time to discuss what they will be.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=116.511s">We</a>  have number three, good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=118.952s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=123.524s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=123.944s">I</a>  just wanted to, for good of the order, since it's the first meeting of the month and we typically have it, last year we talked about setting some goals for a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=134.574s">And</a>  I just want to think about, read out to my colleagues about what those would be and how we can schedule a time to discuss what they will be.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=143.763s">We</a>  have number three, good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=146.325s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=150.327s">Third</a>  time's the charm. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=150.907s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=152.108s">I</a>  just wanted to, for good of the order, since it's the first meeting of the month and we have it, last year we talked about setting some goals.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=167.132s">We</a>  do have a good of the order, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=169.033s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=177.335s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=179.389s">Yeah,</a>  just start.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=181.31s">So</a>  again, I think everybody probably heard that a couple of times, but you know, so we want to set some goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=187.654s">We</a>  had voted last year that we were going to set goals for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=192.697s">And</a>  so I just wanted to put out to my colleagues, you know, that we don't want to wait another, I assume we don't want to wait another whole month for the next good of the order to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=200.822s">So</a>  maybe I'd like to make a motion that we set a time, some, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=208.444s">Committee</a>  of the Whole or something maybe this month to talk about setting goals.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=212.506s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=213.126s">Motion</a>  on the floor by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=217.948s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=218.669s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=220.91s">Committee</a>  of the Whole will be scheduled in the next several weeks to discuss the good of the order and goals for the upcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=226.512s">We</a>  have the consent agenda, bills and payrolls, special school committee meeting minutes June 13, 2022, and Committee of the Whole meeting minutes June 22, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=231.755s">Is</a>  there a motion for approval?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=237.861s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=238.822s">By</a>  Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=240.823s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=242.165s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=242.425s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=243.946s">Paper</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=245.768s">There</a>  are no reports of subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=247.729s">And</a>  number six, report of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=250.231s">Number</a>  one is superintendent's updates and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=252.873s">Dr.</a>  Maurice-Edouard-Vincent, superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=257.277s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=257.878s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=261.12s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=263.062s">As</a>  we begin tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=265.583s">I</a>  would be remiss if I did not mention that yesterday was the 21st anniversary of the horrific September 11th terrorist attacks on our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=276.629s">I</a>  know that everyone remembers where they were that day when that first plane hit the World Trade Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=283.652s">Despite</a>  the unspeakable pain and loss, we will always feel at the deaths of over 2,900 people <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=292.679s">We</a>  also remember the sense of unity and service that was palpable during this time 21 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=303.428s">Indeed,</a>  in our work, educating students who were not yet born on September 11th, we strive to continue that commitment to service and in the hope that there will be moments devoid of tragedy in which we will once again feel, at least to some degree, that sense of unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=323.035s">To</a>  honor the memory of all those lost, I respectfully ask that we rise for a moment of silence to remember all those who perished and for all the public safety personnel who ran to help the victims that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=356.866s">And</a>  sadly, I would also like to ask that we just take one additional moment of silence to honor the memory of Kyle Roust, a 2019 Medford High School graduate who lost his life in a tragic accident this summer.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=392.386s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=394.987s">Over</a>  the last several weeks, this is regards to the opening of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=400.27s">The</a>  hallways and classrooms of our school buildings have once again been filled with students and staff, as together we once again embark upon a new school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=411.636s">Administrators</a>  and first year educators arrived on campus the week of August 22nd, and our new staff were treated to an induction week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=422.688s">as</a>  well to help them get acclimated to the Mustang community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=426.169s">Induction</a>  week this year included a tour of the city of Medford, in which our new colleagues visited Tufts University, the Royal House, and the slave quarters, and the brand new Medford Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=442.274s">After</a>  the library, the group was welcomed to Medford by Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=447.776s">There</a>  will be a more detailed report next week from Dr. Riccardelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=453.894s">If</a>  the last few school years have taught us anything, it is that the partnerships we enjoy as a school are critically important to the execution of our mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=467.306s">I</a>  would like to take this opportunity to recognize several different invaluable partnerships that make it possible for us to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=482.162s">First,</a>  our most sincere thanks goes to our Members Plus Credit Union for providing 100 filled backpacks for our students, and to Wegmans for providing additional school supplies for our middle and high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=498.737s">Second,</a>  I would like to note the generous donations from Tufts University, Herb Chambers, Simple Fare, and East Cambridge Savings Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=510.202s">Because</a>  the networks night of 10,000 lights had a wonderful fundraiser at rights pawn this past Saturday evening, and due to generous donations of our partners that event was able to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=527.887s">I</a>  wanted to share, as we announced last week, that the Medford Public Schools has reached tentative agreements with three of our bargaining units, representing administrative assistants, carpenters and maintenance personnel, and school nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=543.559s">We</a>  are grateful to each of these groups for their commitment to the district, and we'll be submitting those tentative agreements to the school committee for your final approval in the coming days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=557.938s">In</a>  addition, as we announced last week, and with the unanimous support of the school committee, we have declared an impasse in our negotiations with the Medford Teachers Association in order so we may petition the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations to assign a neutral mediator to assist toward a resolution on a successor agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=585.595s">These</a>  decisions will be discussed later in the agenda in our labor update. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=590.739s">But</a>  to be clear, the declaration of an impasse in no way constitutes the district walking away from the bargaining table. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=600.305s">It</a>  instead means we are looking to engage in this negotiation with the assistance of a mediator in the hope of expediting a resolution.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=619.454s">Do</a>  you have anything else to say, Mr. Gopnik? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=622.615s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=627.257s">Finally,</a>  there are a few reminders and updates that reflect what a busy time of year this is for our Mustang community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=638.901s">Fall</a>  sports season is in full swing, and we wish all of our athletes well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=647.924s">Our</a>  Mustang football team began their season this past Friday against Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=655.088s">We</a>  do encourage all community members to check out our sports schedule to support our student athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=663.773s">This</a>  week, Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council hosts its first virtual meeting of the new year on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=676.207s">Sunday,</a>  Mustang alum Dave McGilvery's inaugural Run Medford event will be held. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=683.933s">CCSR</a>  and Power Kids were selected as beneficiaries of this race. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=692.559s">On</a>  September 24th at Hormel Stadium, the Mustang Band will host and compete at the New England Band Competition.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=710.447s">And</a>  this year in Medford, we are opening with several new faces.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=718.093s">While</a>  there are very limited number of teaching positions and power positions that we still need to fill, we have successfully filled the vast majority of vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=730.663s">As</a>  noted in one of my back to school bulletins, we are welcoming several new leaders into administrator roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=739.679s">While</a>  we hope to have an opportunity to introduce you to several of these new faces in presentations in the coming weeks and months, I've asked our two newly minted school leaders to join us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=754.01s">It</a>  is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Andrew O'Brien, friendly assistant principal at the Roberts Elementary School, who is now the principal of the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=767.447s">and</a>  Dr. Lori Hodgdon, who is now the principal of the Curtis Tufts High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=774.589s">Lori</a>  most recently held the role of school director at the Collegiate Charter School of Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=782.251s">At</a>  this time, I would like to ask Mr. Andy O'Brien and Dr. Lori Hodgdon to step forward so that they may be recognized.</p>

    <p>[o9F0qYH9Geo_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=810.161s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=811.603s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=812.404s">Those</a>  are my remarks.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=815.488s">Thank</a>  you, Doctor Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=817.931s">We</a>  have number two opening report on transportation operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=822.116s">Mr.</a>  David Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=831.633s">Thank</a>  you mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=835.041s">Pleasure</a>  to be with you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=836.624s">You</a>  had a wonderful summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=839.541s">This</a>  first update is a very brief deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=842.162s">We</a>  can just go to the one and only slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=845.625s">As</a>  you know, and as the superintendent's back to school bulletins referenced several times, the beginning of school can be a bumpy period, particularly with respect to some of our operational areas, and that's certainly true in the area of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=863.357s">The</a>  operations and transportation update to some degree are going to blend together because a lot of the operational challenges that we're facing currently at the beginning of this school year and historically at the beginning of every school year relate to transportation issues as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=879.386s">school</a>  safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=880.446s">So</a>  I will say that to summarize at a very high level, we've had a generally successful opening to school opening of school with respect to on the operational side that that certainly do in no small measure to staff members, teachers, paraprofessionals, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=897.551s">custodians,</a>  administrative assistants, and everyone else in our various school communities who have helped us to get off to a pretty efficient and pretty smooth start. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=907.319s">As</a>  referenced there in the slide, one of the priorities over the course of the summer, both for the Medford Public Schools, as well as the city of Medford, has been our ongoing and continuous communication and work with the Medford Police Department to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=924.151s">All</a>  operational concerns with respect to student and staff safety are being prioritized first and foremost. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=930.794s">Some</a>  of those are adjustments and things that we can speak publicly about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=934.496s">Others,</a>  as we've talked about in this forum many times before, are items that we wouldn't necessarily discuss in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=940.978s">but</a>  I can commit to you that they are being prioritized in this work taking place in each school to make sure that safety is where it needs to be on our priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=952.662s">One</a>  of the ways in which we've tried to enhance safety is by taking a very close look at the traffic patterns surrounding each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=962.086s">The</a>  traffic around our schools and our building administrators, particularly at the elementary level, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=968.688s">joined</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=969.889s">Galuccio</a>  and myself at the Metro Police Department headquarters last spring when some of the traffic concerns were sort of boiling over in a variety of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=980.556s">And</a>  so we were able to put in some ad hoc solutions around schools, working with our traffic, or the police department's traffic supervisors to make sure that we were able to troubleshoot some of those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=991.363s">before</a>  the close of school last year, but we had all sort of left those meetings knowing that there were more things that we were gonna have to do surrounding each school to make sure that dismissal in particular, for a variety of logistical reasons, student drop-off at the moment is not a huge concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1010.295s">I</a>  recognize that there's some significant traffic issues surrounding the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1016.079s">Those</a>  issues, frankly, are not all pertaining to the high school, that's the area <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1019.981s">around</a>  the high school is seeing some significant construction work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1023.462s">And</a>  so some of the slowdowns that families and students have experienced during the drop-off at the high school, they really don't have anything to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1032.083s">We</a>  haven't put in any changed protocols related to the high school on drop-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1037.304s">Pickup,</a>  on the other hand, at a few schools has been a challenge in terms of the traffic and the congestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1045.366s">And</a>  we've installed speed bumps at the high school, which I know we've received some feedback on, which we always appreciate, as well as some various traffic strategies that we've put into place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1057.43s">Overall,</a>  we are, from the administration's perspective, pretty pleased with how the first couple weeks of school have gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1066.412s">The</a>  parking lot at the high school is clearing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1068.753s">approximately</a>  12 minutes, on average, 12 minutes faster than it was previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1073.054s">And</a>  that's with traffic having been slowed down due to the speed bumps that were installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1078.395s">So</a>  I think our decision to move the primary student pickup area over to the West Courtyard Loop is, from our perspective, success, and that we think we've been able to improve safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1096.035s">Before</a>  I move on to the personnel issue, which will also be a brief update, are there any questions either on the transportation or general operational front? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1105.142s">Putting</a>  the human resources staffing questions to the side for a second, and I will be happy to answer those as well.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1111.506s">Member</a>  McLaughlin and then Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1117.871s">Thanks</a>  for that update.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1120.2s">And</a>  I'm wondering how families are able to let staff or folks know what transportation issues they're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1128.902s">So</a>  for example, if there is an issue with the bus, or if there's an issue with being 40 minutes in the line to get into the school because of the traffic remediation issues that we're having, particularly at the high school right now, what's the process for people to let folks know at Central? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1146.126s">One,</a>  and then the second is, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1149.045s">I'm</a>  hearing some qualitative information around folks who are saying that they're being marked hardy and want to know what folks can do for that if that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1159.454s">I'm</a>  sure it's probably miscommunication or something along the lines, but just how can people address that too?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1166.46s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1166.84s">Thank</a>  you for those questions, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1168.261s">McLaughlin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1168.722s">I</a>  think my first response <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1171.964s">cuts</a>  across both questions, and that is families and caretakers should reach out to their school principal school principal, particularly with some of these matters and sort of the normal rough and tumble of the opening of school school principal, and in the case the high school perhaps the assistant principal working closely with the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1191.208s">is</a>  gonna be the first line of defense in terms of being able to troubleshoot some of those issues, particularly with respect to students being marked tardy, because as a sort of general guideline, I don't wanna say that students aren't marked tardy, because that's not something I would want, no offense to our student reps, I'm sure you're all on time every day, but it's not necessarily something that we would officially endorse or condone, but as a general guideline, even without some of the traffic issues that we've had, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1218.784s">The</a>  expectation is that we're somewhat lenient in the first week or two of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1225.012s">It's</a>  not uncommon to find <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1227.717s">individuals</a>  who have just found their way to the high school for the first time, wandering around various hallways, and they're significantly removed from where they're supposed to be, and it's not through no intention on their part. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1239.31s">With</a>  regard to questions specific to transportation, if it's a specialized transportation issue, I would start with the Office of Student Services with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1248.58s">Bowen</a>  and her team. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1250.721s">because</a>  there are just a few nuances with respect to how we operationalize the specialized transportation issues and services rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1259.385s">If</a>  it's a non-specialized transportation, then I would start with the Office of Family and Community Engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1266.168s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1266.448s">Fidler-Carey</a>  has an email address that's available on the website that funnels all those questions through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1273.291s">And</a>  then we go through and make sure that there's a staff member assigned to address each one.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1277.284s">Can</a>  I just follow up on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1278.665s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1279.946s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1280.366s">So</a>  I'm wondering if it's on the website too, just in terms of like explicitly around transportation issues that folks know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1286.29s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1286.73s">That's</a>  helpful that folks know who to contact and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1289.512s">And</a>  so I'm also thinking about instances where we have, you know, students who are out of district, if it's a non-school day in Medford, but it's a school day in the district that they're in, how are we addressing, you know, that, especially if it's, you know, 7 45 in the morning, you know, folks aren't, you know, is there a protocol that sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1308.427s">made</a>  aware to families either on the website or otherwise, and if there's not, can there be?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1312.745s">Yeah,</a>  so thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1314.286s">And</a>  that is an issue, as I think we've talked about here before, that has come up and there have been some hiccups with before. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1319.671s">We</a>  have put some protocols in place to make sure that the appropriate offices are reaching out to those families when there is some type of a change of some kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1328.138s">I</a>  will double check that to make sure that that's as tight as we need it to be, because it's a protocol issue, but obviously the protocol is only as good as the execution of the protocol.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1340.028s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1340.528s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1340.708s">Hayes?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1341.289s">Member</a>  Hays? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1342.571s">Thanks,</a>  I had a question about the the memo that went out about bus transportation and that buses are crowded and I had several parents express some worries about that, especially I think there were a couple who had to were in the school for the first time and who aren't completely clear about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1359.522s">the</a>  cutoff of the one mile and they're concerned that they might actually be told that they can no longer take the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1366.889s">So</a>  will there be a clarification of that sooner? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1370.352s">How</a>  will that be communicated to parents if they are no longer going to access the bus?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1374.616s">Thank</a>  you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1375.617s">And</a>  I know this is a question that is on the minds of a lot of families. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1380.661s">just</a>  to back up for a moment, in the superintendent's weekly communication last week, we notified families that due to an increase in ridership, and the ridership has increased significantly with respect to students who have registered to take the bus, that increase is concentrated primarily at the Brooks Elementary School and at the two middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1401.048s">We're</a>  not seeing a disproportionate increase at the other schools at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1405.51s">But</a>  in those two areas, we are going through to look at each bus stop to determine if there were bus stops that at the elementary school are within the one-mile radius that is our practice in Medford or at the middle school within the two-mile radius, then it is possible that within the next week or so, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1423.639s">Fidler-Carey</a>  or the school administrator will have to contact the families of students at that bus stop and let them know that with advance notice, that bus stop will be discontinued. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1433.144s">Again,</a>  that's within the two mile radius for the middle school and one mile radius at the elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1438.272s">And</a>  a very, very important caveat to that is no bus stop is eliminated without a safety analysis happening first. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1444.881s">And</a>  so if the walking route to school is within the radius, but there's a busy intersection or a Felsway or something along those lines that would prevent a student from being able to safely walk that route, then the stop will not be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1463.794s">There</a>  will be advanced notice between the time that that communication, I think incidentally, we're talking about a fairly limited number of bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1469.999s">So</a>  I do not wanna give the impression that every bus stop under a mile, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1474.822s">or</a>  every bus stop under two miles is going to be eliminated because, again, the bus stops that exist are typically there and should be there due to safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1484.491s">Those</a>  aren't going to be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1485.852s">But</a>  we do have isolated spots, again, particularly at the middle schools and at the Brooks, where stops have been created, probably shouldn't have been created, frankly, are within that radius and are considered a safe route. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1500.064s">that</a>  determination, just to sort of anticipate the next question, a perfectly reasonable one, is made between the bus vendor, the Medford Public Schools, and the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1508.751s">All</a>  three entities are consulted to determine whether or not that's a safe route. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1512.333s">And</a>  at that point, that communication would be made to the families of students at that particular bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1518.678s">Again,</a>  it's a limited number of bus stops that are going to be affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1524.684s">I</a>  think any bus stop that is going to be affected will likely be notified before the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1529.61s">I'm</a>  sure Mr. Lucario will text me if my timeline is off on that, but I believe it'll be before the end of this week, and then there'll be a two-week lead time before we do a consolidation.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1544.645s">So</a>  I know, for example, in my case, I was given a choice of three different bus stops that were really close, all were close to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1552.571s">So</a>  when you say a bus stop is eliminated, those families are no longer eligible for the bus or they need to go to, I just think that could be confusing.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1559.296s">If</a>  they're within the radius, it's the bus stop that gets eliminated, not the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1565.62s">Typically,</a>  in your case, frankly, one analysis, and there's a variety of systems we're putting in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1572.243s">We've</a>  just retained a new vendor, Transfinder, that will help us to be able to do this analysis in a slightly more sophisticated way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1579.706s">But</a>  if it's really the case that in the Hayes household, there are three bus stops in such close proximity that you would have no particular preference amongst those three, then I would say it's probably the case that one of those, at least one, could probably be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1595.673s">And</a>  that's the type of analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1596.714s">It</a>  is possible that we will go through, there will be stops eliminated, and very, very few families will be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1602.277s">I</a>  think it's very unlikely that no families will be affected, though.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1608.48s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1609.26s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1612.102s">Do</a>  you anticipate any bus stops being eliminated that would be otherwise inside of our policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1619.844s">within</a>  like a bus stop more than a mile away, more than two miles away being eliminated?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1624.908s">I</a>  don't, I can't anticipate, I can't think of any circumstances under which that would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1629.911s">We're</a>  not looking to change in this moment at least, the practice of the one mile and two mile radius for the respective levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1637.857s">So</a>  I can't think of a circumstance under which a stop beyond that radius <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1642.901s">would</a>  be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1644.242s">I</a>  will say that part of what's challenging here is that, and if you recall we talked we dealt with this a little bit at the beginning of last year when we were sort of trying to upgrade this systems approach to developing our bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1659.397s">There</a>  are bus stops that have been created historically in Medford that probably shouldn't be there either because they're in close proximity to the school or they're transporting students to schools outside of that actual zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1671.922s">And</a>  obviously I'm referring to the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1674.583s">That</a>  is a practice that we are looking to reduce and then eventually eliminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1680.466s">And</a>  I would anticipate that we'll be coming before the committee shortly with a policy recommendation related to <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1688.789s">intradistrict</a>  transportation for students who have received intradistrict transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1694.691s">So</a>  students who are going to an elementary school but not in that elementary school zone don't have any specialized transportation needs specifically identified but have historically for some reason been provided transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1706.954s">We've</a>  been sort of working on these on a case-by-case basis over the course of the last year and <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1713.716s">In</a>  part, because when we came before you with a policy recommendation, it was our hope to have as few families as possible negatively affected by what we hope will be the new policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1723.425s">And</a>  I think thanks to the work of primarily Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1726.388s">Fidler-Carey,</a>  we're in a better place now to bring that recommendation before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1731.032s">And</a>  I would anticipate we'll be doing so relatively soon.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1737.85s">contract</a>  is up at the end of the school year, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1740.932s">Yes,</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1741.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1742.053s">So</a>  I think we've talked a number of times about whether one mile and two mile, particularly the two mile radius issue is the right radius for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1754.103s">And</a>  I would submit the traffic going into Medford High in the morning, maybe as an indicator that buses might help, but <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1763.783s">just</a>  try to think through when does the committee need to provide guidance to all of you about what changes if any should be made so that they can go into an RFP so that they can be posted because we were not given that opportunity the last time around and this was before your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1779.8s">We</a>  were just told here's the contract and we got to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1785.205s">I</a>  think there probably are transportation considerations that we should think about before the RFP goes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1792.493s">I</a>  just don't know what the right timing is for us to have that conversation.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1796.157s">I</a>  would say not the end of the year is my first response. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1801.863s">retention</a>  of the TransFinder vendor is in part so we can provide a data-based analysis to determine if you were to change that policy, what would the implications of it be? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1813.807s">Now,</a>  it's always fluid, obviously, because sometimes there are more students in one area than another, and there are some <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1822.689s">challenges</a>  that stem from our current zoning of elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1828.312s">That</a>  is an issue that's obviously well beyond the scope of the transportation consideration, but it is my hope that through TransFinder and the TransFinder expertise that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1838.478s">Fidler-Curry</a>  is accumulating, that we'll be able to provide some more data-based recommendations to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1845.56s">when</a>  that time comes up, which I would hope that we would be having that conversation, I'm gonna say in the fall, but by the fall, I mean before December, I definitely do not mean the next couple of weeks.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1854.442s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1855.562s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1857.202s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1858.422s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1860.283s">You</a>  said that just now that the transportation and the zoning of the schools, I don't remember your exact words, but I just wanna be sure that we do not get in a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1873.892s">sign</a>  a contract, a year later we decide to rezone, and we are limited because we have a contract for the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1882.337s">Now</a>  I've not been a part of a school system where the rezoning happened and how that would impact busing, but I can't imagine it doesn't impact busing, so I want to make sure that if we do <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1894.09s">pick</a>  up the incredibly hot potato of rezoning, we're not throwing ourselves into this fire and then really being stuck because of how we decided our bus contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1905.939s">So</a>  are those things truly a separate</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1910.049s">Well,</a>  so what I said was that when we bring forth analysis on the transportation, based on the transportation data, so that we can decide on routes and what we want to put into an RFP, that there may be some existing challenges that stem from our current zone situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1930.675s">that</a>  is going to be beyond the scope of our considerations with respect to transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1936.303s">I</a>  think I fully agree with the sort of underlying point that you're making, which is that our zoning system should not be dictated by a vendor agreement with our transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1946.577s">And</a>  I think the way that we guard against that is just making sure that the RFP affords sufficient flexibility to make sure that we are receiving the service that we need, irrespective of whether whatever other decisions the school committee makes with regard to zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1961.642s">Last</a>  point very quickly though, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1963.483s">is</a>  that any changes to zoning, which, as you know, we're not discussing tonight, but is something that is, as you called it a hot potato, but it's certainly that, and it's also one that's very consequential for a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1974.459s">So</a>  much so that it is not uncommon for when changes are made in a district of this size <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1980.027s">for</a>  there to be a lead time with respect to implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1983.389s">And</a>  it wouldn't shock me, frankly, if the lead time actually exceeded the length of what is typically a three-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1989.353s">So</a>  that may be one way in which we sort of are able to separate the two issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1992.595s">But</a>  generally speaking, I would say a vendor agreement can't hamper our ability to provide service to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=1999.88s">And</a>  zoning is one of the ways in which we provide service to students.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2003.323s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2006.224s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2007.836s">I</a>  thought miss it did you have one more 5 transition follow-up.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2011.742s">May</a>  from the chair just one question of course I know it talked about changing routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2016.349s">I</a>  saw one request come in for an additional route to how many requests do we have for additional routes.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2022.356s">I</a>  don't know the specific number of additional routes, but I would say that our primary bus vendor of Eastern Bus is experiencing the same challenges that we are as an organization with respect to workforce depletion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2036.66s">And</a>  so at the moment, the prospect of additional routes, I would say, is pretty slim. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2044.762s">There</a>  are a lot of requests that come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2048.601s">essentially</a>  good faith questions and requests that we do our best to accommodate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2056.243s">But</a>  our responsibility is to make sure that the system as a whole works and we accommodate whatever individual requests that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2063.265s">I</a>  can try to get some specific numbers in terms of if we have any data to suggest that there's sort of a demand that's not being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2071.967s">But</a>  generally speaking, I would say at the moment, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2074.768s">meeting</a>  more demand than we really have capacity to meet, which is why we're talking about the potential initial stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2079.951s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2080.891s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2083.072s">And</a>  if Megan is watching, feel free to correct me and I'll try to do, I'll try to correct myself before the end of the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2089.896s">So,</a>  um, with that, uh, yeah, number three report on personnel, Mr. David Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2096.319s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2097.56s">I</a>  thought I jumped at personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2099.601s">Um,</a>  we have, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2102.335s">We</a>  worked hard over the summer to fill as many of the personal vacancies as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2106.28s">Our</a>  administrator ranks are now fully staffed with the elevation of some teacher leadership roles, including our new coordinator of world languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2118.965s">and</a>  coordinators of performing arts and fine arts and I believe will be similar as we did the school leaders this evening, introducing those individuals to you in the coming weeks and with respect to teacher and paraprofessional roles we have seven teaching positions for which we're looking for either permanent appointments or <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2138.629s">long-term</a>  substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2140.55s">I</a>  believe the breakdown is three permanent positions of late summer resignations and four long-term substitute positions at various schools that we're looking to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2151.656s">We</a>  are, as we were last year, facing a significant challenge with respect to our paraprofessional staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2156.678s">It</a>  is comparable to the situation that we had last year around somewhere between 15 and 17 vacancies across all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2166.365s">And</a>  that's obviously a significant issue that is not uncommon. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2170.228s">Other</a>  districts are facing, it seems, challenges of similar scale, but definitely something that needs to be addressed in the coming days.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2181.654s">7</a>  positions open full-time now 15 to 17 last last year.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2186.076s">1517</a>  paraprofessionals this year 7 teaching positions okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2189.858s">Of</a>  the 7 teaching positions are just be there for our positions that would be filled with a lot of substitutes.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2197.621s">And</a>  the question I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2202.303s">I</a>  did again thank you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2204.624s">Obviously</a>  the paraprofessional issue is very concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2208.278s">I</a>  know that you and I have talked about this a number of times as well, and I'm mentioning it here publicly because I think folks know that it's an issue as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2216.207s">So</a>  it was brought to my attention earlier today that even postings for the paraprofessionals, if we could just go across all platforms and any platforms that are out there for postings, and I know every district is sort of looking, but <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2231.165s">The</a>  CPAC sort of alerted us tonight that there's not postings in different job listings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2237.687s">So</a>  I know a lot of folks go to SchoolSpring, and I forget the other ones, some of the other ones that are more popular for the world of education. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2244.989s">But</a>  if we're really trying to cast a wide net, if we're going to places like idealist.org, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2254.3s">LinkedIn</a>  and I mean not LinkedIn, Indeed and some other places, just to make sure that we're casting as wide a net as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2260.463s">I'm</a>  very concerned about the obvious potential legal ramifications, especially when there are students requiring paraprofessionals on a one-to-one basis in their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2273.709s">And</a>  I know if maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2275.831s">through</a>  the chair or through the superintendent, if the Director of Pupil Services wants to address that at all, just for public consumption, that would be really helpful in terms of how that's happening, because I'm getting a lot of questions particular to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2289.983s">So</a>  I'm also thinking about our therapeutic learning program in classrooms, a lot of those <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2295.166s">specifically,</a>  we talk a lot about our most vulnerable students, and they're also our most vulnerable teachers and paraprofessionals in those classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2301.99s">So</a>  how are we really working to remediate? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2304.531s">And</a>  I know in some instances, Central's going into the classrooms, which I'm sure that's an extra burden on everybody as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2310.734s">So</a>  how can we help? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2313.296s">How</a>  can we help spread the word? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2314.716s">What</a>  can we do to get extra help in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2317.498s">And</a>  also, you know, I'm sure that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2320.774s">meeting</a>  legal requirement, but just if you let folks know what that is and what that looks like, it'd be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2325.855s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2326.376s">So</a>  at this time, we're doing the best we can to fill the power positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2329.776s">We</a>  are expanding to different platforms to see if we can get more candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2334.218s">We've</a>  also created flyers that we're putting up in the library, grocery stores, restaurants, to see we have gotten candidates from those flyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2343.66s">We</a>  continue to try to meet every student's needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2347.241s">We</a>  are extremely short staff, so <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2350.322s">If</a>  there is an area that we're not able to be compliant in, we would look at what compensatory services would be for those families. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2358.385s">And</a>  that would be at a team meeting that would, it would be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2362.767s">But</a>  it's an ongoing recruitment that we're trying to get paraprofessionals in as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2370.23s">We</a>  were able to hire one or two in the past two weeks, but it's slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2375.25s">We're</a>  working as hard as we can and we're trying to expand it to as many people as possible to help us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2380.612s">So</a>  if you know anyone that's looking for a position, you know, tell them to, you know, send their resume my way, but we are going to expand the platforms as well.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2389.576s">Can</a>  I follow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2390.736s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2391.176s">Can</a>  I follow up there? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2392.877s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2393.801s">Just</a>  to follow up to that, thank you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2396.183s">Bowen,</a>  and appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2398.164s">And</a>  obviously, if families have concerns, they can reach out to their ETL at the school, letting them know if there's concerns specifically around paraprofessional coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2409.151s">But</a>  obviously, with one-to-one, for compensatory, I know you're talking probably speech, OT, that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2416.296s">you</a>  can't do compensatory for one-to-one in a classroom, so you obviously have to.</p>

    <p>[O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2419.838s">So</a>  we would have to have a team meeting to discuss what the specifics would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2424.12s">So</a>  if it's a student that needs a one-to-one in math, we may offer some sort of tutoring services after school or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2430.944s">So</a>  it's taking each individual case, case by case, and seeing what the services that we're missing and how we can provide that to them.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2439.329s">Okay,</a>  because I know some IEPs have one-to-one for the students specifically, and sometimes with the shortage, if there's a <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2445.6s">if</a>  there's a paraprofessional in the classroom and they're assigned to a student one-to-one, but they can also be acting as a classroom paraprofessional. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2453.005s">So</a>  then it's two roles that they're trying to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2455.447s">And</a>  obviously if the IEP is requiring them to fill one, it's sort of tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2458.709s">It</a>  is very tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2459.91s">It</a>  is really tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2460.771s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2461.772s">And</a>  so I want to make sure that everyone's aware of how tricky this is because we really, really, really, you know, need people to help support us in these situations and to figure out what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2472.699s">And</a>  then do we do exit interviews at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2475.157s">with</a>  folks like that if people are, if we have high attrition with our paras, are we doing any exit interviews?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2481.862s">We</a>  certainly, we try to, but I can't say that it's 100% because people leave with various timelines and their various circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2488.627s">So</a>  as a general rule, I think it's a good practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2491.75s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2493.391s">If</a>  I could just follow up quickly on the platform issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2496.593s">It's</a>  the administration's policy to use every platform available to us <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2501.513s">particularly</a>  for some of these positions where there's both high turnover and high demand and high volume. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2506.775s">So</a>  I don't, I am familiar with the email that you've referenced and it is something that I've asked my staff to follow up on to see if sometimes there are postings that expire and if we don't catch them, then we need to renew them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2518.699s">But</a>  it's as a general rule, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2521.16s">the</a>  postings are up across a variety of platforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2524.323s">And</a>  again, for the situation with respect to the Paris, that's necessary because we obviously need to cast as wide of a net as possible.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2535.49s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2546.398s">I</a>  wouldn't mind finishing the report, but after that,</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2553.624s">it</a>  will.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2557.587s">So</a>  really. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2558.487s">It's</a>  it's good to see you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2564.792s">Were</a>  there any questions related to the vacancies or with respect to I think we left off of the teacher and power positions.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2575.879s">Member</a>  Ruseau are any of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2581.143s">You</a>  know off the top of your head that the teacher <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2583.646s">positions</a>  that are open. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2584.767s">I</a>  mean, you know, like if we have one calculus teacher and we don't have calculus.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2589.05s">So</a>  they're all, they're non classroom, uh, traditional classroom teaching roles, but they are all, uh, high, uh, most vulnerable student supporting positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2600.217s">So</a>  they're all, uh, high priorities to face. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2603.279s">It's</a>  not, so it also means that there's more flexibility sometimes with respect to how we make sure those services and support are rendered. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2609.623s">But,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2611.813s">They</a>  are all in that job category. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2614.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2614.636s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2614.876s">You</a>  should be careful standing next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2620.12s">It's</a>  a dangerous place.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2623.46s">Just</a>  to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2624.101s">Name</a>  and address for the record, and then please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2626.462s">Gina</a>  Coppola, president of paraprofessionals, instructional tutors, OTAs, PTAs, kindergarten assistant, and anything else that comes under assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2636.988s">Nice</a>  to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2638.168s">I</a>  just want to clarify for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2640.25s">The</a>  reason why we have the shortage is, as you know, it's the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2646.193s">And</a>  a lot of cities and towns <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2648.962s">have</a>  poached, should I say that word, our brightest and best, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2655.548s">And</a>  I had the mayor of Somerville say to me, we're so glad that you trained them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2661.754s">We</a>  know how Medford trains paraprofessionals so good, but we're taking them one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2670.506s">That's</a>  what I was told by phone call, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2674.409s">So</a>  I wanna say that, yes, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2677.011s">McLaughlin,</a>  there is a couple of paras, which I will talk to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2681.795s">Bowen</a>  about tomorrow, that are doing sixth, seventh, and eighth, and that's impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2688.721s">If</a>  you have a teacher that's in seventh grade, oh, excuse me, I have to leave for eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2694.245s">Sorry</a>  if Tommy's not feeling well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2697.168s">You</a>  see what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2698.939s">That's</a>  unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2700.52s">And</a>  we can't possibly have that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2703.462s">Not</a>  for $17,300. <a href="https://youtu.be/gqBOBLNPKLQ&t=2704.183s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
