1
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:35,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford High School for its incredible staff and student body.

2
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:41,006
[SPEAKER_19]: This year has started at a great note and we are excited for the coming months and events that will take place.

3
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:49,510
[SPEAKER_19]: My peers and I are eager to speak about any problems in the school environment as well as start discussions for changes that are needed to improve the quality of our school.

4
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:56,866
[SPEAKER_19]: We hope to gain knowledge about important matters, and we are honored to be able to participate and attend the school committee meetings for this year.

5
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:02,348
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an amazing opportunity for us, and we hope to get as much out of this experience as possible.

6
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:02,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

7
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:13,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

8
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:14,914
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could all please rise to salute the flag.

9
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:19,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

10
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,883
[SPEAKER_03]: and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

11
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:27,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

12
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:30,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We have number three, good of the order.

13
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:32,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

14
00:01:36,158 --> 00:01:36,578
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

15
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:46,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to, for good of the order, since it's the first meeting of the month and we typically have it, last year we talked about setting some goals for a school committee.

16
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:56,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to think about, put it out to my colleagues about what we want those to be and when we can schedule a time to discuss what they will be.

17
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:57,772
[SPEAKER_04]: We have number three, good of the order.

18
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

19
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:03,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

20
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:13,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to, for good of the order, since it's the first meeting of the month and we typically have it, last year we talked about setting some goals for a school committee.

21
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:23,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to think about, read out to my colleagues about what those would be and how we can schedule a time to discuss what they will be.

22
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:25,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We have number three, good of the order.

23
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

24
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:30,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Third time's the charm.

25
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:31,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

26
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:40,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to, for good of the order, since it's the first meeting of the month and we have it, last year we talked about setting some goals.

27
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,513
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have a good of the order, yeah.

28
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

29
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:57,415
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

30
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just start.

31
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I think everybody probably heard that a couple of times, but you know, so we want to set some goals.

32
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:12,197
[SPEAKER_02]: We had voted last year that we were going to set goals for school committee.

33
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:20,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just wanted to put out to my colleagues, you know, that we don't want to wait another, I assume we don't want to wait another whole month for the next good of the order to discuss this.

34
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:26,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'd like to make a motion that we set a time, some, you know,

35
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:32,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Committee of the Whole or something maybe this month to talk about setting goals.

36
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:32,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

37
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:37,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion on the floor by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member McStone.

38
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:38,649
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

39
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,270
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

40
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee of the Whole will be scheduled in the next several weeks to discuss the good of the order and goals for the upcoming year.

41
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:51,695
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the consent agenda, bills and payrolls, special school committee meeting minutes June 13, 2022, and Committee of the Whole meeting minutes June 22, 2022.

42
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:52,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion for approval?

43
00:03:57,861 --> 00:03:58,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

44
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,683
[SPEAKER_05]: By Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Rousseau.

45
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,584
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

46
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:02,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

47
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:03,145
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

48
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:04,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper passes.

49
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:07,449
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no reports of subcommittees.

50
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And number six, report of the superintendent.

51
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one is superintendent's updates and comments.

52
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent, superintendent.

53
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:17,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

54
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:20,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

56
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,043
[SPEAKER_08]: As we begin tonight,

57
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:34,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be remiss if I did not mention that yesterday was the 21st anniversary of the horrific September 11th terrorist attacks on our country.

58
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:42,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that everyone remembers where they were that day when that first plane hit the World Trade Center.

59
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:50,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Despite the unspeakable pain and loss, we will always feel at the deaths of over 2,900 people

60
00:04:52,679 --> 00:05:01,106
[SPEAKER_08]: We also remember the sense of unity and service that was palpable during this time 21 years ago.

61
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:20,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Indeed, in our work, educating students who were not yet born on September 11th, we strive to continue that commitment to service and in the hope that there will be moments devoid of tragedy in which we will once again feel, at least to some degree, that sense of unity.

62
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:37,428
[SPEAKER_08]: To honor the memory of all those lost, I respectfully ask that we rise for a moment of silence to remember all those who perished and for all the public safety personnel who ran to help the victims that day.

63
00:05:56,866 --> 00:06:16,818
[SPEAKER_08]: And sadly, I would also like to ask that we just take one additional moment of silence to honor the memory of Kyle Roust, a 2019 Medford High School graduate who lost his life in a tragic accident this summer.

64
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:32,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

65
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:39,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the last several weeks, this is regards to the opening of school.

66
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:49,715
[SPEAKER_08]: The hallways and classrooms of our school buildings have once again been filled with students and staff, as together we once again embark upon a new school year.

67
00:06:51,636 --> 00:07:01,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Administrators and first year educators arrived on campus the week of August 22nd, and our new staff were treated to an induction week.

68
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,149
[SPEAKER_08]: as well to help them get acclimated to the Mustang community.

69
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:21,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Induction week this year included a tour of the city of Medford, in which our new colleagues visited Tufts University, the Royal House, and the slave quarters, and the brand new Medford Library.

70
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:26,836
[SPEAKER_08]: After the library, the group was welcomed to Medford by Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern.

71
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:31,097
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a more detailed report next week from Dr. Riccardelli.

72
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:44,704
[SPEAKER_08]: If the last few school years have taught us anything, it is that the partnerships we enjoy as a school are critically important to the execution of our mission.

73
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:59,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to take this opportunity to recognize several different invaluable partnerships that make it possible for us to do this work.

74
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:16,755
[SPEAKER_08]: First, our most sincere thanks goes to our Members Plus Credit Union for providing 100 filled backpacks for our students, and to Wegmans for providing additional school supplies for our middle and high school students.

75
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:28,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Second, I would like to note the generous donations from Tufts University, Herb Chambers, Simple Fare, and East Cambridge Savings Bank.

76
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:43,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the networks night of 10,000 lights had a wonderful fundraiser at rights pawn this past Saturday evening, and due to generous donations of our partners that event was able to take place.

77
00:08:47,887 --> 00:09:02,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to share, as we announced last week, that the Medford Public Schools has reached tentative agreements with three of our bargaining units, representing administrative assistants, carpenters and maintenance personnel, and school nurses.

78
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:14,228
[SPEAKER_08]: We are grateful to each of these groups for their commitment to the district, and we'll be submitting those tentative agreements to the school committee for your final approval in the coming days.

79
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:44,008
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, as we announced last week, and with the unanimous support of the school committee, we have declared an impasse in our negotiations with the Medford Teachers Association in order so we may petition the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations to assign a neutral mediator to assist toward a resolution on a successor agreement.

80
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:49,938
[SPEAKER_08]: These decisions will be discussed later in the agenda in our labor update.

81
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:59,205
[SPEAKER_08]: But to be clear, the declaration of an impasse in no way constitutes the district walking away from the bargaining table.

82
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:12,294
[SPEAKER_08]: It instead means we are looking to engage in this negotiation with the assistance of a mediator in the hope of expediting a resolution.

83
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:21,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have anything else to say, Mr. Gopnik?

84
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:23,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

85
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:36,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, there are a few reminders and updates that reflect what a busy time of year this is for our Mustang community.

86
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:46,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Fall sports season is in full swing, and we wish all of our athletes well.

87
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:53,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Mustang football team began their season this past Friday against Arlington.

88
00:10:55,088 --> 00:11:01,772
[SPEAKER_08]: We do encourage all community members to check out our sports schedule to support our student athletes.

89
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:13,619
[SPEAKER_08]: This week, Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council hosts its first virtual meeting of the new year on Wednesday.

90
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:22,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunday, Mustang alum Dave McGilvery's inaugural Run Medford event will be held.

91
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:29,397
[SPEAKER_08]: CCSR and Power Kids were selected as beneficiaries of this race.

92
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:42,266
[SPEAKER_08]: On September 24th at Hormel Stadium, the Mustang Band will host and compete at the New England Band Competition.

93
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:56,151
[SPEAKER_11]: And this year in Medford, we are opening with several new faces.

94
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:08,621
[SPEAKER_08]: While there are very limited number of teaching positions and power positions that we still need to fill, we have successfully filled the vast majority of vacancies.

95
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:18,149
[SPEAKER_08]: As noted in one of my back to school bulletins, we are welcoming several new leaders into administrator roles.

96
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:32,649
[SPEAKER_08]: While we hope to have an opportunity to introduce you to several of these new faces in presentations in the coming weeks and months, I've asked our two newly minted school leaders to join us tonight.

97
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:46,340
[SPEAKER_08]: It is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Andrew O'Brien, friendly assistant principal at the Roberts Elementary School, who is now the principal of the McGlynn Elementary School.

98
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:52,729
[SPEAKER_08]: and Dr. Lori Hodgdon, who is now the principal of the Curtis Tufts High School.

99
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:59,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Lori most recently held the role of school director at the Collegiate Charter School of Law.

100
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:11,634
[SPEAKER_08]: At this time, I would like to ask Mr. Andy O'Brien and Dr. Lori Hodgdon to step forward so that they may be recognized.

101
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:30,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

102
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

103
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:33,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are my remarks.

104
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:36,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Doctor Edward Vincent.

105
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:42,056
[SPEAKER_05]: We have number two opening report on transportation operations.

106
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:45,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. David Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

107
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you mayor, members of the school committee.

108
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure to be with you again.

109
00:13:56,624 --> 00:13:57,767
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a wonderful summer.

110
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,502
[SPEAKER_00]: This first update is a very brief deck.

111
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:04,344
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just go to the one and only slide.

112
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:20,555
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, and as the superintendent's back to school bulletins referenced several times, the beginning of school can be a bumpy period, particularly with respect to some of our operational areas, and that's certainly true in the area of transportation.

113
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:38,726
[SPEAKER_00]: The operations and transportation update to some degree are going to blend together because a lot of the operational challenges that we're facing currently at the beginning of this school year and historically at the beginning of every school year relate to transportation issues as well as

114
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:40,366
[SPEAKER_00]: school safety issues.

115
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:56,791
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say that to summarize at a very high level, we've had a generally successful opening to school opening of school with respect to on the operational side that that certainly do in no small measure to staff members, teachers, paraprofessionals,

116
00:14:57,551 --> 00:15:06,438
[SPEAKER_00]: custodians, administrative assistants, and everyone else in our various school communities who have helped us to get off to a pretty efficient and pretty smooth start.

117
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:23,251
[SPEAKER_00]: As referenced there in the slide, one of the priorities over the course of the summer, both for the Medford Public Schools, as well as the city of Medford, has been our ongoing and continuous communication and work with the Medford Police Department to make sure that

118
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:29,994
[SPEAKER_00]: All operational concerns with respect to student and staff safety are being prioritized first and foremost.

119
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:34,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are adjustments and things that we can speak publicly about.

120
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:40,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, as we've talked about in this forum many times before, are items that we wouldn't necessarily discuss in public.

121
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:51,802
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can commit to you that they are being prioritized in this work taking place in each school to make sure that safety is where it needs to be on our priority list.

122
00:15:52,662 --> 00:16:00,865
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways in which we've tried to enhance safety is by taking a very close look at the traffic patterns surrounding each school.

123
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:07,748
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic around our schools and our building administrators, particularly at the elementary level,

124
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:09,869
[SPEAKER_00]: joined Ms.

125
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:19,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Galuccio and myself at the Metro Police Department headquarters last spring when some of the traffic concerns were sort of boiling over in a variety of ways.

126
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:30,883
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to put in some ad hoc solutions around schools, working with our traffic, or the police department's traffic supervisors to make sure that we were able to troubleshoot some of those areas.

127
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:49,915
[SPEAKER_00]: before the close of school last year, but we had all sort of left those meetings knowing that there were more things that we were gonna have to do surrounding each school to make sure that dismissal in particular, for a variety of logistical reasons, student drop-off at the moment is not a huge concern.

128
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:55,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize that there's some significant traffic issues surrounding the high school.

129
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Those issues, frankly, are not all pertaining to the high school, that's the area

130
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:03,042
[SPEAKER_00]: around the high school is seeing some significant construction work.

131
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:12,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the slowdowns that families and students have experienced during the drop-off at the high school, they really don't have anything to do.

132
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:16,944
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't put in any changed protocols related to the high school on drop-off.

133
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:24,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Pickup, on the other hand, at a few schools has been a challenge in terms of the traffic and the congestion.

134
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:36,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've installed speed bumps at the high school, which I know we've received some feedback on, which we always appreciate, as well as some various traffic strategies that we've put into place there.

135
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:45,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, we are, from the administration's perspective, pretty pleased with how the first couple weeks of school have gone.

136
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,213
[SPEAKER_00]: The parking lot at the high school is clearing out.

137
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:52,614
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 12 minutes, on average, 12 minutes faster than it was previously.

138
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:58,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's with traffic having been slowed down due to the speed bumps that were installed.

139
00:17:58,395 --> 00:18:13,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think our decision to move the primary student pickup area over to the West Courtyard Loop is, from our perspective, success, and that we think we've been able to improve safety.

140
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:24,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I move on to the personnel issue, which will also be a brief update, are there any questions either on the transportation or general operational front?

141
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:30,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting the human resources staffing questions to the side for a second, and I will be happy to answer those as well.

142
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:32,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin and then Member Hayes.

143
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:38,612
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for that update.

144
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:48,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering how families are able to let staff or folks know what transportation issues they're having.

145
00:18:48,902 --> 00:19:05,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, if there is an issue with the bus, or if there's an issue with being 40 minutes in the line to get into the school because of the traffic remediation issues that we're having, particularly at the high school right now, what's the process for people to let folks know at Central?

146
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:07,486
[SPEAKER_02]: One, and then the second is,

147
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:19,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing some qualitative information around folks who are saying that they're being marked hardy and want to know what folks can do for that if that happens.

148
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:26,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's probably miscommunication or something along the lines, but just how can people address that too?

149
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:26,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

150
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for those questions, Ms.

151
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:28,682
[SPEAKER_00]: McLaughlin.

152
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:30,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my first response

153
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:48,991
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts across both questions, and that is families and caretakers should reach out to their school principal school principal, particularly with some of these matters and sort of the normal rough and tumble of the opening of school school principal, and in the case the high school perhaps the assistant principal working closely with the house.

154
00:19:51,208 --> 00:20:17,323
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna be the first line of defense in terms of being able to troubleshoot some of those issues, particularly with respect to students being marked tardy, because as a sort of general guideline, I don't wanna say that students aren't marked tardy, because that's not something I would want, no offense to our student reps, I'm sure you're all on time every day, but it's not necessarily something that we would officially endorse or condone, but as a general guideline, even without some of the traffic issues that we've had,

155
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:24,631
[SPEAKER_00]: The expectation is that we're somewhat lenient in the first week or two of school.

156
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,294
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not uncommon to find

157
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:38,068
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals who have just found their way to the high school for the first time, wandering around various hallways, and they're significantly removed from where they're supposed to be, and it's not through no intention on their part.

158
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:48,540
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to questions specific to transportation, if it's a specialized transportation issue, I would start with the Office of Student Services with Ms.

159
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen and her team.

160
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:59,365
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are just a few nuances with respect to how we operationalize the specialized transportation issues and services rather.

161
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:05,828
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a non-specialized transportation, then I would start with the Office of Family and Community Engagement.

162
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:06,408
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ms.

163
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:12,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Fidler-Carrie has an email address that's available on the website that funnels all those questions through.

164
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go through and make sure that there's a staff member assigned to address each one.

165
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:18,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just follow up on that?

166
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:19,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

167
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:20,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

168
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:25,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if it's on the website too, just in terms of like explicitly around transportation issues that folks know.

169
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:26,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

170
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,432
[SPEAKER_02]: That's helpful that folks know who to contact and how.

171
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:47,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm also thinking about instances where we have, you know, students who are out of district, if it's a non-school day in Medford, but it's a school day in the district that they're in, how are we addressing, you know, that, especially if it's, you know, 7 45 in the morning, you know, folks aren't, you know, is there a protocol that sort of,

172
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:52,356
[SPEAKER_02]: made aware to families either on the website or otherwise, and if there's not, can there be?

173
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so thank you for that.

174
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:59,391
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an issue, as I think we've talked about here before, that has come up and there have been some hiccups with before.

175
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:07,457
[SPEAKER_00]: We have put some protocols in place to make sure that the appropriate offices are reaching out to those families when there is some type of a change of some kind.

176
00:22:08,138 --> 00:22:17,566
[SPEAKER_00]: I will double check that to make sure that that's as tight as we need it to be, because it's a protocol issue, but obviously the protocol is only as good as the execution of the protocol.

177
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:20,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

178
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:20,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

179
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:20,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Hayes?

180
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:21,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Hayes?

181
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:39,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, I had a question about the the memo that went out about bus transportation and that buses are crowded and I had several parents express some worries about that, especially I think there were a couple who had to were in the school for the first time and who aren't completely clear about.

182
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:45,748
[SPEAKER_15]: the cutoff of the one mile and they're concerned that they might actually be told that they can no longer take the bus.

183
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:49,611
[SPEAKER_15]: So will there be a clarification of that sooner?

184
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:54,496
[SPEAKER_15]: How will that be communicated to parents if they are no longer going to access the bus?

185
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:55,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that question.

186
00:22:55,617 --> 00:23:00,081
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this is a question that is on the minds of a lot of families.

187
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:20,668
[SPEAKER_00]: just to back up for a moment, in the superintendent's weekly communication last week, we notified families that due to an increase in ridership, and the ridership has increased significantly with respect to students who have registered to take the bus, that increase is concentrated primarily at the Brooks Elementary School and at the two middle schools.

188
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:24,550
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing a disproportionate increase at the other schools at the moment.

189
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:43,619
[SPEAKER_00]: But in those two areas, we are going through to look at each bus stop to determine if there were bus stops that at the elementary school are within the one-mile radius that is our practice in Medford or at the middle school within the two-mile radius, then it is possible that within the next week or so, Ms.

190
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:52,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Fidler-Carrie or the school administrator will have to contact the families of students at that bus stop and let them know that with advance notice, that bus stop will be discontinued.

191
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:57,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's within the two mile radius for the middle school and one mile radius at the elementary school.

192
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:04,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very, very important caveat to that is no bus stop is eliminated without a safety analysis happening first.

193
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:22,914
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the walking route to school is within the radius, but there's a busy intersection or a Felsway or something along those lines that would prevent a student from being able to safely walk that route, then the stop will not be eliminated.

194
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:29,959
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be advanced notice between the time that that communication, I think incidentally, we're talking about a fairly limited number of bus stops.

195
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not wanna give the impression that every bus stop under a mile,

196
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:44,311
[SPEAKER_00]: or every bus stop under two miles is going to be eliminated because, again, the bus stops that exist are typically there and should be there due to safety concerns.

197
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:45,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't going to be eliminated.

198
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:58,743
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have isolated spots, again, particularly at the middle schools and at the Brooks, where stops have been created, probably shouldn't have been created, frankly, are within that radius and are considered a safe route.

199
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:08,711
[SPEAKER_00]: that determination, just to sort of anticipate the next question, a perfectly reasonable one, is made between the bus vendor, the Medford Public Schools, and the Medford Police Department.

200
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:12,273
[SPEAKER_00]: All three entities are consulted to determine whether or not that's a safe route.

201
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:18,138
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, that communication would be made to the families of students at that particular bus stop.

202
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:24,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a limited number of bus stops that are going to be affected by this.

203
00:25:24,684 --> 00:25:28,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I think any bus stop that is going to be affected will likely be notified before the end of this week.

204
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:39,300
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Mr. Lucario will text me if my timeline is off on that, but I believe it'll be before the end of this week, and then there'll be a two-week lead time before we do a consolidation.

205
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:51,730
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know, for example, in my case, I was given a choice of three different bus stops that were really close, all were close to my house.

206
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:59,276
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you say a bus stop is eliminated, those families are no longer eligible for the bus or they need to go to, I just think that could be confusing.

207
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:03,819
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're within the radius, it's the bus stop that gets eliminated, not the student.

208
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:12,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, in your case, frankly, one analysis, and there's a variety of systems we're putting in place.

209
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:19,026
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just retained a new vendor, Transfinder, that will help us to be able to do this analysis in a slightly more sophisticated way.

210
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:34,633
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's really the case that in the Hayes household, there are three bus stops in such close proximity that you would have no particular preference amongst those three, then I would say it's probably the case that one of those, at least one, could probably be eliminated.

211
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:36,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the type of analysis.

212
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:41,936
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible that we will go through, there will be stops eliminated, and very, very few families will be affected.

213
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:44,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very unlikely that no families will be affected, though.

214
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

215
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

216
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:58,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you anticipate any bus stops being eliminated that would be otherwise inside of our policy?

217
00:26:59,844 --> 00:27:04,387
[SPEAKER_17]: within like a bus stop more than a mile away, more than two miles away being eliminated?

218
00:27:04,908 --> 00:27:08,651
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I can't anticipate, I can't think of any circumstances under which that would happen.

219
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:17,217
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking to change in this moment at least, the practice of the one mile and two mile radius for the respective levels.

220
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:22,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't think of a circumstance under which a stop beyond that radius

221
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:23,662
[SPEAKER_00]: would be eliminated.

222
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:38,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that part of what's challenging here is that, and if you recall we talked we dealt with this a little bit at the beginning of last year when we were sort of trying to upgrade this systems approach to developing our bus stops.

223
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:51,862
[SPEAKER_00]: There are bus stops that have been created historically in Medford that probably shouldn't be there either because they're in close proximity to the school or they're transporting students to schools outside of that actual zone.

224
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously I'm referring to the elementary schools.

225
00:27:54,583 --> 00:28:00,346
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a practice that we are looking to reduce and then eventually eliminate.

226
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:08,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would anticipate that we'll be coming before the committee shortly with a policy recommendation related to

227
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:14,211
[SPEAKER_00]: intradistrict transportation for students who have received intradistrict transfers.

228
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:26,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So students who are going to an elementary school but not in that elementary school zone don't have any specialized transportation needs specifically identified but have historically for some reason been provided transportation.

229
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:33,056
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been sort of working on these on a case-by-case basis over the course of the last year and

230
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:42,985
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, because when we came before you with a policy recommendation, it was our hope to have as few families as possible negatively affected by what we hope will be the new policy.

231
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:46,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think thanks to the work of primarily Ms.

232
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:50,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Fidler-Carey, we're in a better place now to bring that recommendation before you.

233
00:28:51,032 --> 00:28:52,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would anticipate we'll be doing so relatively soon.

234
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,812
[SPEAKER_17]: contract is up at the end of the school year, is that correct?

235
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:01,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.

236
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:01,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

237
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:14,023
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we've talked a number of times about whether one mile and two mile, particularly the two mile radius issue is the right radius for our students.

238
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:23,310
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would submit the traffic going into Medford High in the morning, maybe as an indicator that buses might help, but

239
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:39,240
[SPEAKER_17]: just try to think through when does the committee need to provide guidance to all of you about what changes if any should be made so that they can go into an RFP so that they can be posted because we were not given that opportunity the last time around and this was before your time.

240
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,464
[SPEAKER_17]: We were just told here's the contract and we got to sign it.

241
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:51,852
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there probably are transportation considerations that we should think about before the RFP goes out.

242
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:56,137
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't know what the right timing is for us to have that conversation.

243
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:59,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say not the end of the year is my first response.

244
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:13,767
[SPEAKER_00]: retention of the TransFinder vendor is in part so we can provide a data-based analysis to determine if you were to change that policy, what would the implications of it be?

245
00:30:13,807 --> 00:30:20,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's always fluid, obviously, because sometimes there are more students in one area than another, and there are some

246
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:27,292
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that stem from our current zoning of elementary schools.

247
00:30:28,312 --> 00:30:38,458
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an issue that's obviously well beyond the scope of the transportation consideration, but it is my hope that through TransFinder and the TransFinder expertise that Ms.

248
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:44,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Fidler-Curry is accumulating, that we'll be able to provide some more data-based recommendations to you.

249
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:53,821
[SPEAKER_00]: when that time comes up, which I would hope that we would be having that conversation, I'm gonna say in the fall, but by the fall, I mean before December, I definitely do not mean the next couple of weeks.

250
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:55,082
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, thank you.

251
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

252
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:58,022
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Rousseau.

253
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:58,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

254
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:12,905
[SPEAKER_21]: You said that just now that the transportation and the zoning of the schools, I don't remember your exact words, but I just wanna be sure that we do not get in a situation where

255
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:20,976
[SPEAKER_21]: sign a contract, a year later we decide to rezone, and we are limited because we have a contract for the bus.

256
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:32,764
[SPEAKER_21]: Now I've not been a part of a school system where the rezoning happened and how that would impact busing, but I can't imagine it doesn't impact busing, so I want to make sure that if we do

257
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:45,859
[SPEAKER_21]: pick up the incredibly hot potato of rezoning, we're not throwing ourselves into this fire and then really being stuck because of how we decided our bus contract.

258
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:49,182
[SPEAKER_21]: So are those things truly a separate

259
00:31:50,049 --> 00:32:10,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so what I said was that when we bring forth analysis on the transportation, based on the transportation data, so that we can decide on routes and what we want to put into an RFP, that there may be some existing challenges that stem from our current zone situation.

260
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:15,282
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to be beyond the scope of our considerations with respect to transportation.

261
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:26,137
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I fully agree with the sort of underlying point that you're making, which is that our zoning system should not be dictated by a vendor agreement with our transportation.

262
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:41,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the way that we guard against that is just making sure that the RFP affords sufficient flexibility to make sure that we are receiving the service that we need, irrespective of whether whatever other decisions the school committee makes with regard to zoning.

263
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:42,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Last point very quickly though,

264
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:53,939
[SPEAKER_00]: is that any changes to zoning, which, as you know, we're not discussing tonight, but is something that is, as you called it a hot potato, but it's certainly that, and it's also one that's very consequential for a district.

265
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:59,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that it is not uncommon for when changes are made in a district of this size

266
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:02,829
[SPEAKER_00]: for there to be a lead time with respect to implementation.

267
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:08,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't shock me, frankly, if the lead time actually exceeded the length of what is typically a three-year contract.

268
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:12,515
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be one way in which we sort of are able to separate the two issues.

269
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:19,480
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, I would say a vendor agreement can't hamper our ability to provide service to students.

270
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,982
[SPEAKER_00]: And zoning is one of the ways in which we provide service to students.

271
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:23,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

272
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:26,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

273
00:33:27,836 --> 00:33:30,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought miss it did you have one more 5 transition follow-up.

274
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:35,909
[SPEAKER_05]: May from the chair just one question of course I know it talked about changing routes.

275
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:41,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw one request come in for an additional route to how many requests do we have for additional routes.

276
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:56,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the specific number of additional routes, but I would say that our primary bus vendor of Eastern Bus is experiencing the same challenges that we are as an organization with respect to workforce depletion.

277
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:03,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the moment, the prospect of additional routes, I would say, is pretty slim.

278
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,623
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of requests that come in.

279
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:16,183
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially good faith questions and requests that we do our best to accommodate.

280
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:22,805
[SPEAKER_00]: But our responsibility is to make sure that the system as a whole works and we accommodate whatever individual requests that we can.

281
00:34:23,265 --> 00:34:31,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I can try to get some specific numbers in terms of if we have any data to suggest that there's sort of a demand that's not being met.

282
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,768
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, I would say at the moment,

283
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:39,931
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting more demand than we really have capacity to meet, which is why we're talking about the potential initial stops.

284
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:40,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

285
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:41,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

286
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:49,856
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Megan is watching, feel free to correct me and I'll try to do, I'll try to correct myself before the end of the meeting.

287
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:56,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, with that, uh, yeah, number three report on personnel, Mr. David Murphy.

288
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:56,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.

289
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I jumped at personnel.

290
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:01,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have, uh,

291
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:05,419
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked hard over the summer to fill as many of the personal vacancies as possible.

292
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:17,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Our administrator ranks are now fully staffed with the elevation of some teacher leadership roles, including our new coordinator of world languages.

293
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:37,789
[SPEAKER_00]: and coordinators of performing arts and fine arts and I believe will be similar as we did the school leaders this evening, introducing those individuals to you in the coming weeks and with respect to teacher and paraprofessional roles we have seven teaching positions for which we're looking for either permanent appointments or

294
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:39,750
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term substitutes.

295
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:50,575
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the breakdown is three permanent positions of late summer resignations and four long-term substitute positions at various schools that we're looking to fill.

296
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:55,958
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, as we were last year, facing a significant challenge with respect to our paraprofessional staffing.

297
00:35:56,678 --> 00:36:05,705
[SPEAKER_00]: It is comparable to the situation that we had last year around somewhere between 15 and 17 vacancies across all schools.

298
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:10,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's obviously a significant issue that is not uncommon.

299
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:19,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Other districts are facing, it seems, challenges of similar scale, but definitely something that needs to be addressed in the coming days.

300
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:25,436
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 positions open full-time now 15 to 17 last last year.

301
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:29,057
[SPEAKER_00]: 1517 paraprofessionals this year 7 teaching positions okay.

302
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:35,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 7 teaching positions are just be there for our positions that would be filled with a lot of substitutes.

303
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:38,601
[SPEAKER_11]: And the question I do.

304
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:43,383
[SPEAKER_24]: I did again thank you.

305
00:36:44,624 --> 00:36:47,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously the paraprofessional issue is very concerning.

306
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:55,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you and I have talked about this a number of times as well, and I'm mentioning it here publicly because I think folks know that it's an issue as well.

307
00:36:56,207 --> 00:37:09,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was brought to my attention earlier today that even postings for the paraprofessionals, if we could just go across all platforms and any platforms that are out there for postings, and I know every district is sort of looking, but

308
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:17,647
[SPEAKER_02]: The CPAC sort of alerted us tonight that there's not postings in different job listings.

309
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:24,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know a lot of folks go to SchoolSpring, and I forget the other ones, some of the other ones that are more popular for the world of education.

310
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:29,291
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're really trying to cast a wide net, if we're going to places like idealist.org,

311
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:40,423
[SPEAKER_02]: LinkedIn and I mean not LinkedIn, Indeed and some other places, just to make sure that we're casting as wide a net as possible.

312
00:37:40,463 --> 00:37:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very concerned about the obvious potential legal ramifications, especially when there are students requiring paraprofessionals on a one-to-one basis in their classroom.

313
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:54,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know if maybe

314
00:37:55,831 --> 00:38:09,522
[SPEAKER_02]: through the chair or through the superintendent, if the Director of Pupil Services wants to address that at all, just for public consumption, that would be really helpful in terms of how that's happening, because I'm getting a lot of questions particular to that.

315
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:14,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm also thinking about our therapeutic learning program in classrooms, a lot of those

316
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:21,950
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, we talk a lot about our most vulnerable students, and they're also our most vulnerable teachers and paraprofessionals in those classrooms.

317
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are we really working to remediate?

318
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:30,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know in some instances, Central's going into the classrooms, which I'm sure that's an extra burden on everybody as well.

319
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:32,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we help?

320
00:38:33,296 --> 00:38:34,636
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we help spread the word?

321
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:37,438
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we do to get extra help in there?

322
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:40,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, I'm sure that we're

323
00:38:40,774 --> 00:38:45,815
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting legal requirement, but just if you let folks know what that is and what that looks like, it'd be helpful.

324
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:46,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

325
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:49,716
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this time, we're doing the best we can to fill the power positions.

326
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:53,778
[SPEAKER_06]: We are expanding to different platforms to see if we can get more candidates.

327
00:38:54,218 --> 00:39:02,540
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also created flyers that we're putting up in the library, grocery stores, restaurants, to see we have gotten candidates from those flyers.

328
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,561
[SPEAKER_06]: We continue to try to meet every student's needs.

329
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,342
[SPEAKER_06]: We are extremely short staff, so

330
00:39:10,322 --> 00:39:18,325
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is an area that we're not able to be compliant in, we would look at what compensatory services would be for those families.

331
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:21,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be at a team meeting that would, it would be discussed.

332
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:30,170
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's an ongoing recruitment that we're trying to get paraprofessionals in as quickly as possible.

333
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,592
[SPEAKER_06]: We were able to hire one or two in the past two weeks, but it's slow.

334
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,592
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working as hard as we can and we're trying to expand it to as many people as possible to help us out.

335
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:48,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you know anyone that's looking for a position, you know, tell them to, you know, send their resume my way, but we are going to expand the platforms as well.

336
00:39:49,576 --> 00:39:50,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I follow up?

337
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:51,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

338
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:51,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I follow up there?

339
00:39:52,877 --> 00:39:53,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

340
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to follow up to that, thank you, Ms.

341
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:58,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen, and appreciate that.

342
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:09,131
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, if families have concerns, they can reach out to their ETL at the school, letting them know if there's concerns specifically around paraprofessional coverage.

343
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:15,135
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, with one-to-one, for compensatory, I know you're talking probably speech, OT, that sort of thing.

344
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:19,738
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't do compensatory for one-to-one in a classroom, so you obviously have to.

345
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,060
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would have to have a team meeting to discuss what the specifics would look like.

346
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:30,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's a student that needs a one-to-one in math, we may offer some sort of tutoring services after school or something like that.

347
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:39,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's taking each individual case, case by case, and seeing what the services that we're missing and how we can provide that to them.

348
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:45,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, because I know some IEPs have one-to-one for the students specifically, and sometimes with the shortage, if there's a

349
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,985
[SPEAKER_02]: if there's a paraprofessional in the classroom and they're assigned to a student one-to-one, but they can also be acting as a classroom paraprofessional.

350
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it's two roles that they're trying to fill.

351
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:58,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously if the IEP is requiring them to fill one, it's sort of tricky.

352
00:40:58,709 --> 00:40:59,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very tricky.

353
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,751
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really tricky.

354
00:41:00,771 --> 00:41:01,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

355
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:12,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want to make sure that everyone's aware of how tricky this is because we really, really, really, you know, need people to help support us in these situations and to figure out what we need to do.

356
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:14,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do we do exit interviews at all?

357
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:21,842
[SPEAKER_02]: with folks like that if people are, if we have high attrition with our paras, are we doing any exit interviews?

358
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:28,547
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly, we try to, but I can't say that it's 100% because people leave with various timelines and their various circumstances.

359
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:31,710
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a general rule, I think it's a good practice.

360
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

361
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,413
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could just follow up quickly on the platform issue.

362
00:41:36,593 --> 00:41:41,077
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the administration's policy to use every platform available to us

363
00:41:41,513 --> 00:41:46,355
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly for some of these positions where there's both high turnover and high demand and high volume.

364
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:58,679
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I am familiar with the email that you've referenced and it is something that I've asked my staff to follow up on to see if sometimes there are postings that expire and if we don't catch them, then we need to renew them.

365
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:00,280
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's as a general rule,

366
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,263
[SPEAKER_00]: the postings are up across a variety of platforms.

367
00:42:04,323 --> 00:42:12,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, for the situation with respect to the Paris, that's necessary because we obviously need to cast as wide of a net as possible.

368
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:24,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

369
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:27,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't mind finishing the report, but after that,

370
00:42:33,624 --> 00:42:37,166
[SPEAKER_11]: it will.

371
00:42:37,587 --> 00:42:38,467
[SPEAKER_00]: So really.

372
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:43,491
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's good to see you guys.

373
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:52,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any questions related to the vacancies or with respect to I think we left off of the teacher and power positions.

374
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:59,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Rousseau are any of the.

375
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:02,684
[SPEAKER_21]: You know off the top of your head that the teacher

376
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:04,687
[SPEAKER_21]: positions that are open.

377
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:09,030
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you know, like if we have one calculus teacher and we don't have calculus.

378
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:20,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all, they're non classroom, uh, traditional classroom teaching roles, but they are all, uh, high, uh, most vulnerable student supporting positions.

379
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:23,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all, uh, high priorities to face.

380
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:29,543
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, so it also means that there's more flexibility sometimes with respect to how we make sure those services and support are rendered.

381
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:30,564
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um,

382
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:33,995
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all in that job category.

383
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:34,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

384
00:43:34,636 --> 00:43:34,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

385
00:43:34,876 --> 00:43:39,840
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be careful standing next to me.

386
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,021
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dangerous place.

387
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to clarify.

388
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, and then please.

389
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:56,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Gina Coppola, president of paraprofessionals, instructional tutors, OTAs, PTAs, kindergarten assistant, and anything else that comes under assistant.

390
00:43:56,988 --> 00:43:57,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice to see you all.

391
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,809
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to clarify for the record.

392
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,513
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why we have the shortage is, as you know, it's the money.

393
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:08,014
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of cities and towns

394
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:14,988
[SPEAKER_14]: have poached, should I say that word, our brightest and best, okay?

395
00:44:15,548 --> 00:44:21,313
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had the mayor of Somerville say to me, we're so glad that you trained them.

396
00:44:21,754 --> 00:44:28,600
[SPEAKER_14]: We know how Medford trains paraprofessionals so good, but we're taking them one by one.

397
00:44:30,506 --> 00:44:33,789
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I was told by phone call, by the way.

398
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,971
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanna say that, yes, Ms.

399
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:41,735
[SPEAKER_14]: McLaughlin, there is a couple of paras, which I will talk to Ms.

400
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:47,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Bowen about tomorrow, that are doing sixth, seventh, and eighth, and that's impossible.

401
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:53,845
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a teacher that's in seventh grade, oh, excuse me, I have to leave for eighth grade.

402
00:44:54,245 --> 00:44:56,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry if Tommy's not feeling well.

403
00:44:57,168 --> 00:44:58,048
[SPEAKER_14]: You see what I'm saying?

404
00:44:58,939 --> 00:44:59,860
[SPEAKER_14]: That's unheard of.

405
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,802
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can't possibly have that anymore.

406
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:03,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Not for $17,300.

407
00:45:04,183 --> 00:45:04,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

408
00:45:04,763 --> 00:45:21,755
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate, Dr. Vincent, I appreciate you.

409
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:27,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you too, David.

410
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate everybody, but I grew up here as an immigrant.

411
00:45:33,995 --> 00:45:37,077
[SPEAKER_14]: My father made all the playgrounds for free.

412
00:45:37,757 --> 00:45:40,298
[SPEAKER_14]: He didn't take his construction company, did not take a dime.

413
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:42,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm giving back whatever I can.

414
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:47,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working for nothing, only because I can, okay?

415
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:50,902
[SPEAKER_14]: But these women, I feel so bad.

416
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I had to loan somebody $500.

417
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:56,304
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like breaks my heart, you know?

418
00:45:57,745 --> 00:46:02,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I bring food, I have to bring food, I have to bring diapers, I have to bring this, I have to bring that.

419
00:46:03,568 --> 00:46:12,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes I'm so tired myself, I'm beat today, I really am, because a couple of people have COVID and I covered three or four of their classrooms.

420
00:46:13,453 --> 00:46:14,773
[SPEAKER_14]: But then who lost out?

421
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:20,476
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, some kids did lose out, because I had to help.

422
00:46:21,036 --> 00:46:26,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So the thing is, is that we need, you want highly qualified, you must pay.

423
00:46:27,503 --> 00:46:32,225
[SPEAKER_14]: highly qualified.

424
00:46:45,231 --> 00:46:48,452
[SPEAKER_14]: I beg you, love and light to all of you.

425
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,953
[SPEAKER_14]: I really want a peaceful table.

426
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I really do.

427
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,852
[SPEAKER_14]: This cannot be a fight.

428
00:46:55,573 --> 00:46:56,574
[SPEAKER_14]: We love people.

429
00:46:56,594 --> 00:47:01,421
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to go in, we want to work, but give us a little bit more.

430
00:47:02,742 --> 00:47:03,704
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all we're asking.

431
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:05,966
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you all.

432
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:06,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for listening.

433
00:47:15,203 --> 00:47:16,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for bringing it up.

434
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:24,130
[SPEAKER_14]: I really do appreciate you, that you asked for us to see where this employment is going.

435
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,471
[SPEAKER_14]: I had 120 members, I have 74.

436
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:29,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

437
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:30,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Our kids need you.

438
00:47:30,894 --> 00:47:31,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Our kids need you.

439
00:47:31,795 --> 00:47:31,775
74.

440
00:47:32,515 --> 00:47:33,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, our kids need you.

441
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:35,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Your kids are losing.

442
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:35,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

443
00:47:36,378 --> 00:47:36,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you.

444
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:37,939
[SPEAKER_24]: We appreciate you.

445
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:38,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

446
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

447
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for listening.

448
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:58,996
[SPEAKER_05]: We have next up, number four, Labor Update, Mr. David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.

449
00:47:59,356 --> 00:47:59,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Murphy.

450
00:48:00,162 --> 00:48:00,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor.

451
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:13,593
[SPEAKER_00]: So a closely related topic to what we were just discussing with respect to personnel is our ongoing negotiations over successor collective bargaining agreements.

452
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:23,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll recognize the slide before you today with a few modifications from the last time in the spring when we updated U.S.

453
00:48:23,121 --> 00:48:24,383
[SPEAKER_00]: with respect to our

454
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:26,484
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing negotiations.

455
00:48:26,844 --> 00:48:42,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Several units obviously are still in the midst of negotiations and we'll talk a little bit more about the teachers with respect to the school committee's declaration of impasse momentarily, but as the superintendent said in her opening remarks and as we announced on Friday,

456
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:55,602
[SPEAKER_00]: The district has entered tentative agreements with three of our units, our carpenters and maintenance unit, our administrative assistance unit, as well as our school nurses unit, who I'm happy to say ratified that TA earlier this afternoon.

457
00:48:56,062 --> 00:49:02,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is obviously progress and we're happy that we're able to move forward.

458
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:11,292
[SPEAKER_00]: The district's bargaining priorities and objectives have been the same since we first started discussing successor agreements last year.

459
00:49:12,553 --> 00:49:25,497
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, just to be candid, at the last time that I provided this information to you, you may recall that one of the members made a motion to make the district's proposals public at that time.

460
00:49:26,477 --> 00:49:30,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I was grateful that the mayor gave me the opportunity to speak before that motion was voted on.

461
00:49:31,258 --> 00:49:41,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked you at the time to not direct us to do that because where we were in the course of the negotiations, I did not think that that would be a prudent or strategic move.

462
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:49,752
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not, frankly, because as you'll see this evening, there was anything that the district felt that we had to hide with respect to our negotiations.

463
00:49:50,645 --> 00:50:00,649
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, many of our proposals can be inferred from our budget process, and we've been very open with respect to the goals that we are that we are looking to advance in the district.

464
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, how the way that some of the negotiations have progressed since that time.

465
00:50:07,032 --> 00:50:16,058
[SPEAKER_00]: the consensus amongst our team, and I'm grateful to have the unanimous support of the committee, those variables have changed significantly.

466
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:23,964
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, for purposes of making sure that these negotiations do not, any more than they already have, disrupt our operations as a school district,

467
00:50:24,304 --> 00:50:27,726
[SPEAKER_00]: we did feel the need to present a number of items tonight publicly.

468
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:41,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Before moving into that, though, with respect to the tentative agreements with these three units that have completed success to our TAs in the course of the last week, these are modest reforms.

469
00:50:41,494 --> 00:50:42,635
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be very clear about that.

470
00:50:43,115 --> 00:50:45,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be also clear that our

471
00:50:46,701 --> 00:51:02,703
[SPEAKER_00]: As is the case with all of our bargaining units, all the bargaining units, those that we're negotiating with, those that we're at impasse with, and those that we've recently reached deals with, are all comprised of individuals that are spending day in and day out serving the Medford community.

472
00:51:03,283 --> 00:51:21,251
[SPEAKER_00]: and when the district feels as though there's something that we need to change it is because we feel as though there may be a practice that could serve the interests of students better than the current agreements would allow it is not because we have any reservation or hesitation with respect to the

473
00:51:21,631 --> 00:51:26,072
[SPEAKER_00]: the dedication or the commitment of the individuals who are in these units.

474
00:51:27,032 --> 00:51:34,894
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to those modest, they're listed here, but generally speaking, the compensation agreements follow a 2% cost of living adjustment.

475
00:51:35,654 --> 00:51:39,095
[SPEAKER_00]: As is always the case, that does not mean that it is 2% all in.

476
00:51:39,455 --> 00:51:50,638
[SPEAKER_00]: There are either modest longevity changes or modest step changes or things of that nature, but the cost of living increase across these agreements was within the budgetary confines that we had

477
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:52,279
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed last spring.

478
00:51:52,819 --> 00:52:03,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the reform side, the new administrative assistant agreement includes a new performance evaluation instrument, which was something that the district prioritized.

479
00:52:03,846 --> 00:52:06,568
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that the bargaining was

480
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:18,293
[SPEAKER_00]: exceedingly constructive and collaborative with us as we went back and forth as to what would be a fair way of implementing that type of instrument on some of our non-licensed personnel.

481
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:26,917
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect, on the school nurses side, we are, for the first time as I understand it, certainly first time in this agreement,

482
00:52:28,497 --> 00:52:41,940
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing the National Board Certification as a basis for lane movement, which in discussing this contract with both our previous health services director as well as our current health services director, Ms.

483
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:50,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Hines, we felt as though that was a credential that would be reflective of increased capacity to support and serve students in a school environment.

484
00:52:50,242 --> 00:52:50,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very

485
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,307
[SPEAKER_00]: very happy about that.

486
00:52:54,288 --> 00:53:00,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Edward Vincent said it earlier, but these TAs will be going to you for your approval within the next week.

487
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:15,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've already given you a sort of a high-level summary, but I would just say in closing with respect to the TAs that these are all within the budgetary confines and the objectives that we had set out all the way back in June of 2021.

488
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:24,102
[SPEAKER_00]: when the contracts were coming due and we were getting ready to move forward with those negotiations.

489
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:35,006
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard me say a lot in the spring that there's sort of no way to talk about negotiations without talking about the budget, and there's no way of talking about the budget without talking about negotiations.

490
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:48,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just as sort of a refresher, we're operating with about a $69.3 million operating budget this year, the vast majority of which comes from our local contribution from the city of Medford.

491
00:53:48,537 --> 00:54:02,062
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a smaller portion from our Chapter 70 allocation, that's being the state allocation that comes from, through the state's allocation and through, excuse me, and through the taxpayers from across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

492
00:54:02,802 --> 00:54:08,444
[SPEAKER_00]: There are external funds that supplement that for various causes, but generally speaking, when we talk about our operating budget,

493
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:15,367
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at just below $69.3 million.

494
00:54:16,607 --> 00:54:24,490
[SPEAKER_00]: We had said in the course of the budget that you approved in June that we were projecting for a 2% cost of living increase.

495
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,771
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said in the TAs thus far, we've been able to stay within those parameters.

496
00:54:29,112 --> 00:54:34,233
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also what was allocated to non-unit managerial staff at the beginning of the fiscal year.

497
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:39,572
[SPEAKER_00]: a 2% across the board, meaning all units and non-unit personnel.

498
00:54:40,172 --> 00:54:42,996
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally estimate to be about a million dollars.

499
00:54:43,557 --> 00:54:48,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk through some of the specifics of our negotiations with the Medford Teachers Association.

500
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:52,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well aware that many representatives from the MTA are here.

501
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:53,749
[SPEAKER_00]: this evening.

502
00:54:53,769 --> 00:55:04,014
[SPEAKER_00]: I also just want to say up front, I know that there will be, I suspect, a bullet point or two that some of our guests will not agree with.

503
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly appreciate that.

504
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:09,496
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my responsibility, frankly, to articulate the district's position.

505
00:55:10,157 --> 00:55:19,563
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we're in a difficult position as we are right now, from a labor perspective, I don't think it is helpful to not identify what those areas of disagreement are.

506
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:22,825
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna ask for the opportunity to walk through that.

507
00:55:23,645 --> 00:55:29,069
[SPEAKER_00]: So with respect to a timeline, the negotiations team has met 17 times.

508
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:38,174
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not, I just wanna be clear, this is not a criticism, but it was the MTA negotiating team did ask to not meet during the previous summers.

509
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not...

510
00:55:40,899 --> 00:55:51,761
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that the district objected to, but with respect to the timeline, which I know has absorbed a lot of conversation and has garnered a lot of attention, that was a decision that was made at that time.

511
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:56,822
[SPEAKER_00]: There were approximately 14 issues that have been discussed at the negotiating table.

512
00:55:57,683 --> 00:56:09,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand, given what appears to be some of the animosity that's been generated, particularly recently, I think it would be reasonable for folks to infer that there's tremendous disagreement

513
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:11,806
[SPEAKER_00]: over a variety of very significant issues.

514
00:56:12,606 --> 00:56:29,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually happy to report, and I'd like to think that that sentiment would be shared, that on the vast majority of issues, there was mutual engagement by both parties, and either tentative agreements were reached, or we've exchanged proposals with identical language, which

515
00:56:30,882 --> 00:56:39,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you have a lot of bargaining experience or not, one could infer that that means we're close to a tentative agreement if the parties continue to give each other pieces of paper that say the same thing on them.

516
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:44,288
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in my experience, that's been the case.

517
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:50,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Also not uncommon, most of the issues that were raised were raised by the union.

518
00:56:52,792 --> 00:57:00,577
[SPEAKER_00]: The district responded to each issue that was raised and attempted to engage meaningfully.

519
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:12,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that there were a number of issues that were raised by the union that I do think have underlying benefits that directly serve students, and I think the union should be commended for that.

520
00:57:12,943 --> 00:57:16,286
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the case, frankly, in every district, and it's not the case in every negotiation.

521
00:57:16,326 --> 00:57:25,854
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of the reason that we were able to engage as constructively as we did was because there were a lot of really valid and good points that were raised.

522
00:57:26,435 --> 00:57:38,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And we attempted to respond in good faith and make sure that, ultimately, the language that changed in the contract changed in a way that would advance the actual mission of the organization and not just serve the interests of adults.

523
00:57:38,485 --> 00:57:42,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do want to credit the association for bringing forth a number of those issues.

524
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:56,188
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say clearly that the district engaged on those issues and got to a point that, as I said, either there was a tentative agreement reached or we were exchanging identical language, which would at least lead me to believe that we were close to an agreement.

525
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,924
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a few issues that have been discussed publicly, not by the district at this point.

526
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:12,070
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just a clarifying point that it became apparent to us as we saw some of the communications that were.

527
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:28,112
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating around the district is that all substantive proposals for any type of reforms that the district was prioritizing, we communicated as early as last spring a willingness to withdraw those proposals.

528
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:37,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is not the case that all parties received exactly what they want based on their initial proposals.

529
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:41,342
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple of issues that the union has prioritized that

530
00:58:41,722 --> 00:58:54,133
[SPEAKER_00]: while the district did engage and made counter proposals on, we've reached a point where we don't necessarily believe at this point that there's room in this negotiation to change the current contractual language on.

531
00:58:54,833 --> 00:59:05,142
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those issues, and particularly the ones that the elementary prep time that I know has been spoken frequently about publicly in this forum, that issue has been withdrawn.

532
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:08,765
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the district's concerned, it's no longer being negotiated.

533
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:23,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I recognize that there are some qualifiers there, but if you see that last bullet point, from the district's perspective, and I can only speak from the district's perspective, this negotiation, the scope of this negotiation is now narrowed.

534
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:24,791
[SPEAKER_00]: to financial issues.

535
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:38,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And those financial issues, for some of the reasons that we're going to talk about tonight, and I think the ones that are for reasons that are very clear, particularly to the people whose income is being affected by those issues, those are very serious issues, and they're very real issues.

536
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:48,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter how steadfast our disagreement might be with respect to what's responsible budgeting and what's responsible negotiating,

537
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:57,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do anything to suggest that we diminish the consequence or the impact of what we're negotiating.

538
00:59:57,328 --> 01:00:00,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, for some of our other bargaining units, as Ms.

539
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:10,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Coppola just shared with us, it's both a real impact on our employees, and it's a real impact on our ability to function as an organization.

540
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:27,895
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, I do need to walk through the proposals that have been exchanged because I don't believe that we can have appropriate context for where we are now without understanding how these negotiations have progressed.

541
01:00:28,476 --> 01:00:37,984
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say just as we go to the next slide, if I had to identify an objective for this presentation tonight, it is definitely not

542
01:00:38,604 --> 01:00:47,286
[SPEAKER_00]: for everyone to agree that what the district is offering is good and is fair, and that everyone should just come to the table and sign on the dotted line.

543
01:00:47,346 --> 01:00:56,549
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the point of the message that the district has been circulating over the course of the last week since the declaration of the impasse, and it's not my objective tonight.

544
01:00:57,509 --> 01:01:05,631
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do believe that in looking at what the district has proposed in the context in which we've proposed it,

545
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:11,361
[SPEAKER_00]: It is unreasonable to say that these proposals are inherently disrespectful.

546
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:15,182
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it is even more problematic to say that that is their intent.

547
01:01:15,862 --> 01:01:24,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for those of us who do this side of the work, which if you haven't pieced together is not necessarily the most enjoyable part of the work.

548
01:01:27,366 --> 01:01:42,355
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that we would do this with some type of latent intent or explicit intent to disrespect people or to not treat them with the dignity that we think educators should be afforded is far removed from reality.

549
01:01:42,896 --> 01:01:49,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the employees of the organization and the members of the Medford community have a

550
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,582
[SPEAKER_00]: a right to know where the district administration stands.

551
01:01:55,162 --> 01:02:11,208
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they, at this point, have a right to hear directly from us, which is why we're presenting this to you and why we're soliciting the support of a mediator to try to move this forward so we can mercifully move on from this topic and start focusing on the actual work of the Medford Public Schools.

552
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:18,613
[SPEAKER_00]: The union's initial wage proposal was for a 6% increase per year, 18% over three years.

553
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:25,098
[SPEAKER_00]: There were other compensation components to that, but that was certainly the centerpiece of that.

554
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:29,482
[SPEAKER_00]: The rationale provided and has been provided publicly so that I'm not

555
01:02:29,922 --> 01:02:45,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not speaking on their behalf, and they can certainly do that on their own, was due to the pronounced inflation that is affecting the country as well as the Medford area, as well as the significant hardship that all educators have endured during the COVID disruption.

556
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:52,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll touch upon both of those points, the inflation argument as well as the COVID argument momentarily.

557
01:02:53,769 --> 01:03:14,513
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get to that, I need to say publicly what I've communicated to the union, which is that a school district in Massachusetts with a 2.5% cap on the aggregate income property taxes and the revenue that can be raised cannot afford anything close to 18% over three years.

558
01:03:16,215 --> 01:03:24,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I to be clear, this is an initial proposal and I don't I don't believe that anyone felt that they were going to receive an 18% increase over three years.

559
01:03:26,267 --> 01:03:32,194
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because of that proposal that was made in January, the district was faced with two choices.

560
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:44,232
[SPEAKER_00]: we could make a proposal that was very, very low to give us the room to negotiate, to get into the vicinity of where we knew we could sustain based on our budget.

561
01:03:44,732 --> 01:03:49,740
[SPEAKER_00]: But by giving that low proposal, it was inevitable that it would seem disrespectful.

562
01:03:51,493 --> 01:04:09,424
[SPEAKER_00]: The second choice was to make a proposal that was in the vicinity of what we could responsibly afford, and then be in a position where we were boxed in and could only make minuscule or incremental movement from the point of that proposal, and then be accused of being disrespectful because our movement was so slow.

563
01:04:10,084 --> 01:04:14,647
[SPEAKER_00]: This was communicated multiple times in multiple forms.

564
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:21,302
[SPEAKER_00]: After two months, the district made a wage proposal in the hope of moving the discourse forward.

565
01:04:22,163 --> 01:04:32,067
[SPEAKER_00]: That proposal was 2%, one and three quarters percent, one and a half, which as I said, is very low.

566
01:04:33,427 --> 01:04:40,150
[SPEAKER_00]: But on March 29th, which I believe was the date that we made that proposal, and perhaps March 27th, it was the last week of March,

567
01:04:41,149 --> 01:04:45,571
[SPEAKER_00]: we felt at that point that that was our only option to try to move the conversation forward.

568
01:04:47,071 --> 01:05:01,456
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, in that proposal and in every compensation proposal since, offered to use the grant funding that was available to us to supplement that pay, provided that that supplement was not incorporated into the base pay.

569
01:05:02,776 --> 01:05:07,458
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the district's position from the very beginning, that while the grant funding is temporary,

570
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,665
[SPEAKER_00]: and will not exist in a short period of time.

571
01:05:11,564 --> 01:05:24,669
[SPEAKER_00]: given our prioritization of valuing our staff, respecting our staff, and recognizing the difficulty that our staff has gone through, particularly over the last couple of years, that it is an appropriate use of that funding.

572
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:36,934
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some logistical hurdles, frankly, to using that money, and that's something that we've tried to work through, and we've tried to be as transparent as possible with respect to those proposals.

573
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,535
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time that we made that proposal,

574
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:50,037
[SPEAKER_00]: through today, they have been, in our view, in our team's view, mischaracterized as an attempt to shortchange our teachers.

575
01:05:50,537 --> 01:06:02,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sincerely regret that that is the impression that has been made, but it is, in my view, disconnected from both what we have done at the bargaining table as well as what our intentions have been.

576
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we go to the next slide.

577
01:06:07,324 --> 01:06:10,246
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the 18% proposal was an initial proposal.

578
01:06:10,946 --> 01:06:21,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we said in our statement last week, the current divide is between a 7.25% proposal that the district has made and a 10% proposal that is on the table from the union.

579
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:30,717
[SPEAKER_00]: The 7.25% proposal does not include that supplemental pay made possible through the COVID-related grants.

580
01:06:31,297 --> 01:06:37,305
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are attempting and have been attempting for several months to provide to our teachers.

581
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:49,503
[SPEAKER_00]: If factored in cumulatively, that would have the real feel of approximately 9.1% increase over a three-year period for all teachers.

582
01:06:49,703 --> 01:07:08,276
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be the 7.25% divided by 2.5, 2.25, 2.5, and the $1,000 per teacher per year for three years, with, again, that supplemental pay not being incorporated into the base for the reasons that I referenced earlier with respect to the city's capacity.

583
01:07:10,035 --> 01:07:15,237
[SPEAKER_00]: On June 6, the union made a presentation before you, similar to what I'm doing this evening.

584
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:19,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that was the date that I asked you not to make me do this publicly.

585
01:07:19,698 --> 01:07:21,438
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't work out.

586
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,979
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm doing this publicly.

587
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:27,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that presentation, the union presented an analysis.

588
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,020
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could go to the next slide.

589
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:34,342
[SPEAKER_00]: The union presented an analysis that we could absorb as a district in our operating budget

590
01:07:34,815 --> 01:07:36,896
[SPEAKER_00]: a 2.25% increase.

591
01:07:37,576 --> 01:07:52,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, as I said before, we had budgeted 2%, and frankly, the difference between 2% and 2 1⁄4 when we're dealing with a $69 million budget is relative, I would say.

592
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:57,663
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, frankly, an analysis that the district deeply disagrees with.

593
01:07:58,263 --> 01:07:59,783
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, right now, our proposal is 2 1⁄2, 2 1⁄4, 2 1⁄2.

594
01:08:02,352 --> 01:08:08,794
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be clear, we do not disagree with the MTA's analysis of our operating budget capacity.

595
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:26,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we do disagree and where we think the facts do not support the arguments that were made on June 6th is the idea that the ESSER money, meaning the temporary grants allocated to the district for purposes of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,

596
01:08:26,738 --> 01:08:34,200
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used to somehow bridge a gap between this contract and some future date where there is additional revenue.

597
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:51,244
[SPEAKER_00]: We disagree with that both because from a regulatory perspective, the guidance that we have received from the state and federal government would indicate that this would be an impermissible use of that funding, but also because it would create a structural deficit that may or may not be filled.

598
01:08:52,386 --> 01:08:56,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to be clear, there are different ways in which that structural deficit could be confronted.

599
01:08:57,572 --> 01:09:00,415
[SPEAKER_00]: The taxes in the community could be raised.

600
01:09:00,655 --> 01:09:10,707
[SPEAKER_00]: That could certainly raise sufficient revenue and expand the capacity such that an agreement similar to what the union is proposing could be a viable one in the future.

601
01:09:11,735 --> 01:09:24,822
[SPEAKER_00]: But to that argument, I would say that I think it's a disservice to the community to enter into a contract that we know we can't afford and then tell the members of the community that we should raise their taxes in order to fund the agreement.

602
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:26,863
[SPEAKER_00]: That's backwards, frankly.

603
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:38,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, and again, I try not to reference this too often, but having sat in a chair very similar to yours, I can tell you that it is not an argument that a community typically responds well to.

604
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:39,450
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think understandably so.

605
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:50,653
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way in which that structural deficit could be confronted would be if there was additional revenue that came in from the state through increased allocation of Chapter 70.

606
01:09:51,413 --> 01:09:58,895
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I take the union's presentation from that night, I believe that is what they are essentially predicting.

607
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:02,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be clear, they may be right about that.

608
01:10:03,437 --> 01:10:07,038
[SPEAKER_00]: But similar to how it would be out of sequence to

609
01:10:08,729 --> 01:10:15,636
[SPEAKER_00]: enter into an agreement that we know we don't have the capacity for locally, and then tell residents that they have to fund it.

610
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:28,309
[SPEAKER_00]: It would also seem unorthodox, at best, to enter into an agreement that we don't know with certainty is going to be funded by way of those state revenues.

611
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:35,396
[SPEAKER_00]: There is certainly the case that the state has committed in various ways to increase its chapter funding allocation.

612
01:10:35,776 --> 01:10:43,584
[SPEAKER_00]: But as those of you who were here when the Student Opportunity Act passed, Medford is not necessarily a principal beneficiary of those increased revenues.

613
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:46,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, as I said at the beginning of the presentation,

614
01:10:48,038 --> 01:10:51,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Our budget is comprised primarily of a local contribution.

615
01:10:52,161 --> 01:11:05,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So an increase in Chapter 70 funding does not benefit the Medford community in a way that that analysis might carry more water in other communities that benefit more from the state's Chapter 70 formula.

616
01:11:06,253 --> 01:11:10,837
[SPEAKER_00]: So to sum up, if we go back just one slide, Dr. Cushing, thanks.

617
01:11:14,087 --> 01:11:26,861
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could summarize this disagreement, I hope one that we can have respectfully, it is the question of whether temporary grant funding can be used to increase base pay.

618
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:32,813
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the district's position that it both cannot be and that it should not be.

619
01:11:33,574 --> 01:11:40,478
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not to say that we don't have a responsibility to find a way to fund a competitive increase.

620
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:41,439
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.

621
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:49,424
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have that responsibility, which is why we have put on the table a seven and a quarter percent increase over three years.

622
01:11:50,045 --> 01:11:55,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in addition to that, supplemented each teacher's pay with $1,000 per person per year

623
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,292
[SPEAKER_00]: through the COVID-related grants.

624
01:12:01,053 --> 01:12:06,037
[SPEAKER_00]: On this slide, you can see these are all of the wage proposals that the district has made.

625
01:12:08,109 --> 01:12:21,119
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think that it is certainly the case that every teacher, every community member has a right, as the union does, to say this is insufficient.

626
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:23,321
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just not going to accept that.

627
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:30,086
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is our professional responsibility and sort of common sense would say that we have to respect that.

628
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:42,473
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe that if we look at these numbers in this context, the suggestion that somehow this is an intentional ploy by the district to demonstrate disrespect, I think is an untenable position.

629
01:12:42,953 --> 01:12:58,063
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would ask members of the community, as well as people in the organization, to make their own judgment about that as to exactly what intent or what motive the district would have to try to insult the people that are spending,

630
01:12:59,223 --> 01:13:03,265
[SPEAKER_00]: hours every day trying to move the children of this community forward in their lives.

631
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:05,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why we would want to do that.

632
01:13:06,366 --> 01:13:15,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we can't spell out our rationale, then perhaps there's a factual problem with that position.

633
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:20,951
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom here, just to make clear, these increases that we're proposing

634
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:36,265
[SPEAKER_00]: The 7.25% cost of living adjustment that would be incorporated into the base over three years, which exceeds the amounts for the previous three collective bargaining agreements in Medford, as well as the $1,000 supplemental pay per person per year.

635
01:13:37,106 --> 01:13:43,168
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, the district has proposed, and in some cases the district actually did propose,

636
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:56,420
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing compensation with respect to missed prep periods, with additional classes that are being taught, as well as longevity payments, which we were happy to offer counterproposals on.

637
01:13:57,021 --> 01:14:01,685
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, why is it that we feel as though we now have to make this information public?

638
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:12,302
[SPEAKER_00]: because the rhetoric and the threat of job actions have gotten to a point where we are concerned that it could be disruptive to the organization.

639
01:14:12,922 --> 01:14:23,605
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is our hope that through the use of the state mediator, we will increase the chances that we can get to an amicable resolution as quickly as possible.

640
01:14:24,525 --> 01:14:27,346
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of more slides, and then I'll be happy to take questions.

641
01:14:28,406 --> 01:14:31,327
[SPEAKER_00]: To sum up, with respect to the inflation argument,

642
01:14:33,456 --> 01:14:37,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in this room is being affected by inflation.

643
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:41,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, I don't mean to suggest that everyone in every income bracket is affected equally.

644
01:14:42,046 --> 01:14:44,509
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly not true.

645
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:50,977
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is the case that inflation is a real problem, and it's having a real impact on people's lives.

646
01:14:52,418 --> 01:14:59,205
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what organizations and at what level of government do we have the capacity to actually fix that?

647
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:05,251
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is the Medford Public Schools lacks the capacity to fix inflation.

648
01:15:06,052 --> 01:15:13,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is why we have a responsibility to act within the capacity that we do have.

649
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:19,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And that capacity is limited by the 2.5% tax levy limitation that is imposed on all cities and towns.

650
01:15:20,202 --> 01:15:27,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's limited by the local state allocation that I referenced earlier.

651
01:15:28,426 --> 01:15:36,450
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to the argument over COVID-19 and the hardship that educators and others have, if we could just go to the next slide, thank you.

652
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:47,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just like inflation, that hardship is true, that has happened, and to be clear, it's going to continue to happen for the foreseeable future.

653
01:15:47,511 --> 01:16:02,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Public school systems in all likelihood will be some of the final entities to no longer be feeling the effects of COVID-19 because we have a generation of students who have had a detrimental impact on their education in critical years.

654
01:16:03,264 --> 01:16:20,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is for that reason that while the primary purpose of this grant money that became available is to fund initiatives that can support students directly, it is definitely the case that there is a need to supplement the pay of educators because their work has materially changed.

655
01:16:20,721 --> 01:16:25,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why we're trying to use this funding and have been trying to use this funding to supplement that pay.

656
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:41,287
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a responsibility to the people that will be working in this community years from now and to the students that will be going to school years from now to not do so in a way that creates the types of structural deficits that will inevitably harm students.

657
01:16:41,728 --> 01:16:50,556
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be clear, how they will harm students is that if we create a structural financial deficit that does not have an adequate response to offset it,

658
01:16:51,076 --> 01:16:55,718
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the positions that support high need learners that don't exist.

659
01:16:56,198 --> 01:17:03,481
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recognize that there are constituents that don't like when we speak as directly about the possibility of not being able to retain as many jobs.

660
01:17:03,921 --> 01:17:09,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there are some constituents that don't like when we talk about the direct impact we'll have on our most vulnerable learners.

661
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:30,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, to those two constituencies, I am offending them in equal measure when I say, I don't know how else to do this job other than to tell you that if you enter into an agreement that you can't afford, the students who are most at risk, who are most vulnerable, who have the most needs, will be the ones who suffer.

662
01:17:31,061 --> 01:17:33,722
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an attempt to appeal to people's emotions.

663
01:17:34,002 --> 01:17:35,822
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not an attempt to pull on people's heartstrings.

664
01:17:36,142 --> 01:17:46,025
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an attempt to do the responsibility that this committee gave me over two years ago to analyze the district's finances and make clear to you when there are problems in the office.

665
01:17:46,425 --> 01:17:48,125
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a disaster.

666
01:17:52,026 --> 01:17:58,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, with respect to pay equity and to follow up on the points that Miss Coppola made earlier,

667
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:03,254
[SPEAKER_00]: The teachers collective bargaining agreement drives the budget of the Medford public schools.

668
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:05,235
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true for every school district.

669
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:13,058
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the primary driver because as you've heard me say before, we are an organization of people attempting to educate people.

670
01:18:13,418 --> 01:18:18,660
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whatever agreement governs the most people, that's what's going to drive the budget.

671
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,941
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us to enter into other agreements

672
01:18:22,927 --> 01:18:28,751
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly ones in which there's a clear direction from the committee and a clear market forces, as Ms.

673
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:37,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Coppola alluded to, that would require us to look at potential increases that are disproportionate to what some of the other units are experiencing.

674
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:43,183
[SPEAKER_00]: It is problematic to do that with this variable being uncertain.

675
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:50,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be clear, this committee has been uniform in your commitment to increasing paraprofessional pay.

676
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:55,587
[SPEAKER_00]: There has not been an iota of objection from this administration to increase paraprofessional pay.

677
01:18:56,127 --> 01:18:59,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Common sense would tell us we have to increase paraprofessional pay.

678
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,890
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to increase paraprofessional pay.

679
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:09,131
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be addressing that issue in a significant way, to be clear, we could give them a 2% raise.

680
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:10,592
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't cause a problem.

681
01:19:10,852 --> 01:19:11,612
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one wants that.

682
01:19:11,912 --> 01:19:13,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want to do that.

683
01:19:13,812 --> 01:19:21,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the question is why is that agreement still outstanding, it is because the primary driver of the Medford Public Schools operating budget is still uncertain.

684
01:19:21,794 --> 01:19:28,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that's not uncertain, the paraprofessionals will be the first priority with respect to instituting greater pay equity in the district.

685
01:19:29,892 --> 01:19:37,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, questions about why did we, at this point, declare an impasse?

686
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:43,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I've referenced several of these points throughout this, so I'm just going to breeze through this as quickly as I can.

687
01:19:44,323 --> 01:19:54,891
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did everything we could as a team to keep these negotiations confidential and to try to move the discourse forward.

688
01:19:55,411 --> 01:19:57,293
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it got to a point when

689
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:05,926
[SPEAKER_00]: There were clear threats to disrupt the district's operations, multiple threats with respect to planned job actions.

690
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:13,415
[SPEAKER_00]: and repeated assertions that the district administration is somehow trying to disrespect our employees.

691
01:20:14,596 --> 01:20:33,126
[SPEAKER_00]: We felt as though, excuse me, coupled with the fact that there wasn't anything left at the bargaining table, in our view, to negotiate other than the finances, we felt as though just continuing to sit across the table, or in this case, a Zoom screen, and stare at each other would have been a waste of, number one, everyone's time.

692
01:20:33,934 --> 01:20:40,632
[SPEAKER_00]: and would have run the risk of delaying the competitive and sustainable wage increases that we'd like to institute.

693
01:20:43,169 --> 01:20:49,975
[SPEAKER_00]: not feeling as though we had any better options, we asked you to declare an impasse.

694
01:20:50,235 --> 01:20:52,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm grateful to you for doing that.

695
01:20:53,337 --> 01:21:08,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is our hope that through the help of a DLR assigned neutral mediator, we'll be able to expand all of our creative thinking and try to get to a place where we can resolve this as quickly as possible.

696
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,321
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just the very final slide there.

697
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:18,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay equity is a priority for us.

698
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:20,424
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we want to do.

699
01:21:21,365 --> 01:21:27,248
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a limitation in Massachusetts with respect to what is a legally permissible job action.

700
01:21:27,668 --> 01:21:32,730
[SPEAKER_00]: It is our hope and expectation that those boundaries will be respected.

701
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:34,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Temporary grant money.

702
01:21:36,687 --> 01:21:44,232
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot and should not be used to increase base pay in the way that the union's June 6th presentation would suggest.

703
01:21:44,692 --> 01:22:06,046
[SPEAKER_00]: And while, again, it's perfectly understandable for an individual in this context, given the inflation, given the COVID hardship, or whatever other reason to say that the 7.25% increase that the district has proposed, as well as the supplemental pay that gets it over 9% per member per year, is not acceptable.

704
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:10,009
[SPEAKER_00]: if every union, every individual has a right to an opinion on that.

705
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:31,665
[SPEAKER_00]: But when that is viewed in comparison to area school districts, when it's viewed in comparison to historical collective bargaining agreements in Medford, and when it's viewed against both the district and the union's analysis of our operating budget, I think the suggestion that it is somehow

706
01:22:33,603 --> 01:22:37,406
[SPEAKER_00]: an intentional offense, I think lacks a factual basis.

707
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:42,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's for that reason that we felt as though all of this information needed to be presented to you publicly.

708
01:22:43,011 --> 01:22:44,332
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

709
01:22:46,974 --> 01:22:47,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

710
01:22:47,715 --> 01:22:50,217
[SPEAKER_24]: May I have a point of privilege?

711
01:22:51,118 --> 01:22:52,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of privilege, Member McLaughlin.

712
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:55,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to ask if there's any way that the air conditioning can be adjusted.

713
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:56,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's freezing.

714
01:22:56,422 --> 01:22:56,402
69.

715
01:22:58,403 --> 01:23:02,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just a little bit, if we can ask.

716
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:03,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

717
01:23:04,491 --> 01:23:04,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

718
01:23:05,232 --> 01:23:06,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

719
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:08,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from the committee?

720
01:23:09,173 --> 01:23:09,293
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

721
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:10,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

722
01:23:10,733 --> 01:23:11,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

723
01:23:13,174 --> 01:23:13,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

724
01:23:13,834 --> 01:23:14,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

725
01:23:14,674 --> 01:23:15,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

726
01:23:17,315 --> 01:23:17,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

727
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:20,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Shelly Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford, Mass.

728
01:23:21,801 --> 01:23:33,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So this evening I listened to Mr. Murphy, and I greatly appreciate the fact that he mentioned that we brought things to the table that we feel would benefit the students, which we clearly did.

729
01:23:35,304 --> 01:23:45,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I also will be responding to the letter, and I'm not going to get into the details of everything, but I will be responding, the MTA will be responding too.

730
01:23:46,417 --> 01:23:55,542
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the accusations that have been made here tonight, including the one that stated that the summer we said no to negotiations.

731
01:23:56,342 --> 01:23:59,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make it perfectly clear, and I have an email.

732
01:24:00,565 --> 01:24:03,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Murphy and I, we were doing off-the-record proposals.

733
01:24:04,527 --> 01:24:12,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And during those off-the-record proposals, we both agreed that the last off-the-record, Mr. Murphy, correct?

734
01:24:14,935 --> 01:24:17,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, do we not have off-the-record proposals, Mr. Murphy?

735
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

736
01:24:22,162 --> 01:24:26,306
[SPEAKER_07]: During those off-the-record proposals, well, they were in June.

737
01:24:27,367 --> 01:24:27,828
[SPEAKER_07]: They were in June.

738
01:24:28,788 --> 01:24:29,249
[SPEAKER_07]: They were in June.

739
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:30,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct?

740
01:24:31,711 --> 01:24:33,113
[SPEAKER_07]: June 21st is summer, by the way.

741
01:24:34,934 --> 01:24:35,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

742
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:38,736
[SPEAKER_07]: In June, I stand corrected.

743
01:24:39,256 --> 01:24:42,118
[SPEAKER_07]: In June, we had off the record proposals going back and forth.

744
01:24:42,518 --> 01:24:46,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Murphy and I engaged in conversations going back and forth.

745
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:49,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Murphy and I were able to work through many things.

746
01:24:51,022 --> 01:24:55,404
[SPEAKER_07]: During COVID, during many things, we worked together, okay?

747
01:24:56,205 --> 01:25:00,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what happened, nor do I even wanna analyze what happens, okay?

748
01:25:01,527 --> 01:25:02,608
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wanna say one thing.

749
01:25:03,407 --> 01:25:22,901
[SPEAKER_07]: when you and I spoke at the very last author record proposal that you presented to me and to us, and I won't say what it was here, but you said, this is probably the best you're going to get, and it's a simple yes or no, and we will not agree to negotiate over the summit.

750
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,342
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could adjust the chair, Ms.

751
01:25:24,382 --> 01:25:24,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Douglas.

752
01:25:24,722 --> 01:25:27,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it was either a simple yes or no,

753
01:25:28,191 --> 01:25:31,772
[SPEAKER_07]: and we will agree to not negotiate over the summer.

754
01:25:32,433 --> 01:25:47,418
[SPEAKER_07]: In my correspondence to him, I wrote that, and if it was wrong, then maybe he should have corrected me and said that we didn't have a mutual agreement because it was a no to the proposal, and as mutually agreed, we would not negotiate over the summer.

755
01:25:47,758 --> 01:25:49,098
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a mutual agreement.

756
01:25:49,498 --> 01:25:50,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I have that email.

757
01:25:50,959 --> 01:25:51,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I can send it to you.

758
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:53,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I am tired.

759
01:25:54,318 --> 01:25:58,842
[SPEAKER_07]: of being accused of saying things that I don't say.

760
01:26:00,043 --> 01:26:01,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want that happening.

761
01:26:02,185 --> 01:26:03,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not.

762
01:26:04,387 --> 01:26:07,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a responsibility as the president of this union.

763
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:11,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I represent 489 members.

764
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:15,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not up here, it's not about me at all.

765
01:26:16,398 --> 01:26:18,520
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the members of this union.

766
01:26:19,639 --> 01:26:20,740
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are here tonight.

767
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:22,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time, I never spoke.

768
01:26:23,543 --> 01:26:25,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I let them speak.

769
01:26:26,205 --> 01:26:33,892
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a body, we asked every single one of you to come to our negotiations.

770
01:26:34,733 --> 01:26:37,856
[SPEAKER_07]: You continually choose not to do that.

771
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:43,381
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just gonna say, I'm gonna make a real quick point.

772
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:45,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So you continue not to do that.

773
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,248
[SPEAKER_07]: then you vote for an impasse.

774
01:26:47,548 --> 01:26:50,730
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not believe we're impasse, but we will address that also.

775
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:54,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let other people speak, but I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.

776
01:26:54,733 --> 01:26:56,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not lie.

777
01:26:56,414 --> 01:27:02,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I am very forthcoming and every one of you have known me for many years.

778
01:27:04,175 --> 01:27:10,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can show that I am a liar or that I put out the facts were there, what he said, exactly.

779
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:12,699
[SPEAKER_07]: We were looking at chapter 70 money.

780
01:27:13,159 --> 01:27:14,259
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we proposed.

781
01:27:14,659 --> 01:27:16,980
[SPEAKER_07]: We did see the 2.2 in the budget.

782
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:19,522
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever he said, that was my proposal.

783
01:27:19,842 --> 01:27:21,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I have nothing to be ashamed of.

784
01:27:21,662 --> 01:27:22,943
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what I said.

785
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:24,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

786
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:43,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

787
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:44,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Douglas.

788
01:27:44,131 --> 01:27:54,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to point out, I've been at the June session and the September bargaining session, and I know member Graham was present with me, vice chair, in June when we were representing the committee.

789
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:55,956
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to point that out.

790
01:27:56,697 --> 01:27:58,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, mayor.

791
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:04,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be... It was a bargaining session.

792
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:08,322
[SPEAKER_05]: On June 21st, member Graham and I were present at the bargaining session.

793
01:28:08,342 --> 01:28:09,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I can clarify this.

794
01:28:09,683 --> 01:28:11,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the proposal was...

795
01:28:14,297 --> 01:28:14,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

796
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,278
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposal was off the record.

797
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:20,080
[SPEAKER_00]: The bargaining session was a bargaining session.

798
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,722
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the mayor pointed out, the mayor and the vice chair were both present.

799
01:28:24,822 --> 01:28:29,905
[SPEAKER_00]: The statement that no school committee members have attended negotiation session is inaccurate.

800
01:28:30,646 --> 01:28:32,246
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make very clear, it is

801
01:28:33,695 --> 01:28:43,709
[SPEAKER_00]: not uncommon for the elected school committee to defer to their administrators and committee council with respect to negotiations.

802
01:28:45,471 --> 01:28:45,832
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also

803
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:53,096
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate for the parties to be attempting to dictate who represents the other party.

804
01:28:53,296 --> 01:28:57,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Department of Labor Relations, frankly, has been very clear on that.

805
01:28:58,101 --> 01:29:06,089
[SPEAKER_00]: I said at the beginning, with respect to the summer, it was the union's decision not to meet over the summer.

806
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:11,646
[SPEAKER_00]: I also said at the beginning, the district didn't object to that.

807
01:29:12,067 --> 01:29:21,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason I mentioned it tonight is because there's been a lot of concern and communication around how long this negotiation has taken.

808
01:29:23,562 --> 01:29:32,648
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns and communication up until this point, as is the case for any communications about our bargaining, have not come from the district.

809
01:29:33,088 --> 01:29:37,651
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to be clear, I don't think Ms.

810
01:29:37,692 --> 01:29:40,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Douglas makes intentional misrepresentations either.

811
01:29:42,114 --> 01:29:50,040
[SPEAKER_00]: But with respect to the email exchange, I have a copy of it as well, and it's pretty clear, and I'd be more than happy to share that.

812
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Although again, I don't really see the point, because I don't really think that's what we're

813
01:29:53,862 --> 01:29:56,083
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, who decided they didn't want to bargain over the summer.

814
01:29:56,103 --> 01:30:01,265
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really seem like a huge, huge factor at the moment, but that's just, that's just accurate.

815
01:30:03,306 --> 01:30:13,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'll be happy to, I'm assuming that there are other individuals who would like to speak and I'd prefer to respond at the end if possible, but that will depend probably on what's said.

816
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:17,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's members in the audience and we have member Rousseau, member McLaughlin.

817
01:30:18,117 --> 01:30:19,038
[SPEAKER_05]: would you like to speak?

818
01:30:19,078 --> 01:30:19,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

819
01:30:19,278 --> 01:30:20,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

820
01:30:20,539 --> 01:30:20,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

821
01:30:21,299 --> 01:30:23,100
[SPEAKER_21]: If you could bear with me and not take offense.

822
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,082
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a success story, a big success story.

823
01:30:26,322 --> 01:30:26,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

824
01:30:27,043 --> 01:30:30,385
[SPEAKER_21]: We are all here groveling over nickels and dimes.

825
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:35,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Massachusetts used to be the sixth heaviest tax state in 1980.

826
01:30:36,149 --> 01:30:36,869
[SPEAKER_21]: We are now number 36.

827
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:44,215
[SPEAKER_21]: and what do taxes pay for public goods, public goods principally being public education.

828
01:30:44,936 --> 01:30:52,342
[SPEAKER_21]: So the rich got exactly what they wanted us at each other's throats over the nickels that are left, okay?

829
01:30:53,023 --> 01:30:58,128
[SPEAKER_21]: There is no school committee member here that doesn't think starting pay for a teacher shouldn't be six figures.

830
01:30:58,308 --> 01:30:58,748
[SPEAKER_21]: There isn't.

831
01:31:00,049 --> 01:31:02,752
[SPEAKER_21]: None of us ran for office to figure out how to screw teachers.

832
01:31:05,145 --> 01:31:05,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Quite the opposite.

833
01:31:05,986 --> 01:31:21,978
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I ran for office and I tried to get the MTAs endorsement because I really care about that teachers have anything and everything they could possibly ever need to do their job, because the teachers that my kids have had have been absolutely amazing.

834
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:26,842
[SPEAKER_21]: And, and I see some of them in the audience probably all of them.

835
01:31:32,123 --> 01:31:48,263
[SPEAKER_21]: I get really upset because this feels a bit like us against them, when really the them are the rich people who figured out how to get us from number six to number 36 Massachusetts isn't like a state of poverty, where's all that money going, it's going into

836
01:31:49,656 --> 01:31:54,979
[SPEAKER_21]: The usual communities start w some of them start with other letters but somehow w is very popular.

837
01:31:56,540 --> 01:32:05,444
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just, I just think it's really important to to pause a bit because the other thing about the 1993 ed reform act was that school committees.

838
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:08,827
[SPEAKER_21]: sort of a joke on us.

839
01:32:09,347 --> 01:32:10,168
[SPEAKER_21]: It really is a joke.

840
01:32:10,729 --> 01:32:19,317
[SPEAKER_21]: We have all the responsibility to negotiate with you and no authority to do a damn thing about how much money we have to do that with.

841
01:32:19,698 --> 01:32:22,861
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really kind of a sick, sick joke.

842
01:32:24,222 --> 01:32:27,344
[SPEAKER_21]: And all school committees in Massachusetts have this same problem.

843
01:32:27,624 --> 01:32:31,586
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I go to all the school committee conferences, ask my colleagues, I go to them all.

844
01:32:32,526 --> 01:32:41,931
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's partially a therapy session because we're all suffering from the same problem where we have no capacity to raise revenues to do a damn thing.

845
01:32:42,612 --> 01:32:50,536
[SPEAKER_21]: I ran for office because I wanted to implement K to 12 computer science curriculum that President Obama and Congress had done.

846
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:57,654
[SPEAKER_21]: but quickly realize, well, we don't have an extra four to $600,000 laying around for any of that to happen.

847
01:32:58,314 --> 01:33:00,215
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's, you know, that's out the window.

848
01:33:00,315 --> 01:33:08,077
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we're doing some stuff, but, so I just think that, I just want this to be clear.

849
01:33:09,057 --> 01:33:13,659
[SPEAKER_21]: There's nobody in this room who is against anybody

850
01:33:15,188 --> 01:33:25,954
[SPEAKER_21]: Prop two and a half was designed to make sure that communities like us do what we're doing, hating each other or whatever, maybe hate's a strong word, I don't know.

851
01:33:26,034 --> 01:33:27,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Some days it feels that way.

852
01:33:28,155 --> 01:33:38,380
[SPEAKER_21]: But in communities that really ran the prop two and a half thing to get it passed, they do overrides, some of them more than once a year, because they know they want stuff.

853
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:42,282
[SPEAKER_21]: They know that there's no way you can afford it with two and a half percent increases every year.

854
01:33:43,328 --> 01:34:01,205
[SPEAKER_21]: And they knew that the people of their community, whether it's based on educational levels or income levels or demand and expectations of services, that they would just put an override every year, some of them twice a year, and poof, they would pass them and their taxes would go up a little bit and they could afford it.

855
01:34:04,766 --> 01:34:11,030
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't envy any elected official, any teacher, and frankly, any resident of a regular community.

856
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:13,251
[SPEAKER_21]: And Medford, I think of as a regular community.

857
01:34:15,413 --> 01:34:20,496
[SPEAKER_21]: So when we're talking about what we can afford, what we're really talking about is what rich people think we deserve.

858
01:34:21,076 --> 01:34:27,760
[SPEAKER_21]: And let's be clear, they think we deserve an end to public education for full privatization, so there's even more rich people.

859
01:34:29,478 --> 01:34:38,264
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm just making sure this is all said, because frankly, prop two and a half is sort of like this boogeyman, nobody knows what it is exactly.

860
01:34:38,284 --> 01:34:42,187
[SPEAKER_21]: And you don't have to learn what it is, but you do have to know why it is.

861
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:51,793
[SPEAKER_21]: It's there to make sure rich people don't have to pay taxes, and the rest of us are at each other's throat groveling over how to split the nickel.

862
01:34:55,513 --> 01:35:02,034
[SPEAKER_21]: You can look at Medford's budget from before Prop two and a half, and we had, what was it, 150 people in DPW?

863
01:35:02,514 --> 01:35:06,035
[SPEAKER_21]: We didn't get less roads between now and then, and we have what, 50, Mayor?

864
01:35:06,055 --> 01:35:10,936
[SPEAKER_21]: 70, but 70, 150 down to 70.

865
01:35:13,156 --> 01:35:14,757
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we've all driven on the roads.

866
01:35:16,397 --> 01:35:22,178
[SPEAKER_21]: And when we talk about how to split the nickel, if we give,

867
01:35:23,789 --> 01:35:49,625
[SPEAKER_21]: And I absolutely hate this next sentence, but if we give the teachers more than we can responsibly afford, meaning rich people think we should be able to afford, not what I think we should be able to afford, but based on the size of the pie, which can barely grow, if we give more than we can, then we're not gonna have to worry about the 15 to 17 pairs we have openings for, by the way, because we're gonna be getting rid of half of the pairs or whatever the number is.

868
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,960
[SPEAKER_21]: That terrifies me, frankly, more.

869
01:35:56,121 --> 01:36:13,830
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just feel like as a body, we are often maligned, and I don't mean necessarily individually, but the notion that we can just pass wage increases and that there will be money coming

870
01:36:14,798 --> 01:36:15,598
[SPEAKER_21]: is just not true.

871
01:36:15,798 --> 01:36:17,859
[SPEAKER_21]: We do not have any taxation authority.

872
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,881
[SPEAKER_21]: We have no ability to rent out the buildings yet more.

873
01:36:21,341 --> 01:36:24,122
[SPEAKER_21]: They're kind of always rented out and that doesn't give you much money.

874
01:36:24,642 --> 01:36:37,207
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just really felt the need to kind of pontificate on why we're here, because I wish we were all getting together to talk about how can we improve this part of education and this part of education.

875
01:36:37,247 --> 01:36:38,928
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause I know that the teachers all want that.

876
01:36:39,088 --> 01:36:42,830
[SPEAKER_21]: And every member of the school committee ran for office for the exact same reason.

877
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:43,250
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

878
01:36:44,429 --> 01:36:44,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

879
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:45,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

880
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:49,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of clarification that member McLaughlin, so you yield.

881
01:36:49,435 --> 01:36:54,822
[SPEAKER_07]: The meeting that you spoke of with yourself and Jenny Graham, that was not a negotiations meeting.

882
01:36:55,182 --> 01:36:58,366
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a meeting that you requested to speak with me.

883
01:36:58,707 --> 01:37:01,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave, you wrote me an email asking to speak with me.

884
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,532
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor wants to speak with me and Greg.

885
01:37:04,093 --> 01:37:05,234
[SPEAKER_07]: There was negotiation.

886
01:37:05,534 --> 01:37:10,898
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a meeting that was supposed to be between you, me, Greg, and I was obviously the superintendent.

887
01:37:11,238 --> 01:37:12,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I would assume we're there.

888
01:37:12,519 --> 01:37:20,205
[SPEAKER_07]: When we attended that meeting, it was just Greg and myself, and you were there, and you were there, you were there, Dave was there.

889
01:37:20,385 --> 01:37:21,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember who else was there.

890
01:37:21,726 --> 01:37:22,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Howard was there.

891
01:37:22,807 --> 01:37:24,848
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no, may I finish please?

892
01:37:25,529 --> 01:37:28,070
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no negotiation team.

893
01:37:28,411 --> 01:37:30,732
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no negotiation team.

894
01:37:31,893 --> 01:37:36,035
[SPEAKER_07]: at that time, and what was given was an off-the-record proposal.

895
01:37:36,395 --> 01:37:42,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was no scheduled negotiations, and we did not say we were meeting to negotiate.

896
01:37:43,019 --> 01:37:45,060
[SPEAKER_07]: You said you wanted to meet to talk with us.

897
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:48,421
[SPEAKER_07]: You did not say you wanted to meet to negotiate with us.

898
01:37:48,742 --> 01:37:52,343
[SPEAKER_07]: If that was the case, the whole team would have been there, and they were not.

899
01:37:52,624 --> 01:37:55,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It was myself and the MTA reg, Greg.

900
01:37:55,905 --> 01:37:56,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

901
01:37:56,606 --> 01:37:59,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Clarification.

902
01:38:06,038 --> 01:38:06,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

903
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:08,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

904
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:13,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think if you want to, if you want to come to the microphone.

905
01:38:14,203 --> 01:38:18,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I have emails for every communication that I have been the president of this union.

906
01:38:18,965 --> 01:38:20,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I started in 2012.

907
01:38:20,946 --> 01:38:29,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I have every single email from every communication with every superintendent, with every mayor categorized and done.

908
01:38:29,511 --> 01:38:31,572
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would be glad to share anything.

909
01:38:31,992 --> 01:38:32,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

910
01:38:34,294 --> 01:38:34,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

911
01:38:35,694 --> 01:38:36,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

912
01:38:36,074 --> 01:38:42,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I neglected to say when I asked for the point of privilege for the air conditioning I didn't mean to interrupt.

913
01:38:43,728 --> 01:38:47,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Murphy's end of presentation, and I wanted to say thank you for the presentation.

914
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:52,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the graphics in particular were very helpful and having a table for folks to see was very helpful.

915
01:38:53,072 --> 01:38:53,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

916
01:38:54,832 --> 01:39:03,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to thank through the mayor, my colleague, I echo many of his sentiments that he just shared regarding the position that we're in.

917
01:39:04,076 --> 01:39:10,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And also just want to say that, you know, oftentimes to me, this feels like a dysfunctional family.

918
01:39:10,058 --> 01:39:12,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of what we're watching really

919
01:39:12,918 --> 01:39:16,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the fighting and the bickering and the back and forth, it's kind of endless.

920
01:39:17,382 --> 01:39:23,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do dysfunctional families or marriages or whatever you want to call them do when there are problems?

921
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:26,109
[SPEAKER_02]: They have counseling, I hope, to improve them.

922
01:39:26,529 --> 01:39:28,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I see.

923
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:29,872
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I see the mediator.

924
01:39:30,272 --> 01:39:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the impasse as a bad thing.

925
01:39:32,654 --> 01:39:34,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the mediator as something that's obviously needed.

926
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:35,936
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had 17 meetings.

927
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:39,598
[SPEAKER_02]: and things are not moving forward.

928
01:39:39,658 --> 01:39:48,481
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad thing to bring a mediator in with someone with an objective outside point of view to be able to move things forward for all of us, for our community.

929
01:39:49,021 --> 01:39:50,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to add that.

930
01:39:51,101 --> 01:39:51,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

931
01:39:53,422 --> 01:39:54,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

932
01:39:56,302 --> 01:39:57,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record?

933
01:39:58,263 --> 01:39:58,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

934
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:10,251
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Anthony Guinn, and I'm fond of saying I live at 489 Winthrop Street, room C209, but I actually live at 45 Emhill Avenue in Lemons to Mass.

935
01:40:12,286 --> 01:40:13,808
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been on this negotiating team.

936
01:40:14,328 --> 01:40:16,570
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been negotiating since the reopenings.

937
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:17,891
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when Ms.

938
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:20,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Douglas asked me, would you help with this?

939
01:40:21,033 --> 01:40:25,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And I remember I was standing in line wearing a mask, one of the first times I had to do it at a store.

940
01:40:26,058 --> 01:40:32,463
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought, yeah, because I love this job and I love this school and it's in crisis and I gotta do it.

941
01:40:35,913 --> 01:40:45,320
[SPEAKER_12]: There have been 17 meetings, and I've left some of them very angry, and I've left some of them very down, and my wife has heard a lot about it.

942
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:59,492
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I've done after every meeting, after I, you know, calm down as I look at my schedule and make sure there's time to show up to the next one, because there has been progress made.

943
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:02,054
[SPEAKER_12]: As has been stated here, there's been progress made.

944
01:41:04,465 --> 01:41:21,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't feel that the negotiations were insulting until I came to a negotiating meeting last Thursday, ready to go, after having done a member meeting, having a full day of teaching done, and planning my route back to Lemonster, because that's where I could afford to live.

945
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:27,318
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was greeted and told, oh, by the way, write an impasse.

946
01:41:28,078 --> 01:41:30,759
[SPEAKER_12]: And that decision was not made that Thursday.

947
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:32,901
[SPEAKER_12]: That decision was made ahead of time.

948
01:41:33,939 --> 01:41:37,021
[SPEAKER_12]: We could have been told, you could have reached out to us.

949
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:40,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I never heard, this is our last offer, if you don't take this, run an impasse.

950
01:41:41,404 --> 01:41:43,886
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know, I was ready to keep going.

951
01:41:44,306 --> 01:41:49,229
[SPEAKER_12]: I was ready to do this, and I was ready to have our first in-person negotiating meeting tomorrow.

952
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I was looking forward to it, because I thought maybe that's the barrier.

953
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:57,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we're all just sick of Zoom, and we stare at those computer screens, and it does terrible things to our minds.

954
01:41:57,935 --> 01:42:01,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we can feel it after a long Zoom meeting.

955
01:42:02,759 --> 01:42:16,749
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was excited and ready to go, and this is the first time I felt insulted, is that we weren't told ahead of time, and after all this time spent together, all of this work done, all of the progress we've made, that it's now decided we can't do it.

956
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:19,592
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've been through so much.

957
01:42:20,352 --> 01:42:21,473
[SPEAKER_12]: We've gotten so much done.

958
01:42:22,754 --> 01:42:24,315
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all doing it for the students.

959
01:42:25,896 --> 01:42:29,199
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanna ask personally that you come back.

960
01:42:30,276 --> 01:42:32,039
[SPEAKER_12]: And we try without the mediator.

961
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:33,422
[SPEAKER_12]: We try to get this done.

962
01:42:33,723 --> 01:42:35,065
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been movement at every meeting.

963
01:42:36,648 --> 01:42:38,331
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to give that a shot.

964
01:42:39,734 --> 01:42:40,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

965
01:43:00,137 --> 01:43:01,698
[SPEAKER_05]: if I could just address that.

966
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:13,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I've attended in June with member Graham, the meeting and the bargaining session, which was a couple of weeks ago, I believe.

967
01:43:14,808 --> 01:43:15,749
[SPEAKER_05]: August 25th, thank you.

968
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:25,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I attended those because we were at a point where we really couldn't financially move any further.

969
01:43:25,937 --> 01:43:29,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the union pointed out in June

970
01:43:30,472 --> 01:43:34,113
[SPEAKER_05]: the capacity for the city based on the budget analyzation was 2.25%.

971
01:43:36,434 --> 01:43:40,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So Anthony, I hear you, but we have no more room to move.

972
01:43:40,695 --> 01:43:46,877
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a bargaining with almost 20 other unions that all deserve increases.

973
01:43:46,897 --> 01:43:49,038
[SPEAKER_05]: We are at an impasse.

974
01:43:49,818 --> 01:43:55,860
[SPEAKER_05]: If we knew that when I was there on the 25th, if I knew we had already voted for that, we would have told you.

975
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,761
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't, we didn't know that.

976
01:43:58,356 --> 01:43:59,397
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no more room to move.

977
01:43:59,417 --> 01:44:02,819
[SPEAKER_05]: We've moved higher than we can afford, is the truth.

978
01:44:07,502 --> 01:44:12,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd just like to say, I just really wish I knew that before I came into that meeting last Thursday and cleared that schedule.

979
01:44:13,746 --> 01:44:14,687
[SPEAKER_12]: And someone knew.

980
01:44:15,928 --> 01:44:19,550
[SPEAKER_12]: And someone had the ability to reach out and say, we believe we're at an impasse.

981
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:22,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Or the meeting before to say, this is our last best offer.

982
01:44:24,453 --> 01:44:25,274
[SPEAKER_12]: We never got told that.

983
01:44:26,072 --> 01:44:29,274
[SPEAKER_12]: We went to our members saying, we're going into another bargaining session today.

984
01:44:30,115 --> 01:44:31,175
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still working at it.

985
01:44:31,455 --> 01:44:32,516
[SPEAKER_12]: They thanked me.

986
01:44:32,816 --> 01:44:34,357
[SPEAKER_12]: They talked to me all the time.

987
01:44:34,798 --> 01:44:37,860
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear from different schools, different teachers, and all they do is thank us.

988
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:40,161
[SPEAKER_12]: And all they do is say, how do you do it?

989
01:44:40,201 --> 01:44:43,883
[SPEAKER_12]: And I tell them because it's moving, because it's good, because it's the good work to do.

990
01:44:44,984 --> 01:44:47,626
[SPEAKER_12]: So if that's where we are, that's where we are.

991
01:44:47,826 --> 01:44:53,490
[SPEAKER_12]: As you say, if that's where you believe we are, but I just can't understand why we couldn't have known before.

992
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:54,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

993
01:45:04,005 --> 01:45:05,365
[SPEAKER_22]: Just name and address for the record, please.

994
01:45:06,146 --> 01:45:08,727
[SPEAKER_22]: Kimberly Munyon, 126 North Street in Medford.

995
01:45:09,327 --> 01:45:11,247
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, everybody, for allowing me to be here.

996
01:45:11,267 --> 01:45:17,890
[SPEAKER_22]: I am solely here as a support for our teachers and educators.

997
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:20,771
[SPEAKER_22]: I am a generational Medford resident.

998
01:45:21,731 --> 01:45:27,173
[SPEAKER_22]: I share the kindergarten teacher with my mother, aunts, uncles, cousins, you name it, we've been here.

999
01:45:28,113 --> 01:45:29,834
[SPEAKER_22]: I was good school.

1000
01:45:30,194 --> 01:45:35,657
[SPEAKER_22]: I also have three students in the Metro public school system, seventh grade, fifth grade and first grade.

1001
01:45:35,677 --> 01:45:45,983
[SPEAKER_22]: I have developed relationships with many of the teachers in this room, along with any and other staff at the schools my kid attend.

1002
01:45:47,744 --> 01:45:50,906
[SPEAKER_22]: They show up for us in a way that has moved me.

1003
01:45:50,926 --> 01:45:52,967
[SPEAKER_22]: I cannot describe.

1004
01:45:55,008 --> 01:45:56,369
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not here to argue with anybody.

1005
01:45:57,577 --> 01:45:59,759
[SPEAKER_22]: on this panel, that is not it.

1006
01:46:00,019 --> 01:46:05,423
[SPEAKER_22]: I would just really want the staff to understand that we do support them.

1007
01:46:05,823 --> 01:46:07,584
[SPEAKER_22]: We are absolutely on your side.

1008
01:46:07,604 --> 01:46:22,835
[SPEAKER_22]: I will cry, I apologize, because I feel this strongly about it and I hope that I can even reach a single parent

1009
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:30,823
[SPEAKER_22]: a single supporter to get their feet in those doors and show the same support that our teachers deserve from you right now.

1010
01:46:32,223 --> 01:46:42,547
[SPEAKER_22]: The time spent volunteering, money out of their own pockets, at-home work, time away from their families, we cannot quantify that value that they provide to our children.

1011
01:46:43,107 --> 01:46:51,150
[SPEAKER_22]: I long for the days of the old MedFed where, you know, it's old MedFed versus new MedFed,

1012
01:46:52,321 --> 01:47:04,274
[SPEAKER_22]: if we're being honest, having the longevity of, and the consistency of the same educators and staff in the schools is invaluable.

1013
01:47:05,355 --> 01:47:07,257
[SPEAKER_22]: You had mentioned that word and that stuck out to me.

1014
01:47:07,698 --> 01:47:08,579
[SPEAKER_22]: They are invaluable.

1015
01:47:19,013 --> 01:47:23,535
[SPEAKER_22]: As far as the school committee not attending negotiations, that's not something I can wrap my head around.

1016
01:47:23,595 --> 01:47:25,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Time is our most valuable currency.

1017
01:47:27,376 --> 01:47:32,318
[SPEAKER_22]: And to not provide that to them is, I find appalling.

1018
01:47:34,699 --> 01:47:36,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, okay, I'm not here to argue.

1019
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:42,242
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to express my support to everybody in this room wearing red.

1020
01:47:42,262 --> 01:47:46,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi guys.

1021
01:47:48,041 --> 01:47:50,085
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so thank you for your time.

1022
01:47:50,145 --> 01:47:51,006
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate it.

1023
01:47:51,387 --> 01:47:52,488
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what else I can say.

1024
01:47:52,569 --> 01:47:53,230
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a voice.

1025
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:54,632
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm willing and able to lend it.

1026
01:47:55,213 --> 01:47:55,734
[SPEAKER_22]: So here I am.

1027
01:47:55,954 --> 01:47:56,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1028
01:47:56,355 --> 01:47:56,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1029
01:48:11,186 --> 01:48:11,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Greetings.

1030
01:48:12,547 --> 01:48:14,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Mike Wadness, I know some of you.

1031
01:48:14,529 --> 01:48:18,353
[SPEAKER_20]: I live in 7 Morse Lane, Natick, Mass.

1032
01:48:19,273 --> 01:48:20,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I commute from Natick.

1033
01:48:21,956 --> 01:48:22,997
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a short drive.

1034
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:25,980
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not so bad though, about 35 minutes.

1035
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:31,725
[SPEAKER_20]: But on my commute, I pass through about eight communities.

1036
01:48:33,346 --> 01:48:36,089
[SPEAKER_20]: All but one pay more than Medford.

1037
01:48:37,788 --> 01:48:43,290
[SPEAKER_20]: And five out of those eight pay about 10 to $20,000 more than Medford.

1038
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:52,773
[SPEAKER_20]: I was at a gathering the other day and someone worked at another district and we were talking about the emotional woes that we're going through right now.

1039
01:48:53,473 --> 01:48:56,374
[SPEAKER_20]: And when I told them what our pay was, they laughed.

1040
01:48:57,855 --> 01:48:58,475
[SPEAKER_20]: They laughed.

1041
01:49:00,316 --> 01:49:01,056
[SPEAKER_20]: Our pay scale,

1042
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,801
[SPEAKER_20]: is a joke.

1043
01:49:03,721 --> 01:49:07,925
[SPEAKER_20]: And yes, we could cherry pick and say, yeah, well, there are those W towns.

1044
01:49:08,565 --> 01:49:08,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1045
01:49:09,226 --> 01:49:12,709
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't expect Medford to be able to keep up with those W towns.

1046
01:49:12,729 --> 01:49:13,469
[SPEAKER_20]: I get that.

1047
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:14,630
[SPEAKER_20]: I get that.

1048
01:49:15,611 --> 01:49:18,853
[SPEAKER_20]: But we can cherry pick around and

1049
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:22,671
[SPEAKER_20]: really, we are on below average.

1050
01:49:22,791 --> 01:49:25,472
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not just slightly, it's significantly.

1051
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:31,894
[SPEAKER_20]: Now this is my 25th year here teaching at Medford, 25 years since I took that vow of poverty.

1052
01:49:35,295 --> 01:49:46,379
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is the first year on that drive where I've really, really questioned spending the rest of my career here.

1053
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:48,400
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to.

1054
01:49:50,299 --> 01:49:55,202
[SPEAKER_20]: but 10 to $20,000 more a year, that's how far behind we are.

1055
01:49:56,503 --> 01:49:59,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Think about it, go a half hour in any direction.

1056
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:08,270
[SPEAKER_20]: Think about some of those towns, half hour, go 10 minutes, Somerville, Cambridge, all right, a little more than 10 minutes, you got traffic.

1057
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:12,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Nevertheless, that's what you're competing against.

1058
01:50:13,433 --> 01:50:15,574
[SPEAKER_20]: We talked about being competitive, Mr. Murphy.

1059
01:50:17,025 --> 01:50:18,546
[SPEAKER_20]: You need to take that seriously.

1060
01:50:18,586 --> 01:50:28,071
[SPEAKER_20]: And I understand there's a limited pot, but this is where leadership comes in to find a way to make that pot grow any way possible.

1061
01:50:28,471 --> 01:50:40,077
[SPEAKER_20]: If Medford wants to be competitive, I really want to spend the rest of my career here, but for 10 to $20,000 more someplace else that you'd think about that, wouldn't you?

1062
01:50:41,437 --> 01:50:43,919
[SPEAKER_20]: So please give me a reason to stay.

1063
01:50:44,139 --> 01:50:45,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Give everyone a reason to stay.

1064
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:46,720
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1065
01:51:04,355 --> 01:51:04,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham.

1066
01:51:05,696 --> 01:51:25,608
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had a couple of questions for Mister Murphy specifically about what happens next now that we have asked to have a mediator assigned to us and I think my most important question is how quickly can we anticipate to move beyond tonight.

1067
01:51:26,212 --> 01:51:32,859
[SPEAKER_17]: to a place where we can resolve this so that we can pay our teachers.

1068
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:42,089
[SPEAKER_17]: And more importantly, in my mind, we can move on and we can start to address what is a real problem with the paraprofessional wage structure.

1069
01:51:42,109 --> 01:51:46,974
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to thank the teachers for their solidarity with the paras.

1070
01:51:50,289 --> 01:51:52,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm really hoping you're going to tell me this is going to be fast.

1071
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:55,612
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll stop there and ask you what really is going to happen.

1072
01:51:55,632 --> 01:52:00,094
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have filed a petition with the Department of Labor Relations.

1073
01:52:01,295 --> 01:52:04,277
[SPEAKER_00]: I would anticipate that we will have a response within the week.

1074
01:52:05,477 --> 01:52:08,739
[SPEAKER_00]: As the superintendent said earlier, and as I said earlier, it is a

1075
01:52:09,439 --> 01:52:11,180
[SPEAKER_00]: top priority for us to resolve this.

1076
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:16,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think the mediator is going to slow us down in any way.

1077
01:52:16,203 --> 01:52:19,945
[SPEAKER_00]: They're generally available, probably even more so now.

1078
01:52:20,865 --> 01:52:31,591
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, having gone down this road a few times before, it doesn't really constitute a stumbling block from a scheduling perspective.

1079
01:52:32,771 --> 01:52:35,493
[SPEAKER_00]: But with respect to how quickly it will be resolved,

1080
01:52:36,334 --> 01:52:42,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be clear, the district doesn't have any more control over that with a mediator than we do without the mediator.

1081
01:52:43,263 --> 01:52:50,713
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our hope that changing that variable will create the conditions in which we can get to a resolution more quickly.

1082
01:52:54,046 --> 01:53:05,634
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not, the nature of mediation in a public school setting is not that there's some sort of like defined timeline that at the end of the road, there's an arbitrator who's gonna render a decision.

1083
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:19,964
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different phases that the parties can go through that depending on how many phases you go through, that will dictate how long it takes, but there's no sort of specific endpoint, you know, beyond your potential unilateral implementation.

1084
01:53:20,924 --> 01:53:21,945
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, you know,

1085
01:53:23,079 --> 01:53:30,862
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly not imminent, and we're going to continue to work as hard as we can to get this resolved as fast as we can.

1086
01:53:31,902 --> 01:53:35,523
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have a specific timeline because I only represent one of the parties.

1087
01:53:37,844 --> 01:53:38,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1088
01:53:38,184 --> 01:53:39,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1089
01:53:40,225 --> 01:53:40,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1090
01:53:40,705 --> 01:53:41,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody, for being here.

1091
01:53:45,376 --> 01:53:51,080
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been speaking to other districts about mediation, because this is something I've never been involved in.

1092
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:56,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jenny, it's my understanding, it's taking most districts four months to get a mediator, four months.

1093
01:53:57,624 --> 01:53:58,604
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my understanding.

1094
01:53:58,765 --> 01:54:00,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but that's what I'm hearing.

1095
01:54:01,126 --> 01:54:03,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm just letting you know what I hear.

1096
01:54:04,388 --> 01:54:09,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I'm not sure, but you know, we really do want to get back to the table.

1097
01:54:10,592 --> 01:54:11,973
[SPEAKER_07]: We never wanted to leave the table.

1098
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:26,037
[SPEAKER_07]: and MTA will have a response to you all to the impasse document that was shared with us where there was not just one, but there were three items on there as to why we're impasse.

1099
01:54:26,557 --> 01:54:26,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1100
01:54:28,178 --> 01:54:28,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1101
01:54:28,999 --> 01:54:37,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything that we can do to move this along so that we can get to those paras who desperately deserve our attention would be great.

1102
01:54:38,146 --> 01:54:40,288
[SPEAKER_17]: So whatever we can do.

1103
01:54:40,328 --> 01:54:41,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally support the paras.

1104
01:54:42,168 --> 01:54:43,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and it's upsetting.

1105
01:54:44,289 --> 01:54:46,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It's upsetting to me that you're saying we're holding it up.

1106
01:54:47,391 --> 01:54:49,673
[SPEAKER_07]: It's you're pitting us, the teachers, against them.

1107
01:54:49,693 --> 01:54:50,673
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how we see it.

1108
01:54:50,733 --> 01:54:54,496
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's so upsetting.

1109
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:08,124
[SPEAKER_07]: The number of phone calls I received about that from parents, from students, from my members,

1110
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:20,388
[SPEAKER_07]: from the Paris, from Kids Corner, all of those people called me and said, I said, we have no intention, and you're pitting one union against the other.

1111
01:55:20,548 --> 01:55:22,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I came and I spoke about them.

1112
01:55:22,389 --> 01:55:26,152
[SPEAKER_07]: They deserve far more than what we're asking for, far more.

1113
01:55:26,712 --> 01:55:30,455
[SPEAKER_07]: If we want to make them equivalent to some of them, they deserve.

1114
01:55:31,215 --> 01:55:35,217
[SPEAKER_07]: They deserve, and I don't know what the offers are on the table for them.

1115
01:55:35,797 --> 01:55:38,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, you do know, I don't know, okay?

1116
01:55:38,458 --> 01:55:48,043
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's standard with 2%, 2%, 2, 2, 2, then if that's what we're looking at, don't hope to get a power here, okay?

1117
01:55:48,343 --> 01:55:52,845
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go work at the McDonald's for 17 an hour, but less aggravation.

1118
01:55:53,446 --> 01:56:00,069
[SPEAKER_07]: So that being said, do not, we are not, go ahead and negotiate with the powers.

1119
01:56:01,226 --> 01:56:04,289
[SPEAKER_07]: do what you need to do, and get them what they deserve.

1120
01:56:04,629 --> 01:56:06,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Get Kids Corner what they deserve.

1121
01:56:06,851 --> 01:56:13,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't use the Method Teachers Association as your blaming for not talking to them about money.

1122
01:56:13,797 --> 01:56:13,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1123
01:56:14,017 --> 01:56:14,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

1124
01:56:14,417 --> 01:56:27,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Sutherland.

1125
01:56:30,013 --> 01:56:30,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we done with this item?

1126
01:56:30,873 --> 01:56:32,374
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to take an order out of five.

1127
01:56:33,095 --> 01:56:34,536
[SPEAKER_21]: Could we, I'm sorry, what'd you say?

1128
01:56:34,616 --> 01:56:35,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Item number five.

1129
01:56:35,556 --> 01:56:36,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was gonna move on.

1130
01:56:36,757 --> 01:56:42,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Make a motion to suspend the rules and take item 2022-43 next.

1131
01:56:43,161 --> 01:56:46,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for suspension of the rules by member Rousseau, seconded by?

1132
01:56:48,504 --> 01:56:48,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1133
01:56:49,064 --> 01:56:50,185
[SPEAKER_05]: By member McLaughlin.

1134
01:56:50,205 --> 01:56:50,925
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1135
01:56:51,706 --> 01:56:52,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1136
01:56:52,606 --> 01:56:52,627
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-43?

1137
01:56:54,528 --> 01:56:54,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1138
01:56:57,423 --> 01:57:00,245
[SPEAKER_05]: offered by member McLaughlin, member Stone, member Rousseau.

1139
01:57:00,345 --> 01:57:04,147
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the Medford public school district's highest priorities is school safety.

1140
01:57:04,587 --> 01:57:14,953
[SPEAKER_05]: While we focus on all areas of safety, this particular resolution has a focus on gun violence prevention through the leadership of the district and forming, sharing empowerment and education of our school community.

1141
01:57:15,514 --> 01:57:20,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the safety and wellbeing of our students, teachers, and staff is a top priority of Medford public schools.

1142
01:57:20,717 --> 01:57:24,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in the United States, gun violence is the leading cause of death in children and teens.

1143
01:57:24,991 --> 01:57:33,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas evidence strongly suggests that secure firearm storage is an essential component to any effective strategy to keep schools and students safe.

1144
01:57:33,954 --> 01:57:41,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas an estimated 4.6 million American children live in households with at least one loaded, unlocked firearm.

1145
01:57:42,077 --> 01:57:48,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas every year, roughly 350 children under the age of 18 unintentionally shoot themselves or someone else.

1146
01:57:49,465 --> 01:58:08,712
[SPEAKER_05]: about one unintentional shooting per day, and 70% of those incidences take place inside a home, whereas 1,200 children and teens die by gun suicide each year, and over 80% of children under age 18 who died by firearm suicide used a gun belonging to a family member.

1147
01:58:08,732 --> 01:58:12,213
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hard to even read.

1148
01:58:12,293 --> 01:58:17,955
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's just, whereas research shows that secure firearm storage practices are associated with up to

1149
01:58:18,891 --> 01:58:40,904
[SPEAKER_05]: up to a 78% reduction in risk of self-inflicted firearm injuries and up to an 85% reduction in the risk of unintentional firearm injuries among children and teens, whereas the incidence of gun violence on school grounds, up to 80% of shooters under the age of 18 obtain their guns from their own home or that of relatives or friends, whereas the U.S.

1150
01:58:40,964 --> 01:58:47,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center recommends the importance of appropriate storage of weapons because many school attackers

1151
01:58:48,624 --> 01:59:16,660
[SPEAKER_05]: used firearms acquired from their homes, whereas keeping students, teachers, and staff safe from the threat of gun violence should be the responsibility of all adult stakeholders at each of our school sites, whereas across the country, lawmakers, community members, and local leaders are working together to implement public awareness campaigns, such as the Be Smart program, which is endorsed by the National PTA and encourages secure gun storage practices and highlights the public safety risks

1152
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:28,126
[SPEAKER_05]: of unsecured guns, where secure storage of firearms is a legal requirement in Massachusetts pursuant to general law chapter 140, section 133L and 131C.

1153
01:59:28,906 --> 01:59:38,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Failure to comply with the secure storage laws can lead to criminal prosecution, jail time, fines, or revocation of FID card or license, depending on the offense.

1154
01:59:39,692 --> 01:59:45,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends storing firearms unloaded, locked, and separate from ammunition,

1155
01:59:46,732 --> 01:59:51,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas, in order to continue with preventative measures to increase student and school safety, we must act now.

1156
01:59:51,954 --> 02:00:03,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee directs the superintendent and staff to update the student handbook to include information about parents' legal obligations regarding the secure storage of firearms.

1157
02:00:04,097 --> 02:00:15,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Resolved that the school committee directs the superintendent and staff to create an appropriate direct communication in the form of a letter or email to parents and guardians that explains the importance of secure firearm storage to protect minors from

1158
02:00:16,528 --> 02:00:23,154
[SPEAKER_05]: accessing unsecured firearms and their legal obligation consistent with the Massachusetts Safe Storage Law.

1159
02:00:23,834 --> 02:00:30,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Notification will be done as soon as possible and included on the district website and in annual registration materials at each school site.

1160
02:00:31,681 --> 02:00:43,771
[SPEAKER_05]: We resolve that the Memphis School Committee and superintendent will continue to work with local law enforcement agencies, health agencies, and nonprofit organizations to collaborate and increase efforts to inform district parents, guardians, and caregivers

1161
02:00:44,292 --> 02:00:48,236
[SPEAKER_05]: their obligations regarding secure storage of firearms in their homes and vehicles.

1162
02:00:49,356 --> 02:00:49,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

1163
02:00:51,681 --> 02:00:52,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1164
02:00:53,623 --> 02:01:03,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Erin Dowd and her family from Moms Demand Action in Medford when I was knocking doors, actually.

1165
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:12,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started to talk about gun safety and securing firearms and all of the statistics that we just heard.

1166
02:01:12,277 --> 02:01:17,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And we shared how when my children would go to playdates when they were little, I would ask,

1167
02:01:19,442 --> 02:01:32,112
[SPEAKER_02]: people whose houses they were going to, whether they had guns, because I wanted to make sure that I asked that question because I came from a background where there were, you know, some things that had happened that made me ask that question.

1168
02:01:32,593 --> 02:01:43,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And more often than not, I found that people seemed offended by that question, which I thought was, you know, purely innocent and a very important question.

1169
02:01:43,703 --> 02:02:02,840
[SPEAKER_02]: to be asking for our children safety and so I was really glad to hear about what Aaron was doing with moms demand action and making sure that firearms are securely stored because not only it's the law but it's the right thing to do and it protects our children, and I knew Gary Klein another member in Medford had spent a lot of time.

1170
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:08,823
[SPEAKER_02]: both in his time at the Attorney General's office and also as a private citizen working on the same issue.

1171
02:02:08,903 --> 02:02:21,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're able to connect Aaron and Gary and they did a great presentation at the library over the summer and several of our colleagues were here and we wanted to move this motion forward because we feel it's so important.

1172
02:02:21,631 --> 02:02:27,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to thank you so much and I was going to ask the Mayor through the Chair if we can let Aaron speak for a moment.

1173
02:02:28,672 --> 02:02:29,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1174
02:02:29,673 --> 02:02:34,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if any other committee member wants to speak, but I too met with Moms Demand Action.

1175
02:02:35,557 --> 02:02:37,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Great cause, I believe in it.

1176
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:38,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the chief of police does.

1177
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:44,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I know our board of health director then emailed the chief of police and myself and said, do you know about this group?

1178
02:02:44,824 --> 02:02:45,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we said, we're on board.

1179
02:02:46,005 --> 02:02:48,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we want safe gun storage.

1180
02:02:48,387 --> 02:02:49,667
[SPEAKER_05]: It just is a no brainer.

1181
02:02:49,708 --> 02:02:53,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for being here and all that you do for our community and it will save lives.

1182
02:02:54,011 --> 02:02:56,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll let you name and address.

1183
02:02:57,631 --> 02:03:01,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Aaron Dowd, I'm at 15A Austin Terrace in Medford.

1184
02:03:01,892 --> 02:03:04,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're the red shirts that the other red shirts.

1185
02:03:05,994 --> 02:03:12,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Usually moms are numbers are the ones in the red shirts, but tonight we were with the other red shirts.

1186
02:03:13,196 --> 02:03:17,758
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just wanted to say a little bit about this.

1187
02:03:17,818 --> 02:03:24,160
[SPEAKER_16]: So as of 2020, firearms are now the leading cause of death in children and teens when unsupervised

1188
02:03:24,682 --> 02:03:29,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Unauthorized children and teens gain access to unsecured firearms in their homes or vehicles.

1189
02:03:30,826 --> 02:03:36,310
[SPEAKER_16]: We see tragedies such as suicides, unintentional shootings, school shootings, and even some homicides.

1190
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:47,098
[SPEAKER_16]: Raising awareness in our community by passing this secure storage notification resolution is one evidence-based solution to prevent school shootings and other tragedies.

1191
02:03:47,518 --> 02:03:50,560
[SPEAKER_16]: Massachusetts has very strong secure storage laws in place

1192
02:03:51,109 --> 02:04:02,178
[SPEAKER_16]: and it benefits our community to make families aware of the life-saving effects of secure firearm storage and of parents' legal responsibilities to follow the Massachusetts secure firearm storage laws.

1193
02:04:02,818 --> 02:04:14,227
[SPEAKER_16]: More than 2 million students across the country now live in a school district that requires schools to educate parents about the critical importance of secure firearm storage, and this number is continuing to grow.

1194
02:04:15,468 --> 02:04:18,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Our school district can help normalize the conversation around gun safety,

1195
02:04:19,594 --> 02:04:27,641
[SPEAKER_16]: and add our important voice to other community advocates by actively educating parents and caregivers about how secure firearm storage can save lives.

1196
02:04:28,101 --> 02:04:41,792
[SPEAKER_16]: On behalf of the Medford Moms Demand Action for Nonsense in America members, which there's more than, this is our leadership team, I urge you to heed the call to educate families about the importance of securely storing firearms in their homes and pass the resolution.

1197
02:04:42,133 --> 02:04:42,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1198
02:04:45,075 --> 02:04:45,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve.

1199
02:04:47,297 --> 02:04:47,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1200
02:04:50,287 --> 02:04:51,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I went to school with Mia.

1201
02:04:51,808 --> 02:04:53,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us vote first, let us vote.

1202
02:04:53,349 --> 02:04:59,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hayes and all of us, Member Graham.

1203
02:05:00,515 --> 02:05:01,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

1204
02:05:02,817 --> 02:05:03,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Graham.

1205
02:05:03,497 --> 02:05:03,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1206
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:04,718
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Hayes.

1207
02:05:04,979 --> 02:05:05,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1208
02:05:05,519 --> 02:05:06,019
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Kretz.

1209
02:05:06,179 --> 02:05:06,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1210
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,541
[SPEAKER_21]: Member McLaughlin.

1211
02:05:07,761 --> 02:05:08,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1212
02:05:08,481 --> 02:05:09,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Mestona.

1213
02:05:09,162 --> 02:05:09,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1214
02:05:09,822 --> 02:05:10,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Russo.

1215
02:05:10,383 --> 02:05:10,603
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1216
02:05:10,723 --> 02:05:11,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor Longo.

1217
02:05:11,544 --> 02:05:11,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1218
02:05:11,864 --> 02:05:13,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1219
02:05:13,545 --> 02:05:14,766
[SPEAKER_05]: We support the resolution.

1220
02:05:15,126 --> 02:05:16,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor, can I just make one comment?

1221
02:05:18,007 --> 02:05:29,864
[SPEAKER_21]: And members when we at the presentation at the library, and I honestly, every year and month blurs together now, but we also I had brought up or we had discussed.

1222
02:05:30,304 --> 02:05:31,746
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't remember who brought anything up anymore.

1223
02:05:34,213 --> 02:05:39,477
[SPEAKER_21]: The police department, of course, has a complete listing of all licensed firearm owners in the community.

1224
02:05:40,077 --> 02:05:56,447
[SPEAKER_21]: And while it's not within the school committee's authority in any way, shape, or form, it did seem like a good idea, if it was not already happening, that an annual letter goes home from the police chief to everybody who has a licensed firearm to just remind them of the law.

1225
02:05:56,688 --> 02:06:02,411
[SPEAKER_21]: And I mean, at first, on the surface, it's like they went to the trainings or whatever, they got their license.

1226
02:06:04,619 --> 02:06:07,521
[SPEAKER_21]: But we all get lots of things every year to remind us of things.

1227
02:06:07,942 --> 02:06:19,792
[SPEAKER_21]: And if people who have a firearm that isn't a locked locker and don't do anything with it, it just sits there all year long, get the letter, maybe they'll check it and realize, whoa, the lock's not on or something.

1228
02:06:19,872 --> 02:06:30,741
[SPEAKER_21]: So obviously that's nothing for the school committee, but I just thought it was important that there's another avenue here where we don't have access to who has firearms, the police chief does.

1229
02:06:31,451 --> 02:06:40,177
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems like a very low cost thing to send one letter, assuming there's not 60,000 people with licenses in Medford annually.

1230
02:06:40,237 --> 02:06:43,339
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's just something I wanted to drop into your head real quick.

1231
02:06:43,559 --> 02:06:43,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1232
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:44,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1233
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:45,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Rousseau.

1234
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:52,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll discuss that with the chief of police and see what is already given out annually to license holders, see if we can add to it.

1235
02:08:17,562 --> 02:08:24,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McStone.

1236
02:08:24,584 --> 02:08:25,264
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1237
02:08:25,284 --> 02:08:25,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1238
02:08:26,164 --> 02:08:26,884
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1239
02:08:32,445 --> 02:08:33,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion is approved.

1240
02:08:33,425 --> 02:08:36,086
[SPEAKER_05]: We have report on enrollment.

1241
02:08:36,126 --> 02:08:40,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Richmond and Innovation.

1242
02:08:44,067 --> 02:08:44,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Cushing.

1243
02:08:55,166 --> 02:08:58,909
[SPEAKER_18]: in September is a very fluid document.

1244
02:08:59,109 --> 02:09:12,678
[SPEAKER_18]: While our numbers in are well known and well documented, our numbers out in students who may have gone to other districts, but those districts have not submitted or parents have not informed, right now leaves us a little bit in the dark for the fluidity.

1245
02:09:12,758 --> 02:09:16,841
[SPEAKER_18]: I do want to publicly thank Kim Miles for her assistance in pulling these numbers.

1246
02:09:16,901 --> 02:09:18,102
[SPEAKER_18]: She's an incredible resource.

1247
02:09:18,662 --> 02:09:21,503
[SPEAKER_18]: and really make sure that the district's data is squared away.

1248
02:09:22,623 --> 02:09:30,585
[SPEAKER_18]: And so later in October or early November, I know my report does say October, but it may be the first meeting in November.

1249
02:09:31,025 --> 02:09:43,848
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll provide you with a clear up-to-date report as to where Medford's children are within our district and potentially other places as we can best track at that time.

1250
02:09:44,928 --> 02:09:47,909
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you have any questions at this time,

1251
02:09:48,356 --> 02:09:54,581
[SPEAKER_18]: happy to take them, but please note that this is a fluid document, but it is tradition that it is provided at this meeting.

1252
02:09:55,361 --> 02:09:55,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor.

1253
02:09:56,562 --> 02:09:57,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Rousseau.

1254
02:09:57,503 --> 02:09:57,783
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1255
02:09:57,803 --> 02:09:59,265
[SPEAKER_21]: I just have, thank you for the report.

1256
02:09:59,505 --> 02:10:11,254
[SPEAKER_21]: I always look forward to this and I feel, unless I'm reading it wrong, I feel happy that our numbers are rebounding because I know last year's numbers were a little

1257
02:10:12,754 --> 02:10:13,454
[SPEAKER_21]: much lower, right?

1258
02:10:13,875 --> 02:10:14,475
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple hundred?

1259
02:10:15,155 --> 02:10:20,579
[SPEAKER_18]: As people were, we are seeing a significant rise in enrollments across the district.

1260
02:10:20,939 --> 02:10:31,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, you'll note that our freshman class, um, when I pulled that number, I was pretty blown away, uh, at how high it is as we've been in that 300 to three 10 range over the last several years.

1261
02:10:31,745 --> 02:10:36,748
[SPEAKER_18]: So right now, uh, in the vicinity of 339 is a very strong freshman class.

1262
02:10:37,028 --> 02:10:37,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1263
02:10:37,269 --> 02:10:37,569
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1264
02:10:37,669 --> 02:10:37,889
[SPEAKER_21]: And then

1265
02:10:38,696 --> 02:10:43,399
[SPEAKER_21]: There's another, there's a column on page two, it's titled NC, I forget what that means.

1266
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:44,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Newcomers.

1267
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:45,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, thank you.

1268
02:10:45,601 --> 02:10:52,506
[SPEAKER_18]: So just as you add these up, realize that some columns would represent a double count.

1269
02:10:53,006 --> 02:10:59,671
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's the grades across that are counted, but the newcomers, for an example, would not be counted.

1270
02:11:00,031 --> 02:11:02,493
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you're adding them up, they would not be counted.

1271
02:11:02,593 --> 02:11:05,675
[SPEAKER_18]: And then in the total are not the homeschool or charter school.

1272
02:11:06,198 --> 02:11:08,459
[SPEAKER_18]: But those are simply there to provide you that information.

1273
02:11:09,219 --> 02:11:09,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1274
02:11:14,382 --> 02:11:14,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Hayes.

1275
02:11:16,642 --> 02:11:23,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Just curious about that when you present again at the November meeting, will we at that point get information about class sizes?

1276
02:11:24,226 --> 02:11:24,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1277
02:11:31,516 --> 02:11:32,216
[SPEAKER_24]: Member McLaughlin.

1278
02:11:32,796 --> 02:11:33,216
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1279
02:11:33,256 --> 02:11:35,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for these and I look forward to the update.

1280
02:11:36,037 --> 02:11:54,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking at the number of out of district and thinking about those families and wondering if there's any sort of part of the strategic plan around the equity piece and other pieces in terms of trying to bring people back into the community and or look at what is having students out of the community.

1281
02:11:55,413 --> 02:12:00,876
[SPEAKER_18]: So I, I think that the strategic plan is definitely looking at ways that we can engage those families.

1282
02:12:01,637 --> 02:12:07,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, you know, there's been considerable effort over the past year to make sure that our communication is reaching them.

1283
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:17,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, uh, because of some challenges in technology, uh, it really requires, uh, us to go that extra mile to make sure that we're engaging all of our families.

1284
02:12:18,266 --> 02:12:27,529
[SPEAKER_18]: And we want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to support all the students of Medford, wherever they are, while they're our students.

1285
02:12:28,050 --> 02:12:28,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1286
02:12:28,570 --> 02:12:29,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

1287
02:12:29,650 --> 02:12:30,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I follow up, Mayor?

1288
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:31,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1289
02:12:31,671 --> 02:12:35,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just love to know what the communication strategy is just in terms of reaching them.

1290
02:12:35,832 --> 02:12:37,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are they getting the same announcements other folks are?

1291
02:12:37,753 --> 02:12:42,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do the principals do a welcome letter to them as they are with other folks?

1292
02:12:42,414 --> 02:12:44,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're getting sort of intermittent reports that

1293
02:12:44,645 --> 02:12:47,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are getting like after-school information, but some people aren't.

1294
02:12:48,267 --> 02:12:52,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that piece of it that, you know, wanting them to feel like they're part of the community is one piece.

1295
02:12:52,690 --> 02:12:56,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And full disclosure, you know, I have a child in and out of district placement.

1296
02:12:57,672 --> 02:13:06,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to share that as well as I'm talking about this, but also thinking about the cost that's involved for having our students go out of district.

1297
02:13:06,758 --> 02:13:14,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Hare from Harvard Graduate School of Education has a report that's featured actually on, it's on the DESE website, I'm sure, has been for a while.

1298
02:13:14,833 --> 02:13:24,038
[SPEAKER_02]: not a district placement and the majority of families that are not a district placement, you know, actually talked about not wanting to have to leave the district, not wanting their children to have to leave their friends or their community or whatever else.

1299
02:13:24,078 --> 02:13:26,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a cost that's attached to this.

1300
02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:35,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wanting to know, you know, if there's a strategic plan or if there's not, can there be some thought to strategic planning around how we're, you know, supporting families in this instance?

1301
02:13:36,021 --> 02:13:40,544
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'd like to take the time to be able to go back and fully and comprehensively review the strategic plan.

1302
02:13:40,704 --> 02:13:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Hare report would be great.

1303
02:13:42,226 --> 02:13:43,006
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, say that again.

1304
02:13:43,046 --> 02:13:45,448
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hare report, the audit district report by Tom Hare.

1305
02:13:45,708 --> 02:13:46,609
[SPEAKER_18]: If you would be able to send that to me.

1306
02:13:46,629 --> 02:13:47,089
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally can.

1307
02:13:47,109 --> 02:13:48,830
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be a phenomenal resource.

1308
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:50,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, thank you.

1309
02:13:51,973 --> 02:13:58,017
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just ask that whatever we do for a plan on that, that we consider that some families will not want communications.

1310
02:13:59,318 --> 02:14:02,941
[SPEAKER_21]: And so it needs to really be individualized

1311
02:14:03,962 --> 02:14:11,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly, families that want them should be able to get them, but I would just want to be clear that some families definitely will not want them.

1312
02:14:12,644 --> 02:14:13,484
[SPEAKER_21]: So, thank you.

1313
02:14:14,044 --> 02:14:14,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1314
02:14:14,425 --> 02:14:15,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1315
02:14:15,545 --> 02:14:16,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1316
02:14:18,986 --> 02:14:21,126
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our report on summer programs.

1317
02:14:21,186 --> 02:14:21,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1318
02:14:21,906 --> 02:14:25,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Suzanne Galluzzi, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction, Ms.

1319
02:14:25,807 --> 02:14:30,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Joan Bowen, Director of Student Services, and Mr. Paul Teixeira, Director of ELO.

1320
02:14:32,269 --> 02:14:32,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1321
02:14:34,364 --> 02:14:41,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So tonight we're going to present an update regarding the various summer programming that was held during the summer of 2022.

1322
02:14:43,150 --> 02:14:52,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the programming included the special education extended school year services, the EL summer program, the high school credit recovery program,

1323
02:14:53,376 --> 02:14:58,158
[SPEAKER_06]: the elementary academic step up and jumpstart instrumental music camp.

1324
02:14:59,098 --> 02:15:03,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to start with the special education extended school year programming.

1325
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:11,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Every year we run both four and six week programs in the months of July and August.

1326
02:15:11,323 --> 02:15:16,725
[SPEAKER_06]: This year we enrolled 209 students in the Medford extended school year program.

1327
02:15:17,443 --> 02:15:28,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And each summer, the special ed department provides extended school year services for students who are at risk for substantial regression or experiencing difficulty with recruitment of skills.

1328
02:15:30,322 --> 02:15:31,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide.

1329
02:15:31,563 --> 02:15:38,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So the special education programs were housed at the Missittuck, the Roberts Elementary School, and Medford High School.

1330
02:15:39,006 --> 02:15:42,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, there were six-week and four-week programs.

1331
02:15:42,608 --> 02:15:47,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also had tutoring and related services that provided services throughout the summer.

1332
02:15:49,867 --> 02:15:58,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Each program I broke down the enrollment on the next slide please, and it just tells you the amount of students that were enrolled in each of our programs.

1333
02:15:58,891 --> 02:16:06,674
[SPEAKER_06]: We have connections, which is our pre K to five program that was at the Roberts, we had 33 students enrolled in that programming.

1334
02:16:07,372 --> 02:16:14,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, we had 17 and our language based programming we had seven students who accessed summer services.

1335
02:16:15,259 --> 02:16:24,308
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 10 students in our developmental program and our access programs the middle school we had nine, and at the high school we had eight.

1336
02:16:24,963 --> 02:16:28,906
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had students in our project transition program come back.

1337
02:16:28,966 --> 02:16:32,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were two students and they had really individualized programs.

1338
02:16:33,008 --> 02:16:38,912
[SPEAKER_06]: They might've met with the counselor, done some vocational opportunities, some community-based opportunities.

1339
02:16:39,272 --> 02:16:42,894
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wasn't necessarily tutoring or related services.

1340
02:16:42,994 --> 02:16:51,180
[SPEAKER_06]: It may have been other services that we provided just so they would continue those skills that we build on throughout the school year.

1341
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:57,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And then 99 students were enrolled in tutoring throughout the course of the four week program.

1342
02:16:57,901 --> 02:17:01,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And then 19 students received related services only.

1343
02:17:01,902 --> 02:17:06,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last slide I have just breaks down the staffing that we had.

1344
02:17:06,703 --> 02:17:10,243
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had over 76 staff working the summer program.

1345
02:17:10,984 --> 02:17:18,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mention every single name because I think we would be here for a little while longer, but I do wanna say that we continue to work with

1346
02:17:19,085 --> 02:17:29,876
[SPEAKER_06]: the summer fun and Medford recreation program to make sure that our students, not only receive educational services, but also social skills and recreational programs.

1347
02:17:30,316 --> 02:17:37,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you'll notice two of our paraprofessionals provided support and summer fun for two of our students with disabilities.

1348
02:17:38,944 --> 02:17:45,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And in closing, I just want to say a special thanks to our two program supervisors Kim Clinton and Julie Santos.

1349
02:17:45,971 --> 02:17:54,920
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a lot of time and work and organization and getting this all together, but I especially want to say a huge thank you to all the staff that

1350
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:56,821
[SPEAKER_06]: signed up to work this summer.

1351
02:17:57,441 --> 02:17:59,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year was a difficult school year.

1352
02:17:59,822 --> 02:18:05,884
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a lot of consistency with service providers and providing the services to the students.

1353
02:18:05,904 --> 02:18:11,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to say thank you again to all the staff-related services and the paraprofessionals who worked this summer.

1354
02:18:11,067 --> 02:18:19,330
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor, do you want us to wait to the end or to do segment by segment questions?

1355
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:23,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward-Vincent said wait until the end if we could.

1356
02:18:23,552 --> 02:18:23,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1357
02:18:23,832 --> 02:18:24,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1358
02:18:25,649 --> 02:18:40,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, good evening again, Madam Mayor members school committee so this year, our summer credit recovery program credit recovery at the high school is designed to make sure that students stay on track so they don't have what's known as a yard loss your graduation loss.

1359
02:18:41,444 --> 02:18:45,287
[SPEAKER_18]: And so our enrollments this year were actually significantly reduced.

1360
02:18:47,129 --> 02:18:50,952
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had 66 total students with 93 total course enrollments.

1361
02:18:51,973 --> 02:18:54,575
[SPEAKER_18]: All students were from Medford this year.

1362
02:18:55,816 --> 02:19:00,260
[SPEAKER_18]: We had Mr. Ambrose of the High School English Humanities Department.

1363
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:04,962
[SPEAKER_18]: who led the program this summer and Mr. Blouk was supporting.

1364
02:19:05,942 --> 02:19:09,384
[SPEAKER_18]: This summer we did have a bit of a challenge, but we were able to secure teachers.

1365
02:19:09,904 --> 02:19:18,948
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of teachers were really ready to take a break, but we are so incredibly thankful for the teachers who came out.

1366
02:19:19,069 --> 02:19:22,050
[SPEAKER_18]: We used three mathematics teachers to seamlessly bridge

1367
02:19:22,971 --> 02:19:31,559
[SPEAKER_18]: The program, we had a student support teacher, social studies teacher, English teacher, and as well as security staffing, who did much more than just security staffing.

1368
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:43,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Our course enrollments were for Algebra 1, 7 students, Geometry 16, Algebra 2, 13, English 9, 4 students, English 10, 4 students, English 11, 1 student.

1369
02:19:43,970 --> 02:19:44,170
[SPEAKER_18]: U.S.

1370
02:19:44,210 --> 02:19:45,692
[SPEAKER_18]: History had 7 students, U.S.

1371
02:19:45,712 --> 02:19:47,093
[SPEAKER_18]: History 1 had 8 students.

1372
02:19:47,877 --> 02:19:54,123
[SPEAKER_18]: World History II had eight students, Biology had 12 students, and Chemistry had nine students.

1373
02:19:54,343 --> 02:20:00,028
[SPEAKER_18]: I do want to provide just a bit of context from the report that Mr. Ambrose shared with me.

1374
02:20:00,428 --> 02:20:06,394
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll forward this on to you, but Mr. Ambrose stated that he was particularly proud of the wonderful summer school faculty and staff.

1375
02:20:06,994 --> 02:20:10,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Each individual made instruction and personalized experience a priority for our students.

1376
02:20:11,431 --> 02:20:34,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Matt Brophy, Anthony Guillen, Riley Jones, Lomax Parajan, Nelson Maldonado, Dan Wagner, Melissa Ziobro, and then also with the support of Mr. Blouk, really did a tremendous job engaging students, providing them resources, doing some small assemblies to show recognition and support for what students were doing.

1377
02:20:35,089 --> 02:20:40,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Blouk and Mr. Ambrose have already established meeting times with me so that we can plan for next year,

1378
02:20:40,683 --> 02:20:48,212
[SPEAKER_18]: to go beyond just credit recovery and offer some enrichment opportunities and really try to expand the services that we can provide kids.

1379
02:20:48,693 --> 02:20:49,835
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you and.

1380
02:20:56,533 --> 02:20:57,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, good evening everyone.

1381
02:20:58,415 --> 02:21:06,983
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran summer enrichment programs for our English learner students, we had an elementary program for students in K through five that was held at the mistletoe.

1382
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:14,751
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought back the star base program if you remember that from a couple years ago this is the first year we've done the.

1383
02:21:17,059 --> 02:21:28,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But on on site in person hands on stem lab for the week and then we offered tutoring for students at the Medford public library in the middle school and then at the high school.

1384
02:21:30,126 --> 02:21:37,971
[SPEAKER_01]: We support the credit recovery so y'all students can make up the content classes that they need in order to gain the credits to move on to the next grade.

1385
02:21:40,267 --> 02:21:43,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are just some photos at the Missittuck, the elementary program.

1386
02:21:43,969 --> 02:21:46,330
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing some bug exploration.

1387
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:52,634
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to infuse content into what the students are learning as they're developing their language skills.

1388
02:21:52,694 --> 02:21:55,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And we focus on the four areas, reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

1389
02:21:58,537 --> 02:22:00,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously some enrichment play time as well.

1390
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:05,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this was the STARBASE program this year.

1391
02:22:05,642 --> 02:22:09,444
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the week-long STEM camp at Hanscom Air Force Base.

1392
02:22:10,565 --> 02:22:14,148
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 15 students attend that.

1393
02:22:14,408 --> 02:22:20,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a one-week program, full day, and it's a full hands-on STEM lab.

1394
02:22:21,593 --> 02:22:27,257
[SPEAKER_01]: They were building a bridge here that's Leonardo da Vinci Bridge in Italy.

1395
02:22:27,867 --> 02:22:29,890
[SPEAKER_01]: and they learn to recreate it.

1396
02:22:29,950 --> 02:22:38,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's physics, they learn chemistry, they do some coding, 3D printing, some robotics.

1397
02:22:39,024 --> 02:22:40,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Move on to the next slide.

1398
02:22:41,301 --> 02:22:47,343
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just hands-on, fully engaged learning activities for the week.

1399
02:22:47,463 --> 02:23:01,947
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, STARBASE partnered with Bridgewater State University and they had student interns also working with our students, in addition to the scientists from STARBASE and the two teachers from Medford who accompanied our students.

1400
02:23:04,901 --> 02:23:12,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so obviously this program or any of these programs can't, um, go on without any of the teachers who gave up part of their summer work.

1401
02:23:12,849 --> 02:23:29,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to recognize may I put this on Alexander and Alexa and Nunziata, Alison Blanchard, uh, Adelaine Cahill, who also worked as the lead teacher for the elementary program for me, Abby Harris, Melissa Calendarian, Julia Mitchell, and Amanda Zahedi.

1402
02:23:35,811 --> 02:23:36,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1403
02:23:36,391 --> 02:23:49,035
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, so elementary, the two weeks preceding the start of school this year for the 22-23 school year, we held our academic step-up camps.

1404
02:23:49,555 --> 02:23:57,998
[SPEAKER_23]: The effort to do that was to help students transition back from summer and any gaps that may have been lost over the summer.

1405
02:23:59,972 --> 02:24:06,875
[SPEAKER_23]: And so the intent was to have half-day academic programming for both reading and math entering grade level skills.

1406
02:24:08,896 --> 02:24:09,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1407
02:24:09,457 --> 02:24:13,158
[SPEAKER_23]: So this was for rising first grade through fifth grade students.

1408
02:24:15,159 --> 02:24:26,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Originally, I will say we were kind of hoping to maybe do this at each of the elementary buildings, but due to some staffing, we held it at the McGlynn.

1409
02:24:27,185 --> 02:24:28,606
[SPEAKER_23]: That was the centralized location.

1410
02:24:29,193 --> 02:24:44,413
[SPEAKER_23]: worked out very well, and we were able to have one to two sessions per grade levels for the reading, which was held Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday from 9 to 12, and for math, which was held on Thursdays and Fridays from 9 to 12.

1411
02:24:46,065 --> 02:24:51,791
[SPEAKER_23]: The day consisted of academics with us provided snack and a recess period.

1412
02:24:52,351 --> 02:24:55,234
[SPEAKER_23]: I do want to note that for a lot of our programming this summer.

1413
02:24:56,575 --> 02:25:06,225
[SPEAKER_23]: We partnered with the food bank through the Malden YMCA they provided all of the snacks and the lunches the grab and go lunches for

1414
02:25:06,994 --> 02:25:09,959
[SPEAKER_23]: academic step up as well as the credit recovery.

1415
02:25:11,581 --> 02:25:14,446
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. extended all of the summer programming.

1416
02:25:14,806 --> 02:25:15,627
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1417
02:25:15,948 --> 02:25:20,455
[SPEAKER_23]: Big shout out they were great to work with and I think that it's important for people to know.

1418
02:25:21,769 --> 02:25:41,847
[SPEAKER_23]: So the content, as I mentioned, was just grade level entry skills so that students could get back into those routines, especially like around reading, for students to get back into the routines that we have been using, using equity, getting students used to that vocabulary again, and just kind of getting their like student mind working.

1419
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:45,830
[SPEAKER_23]: If we just go to the next slide, there's just a couple of pictures.

1420
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:47,592
[SPEAKER_23]: These are a few pictures from the

1421
02:25:48,126 --> 02:25:53,270
[SPEAKER_23]: reading, in which students were sharing some of their reading and writing skills and working collaboratively.

1422
02:25:54,471 --> 02:26:00,796
[SPEAKER_23]: And the next two slides have to do with math, math groupings.

1423
02:26:02,238 --> 02:26:11,325
[SPEAKER_23]: And then again, like Mr. Texera had mentioned, I'm very grateful, you can advance to the next slide, for the teachers that

1424
02:26:12,167 --> 02:26:22,469
[SPEAKER_23]: Participated in this and gave up the last two weeks of their summer to come and help support our students, which I have to give a shout out to because I'm Laney Cahill.

1425
02:26:23,123 --> 02:26:28,225
[SPEAKER_23]: also came and worked a day for my program as well in someone's absence.

1426
02:26:28,265 --> 02:26:45,913
[SPEAKER_23]: So Maria Michelli, Lauren McCarthy, Ann Smith, Donna Mazie, Kathleen Polino, Debbie Notaro, Lee Chasteen, Alyssa Randazzo, Lee Azarello, Carissa Maturana, Laney Cahill, Adeline, known as Laney, and some academic support by Ms.

1427
02:26:46,033 --> 02:26:46,794
[SPEAKER_23]: Nancy Gersick.

1428
02:26:47,354 --> 02:26:49,675
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just wanted to thank them tremendously for their work.

1429
02:26:52,396 --> 02:26:54,218
[SPEAKER_23]: Moving to the next slide, please.

1430
02:26:54,258 --> 02:27:06,785
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just going to share on behalf of Haley Rello, who's our new coordinator for Performing Arts, that Medford Jumpstart Instrumental Camp was back for summer two.

1431
02:27:07,445 --> 02:27:11,508
[SPEAKER_23]: It was very exciting and pretty much doubled their numbers.

1432
02:27:11,848 --> 02:27:19,072
[SPEAKER_23]: So when we presented last year, there were about 40 students that participated in this, and this summer there were over 80.

1433
02:27:20,353 --> 02:27:23,515
[SPEAKER_23]: And so this is for rising fourth through eighth grade students.

1434
02:27:23,695 --> 02:27:41,084
[SPEAKER_23]: It was both strings and band, and it was also half day, but they had a great schedule in terms of mixing in kind of those, they even had like Olympic type activities, as well as the musical instruction.

1435
02:27:43,805 --> 02:27:47,667
[SPEAKER_23]: It all accumulated in, as you can see from these two pictures,

1436
02:27:49,514 --> 02:27:54,076
[SPEAKER_23]: a concert in Marsha Caron Theater for families to come and witness.

1437
02:27:54,616 --> 02:27:58,798
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the last slide, I love this picture.

1438
02:27:58,818 --> 02:28:08,182
[SPEAKER_23]: They were able to capture part of the activity each day was really getting students exposed to other instruments or other ways to make music.

1439
02:28:08,642 --> 02:28:10,803
[SPEAKER_23]: And so, as you can see here, this was a drum circle.

1440
02:28:11,343 --> 02:28:16,565
[SPEAKER_23]: I think you could make out some of the barrels and unique objects that were used for the drums.

1441
02:28:18,667 --> 02:28:21,730
[SPEAKER_23]: And so Haley Rello was the coordinator for this program.

1442
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:32,640
[SPEAKER_23]: She was there and on site organizing everything, but special thanks to the educators who worked with the students directly, Kristen Turner, Sarah Grant, Emma Baptiste and Sophia Chang.

1443
02:28:34,802 --> 02:28:35,382
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1444
02:28:35,443 --> 02:28:36,624
[SPEAKER_23]: Let us know if you have any questions.

1445
02:28:36,824 --> 02:28:37,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1446
02:28:38,686 --> 02:28:38,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1447
02:28:39,565 --> 02:28:40,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everybody.

1448
02:28:40,345 --> 02:28:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions?

1449
02:28:40,966 --> 02:28:41,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

1450
02:28:42,506 --> 02:28:44,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Member Rosohut is like, oh, no, you didn't have yours.

1451
02:28:45,107 --> 02:28:47,208
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a reflection, actually, of mine and yours.

1452
02:28:47,268 --> 02:28:48,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

1453
02:28:48,429 --> 02:28:48,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1454
02:28:48,869 --> 02:28:49,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the report.

1455
02:28:49,669 --> 02:28:50,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the pictures.

1456
02:28:50,729 --> 02:28:51,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I love seeing the pictures.

1457
02:28:51,610 --> 02:28:52,250
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always great.

1458
02:28:54,471 --> 02:28:59,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to know if there's a way, or if you guys are collecting demographic data at all.

1459
02:28:59,873 --> 02:29:12,124
[SPEAKER_02]: on who's participating in the different programs, and if so, if we can get that information moving forward, because it would be really useful for us to see who's actually participating for the demographics, that would be really helpful.

1460
02:29:13,084 --> 02:29:19,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going to ask about the food, so I'm really glad to hear that the Model Y is doing that.

1461
02:29:21,111 --> 02:29:26,336
[SPEAKER_02]: For the EL program, is there a cost associated with that for the students?

1462
02:29:28,638 --> 02:29:39,727
[SPEAKER_01]: No, all of the programs are paid for either out of a grant, so everything that the students do, the transportation to and from STARBASE, all of that is included under the grant.

1463
02:29:39,943 --> 02:29:40,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1464
02:29:40,343 --> 02:30:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you know, or can we think about in the future, whether there might be any opportunity for swimming instruction because I know that we see a really high incident of students that are not able to swim that come in to the schools to other communities so I know that we have the Medford pool I don't know if that's an option for summertime but just something that I wanted to sort of put out there.

1465
02:30:01,713 --> 02:30:02,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I can connect.

1466
02:30:02,613 --> 02:30:07,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, um, Rachel Perry does, you know, safety during the year, stuff like that.

1467
02:30:07,475 --> 02:30:13,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And with summer fun, I know that the reason they do it at the mistletoe is so that they have access to the pool.

1468
02:30:13,437 --> 02:30:17,018
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I can connect with them and see how they do it.

1469
02:30:17,078 --> 02:30:21,520
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and see how EL students can be included in that.

1470
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:28,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you know if EL students have been attending the summer fun program at all, or have they had any support to do that?

1471
02:30:28,442 --> 02:30:32,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So the summer fun program was going on at the same time.

1472
02:30:33,104 --> 02:30:35,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Elementary Yale program going on.

1473
02:30:36,245 --> 02:30:37,325
[SPEAKER_01]: But summer fun.

1474
02:30:38,126 --> 02:30:39,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that five days a week or four days.

1475
02:30:39,946 --> 02:30:44,828
[SPEAKER_01]: It's five days and it's five so we do have that fifth day because our program was only four days a week.

1476
02:30:45,448 --> 02:30:54,035
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I can talk to them about how students, Yale students can, you know, tag on a day of the week to participate in summer fun next year.

1477
02:30:54,215 --> 02:30:54,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1478
02:30:54,996 --> 02:31:01,682
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a lot of social emotional opportunity there and I know that we worked really hard with special education and the summer fun program.

1479
02:31:02,242 --> 02:31:10,327
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past to be able to collaborate to ensure student activity, because it's a really natural environment for students to build friendships and make relationships with each other.

1480
02:31:10,407 --> 02:31:11,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that would be great.

1481
02:31:11,988 --> 02:31:18,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess to that point, getting to the ESY programming, I know that Joan, you mentioned that there were two

1482
02:31:20,673 --> 02:31:25,915
[SPEAKER_02]: paraprofessionals in the that coordinate or that worked at the summer fund program which is really great.

1483
02:31:26,375 --> 02:31:34,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering what the need is in terms of increasing because I imagine the two were probably assigned were they assigned to individual IEPs.

1484
02:31:35,619 --> 02:31:36,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they were.

1485
02:31:36,279 --> 02:31:40,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were providing support to a group of students.

1486
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:49,762
[SPEAKER_06]: We broke it up that students required that additional power support, but we're also looking at a different type of programming too for some of our TLP students.

1487
02:31:50,522 --> 02:32:02,345
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taking the data from Summer Fund as well as what we saw during the ESY to look at some specific programming for our TLP students at the elementary and middle school level.

1488
02:32:02,705 --> 02:32:19,572
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great because I know the director was, you know, I've heard from so many parents about how incredible this program has been for their students with disabilities and for students with identified disabilities but also there's certainly students that don't identify with disabilities that go to the program as well.

1489
02:32:20,532 --> 02:32:34,520
[SPEAKER_02]: without disabilities, what have you, and the additional support that's needed from the paraprofessional community has really been shown, I think, and demonstrated, and certainly the counselors have expressed that need as well, in addition to the families.

1490
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:47,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's a coordinated effort as well between the special education department, ESY, and the summer fund camp, so that one of the things that we talk about is the lack of regression, right?

1491
02:32:47,888 --> 02:32:55,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So going forward into the school year into the social emotional piece of it is huge, particularly for those of our students who need social emotional supports.

1492
02:32:56,299 --> 02:33:05,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So just wanting to ensure that there's some ESY collaboration scheduling in advance with the summer fun programming yeah and we were we look at it every year.

1493
02:33:06,511 --> 02:33:12,934
[SPEAKER_06]: look at what the positives were and maybe not so positives and how can we make adjustments going forward.

1494
02:33:13,034 --> 02:33:20,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will be meeting with the coordinators that oversaw ESY programming to talk about what we need to do better for next year.

1495
02:33:21,037 --> 02:33:25,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to loop in summer fun and Medford rec to see how we can better support those students.

1496
02:33:25,979 --> 02:33:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think would be really great working with the directors of those programs because they don't necessarily have direct experience with

1497
02:33:33,462 --> 02:33:37,887
[SPEAKER_02]: students with disabilities or other students so that having them looked into get their feedback I think would be super helpful.

1498
02:33:38,427 --> 02:33:44,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just lastly regarding the hiring of the staff so first of all, the staff out there who came in the summertime.

1499
02:33:45,114 --> 02:33:49,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much I'm sure that's a huge commitment to be able to do that I know I needed my summer.

1500
02:33:49,659 --> 02:33:51,960
[SPEAKER_02]: break, I'm sure everybody felt like they did.

1501
02:33:51,980 --> 02:33:54,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the staff, it's an extra commitment to come in to do that.

1502
02:33:55,362 --> 02:34:05,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to that end, the paraprofessional pay rate for specifically like for I think summer fun is it or not summer fun for ESY.

1503
02:34:05,808 --> 02:34:17,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it accurate that some of the paraprofessionals may be on a pay scale for the year that is different than the pay scale for the summer so that some people were literally being asked to take a pay cut to come work in the summertime?

1504
02:34:17,475 --> 02:34:29,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they did not take a pay cut I don't believe but there are paraprofessionals in our specialized programs that get paid their per diem rate as opposed to a para rate so we could take a look at that.

1505
02:34:30,342 --> 02:34:32,363
[SPEAKER_06]: But we put up the application.

1506
02:34:33,064 --> 02:34:37,106
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the salary or this is the hourly rate, and people, you know,

1507
02:34:37,990 --> 02:34:39,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't force anyone to work.

1508
02:34:40,052 --> 02:34:42,213
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of people just want the continuation.

1509
02:34:42,253 --> 02:34:43,995
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to be able to work during the summer.

1510
02:34:44,015 --> 02:34:48,739
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of parents want to work with the same students that they've worked through throughout the school year.

1511
02:34:49,399 --> 02:34:50,560
[SPEAKER_06]: But we look at that every year.

1512
02:34:50,580 --> 02:34:50,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1513
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:54,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know if there's a differential in the ESY rate than there is during the school year.

1514
02:34:54,503 --> 02:34:55,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be helpful for the school committee.

1515
02:34:55,624 --> 02:34:56,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to take a look at that.

1516
02:34:56,525 --> 02:34:57,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1517
02:34:57,125 --> 02:34:57,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

1518
02:34:58,326 --> 02:34:59,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you guys all.

1519
02:34:59,467 --> 02:35:01,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to my colleagues for indulging me.

1520
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:01,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1521
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:03,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody.

1522
02:35:04,265 --> 02:35:07,046
[SPEAKER_05]: We have presentations of the public, not to begin before 7th.

1523
02:35:08,087 --> 02:35:08,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1524
02:35:08,387 --> 02:35:11,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to waive the reading of item number seven.

1525
02:35:12,109 --> 02:35:12,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1526
02:35:13,029 --> 02:35:14,010
[SPEAKER_05]: You read my mind.

1527
02:35:14,170 --> 02:35:15,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to waive the reading.

1528
02:35:15,530 --> 02:35:16,231
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor.

1529
02:35:16,251 --> 02:35:19,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I will waive the reading.

1530
02:35:19,792 --> 02:35:24,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe we have any presentations of the public, so I will continue on to number eight, which is continued business.

1531
02:35:25,955 --> 02:35:28,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually number nine, which is new business 2022.

1532
02:35:30,916 --> 02:35:32,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Dash 39 offered by member Rousseau.

1533
02:35:32,997 --> 02:35:38,961
[SPEAKER_05]: The Memphis School Committee may send a delegate, an alternate delegate, to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

1534
02:35:41,202 --> 02:35:46,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Annual joint conference for the purpose of voting during the delegate assembly on the resolutions of the MASC.

1535
02:35:46,345 --> 02:35:53,329
[SPEAKER_05]: The conference is Wednesday, November 2nd through Saturday, November 5th, with the delegate assembly being held on Friday, November 4th.

1536
02:35:54,653 --> 02:36:01,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Voting is presently only allowed in person and thus is recommended that only members that are able to and are planning to attend the conference be nominated.

1537
02:36:02,078 --> 02:36:03,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there nominations for a delegate?

1538
02:36:06,622 --> 02:36:09,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Member... Nominate me.

1539
02:36:10,204 --> 02:36:10,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you nominate me?

1540
02:36:11,145 --> 02:36:14,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin would like to nominate Mr. Russo.

1541
02:36:14,047 --> 02:36:17,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to be an alternate?

1542
02:36:17,310 --> 02:36:20,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter to me either way I'm going, so I just want to be able to go.

1543
02:36:20,232 --> 02:36:22,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if I'm an alternate or a sub, but I'd like to go.

1544
02:36:23,362 --> 02:36:27,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Member McLaughlin is named Member Rousseau as a delegate.

1545
02:36:27,985 --> 02:36:28,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

1546
02:36:29,245 --> 02:36:33,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Second by Member Graham.

1547
02:36:34,048 --> 02:36:34,869
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1548
02:36:35,529 --> 02:36:35,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1549
02:36:35,689 --> 02:36:36,570
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1550
02:36:37,170 --> 02:36:39,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, Member Rousseau, you are a delegate.

1551
02:36:40,292 --> 02:36:42,753

1552
02:36:43,053 --> 02:36:45,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'd like to- Member Rousseau?

1553
02:36:45,175 --> 02:36:47,076
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to nominate Member McLaughlin.

1554
02:36:47,356 --> 02:36:47,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1555
02:36:48,314 --> 02:36:52,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin has been nominated by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Stone.

1556
02:36:52,335 --> 02:36:53,115
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1557
02:36:53,595 --> 02:36:53,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1558
02:36:53,975 --> 02:36:54,755
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1559
02:36:56,295 --> 02:36:57,035
[SPEAKER_05]: That is approved.

1560
02:36:58,176 --> 02:36:58,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

1561
02:36:58,616 --> 02:36:59,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Represent us well.

1562
02:37:00,056 --> 02:37:00,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1563
02:37:01,476 --> 02:37:04,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Member Rousseau, 2022-40.

1564
02:37:04,697 --> 02:37:11,158
[SPEAKER_05]: The following policies are rescinded as they are no longer necessary because state law covers these matters.

1565
02:37:11,738 --> 02:37:17,619
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no specialized language expanding upon the laws and the MASC policy manual no longer offers these policies.

1566
02:37:18,496 --> 02:37:19,477
[SPEAKER_05]: their template system.

1567
02:37:21,057 --> 02:37:43,168
[SPEAKER_05]: ACH affirmative action policy, ADB drug free environment, CFAA duties of principal, CHB and BGD school committee review of regulations, CHC regulations dissemination, CL administrative reports, CLA administrative reports to the school committee, CMA annual reports and presentation presentation schedule,

1568
02:37:43,550 --> 02:37:45,071
[SPEAKER_05]: CLB incident reports.

1569
02:37:45,271 --> 02:37:47,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by member Russo.

1570
02:37:48,473 --> 02:37:50,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to approve the first reading, right?

1571
02:37:50,634 --> 02:37:53,876
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a policy change, so we have to do this twice.

1572
02:37:53,916 --> 02:37:55,737
[SPEAKER_17]: So motion to approve the first reading.

1573
02:37:57,558 --> 02:38:02,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by member Gramps and seconded by member McLaughlin to approve the first reading.

1574
02:38:02,682 --> 02:38:03,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Great catch, thank you.

1575
02:38:03,902 --> 02:38:04,763

[SPEAKER_05]: This school committee must vote on each of the resolutions from the report of the resolutions committee of the MASC to provide the delegate to the MASC delegate assembly guidance on how to vote during the assembly to be held on November 4th, 2022.

[SPEAKER_05]: The full language of the resolution can be found at this webpage, including the meeting materials on September 12th, 2022.

1590
02:39:11,425 --> 02:39:24,567
[SPEAKER_05]: The votes of the Medford School Committee are considered binding on the delegate unless the language as presented at the September 12th, 2022 meeting is different from the language up for final adoption at the delegate assembly on November 4th, 2022.

1591
02:39:25,088 --> 02:39:37,190
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason votes are otherwise considered guidance is that the exact language voted on during the assembly can be modified by amendments during the assembly and returning to the school committee for a vote on the final language is not possible.

02:39:39,874 --> 02:39:46,497
[SPEAKER_21]: We, I don't think I've ever done this as far as I can tell, but this is actually something we're supposed to do each year.

1595

[SPEAKER_21]: These are resolutions to change.

1596
02:39:51,138 --> 02:40:04,943
[SPEAKER_21]: But essentially their, their resolutions that come from school committees around Massachusetts that tell the association our professional association, what we want them to be focused on in the upcoming year, and their action to get legislation changed.

1597
02:40:05,384 --> 02:40:12,726
[SPEAKER_21]: So, these are the six resolutions that came to the resolution committee of the MSC, and I.

1598
02:40:14,474 --> 02:40:22,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Having read them all, I certainly support all of them, although, as it says earlier, it's up for all of us to decide whether to support them.

1601
02:40:32,983 --> 02:40:36,985
