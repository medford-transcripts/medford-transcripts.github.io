43
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:14,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Dunley, if you could take a moment to just go through the end of year transfers and explain the document that you passed out.

44
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the document that we have here this evening is a little different than what we received in our packet.

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,832
[SPEAKER_14]: It's much more detailed, and I think it answers a lot of the questions that may have come up.

46
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you'd be kind enough to go through a brief presentation, I'd appreciate it.

47
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,056
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair, absolutely.

48
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:30,858
[SPEAKER_20]: Councillor Knight, what I'm doing is I'm actually moving funds

51
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,976
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm moving $16,000 into cemetery to cover overtime that was more than estimated.

52
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:57,857
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm moving $5,000 into data processing ordinary to cover IT's purchase of Office 365.

53
00:02:57,897 --> 00:02:58,177
[SPEAKER_20]: I am moving

54
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:05,417
[SPEAKER_20]: $448 to energy and environment to cover her small part-time deficit.

55
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:14,042
[SPEAKER_20]: I am moving $2,794 into legal to cover legal settlements account, which is in deficit.

56
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:17,564
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm moving $962 to legislative.

[SPEAKER_20]: I'm moving $3,300 to community development board to cover stipends.

58
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:26,809
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm moving $1,300 to licensing to cover licensing stipends.

59
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:34,455
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm moving $14,232 insurance to cover the insurance liability, which was more than estimated.

60
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:43,303
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm moving $4,312 to senior work-off FICA to cover the city's portion of the tax liability for the senior work-off program.

61
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:48,567
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm also moving $886,414 to Snow and Ice for the deficit.

62
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:51,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

63
00:03:54,355 --> 00:04:01,078
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the Chair to Council Member Kern, that was $886,414 to snow and ice.

64
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Through the Chair, if I may.

65
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:09,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Member Kern.

66
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:16,025
[SPEAKER_16]: That $886,414, that's the total amount from last year's budget that's being moved into snow and ice for the current year?

67
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:18,106
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the total amount.

68
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:21,368
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the total amount of leftover funds in this current year budget.

69
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:24,687
[SPEAKER_20]: that I'm moving to cover the snow and ice deficit this fiscal year.

70
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:25,267
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

71
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:27,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

72
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:33,192
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there any other questions for me?

73
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:34,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions for us?

74
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:38,575
[SPEAKER_06]: No further questions?

75
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:42,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, councillors.

76
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:43,197
[SPEAKER_20]: Councillor Knight.

77
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, it's been my experience that at the end of the year, we see a number of end-of-year transfers.

78
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,671
[SPEAKER_14]: We have some accounts that run in a deficit, some accounts that run in a surplus, and really all this is is housekeeping to balance the books.

79
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:05,454
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that there looks like there's a good amount of surplus here that's going towards a snow and ice deficit, which is something that we need to take care of at some point in time as well, Mr. President.

80
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:06,575
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to thank Ms.

81
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:07,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Notley for her presentation.

82
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:10,456
[SPEAKER_14]: I think she did a lot of work putting this document together, and I appreciate it.

83
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:14,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor De La Rosa.

84
00:05:14,977 --> 00:05:17,938
[SPEAKER_08]: President, this is an ordinary process we go through each year.

85
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:20,959
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that we're chipping away at the snow and the ice.

86
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:34,179
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I, uh, uh, am grateful for the transparent nature in which, uh, these, uh, items are being trans, uh, presented to us move approval on the motion.

87
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, council vice president marks.

88
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

89
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:48,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I have, uh, a number of questions regarding these transfers, um, from accounts, uh, that we've heard from.

90
00:05:50,488 --> 00:06:00,634
[SPEAKER_05]: department heads, we've heard from personnel in these particular accounts regarding needs that were addressed in the budget or what we thought was addressed in the budget.

91
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:05,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're seeing transfers from these particular accounts to other accounts.

92
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:12,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first one I have a question with Mr. President is the Chevalier Auditorium.

93
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:16,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all have at one point spoken about

94
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:34,405
[SPEAKER_05]: how Chevalier is the economic engine in this community, and that we need to put some money into Chevalier in order to bring the top-notch performances and activities that we'd all like to see help revitalize our square.

95
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:41,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm concerned, Mr. President, that we're transferring $7,000 in ordinary expense, and we've heard from

96
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:54,286
[SPEAKER_05]: members of the board of commission that there's a hot water tank that's needed at Chevalier.

97
00:06:55,747 --> 00:07:03,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, the $7,000 could have went towards replacing the hot water tank.

98
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:14,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Also the HVA systems in there, the motor needs to be replaced in the HVAC system.

99
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:15,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And

100
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:19,280
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of broken windows throughout the building.

101
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:29,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And as it rains right now out there, torrential rains, I'm concerned that many of these broken windows will be accepting water from outside into the building.

102
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:34,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also receiving a $5,000 transfer out of personnel.

103
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:53,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are only a few things that, as a member of the Friends, which I sat on the past year, that help support Chevalier, know firsthand that the commission, Chevalier Auditory Commission, is looking for these improvements.

104
00:07:54,166 --> 00:08:01,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't fathom why, Mr. President, at this point, we'd be taking money from an entity we all feel needs additional money,

105
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,231
[SPEAKER_05]: and putting it into an account, which is great, snow and ice.

106
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:17,693
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when it's winter time, we all want to make sure that account has plenty, but to take from this account, Mr. President, to put into that account, I have a major concern with this.

107
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:21,613
[SPEAKER_05]: The second piece, Mr. President, is the fire department.

108
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:26,174
[SPEAKER_05]: We're taking $179,000 in ordinary expense from the fire department and $40,000 from personnel.

109
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:44,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the 79,000 from ordinary expense, as we all heard in engine three and engine four and many of the other engines in this city, the windows don't work in the building.

110
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:54,055
[SPEAKER_05]: 79,000 would replace a lot of windows in our fire station that our brave men and women call home for long periods of time, Mr. President.

111
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:57,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet, that's being shipped out of the fire department.

112
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:14,477
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about the restrooms at the headquarters, and some of us took tours, Mr. President, and the deplorable condition of the shower stalls and toilets at the headquarters, deplorable conditions.

113
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:26,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I would submit to you, Mr. President, $79,000 would go a long way in fixing these very crucial needs that we hear from the fire department.

114
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:34,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, an issue that's been near and dear to me is the turnout gear.

115
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:42,707
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally got the washers for the turnout gear, but we still don't have the dryers that can dry the equipment.

116
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:50,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, $79,000 would pay for, I believe they were asking for two dryers at the time,

117
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:54,256
[SPEAKER_05]: would well pay for two dryers, Mr. President.

118
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:59,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So there we have a department that we know is not gonna get a brand new building, the headquarters.

119
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:05,612
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not part of the police headquarters rebuilding.

120
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:16,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have some needs throughout the community in some of these buildings that are 80, 90, 100 years old that our brave men and women are in, Mr. President.

121
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:20,943
[SPEAKER_05]: They do an heroic job when they have to rush out to fires.

122
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:28,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not let them do an heroic job when they have to come back and be in a substandard fire station.

123
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:31,271
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what they're there for, Mr. President.

124
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:59,337
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing, and I bring this up, Mr. President, is because recently the police department, because of what was going on throughout not only this state, but across the country, of security concerns within local police departments, our police department asked for ballistic glass to be put in the windows, because they're located on the first floor, they're located right when you come into the building,

125
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:25,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm under the impression that ballistic glass was installed, however, it makes the windows so heavy, and we already know many of these windows in the front desk area were already in disrepair, and were held up by Coke cans and so forth, opened by Coke cans, that they requested a AC unit in the front desk area, because they can't open the windows.

126
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:29,713
[SPEAKER_05]: and it gets 80 to 90 degrees in there, from what I hear from the officers.

127
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:48,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we're transferring $135,000 from ordinary expense from the police department, and another $20,000 that could go towards the police department locker room, which we all know, in addition to the fire department, is in deplorable condition.

128
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:54,722
[SPEAKER_05]: and this AC unit that this $135,000 would pay for, Mr. President.

129
00:11:55,242 --> 00:12:17,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not quite as happy as some of my colleagues with the transfer to the Snow and Ice account, knowing that there are many needs out there with our public safety officials, with a building that we all brag about, Chevalier, in the squares, the economic engine, and yet we're pulling money out of it to put into, for the most part, the Snow and Ice account.

130
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:22,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will not support this transfer tonight, Mr. President.

131
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:24,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe there are too many needs right now.

132
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:34,685
[SPEAKER_05]: When we sat down and went over the budget with both chiefs, I was under the impression that some of these issues would be addressed through building maintenance.

133
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:45,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am very displeased to see that we are transferring money of this magnitude out of these departments and not addressing the day-to-day operations.

134
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:48,174
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a luxury.

135
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:59,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Having air conditioning in a room that's 90 degrees, where they sit for 24 hours a day, the police department at the front desk, is not a luxury to have an AC unit in that office.

136
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:12,414
[SPEAKER_05]: To have showers, Mr. President, when you come back from a fire, or an officer that's out all day on duty, come back and to go into a restroom that's in deplorable condition, to me is not a luxury.

137
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:13,755
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a necessity.

138
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:21,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, for Chevalier Auditorium, to move that great auditorium forward, we need to keep up with the basics.

139
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:30,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And a hot water tank, HVAC motors that need to replace, those are necessities, those aren't luxuries.

140
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:34,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, Mr. President, I would hope my colleagues would reconsider.

141
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:38,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is a ritual every year, we transfer money

142
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:44,867
[SPEAKER_05]: But in my opinion, this transfer this year, Mr. President, is unnecessary at this point.

143
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:54,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like to see some of the major issues with public safety that this council has been speaking about year after year after year addressed with this money, Mr. President.

144
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair to Councilor Marks for the Chevalier.

145
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, the building department does supplement and take care of the Chevalier.

146
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:06,813
[SPEAKER_20]: This really is just leftover uncommitted funds.

147
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,655
[SPEAKER_20]: We weren't just taking money away arbitrarily from anything.

148
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:12,516
[SPEAKER_20]: And also any things like that are planned for.

149
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:16,298
[SPEAKER_20]: And as far as the fire and police department, both the chiefs are aware.

150
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,560
[SPEAKER_20]: And I emailed them and asked them what is available in order to be moved.

151
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,640
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't just take funds.

152
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:25,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's exactly what you do is take funds because, uh,

153
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:30,108
[SPEAKER_05]: no chief in this city is gonna stand up and say, you're not taking funds out of my account.

154
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:35,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So, with all due respect, I've been around here a number of years, I know how it operates.

155
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:39,392
[SPEAKER_05]: When you talk to members of the commission, Chevrolet commission, saying,

156
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:41,367
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean that's on the agenda?

157
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:45,029
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean they're taking $7,000 out of ordinary expense?

158
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:52,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right, that's overseen by the city now, the budget, and we weren't aware of that.

159
00:14:53,331 --> 00:15:07,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may think everyone's aware and everyone's on board, but I can tell you the brave men in the police department and the fire department are not aware of this money being reverted to other purposes based on their needs.

160
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:09,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may be on board with both chiefs,

161
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:17,653
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can tell you the rank and file and the police and the fire department as well as members of Chevalier Commission are not on board.

162
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:19,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

163
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:22,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member O'Kurin.

164
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:25,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Carviello.

165
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:27,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a question through the chair.

166
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:34,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you saying we should reduce this by $86,000 or are you going to not support the paper in its entirety?

167
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:46,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'll leave it up to the druthers of the council how they want to approach it.

168
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:52,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only one member of the council, but I will not support the paper with the transfers that currently exist.

169
00:15:52,660 --> 00:16:01,045
[SPEAKER_05]: If we want to discuss about leaving the police fire and the Chevalier Auditorium in there, that's open for discussion, and I will support that.

170
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:06,088
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, I'm only one member of the council, and I will not support the paper as it currently exists.

171
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:15,436
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think that, um, through the chair, I think he makes good points and especially with the Chevalier ordinary expenses and the fire department's ordinary expenses.

172
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:21,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I'm not sure how much the ballistic glass costs for the police department.

173
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:22,397
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it would be.

174
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:23,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

175
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:25,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't, but then didn't they need thicker?

176
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:27,578
[SPEAKER_16]: They got the second set.

177
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:30,119
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, if we,

178
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:42,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean, I'd be willing to approve the paper minus $86,000 plus the air conditioner.

179
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:48,538
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think that would solve the problems that are discussed, but then move the rest of the paper forward.

180
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:53,381
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I'll move that motion forward, or you can.

181
00:16:53,401 --> 00:17:04,387
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll have my support if you do it that way, so that we can approve the majority of the transfers and then have the $7,000 for Chevalier to go back to Chevalier for whatever their needs are.

182
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:05,308
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you have

183
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:17,390
[SPEAKER_16]: For $79,000, we all know that is less than what needs to be spent in the fire stations, considering they have beds from the 1940s, I think.

184
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,931
[SPEAKER_16]: So that can definitely be well spent.

185
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:29,576
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there's an air conditioner that's needed, I think that would be a good compromise so that we could get those three things done and then move approval on the rest of the transfers for snow and ice.

186
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:33,378
[SPEAKER_16]: So Mr. President, if I could.

187
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:39,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is why we met in budget a week and a half ago.

188
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:41,954
[SPEAKER_05]: We've met for a number of nights.

189
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,476
[SPEAKER_05]: We asked specific questions regarding each account.

190
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:54,942
[SPEAKER_05]: This year we were given the ability to see last year's expenses, I'm sorry, last year's budget.

191
00:17:55,447 --> 00:18:01,088
[SPEAKER_05]: this year, fiscal year to date, and what the FY18 appropriation is, the budgeted request.

192
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:06,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've asked many times, how are we gonna end in particular accounts?

193
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:24,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was under the impression with a lot of these accounts that because the report, I think was a month back, we were told, because there was sizable amounts in these accounts, that due to salary and so forth, other expenses, that we were gonna bottom out on a lot of these accounts.

194
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:29,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a real surprise to me to see some of these dollar amounts.

195
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:36,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And today is June 27th, and you would have to have this spent by the end of the fiscal year, I believe.

196
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:52,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So it puts us in a real different position now to have this money expended within that period of time, where if we knew maybe a week, two weeks ago, three weeks, what the projection was gonna be,

197
00:18:54,023 --> 00:18:56,205
[SPEAKER_05]: then maybe we could have made a better decision.

198
00:18:57,406 --> 00:19:11,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point, Mr. President, I would go with Councilor Longo's amendment to minus the $7,000 out of Chevalier, out of ordinary expense, the $79,000 out of fire.

199
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:12,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, Councilor Longo?

200
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:16,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the whole $135,000 out of police.

201
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:22,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And see what can be done in this timeframe to address some of the issues that were brought up for

202
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,250
[SPEAKER_05]: building maintenance, and other ordinary expenses.

203
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:28,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor De La Rosa.

204
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:29,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to sever.

205
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Budget Director, was there any comment on that?

206
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:36,122
[SPEAKER_07]: On what to...

207
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:50,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just like to say that we have only like three days left in this year, and I do not think that it would be possible to do the procurements properly.

208
00:19:50,663 --> 00:20:02,086
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that it was, you know, your suggestion that this exercise should have been done maybe a few weeks ahead may have, you know, would give us more time.

209
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:29,430
[SPEAKER_12]: But at this point, where you have two and a half days, really, two full days and one half day in the fiscal year, and with our end of the year processing that our office is going through, I have serious doubt that anything will be, as far as procurement, getting contractors in here and replacing windows or HVAC, I don't see that happening.

210
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so I understand,

211
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:35,012
[SPEAKER_05]: The procurement is $10,000 and over, correct?

212
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Procurement can be anything.

213
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,521
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's a window replacement, it can be less than $10,000.

214
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Procurement can be anything.

215
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:47,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's not a set dollar amount that you have that you reach in order to do procurement?

216
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:53,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, over $10,000 we have to get three quotes and over $50,000 we have to do a formal RFP.

217
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:55,584
[SPEAKER_12]: So it depends on what you're... So what about under $10,000?

218
00:20:55,925 --> 00:21:01,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Under $10,000 you can reach out to anyone and get somebody to come and replace.

219
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can reach out.

220
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,713
[SPEAKER_05]: So many of these items could be addressed.

221
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,245
[SPEAKER_05]: that are under $10,000.

222
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:09,586
[SPEAKER_12]: If they are under $10,000, yes.

223
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:09,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

224
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:18,307
[SPEAKER_12]: And if the contractors are available to come in and do the replacements, like if it's a window replacement or an HVAC, you know.

225
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:18,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

226
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:31,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they were able to get a purchase order by the 30th of this month, with the funding that's available, the work could be done any time, right, after that.

227
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't necessarily have to be done within... No, it has to be done by June 30th.

228
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:39,797
[SPEAKER_20]: General fund has to be done by June 30th.

229
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:40,318
[SPEAKER_05]: The work?

230
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:44,722
[SPEAKER_20]: The work has to be done and procured and incurred by June 30th.

231
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:47,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard that before.

232
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,026
[SPEAKER_20]: I've never heard that before.

233
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:56,314
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we do any type of work now in the building, if we had an emergency work done, you're saying that we couldn't do it because

234
00:21:56,841 --> 00:21:57,221
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't.

235
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,921
[SPEAKER_20]: Emergency work you could do.

236
00:21:58,961 --> 00:21:59,882
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to do emergency.

237
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:00,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.

238
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:01,922
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all emergency work.

239
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:03,662
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all emergency work.

240
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:08,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Emergency is anything that jeopardizes public safety.

241
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,104
[SPEAKER_12]: It's their very strict.

242
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:13,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, or public safety officials.

243
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:13,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

244
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:13,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

245
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,265
[SPEAKER_12]: For any citizens of the city.

246
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:16,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

247
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:23,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, I don't want to step on Councilor Longo's toes if that's what she wanted to offer.

248
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:24,407
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I'll offer the same thing.

249
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:29,847
[SPEAKER_05]: that that money be taken from this paper, Mr. President.

250
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:37,813
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to remind the councillors, too, that for snow and ice deficit, if it's not covered via transfers, that is means that I do have to raise it on the tax recap.

251
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:40,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member O'Karen.

252
00:22:43,677 --> 00:22:46,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but I think that's probably the way to go.

253
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:53,804
[SPEAKER_16]: The only other option is to withdraw it from the transfer and make it a condition of the paper that those

254
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:56,639
[SPEAKER_16]: those projects get done.

255
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if it's not transferred, then it wouldn't have to be on a time crunch.

256
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,763
[SPEAKER_16]: It would just be a condition of the paper.

257
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:13,608
[SPEAKER_16]: You remove them from the transfer, they're going to be unspent, it's going to go to free cash, and then we make it a condition of the paper.

258
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, well, do you want to make that a separate paper?

259
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:26,803
[SPEAKER_16]: You can make that as an amendment.

260
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:36,292
[SPEAKER_16]: I think at least this, the 7,000 and the 79,000 and an air conditioner, if that's the problem, you know, please to get in a new station, but 86,000 plus the air conditioner.

261
00:23:36,312 --> 00:23:37,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So 96 is the number 90 90 where the other four come from.

262
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:49,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Air conditioning unit in the police station, I hear.

263
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:51,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it's gonna cost.

264
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:52,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't.

265
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather put the total dollar amount that's being transferred.

266
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So, at the moment, you've got the two.

267
00:23:57,963 --> 00:23:59,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you said, it will revert back.

268
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:02,466
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got the two departments totaling $86,000, correct?

269
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:04,628
[SPEAKER_07]: The two, and then he wants the third.

270
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:07,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, where's the other $4,000 coming from?

271
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say $4,000.

272
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:12,374
[SPEAKER_16]: I said, I was recommending four from the police ordinary account.

273
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:13,455
[SPEAKER_16]: 86,000 is the number?

274
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:13,775
[SPEAKER_16]: The seven?

275
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:17,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

276
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:17,964
[SPEAKER_07]: $1,000 grand?

277
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:23,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the number you're looking for?

278
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:24,348
[SPEAKER_16]: All three, that's fine.

279
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:24,688
[SPEAKER_16]: 135 plus seven plus 79.

280
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:27,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me get my calculator.

281
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:28,030
[SPEAKER_16]: So 135, 79, and what else?

282
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven.

283
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:28,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven.

284
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:29,711
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's six, one, two.

285
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:29,711
$221,000?

286
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:29,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

287
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:30,491
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to sever $221,000?

288
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:48,939
[SPEAKER_07]: from this transfer?

289
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:02,270
[SPEAKER_07]: If the clerk could advise me that those have to come on each line.

290
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,733
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to separate with the lines that you want.

291
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't.

292
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:08,215
[SPEAKER_07]: We mentioned already, we'll spell out the amendments.

293
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:10,117
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have to spell out the amendments.

294
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:12,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

295
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:14,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, Ms.

296
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Nunley mentioned something.

297
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:21,438
[SPEAKER_14]: She said that, you know, if we reduce the funds in this paper, then it's going to have to be made up for the snow and ice control through the tax recap.

298
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:26,701
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was wondering if she could get up and explain to us a little bit about what impact that will have on the community and on the tax rate going forward.

299
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:29,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

300
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:38,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the Chair, to Councilor Knight, yes, if I can't get this covered, I have to bring it up and raise it on the tax recap, which then goes in towards our levy limit.

301
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:39,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, by

302
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:44,566
[SPEAKER_20]: taking this out and moving the funds, we would actually be under the levy limit.

303
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:56,637
[SPEAKER_14]: So you'd add this surplus deficit, this deficit for snow and ice to the 2.5% maximum tax?

304
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:58,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because we're allowed to raise that, yes.

305
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:02,162
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be snow and ice plus the property tax would generate a tax levy?

306
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:02,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

307
00:26:02,983 --> 00:26:03,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

308
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:14,825
[SPEAKER_07]: The Councilor Longo, do you want to make an amendment on which lines you want to take out?

309
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:17,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know, so the clerk can have it.

310
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:20,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Shabali Auditorium.

311
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:22,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Ordinary expenses.

312
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,911
[SPEAKER_07]: So $7,000 from Shabali Auditorium, ordinary expenses.

313
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:25,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire ordinary expenses, $79,000.

314
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,252
[SPEAKER_07]: $79,000 from fire ordinary expenses.

315
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Police ordinary, $135,000.

316
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,134
[SPEAKER_16]: And police ordinary, $135,000.

317
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:42,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Conditioned on doing, yeah, doing an air conditioner.

318
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:47,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Which comes to a total of $221,000, correct?

319
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:48,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

320
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:56,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, sir.

321
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:59,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave Jampy, 35 Greenhall Street, Medford, Mass.

322
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:01,934
[SPEAKER_09]: With the chair, Ms.

323
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:06,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Nunley, how come we, you wrote up a budget last year?

324
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:09,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Say that again?

325
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:10,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you make up the budget?

326
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:12,455
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not make up the budget.

327
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:15,317
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the mayor's budget.

328
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:17,278
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor's budget?

329
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:17,578
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

330
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:19,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you talking about the transfers or are you talking about the budget?

331
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:22,821
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, one, what's personal mean?

332
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,582
[SPEAKER_20]: Personal is salaries.

333
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:25,923
[SPEAKER_09]: What's personnel?

334
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:28,364
[SPEAKER_20]: It's personal for UMass, Uniform School.

335
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:36,328
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair, according to the Uniform Massachusetts Accounting System, it is called personal for salaries and ordinaries.

336
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:40,051
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to direct the questions for the chair, and then she can have an opportunity to address them afterwards.

337
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:40,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

338
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:41,292
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

339
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:42,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I know for a fact.

340
00:27:42,892 --> 00:27:47,455
[SPEAKER_09]: To the chair, sir.

341
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:53,299
[SPEAKER_09]: $135,000 out of the police account, yet they don't have cruises to respond to calls.

342
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,803
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a common practice by the city's administration

343
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:10,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And before that, this city administration was also the habit of the former administration.

344
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:15,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Every year we come back and forth.

345
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,580
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of money here that hasn't been spent.

346
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:27,468
[SPEAKER_09]: As a person that's been victimized by the city not spending money, I mean, we have money, say $135,000 for ordinary.

347
00:28:30,852 --> 00:28:32,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Public safety, use it.

348
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:39,276
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a Riverside Ave, we have a public school down there.

349
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:40,297
[SPEAKER_09]: No traffic light.

350
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:46,542
[SPEAKER_09]: When we built those schools, that was one of my pet peeves was to get a traffic light there.

351
00:28:47,402 --> 00:28:52,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Because not only do we have kids going back and forth during school, we have kids going back and forth to everything else.

352
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:57,104
[SPEAKER_09]: This city refuses to do anything for the citizens, public safety-wise.

353
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Energy and environment, 448, wow.

354
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:07,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Electrical, how come we have a personnel charge overage of $35,000?

355
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:15,398
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been looking for personnel for these departments for a while now, and nothing's been forthcoming.

356
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:19,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Building inspector, personnel, first $57,000.

357
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,339
[SPEAKER_09]: What have we been looking for for years?

358
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:26,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Code enforcement, maybe another building inspector or a half.

359
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the people getting taken on this, they're in.

360
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:38,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

361
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:59,118
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion that we sever, motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight, and Councilor Langel-Kern's paper will be a separate vote to sever $221,000 from the budget.

362
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:00,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct, Mr. Clerk?

363
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,671
[SPEAKER_07]: from the transfers?

364
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:07,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, excuse me, from the transfers?

365
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:11,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the correct procedure?

366
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:16,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

367
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,602
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Robert Pintus, Arrow Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

368
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,264
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a member of the Saugus body.

369
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:23,847
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a couple of things here that would disturb me.

370
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:27,190
[SPEAKER_19]: The first one goes on to personnel under the Office of Community Development.

371
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,552
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, this city is in desperate need

372
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,652
[SPEAKER_19]: of having good qualified people for the purposes of bringing development here into this community.

373
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:38,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, the city does not have a professional grant writer.

374
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:42,754
[SPEAKER_19]: It does not have any extra people in that particular office upstairs.

375
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:46,115
[SPEAKER_19]: This is what we heard two years ago when this administration was running.

376
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:52,278
[SPEAKER_19]: We were going to boast that particular office with personnel that could bring us to some type of competition.

377
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:53,498
[SPEAKER_19]: Our sister city of Somerville

378
00:30:53,928 --> 00:30:56,690
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe it's either 13 or 14 people in their OCD.

379
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Malden, a smaller city, equal size, has more people than we do.

380
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:05,516
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's a telling story that if you can have two departments that have $100,000

381
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:14,710
[SPEAKER_19]: as this particular department has, and then you can go to the building department, who has a $57,000 personnel line item in there.

382
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:24,937
[SPEAKER_19]: That really tells the story to me that there is absolutely something wrong, and nothing has taken place here over the last two years to bring in good, qualified people, if, in fact, the money is there.

383
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:31,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, $100,000 just doesn't get there at the end of the year, and neither does $50,000 just get there during the year.

384
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:42,534
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I remember correctly, I believe this council some six months ago asked for an interim report as it related to department personnel and expenses, which is obviously you never got.

385
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:52,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Contrary to the issue on fire and ice, where the comment was made that you have to raise it on the tax recap, I believe with our approximately $9 million in free cash,

386
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,472
[SPEAKER_19]: Years in the past, we have paid deficits off with our free cash.

387
00:31:58,153 --> 00:32:01,814
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe you do have an option there without getting into your recap.

388
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:20,784
[SPEAKER_19]: And at the same time, I would seriously question another portion of this transfer of why are you transferring $100,000 from the Office of Community Development, which is supposed to be the brainchild of bringing new business into this community, development into this community, meeting with business owners in this community,

389
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:26,469
[SPEAKER_19]: and being the partner in the arm with the Chamber of Commerce, for which it doesn't seem to seem the light of day.

390
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:32,795
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Mr. President, I would suggest and I would hope that some member of the City Council would reflect upon that matter.

391
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:33,716
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

392
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:34,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

393
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address of the record, please.

394
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:40,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Andrew Castaneda, Cushman Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

395
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:45,987
[SPEAKER_18]: The previous speaker brought up a good point on the OCD, I believe it's Office of Community Development.

396
00:32:47,845 --> 00:32:51,407
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very important that we hire the best of the best, in my opinion.

397
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:55,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford, in general, is at a crossroads for development.

398
00:32:57,249 --> 00:33:10,515
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we need more help, or the cream of the cream, a Boston or a Somerville type of individual that knows, because Route 93 goes right through us since 1960.

399
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:14,757
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of development's been going on, especially on the east side.

400
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:19,628
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's time we come up with a better plan.

401
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:34,444
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we're going to develop, especially any housing that's going to generate real estate tax, as long as they're not tax exempt like Tufts University or a nonprofit 501c3, I don't mind if you're going to jam this in and

402
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:37,506
[SPEAKER_18]: and East Ford on the east side of the square.

403
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:58,812
[SPEAKER_18]: However, also that new growth real estate tax should be deducted from any ideas of prop 2.49% increase because if not, that new growth real estate tax does not help us who's been supporting the city for decades.

404
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:02,093
[SPEAKER_18]: As a matter of fact, it hurts us real big time.

405
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:14,160
[SPEAKER_18]: We need more teachers, more fire, more police, buildings, infrastructure, and not to mention, it's becoming overly congested.

406
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,121
[SPEAKER_18]: That is simply my opinion.

407
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:17,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for listening.

408
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:18,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

409
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:21,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

410
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:22,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

411
00:34:22,883 --> 00:34:25,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia, could I, just a quick question.

412
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:30,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So if those funds are not transferred, do the funds then go into free cash?

413
00:34:31,555 --> 00:34:32,175
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair.

414

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, they close into undesignated fund balance which does become free cash.

415
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:56,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, okay It could you and I couldn't hear you before you were talking about it council and I'd asked you about it that you had mentioned something about the tax recap and I missed that so if you could please repeat that again just so through the chair all of us and everyone at home watching absolutely to Councilor Falco the deficit has to be covered if it's not covered through a transfer Then I have to raise it on the tax recap as part of the tax rate.

416
00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:58,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay Thank you

[SPEAKER_07]: 17.

459
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:11,935
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, are we gonna go on to the budget or the Chamber of Commerce thing?

460
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:11,935
17.

461
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:24,582
[SPEAKER_07]: 554.

462
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:24,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Barney approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $250,000 for the following purposes.

463
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:30,774
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for the Medford Square beautification.

464
00:37:30,794 --> 00:37:33,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to read each one individually?

465
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:35,695
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want.

466
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:50,560
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for the Medford Square beautification would be for a public facade program, public art, benches and public shelter in the City Hall lot, decorative lighting, beautification of flowers and trees, other signage for Chevalier, historical assets, and parking lot locations.

467
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,021
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for Haines Square beautification for the

468
00:37:54,582 --> 00:38:04,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Building facade program, benches, public art, decorative lighting, beautification of flower trees, sparrows, softened plaza in front of Dempsey's.

469
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:16,134
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for West Medford Square beautification, public art, building facade program, decorative lighting, benches, beautification of flowers, other West Medford train station and banners.

470
00:38:16,154 --> 00:38:20,897
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for South Medford beautification, building facade program, public art.

471
00:38:24,255 --> 00:38:30,121
[SPEAKER_07]: flower pots, decorative lighting, bike racks, other trees, and bike racks.

472
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:41,571
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for the hillside, Boston Avenue beautification, public cot, benches, and a bus shelter, bike racks, decorative lighting, building facade program, and other hillside branding and trees.

473
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:42,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Neith.

474
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:49,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I move to postpone

475
00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:56,885
[SPEAKER_14]: the hearing of this matter until after a committee of the whole can be held for an explanation from the administration as to where this expense is going to go.

476
00:38:56,905 --> 00:39:06,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's been a number of concerns from the business community about that, and I think that it might make sense that we all sit down in the same room, Mr. President, and kind of figure out what's going on with these appropriations before we move forward in spending the money.

477
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:06,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

478
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:09,053
[SPEAKER_07]: On to the motion by Council A. Council Member Kern.

479
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:11,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Carviello.

480
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:16,758
[SPEAKER_16]: I too have received a number of phone calls with regards to business owners who have a lot of

481
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:23,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, a lot of people want to see these things happen, but there's a lot of safety concerns within our squares.

482
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of our squares are bigger than the others.

483
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:27,956
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of questions out there, and I think they need to be resolved.

484
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:30,597
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to make sure everybody has a seat at the table.

485
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:32,097
[SPEAKER_16]: We look at the surveys.

486
00:39:32,197 --> 00:39:42,901
[SPEAKER_16]: We talk to the business owners, and we sit down as a group and discuss exactly how to use this, if it is going to come from free cash or, I believe, that's another issue.

487
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:44,341
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was supposed to come from the budget.

488
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:49,355
[SPEAKER_16]: based on the parking enforcement contract, but that's a separate issue.

489
00:39:49,415 --> 00:39:58,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think we need, one way or another, money needs to be spent in the squares, and we need to do it the right way, and we need to make sure everybody's at the table before we do so.

490
00:39:58,181 --> 00:39:59,262
[SPEAKER_16]: So I second the motion.

491
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:03,425
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Langlois-Kern.

492
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:04,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dela Russo.

493
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:11,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I'm quite pleased to endorse this, and would like to see it acted on tonight.

494
00:40:12,153 --> 00:40:19,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I was part of a committee that conducted extensive surveys on location in each one of the aforementioned squares.

495
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:29,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Furthermore, Mr. President, we've had major follow-up meetings regarding Medford Square, and it's been preceded by meetings for over a decade.

496
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:41,392
[SPEAKER_08]: May I also point out that we've been handed survey results from the mayor's office, I believe, which I might add are hard to decipher,

497
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:52,683
[SPEAKER_08]: But however, based on what I've received from people over quite some time, I'm quite satisfied that there is a grasp on things.

498
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:54,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso.

499
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:54,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

500
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:56,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

501
00:40:57,647 --> 00:41:02,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I received a number of calls as well from residents and from members of the business community.

502
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the important thing is if we're going to do it, let's do it right.

503
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:09,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that I would agree that it should go to Committee of the Whole.

504
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:10,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We should talk about it.

505
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,901
[SPEAKER_03]: We should make sure that we're seeking a wide audience.

506
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:14,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's really get the input.

507
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:17,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure everyone has an opportunity to weigh in.

508
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:19,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure we're doing the right thing.

509
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:22,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But bottom line is, if we're going to do it, let's make sure we do it right.

510
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:26,144
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would support the resolution as well, that it goes to committee of the whole.

511
00:41:26,204 --> 00:41:26,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

512
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Mox.

513
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:30,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

514
00:41:30,485 --> 00:41:33,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And Councilor De La Ruz was exactly right.

515
00:41:34,446 --> 00:41:39,888
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor put together a business transition committee when she first became mayor.

516
00:41:40,610 --> 00:42:04,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And that committee did exhaustive work in reaching out to the business districts, having countless meetings, public forums, gathering input from the business community, from residents, and nothing was used, Mr. President, regarding this $250,000 beautification of our business districts.

517
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:09,979
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor came out with her own survey

518
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:31,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm quite surprised to see that in hearing concerns from business owners and residents in this community about a number of issues that public art in our business districts is at the top of the list, or the one and two at the top of the list, Mr. President.

519
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:39,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the questions that were asked in the survey, I don't see any questions regarding public safety.

520
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:52,070
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this money originally was intended because of the kiosks that were put in place that had a terrible, devastating impact on the businesses in our business district.

521
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:56,435
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a way to try to assist them,

522
00:42:57,155 --> 00:43:15,007
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mayor McGlynn at the time came up with an idea of allocating $250,000, 50,000 for each of the five business districts, that they can use this money towards public safety, public art, towards flower pots, decorative light, whatever they see fit, Mr. President.

523
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:22,392
[SPEAKER_05]: But from what I'm gathering from this survey, it's really limited, and I don't think that was the original intent.

524
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:24,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The second point, Mr. President, is

525
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:26,384
[SPEAKER_05]: We should not be looking at 250,000.

526
00:43:26,444 --> 00:43:33,887
[SPEAKER_05]: This is year two of this whole project of giving back to the business districts.

527
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:35,607
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of money should be 500,000.

528
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:38,548
[SPEAKER_05]: This is year two.

529
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:42,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be $100,000 for each business district.

530
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:49,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I know Mayor McGlynn had year one and Mayor Burke has year two, but this is still one city.

531
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:58,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And we owe that, when we have this committee meeting, committee of the whole, whatever, subcommittee meeting, that that issue be addressed, Mr. President.

532
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I didn't forget about year one, the commitment Mayor McGlynn gave.

533
00:44:02,884 --> 00:44:09,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time, Mayor McGlynn said he was gonna pay through the revenues generated from the ticketing in the city.

534
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,701
[SPEAKER_05]: through Park Method.

535
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:15,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mayor Burke came up with her revenue source using free cash.

536
00:44:16,584 --> 00:44:29,114
[SPEAKER_05]: But this, so far, is a two-year program, and I'm very concerned, Mr. President, that this particular survey that was done doesn't represent the needs that we have in the business district.

537
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:33,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you firsthand that the Salem Street parking lot located

538
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,420
[SPEAKER_05]: across the street here on Salem Street.

539
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a business parking lot.

540
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:44,585
[SPEAKER_05]: At night, if you go there 7.30, 8 o'clock at night, it's pitch dark in that lot.

541
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:47,267
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see your hand in front of your face.

542
00:44:48,725 --> 00:44:49,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's no exaggeration.

543
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:52,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pitch dark and it's a business lot.

544
00:44:52,848 --> 00:45:03,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess there was an estimated cost to put lighting in there at 30,000 by some organization, but I think it could be done cheaper, Mr. President.

545
00:45:04,175 --> 00:45:07,757
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are a number of public safety issues, I think, that need to be addressed.

546
00:45:08,397 --> 00:45:12,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask that, and one other point, Mr. President, if I could.

547
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,303
[SPEAKER_05]: The survey that went out

548
00:45:18,856 --> 00:45:20,937
[SPEAKER_05]: said business district beautification project.

549
00:45:21,437 --> 00:45:36,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it went on to give a narrative about 250,000, and then at the bottom it said, once the information is gathered, and I assume that's through this survey, projects specific to each business district will be identified.

550
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Now does anyone see projects through this survey for each business district that are identified?

551
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:47,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And the allocation of projects will be reviewed by the city council.

552
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:49,606
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we reviewing here?

553
00:45:50,306 --> 00:45:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: We're reviewing this?

554
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:52,748
[SPEAKER_05]: This chart here?

555
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:54,970
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we reviewing?

556
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is the mayor asking us for 250,000 now?

557
00:45:59,993 --> 00:46:08,779
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't been given any, according to the mayor's own distribution, any specific projects for any of the different businesses.

558
00:46:10,841 --> 00:46:17,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not quite sure, Mr. President, why this was presented to us in this fashion after two years

559
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:30,840
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not two weeks, two months, two years of working on this that we get a half-hearted survey that doesn't represent the businesses or the community, and no particular projects.

560
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:40,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Something Councilor DelaRusso worked on diligently and had all those meetings, and now one of their recommendations is in this report.

561
00:46:40,604 --> 00:46:44,486
[SPEAKER_05]: You wasted your time, Councilor DelaRusso.

562
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:47,307
[SPEAKER_05]: All that time spent, you wasted it.

563
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:52,385
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a survey done.

564
00:46:52,685 --> 00:47:06,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish to point out that I do not feel my time has been wasted and I would also take this opportunity to point out and thank what would seem to the untrained ear the accolades I've received from Councilor Marks.

565
00:47:07,237 --> 00:47:07,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

566
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:12,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where the information came in that point, but that's, that's quite all right.

567
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:14,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so Mr. President,

568
00:47:15,937 --> 00:47:36,548
[SPEAKER_05]: and I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing this up, but based on that, Mr. President, based on the fact that this was hastily given to us with no clear direction, Mr. President, no specific projects, and fall short of the mark of funding, which should be 500,000 for two years, not 250,000 for one year.

569
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:42,531
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the mayors want to be close-knit, the mayors, when the transition happens and so forth,

570
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:46,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Honor what Mayor McGlynn put forward to the businesses.

571
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:49,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Honor the 250 Mayor McGlynn put forward.

572
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

573
00:47:54,858 --> 00:47:55,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

574
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I just want to be clear that the motion's understood.

575
00:47:58,782 --> 00:48:03,668
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion is to lay the paper on the table until such time as the Committee of the Whole can be held.

576
00:48:08,324 --> 00:48:09,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

577
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:10,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Mr. President.

578
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:28,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I too received a number of phone calls from concerned business owners and citizens and I think that when Councilman Knight's recommendation of going to subcommittee or committee of the whole, whichever we decide, I think this council has gone

579
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:40,386
[SPEAKER_02]: in subcommittee for a number of very big issues, and we've worked together with all the stakeholders to make sure we find a plan that works for everybody affected.

580
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:57,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I understand all of our concerns, and I think this administration has presented something to us that we can now bring to a consensus with different stakeholders and then try to find

581
00:48:57,755 --> 00:48:59,636
[SPEAKER_02]: what is best for our community as a whole.

582
00:48:59,676 --> 00:49:10,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would concur with our Councilor Knight's recommendation to move this forward to subcommittee or committee as a whole.

583
00:49:10,419 --> 00:49:10,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

584
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:11,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

585
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record please.

586
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this ward.

587
00:49:17,062 --> 00:49:26,505
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm glad to see this on the agenda this week because apparently last week when I introduced this before the council as to where this money went, apparently the mayor's office felt necessary to respond to it.

588
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:35,862
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's go back with a little bit of history here on October 7th, 2014, when the mayor had the press release indicating that the contract had been signed.

589
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:47,286
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a result of what took place in September 20th of 2014, with a meeting with the business community and of their concerns at that particular point in time, the mayor made an addendum.

590
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:49,847
[SPEAKER_19]: He made an addendum to the contract that was signed.

591
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:54,808
[SPEAKER_19]: And he stated, after deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community,

592
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:58,962
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor is recommending the following changes to the signed contract.

593
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:13,993
[SPEAKER_19]: In one of the signed contracts, it was point number three, it says, I recommend $250,000 on the revenue generated on a yearly, on a yearly basis to be deducted, dedicated, excuse me, to the business district improvements.

594
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:16,675
[SPEAKER_19]: That was his first comment as it relates to that.

595
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:19,077
[SPEAKER_19]: Then on December 23rd, 2014, then budget director Burke,

596
00:50:23,074 --> 00:50:29,196
[SPEAKER_19]: speaking on behalf of the mayor, issued a press release indicating press highlights of the contract that was signed.

597
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:38,679
[SPEAKER_19]: And once again, she states in her press highlights that $250,000 annually will be subject to appropriations to the district improvements.

598
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:42,161
[SPEAKER_19]: We know that there are five districts, Mr. President, as you know.

599
00:50:42,941 --> 00:50:44,601
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we continue on to December 18th of 2015.

600
00:50:47,170 --> 00:51:03,554
[SPEAKER_19]: You went from December of 2014, and now you're going to December of 2015, for which the mayor, on his comment to the Medford City Council on December 18th, stated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate the sum of $250,000 for the purposes of

601
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:09,902
[SPEAKER_19]: the five districts regarding to the Park Medford.

602
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:14,325
[SPEAKER_19]: This memorandum is a result of what took place during the past year.

603
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:21,189
[SPEAKER_19]: So you have one full year, which is 2015, as Councilmember Mox has alluded to, if we go on an annual basis.

604
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,911
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we go to January 28th of 2016.

605
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:33,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, then Budget Director Burke is the mayor, and this is her comment as it relates to us being the mayor.

606
00:51:33,315 --> 00:51:34,396
[SPEAKER_19]: She states the following.

607
00:51:35,354 --> 00:51:43,956
[SPEAKER_19]: After signing a 10-year contract for the program, McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements in the business district.

608
00:51:44,557 --> 00:51:47,017
[SPEAKER_19]: The prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said.

609
00:51:47,517 --> 00:51:54,179
[SPEAKER_19]: When we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be above and beyond the fixed amount that we collected.

610
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:58,800
[SPEAKER_19]: I certainly think that the district needs enhancements, Burke continued.

611
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:03,962
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll be working for them to determine what type of monies they need going forward.

612
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:09,191
[SPEAKER_19]: You have commitments from the prior Mayor McGlynn to the present Mayor Burke.

613
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:14,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Now if you wanna take on fiscal years 15 and go from January to December, you're into two years.

614
00:52:15,188 --> 00:52:22,171
[SPEAKER_19]: If you wanna go into fiscal years June to July, I mean June to July, yeah, June to July, you're into two fiscal years.

615
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:29,414
[SPEAKER_19]: So no matter how you cut it, it's $100,000 that should be going back to the districts, not 250 or 50,000 each.

616
00:52:29,995 --> 00:52:38,499
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that is a real big concern because with $100,000 and you're going into the third year right now, you're gonna be looking at either next June

617
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:41,120
[SPEAKER_19]: or next December as being into the third year.

618
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,703
[SPEAKER_19]: So to make the discussion on what the needs might be is one thing.

619
00:52:46,023 --> 00:52:53,027
[SPEAKER_19]: But the real cash that should be going back to these departments, strike that, to these districts within the city, that's where it should be at.

620
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:54,547
[SPEAKER_19]: This isn't me making it up.

621
00:52:54,848 --> 00:53:01,771
[SPEAKER_19]: This is all part of the official documents that make up this, plus another packet of internal documents that basically reflect upon the same.

622
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:06,434
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you doubt what I'm saying, go back and check your own records and check the meetings that took place

623
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:13,297
[SPEAKER_19]: between the Medford City Council and the business districts that came down there who were upset because they were not involved in the beginning.

624
00:53:13,637 --> 00:53:23,843
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why Mayor McGlynn at the time changed it in September of 2014 when he signed the contract in October of 2014 to include that on an annual basis.

625
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

626
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:25,723
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

627
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:34,568
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Knight as seconded by Councilor Longo Kern to move this to a committee of the whole meeting.

628
00:53:35,389 --> 00:53:36,810
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

629
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,372
[SPEAKER_07]: As we table the motion, all those in favor?

630
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:40,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

631
00:53:40,873 --> 00:53:42,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

632
00:53:45,215 --> 00:53:47,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Table the paper until after the committee of the whole.

633
00:53:48,117 --> 00:53:48,237
Yes.

634
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:48,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

635
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:48,838
17.

636
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:57,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been tabled.

637
00:53:59,785 --> 00:54:01,946
[SPEAKER_07]: We will let you know when the committee of the whole meeting will be.

638
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,672
[SPEAKER_07]: after the Committee of Homeland.

639
00:54:08,013 --> 00:54:10,915
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get a date in the next week or so.

640
00:54:11,756 --> 00:54:13,377
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get a date and give it to you.

641
00:54:15,279 --> 00:54:15,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

642
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I will let you know when the date is.

643
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,003
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get together everybody and see if we can get a date that's comfortable for everybody.

644
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:22,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

645
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:30,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if anybody wants to be notified, if they can leave their email address with the city messenger, maybe we can send out a notice to those people that are here today that wanted to

646
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:35,595
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll learn more about the topic and we can inform them when the meeting is via email if they leave a letter to the messenger.

647
00:54:47,507 --> 00:54:53,991
[SPEAKER_02]: when this body tables or sends something to the subcommittee, we act on this relatively quickly.

648
00:54:54,251 --> 00:54:56,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't something that's gonna wait a month or two months.

649
00:54:56,612 --> 00:55:02,195
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something we'll get dates together that we can work together with all the stakeholders and move this forward relatively quickly.

650
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:05,337
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's my hope and I believe that's the rest of the council's hope.

651
00:55:05,377 --> 00:55:13,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the date, hopefully we can sit together tonight and have something out by tomorrow with the council.

652
00:55:13,882 --> 00:55:15,003
[SPEAKER_07]: The summer holidays coming up,

653
00:55:15,769 --> 00:55:16,349
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to be away.

654
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,332
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try to reach an agreement with when everyone's going to be gone.

655
00:55:19,352 --> 00:55:20,093
[SPEAKER_07]: The sooner the better, actually.

656
00:55:20,113 --> 00:55:20,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Sooner than later.

657
00:55:20,593 --> 00:55:23,255
[SPEAKER_07]: You just want to know the date, right?

658
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:24,416
[SPEAKER_07]: We will notify you of the date.

659
00:55:24,456 --> 00:55:25,157
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll give you the date.

660
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,978
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a personal matter.

661
00:55:26,998 --> 00:55:27,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Council night.

662
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:33,724
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd recommend having a committee of the whole before the July meeting on July 18th, if that makes everybody happy.

663
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:34,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll try to do it before the next council.

664
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:35,745
[SPEAKER_14]: We can schedule it for July 18th.

665
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:40,009
[SPEAKER_14]: This committee of the whole, provided that representatives from the administration can be there.

666
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,631
[SPEAKER_14]: We can go off that night before our council meeting.

667
00:55:42,955 --> 00:55:47,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would be the objective, do it before the council meeting, the next council meeting.

668
00:55:47,998 --> 00:55:49,158
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we will let you know.

669
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:53,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

670
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:53,161
17, 512.

671
00:55:57,863 --> 00:56:01,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President, Councillors, I submit herewith

672
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:15,606
[SPEAKER_14]: For your approval, the fiscal 18... Oh, we have to take up the table, Councilor.

673
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:17,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

674
00:56:18,147 --> 00:56:20,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to take this paper off the table.

675
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:23,568
[SPEAKER_07]: All in favor?

676
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:25,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

677
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:28,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Knight to have a brief synopsis

678
00:56:32,277 --> 00:56:32,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

679
00:56:38,302 --> 00:56:51,011
[SPEAKER_12]: President Rick Caviello, Honorable Members of City Council, and the citizens of Medford, I will now submit Mayor Burke's budget for FY 2018 for a total amount of $167,117,437, which represents a roughly $5 million increase over last year's budget.

680
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:05,313
[SPEAKER_12]: which is a 3% increase.

681
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:19,105
[SPEAKER_12]: 1% of this increase can be attributed to increase in fixed costs, such as health insurance, pension, debt, trash and waste disposal, and water and sewer assessments by the MWRA.

682
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:24,869
[SPEAKER_12]: If these fixed costs were excluded, the increase would only be a little over 2%.

683
00:57:27,175 --> 00:57:33,939
[SPEAKER_12]: The question now is how does this 2% increase translate into additional services for the citizens of Medford?

684
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:39,221
[SPEAKER_12]: I will now briefly go into the additional services which will be part of this budget.

685
00:57:40,622 --> 00:57:49,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor Burke's administration has created a new full-time year-round recreation department that will provide an assortment of recreation services and events for the families of Medford.

697
00:59:13,544 --> 00:59:21,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, I just want to say that creating a budget is a complex exercise, which requires a lot of coordination with many individuals.

698
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,231
[SPEAKER_12]: This was definitely a team effort.

699
00:59:24,912 --> 00:59:40,865

710
01:00:32,979 --> 01:00:37,981

713

718
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:11,909

723
01:01:39,386 --> 01:01:42,767
[SPEAKER_04]: We're adding, our class size is really very good.

724
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:46,209
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no class in the elementary schools above 22.

725
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:48,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, they're all below 22.

726
01:01:49,045 --> 01:01:55,836
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who are interested, we added a fifth, fourth grade at the Roberts through interest that people had.

727
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:00,544
[SPEAKER_04]: We...

728
01:02:05,197 --> 01:02:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: are adding additional money into the maintenance account so that every school will have additional dollars for that.

729
01:02:10,299 --> 01:02:25,945
[SPEAKER_04]: There's $200,000 of additional maintenance money with each school getting a grant, direct grant of $20,000 in addition to general maintenance costs that we will carry through the central office that will allow them to attack certain issues that they feel are important to them.

730
01:02:26,746 --> 01:02:31,768
[SPEAKER_04]: The middle schools and the high school will get additional dollars for student activity stipends.

731
01:02:31,808 --> 01:02:34,449
[SPEAKER_04]: The special education program will need some additional money

732
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:37,694
[SPEAKER_04]: tuition and transportation, but that's covered.

733
01:02:40,516 --> 01:02:50,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think that we were able to reduce enrollment at Minuteman, which saves hundreds of thousands of dollars and increase our additional revenue from that area.

734
01:02:51,024 --> 01:02:54,087
[SPEAKER_04]: The social studies program will continue to textbook replacement in U.S.

735
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:54,507

737
01:03:01,242 --> 01:03:03,563
[SPEAKER_04]: additional textbooks to the high school math program.

738
01:03:03,943 --> 01:03:13,166
[SPEAKER_04]: The science department is gonna receive $30,000 additional for science materials for the elementary school program while they pilot additional textbooks at that level.

739
01:03:13,646 --> 01:03:19,508
[SPEAKER_04]: The foreign language department will acquire a new teacher from middle school to ensure that all students can take Spanish and Italian if they want.

740
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:22,630
[SPEAKER_04]: The fine arts program has a new director in Tony Sickney.

741
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,391
[SPEAKER_04]: As he assumes his role, we'll add 1.2 teachers to that program.

742
01:03:26,911 --> 01:03:29,392
[SPEAKER_04]: The PE and health department will receive a new teacher.

743
01:03:29,815 --> 01:03:33,817
[SPEAKER_04]: which will be transferred over from one of the programs to help with the Michigan model.

744
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:38,678
[SPEAKER_04]: The library media program continues to add programs and services.

745
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:44,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Every library in the schools will now be covered, either by paraprofessionals or professional libraries.

746
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:47,402
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a new director of technology, Molly Layden.

747
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:58,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will be adding additional dollars to our online learning programs that we have now added a program called Edumentum this year.

748
01:03:58,756 --> 01:04:04,137
[SPEAKER_04]: which helps with credit recovery, helps junctures take additional courses which they couldn't possibly take in this schedule.

749
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's been a very good budget.

750
01:04:06,558 --> 01:04:11,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to thank my staff, all the people that are working with us for the work that they do.

751
01:04:11,779 --> 01:04:18,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we are in good shape and we'll finish this year in the black strongly and we'll also go into next year with a solid budget.

752
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Belson.

753
01:04:22,181 --> 01:04:22,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Knight.

754
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:28,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Belson, do you feel as though based upon the budget that's been approved and appropriated by the school committee

755
01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:34,016
[SPEAKER_14]: for a request for appropriation from the city council that you can meet all of the state and federal mandates and requirements that have been set forth?

756
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:34,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

757
01:04:34,936 --> 01:04:35,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

758
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further questions for the superintendent?

759
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:46,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

760
01:04:46,543 --> 01:04:50,505
[SPEAKER_14]: And can you tell me, the vote looks like it took place on June 19th?

761
01:04:50,525 --> 01:04:51,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry?

762
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:54,047
[SPEAKER_14]: The budget vote for the school committee looked like it took place on June 19th?

763
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:54,167
[SPEAKER_14]: 21st.

764
01:04:54,247 --> 01:04:54,327
[SPEAKER_14]: 21st.

765
01:04:54,347 --> 01:04:55,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you tell me what that vote was?

766
01:04:57,918 --> 01:04:58,138
[SPEAKER_04]: 7-0.

767
01:04:58,158 --> 01:04:59,219
[SPEAKER_14]: 7-0, unanimous.

768
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:00,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

769
01:05:03,243 --> 01:05:04,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor DelaRusso.

770
01:05:04,564 --> 01:05:06,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Move approval on the budget, Mr. President.

771
01:05:06,746 --> 01:05:10,549
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, Vice President Box.

772
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:12,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

773
01:05:12,611 --> 01:05:20,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question for the superintendent, and I think he probably knows what I'm gonna ask, but I'm gonna ask it anyways, Mr. Superintendent.

774
01:05:20,998 --> 01:05:21,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

775
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:25,722
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue is not new, it's something that I've brought up the past

776
01:05:26,347 --> 01:05:31,790
[SPEAKER_05]: three years during budget deliberation, and it's regarding security at the high school.

777
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:42,054
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had some discussion, at some points it's been heated discussion, but nonetheless, I think it's discussion that needs to be had.

778
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:54,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you can agree that it's an issue that needs to be reviewed, because you've told me that each of the last three years, that this is an issue that definitely needs to be reviewed.

779
01:05:54,933 --> 01:06:04,319
[SPEAKER_05]: So according to the budget, Mr. Superintendent, it states that I guess there's nine security offices school-wide, is that correct?

780
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's correct, I didn't look at the number.

781
01:06:06,781 --> 01:06:13,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, nine, and for the most part, they're working six and a half to seven hours?

782
01:06:13,305 --> 01:06:13,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

783
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:14,966
[SPEAKER_05]: On a daily basis.

784
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:20,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And the issue I brought up was regarding, in particular, the high school.

785
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to me that all security

786
01:06:24,768 --> 01:06:33,634
[SPEAKER_05]: that we have are on between the hours of, let's say, 8 and 3, give or take, right around that time.

787
01:06:34,695 --> 01:06:43,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you know, there are many after-school programs, many functions, both athletic and academic, being held at the high school after 3 p.m.

788
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:49,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is not one security officer that's left within the building.

789
01:06:50,485 --> 01:06:52,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked if we could

790
01:06:53,414 --> 01:07:18,209
[SPEAKER_05]: actually take maybe one of the security guards that are on the shift, the eight to three shift, that seems to be all the security guards on that particular shift, and maybe stagger them so we can have security there when our students, when our employees, when our faculty are there on hours that maybe school code is not in session formally.

791
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:30,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's a legitimate request in this day and age, and a building of that size is the largest city-owned building in the community with many, many different entrances.

792
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:36,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to tell you, Mr. Superintendent, and many different organizations using that particular building.

793
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:46,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I would respectfully ask that you and the school committee, because I know decisions are made through you and the school committee, reconsider

794
01:07:47,203 --> 01:07:59,947
[SPEAKER_05]: the staggering of security officers so that we have security personnel, and I know in the past you've mentioned that we have faculty that may be in the building after three, and they're a set of eyes and ears, and I can appreciate that.

795
01:08:00,487 --> 01:08:03,748
[SPEAKER_05]: You said we have maybe custodians there, and they're a set of eyes and ears.

796
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:09,550
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they are not trained security, and that is not their role, their function, or their purpose.

797
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:16,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would respectfully ask, Mr. Superintendent, that in such a giant budget,

798
01:08:17,242 --> 01:08:24,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And one that I can quite emphatically state has a lot of good things in it this year.

799
01:08:25,706 --> 01:08:29,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, I can't find any particular fault with the budget.

800
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:32,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Class size seems to be working throughout the city.

801
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:37,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be a fair allocation between the arts and music.

802
01:08:38,251 --> 01:08:40,332
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have no problem with the school budget.

803
01:08:40,752 --> 01:08:44,994
[SPEAKER_05]: The one problem I do have, and I've been consistent with this, is security, and I was just wondering

804
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if you can address that issue, Mr. Superintendent.

805
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:49,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate what you're saying.

806
01:08:49,711 --> 01:08:51,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have talked about this.

807
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:53,732
[SPEAKER_04]: We continuously review security issues.

808
01:08:54,893 --> 01:08:58,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have security during the day and we think that we've enhanced that quite a bit.

809
01:08:58,474 --> 01:09:06,116
[SPEAKER_04]: We added a Raptor system, as you know, to have a professional ID system of anyone entering the buildings during the school day.

810
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:10,117
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a resource officer assigned to us at the high school.

811
01:09:10,177 --> 01:09:13,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We have resource officers assigned to us throughout the city through the police department.

812
01:09:14,535 --> 01:09:18,716
[SPEAKER_04]: which helps with that as well.

813
01:09:18,756 --> 01:09:21,017
[SPEAKER_04]: The building is 550,000 square feet.

814
01:09:21,877 --> 01:09:26,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And a single individual moving around, I don't believe, is a particularly effective tool.

815
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:38,782
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of adult personnel there, custodians, cleaning crew, coaches, advisors, teachers, and others, all of whom have been equipped with communication devices from time to time.

816
01:09:38,802 --> 01:09:40,662
[SPEAKER_04]: They can call 911 very quickly.

817
01:09:41,383 --> 01:09:42,903
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I understand what you're asking.

818
01:09:43,595 --> 01:09:49,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the spirit of trying to come to some sort of agreement, let me bring it to the attention of the school committee.

819
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:58,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the school committee believes that we should add a person who is in that particular assignment, then we'll bring that up.

820
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:03,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will actively bring it to their attention and we'll talk about that and give you a report.

821
01:10:04,668 --> 01:10:08,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a reasonable compromise given the fact that we've gone back and forth on this for a few years.

822
01:10:09,692 --> 01:10:14,174
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely is a reasonable compromise, and I look forward to your report on that, Mr. Superintendent.

823
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:14,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do that.

824
01:10:15,234 --> 01:10:16,114
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate that.

825
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:20,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I do have a few questions on the budget itself.

826
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,017
[SPEAKER_07]: To Mr. Nelson?

827
01:10:24,377 --> 01:10:27,498
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, in general, the budget itself.

828
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:37,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, we spent countless hours, and there was, in my opinion, a number of good

829
01:10:38,328 --> 01:10:51,218
[SPEAKER_05]: proposals put in this budget from the new traffic engineer, which I know Councilor Falco has been talking about since he's been on the council and members of this council have been discussing for a long period of time.

830
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,503
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of things regarding the police department

831
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:05,025
[SPEAKER_05]: crime analysis analyst that's gonna be added, which we were looking for last year but got added in this year.

832
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:25,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Information technology, which if you attended any of the public safety meetings throughout the community, you'll know that residents are looking for information firsthand and being able to access this information pretty quickly on crime statistics and what's actually happening in their community or in their neighborhood.

833
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:27,322
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we can accomplish that through this

834
01:11:27,952 --> 01:11:33,273
[SPEAKER_05]: crime analyst and the information technology position that's going to happen.

835
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:36,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very pleased with that, Mr. President.

836
01:11:37,054 --> 01:11:50,737
[SPEAKER_05]: A few things that I am displeased about is I offered a resolution, I believe it was about three, four weeks back, and it was regarding the condition of our roads in the community.

837
01:11:51,457 --> 01:11:55,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can unequivocally state that it's probably

838
01:11:56,068 --> 01:12:03,292
[SPEAKER_05]: The number one and number two concern that I receive from residents in this community is the poor condition of our streets.

839
01:12:03,873 --> 01:12:06,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did some research and homework.

840
01:12:06,194 --> 01:12:12,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I went up to the engineering department and talked to staff up there and did a little research.

841
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:19,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did find out, Mr. President, that we put in roughly about $940,000 towards

842
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:26,244
[SPEAKER_05]: repaving of streets in our community.

843
01:12:26,944 --> 01:12:31,328
[SPEAKER_05]: We get back 100% of that through Chapter 90 money.

844
01:12:33,089 --> 01:12:42,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also get an allocation from the Office of Community Development, roughly $150,000, $200,000 a year for repaving of roads.

845
01:12:43,397 --> 01:12:47,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I mentioned a few weeks back, at the current rate we're going,

846
01:12:48,779 --> 01:13:03,610
[SPEAKER_05]: based on what we're putting into repaving our streets, that we have 91 miles of road in this community, and we're roughly repaving, not entire streets, but partial streets or full streets, roughly five to six a year.

847
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:09,353
[SPEAKER_05]: and we have a total of 730 streets in this community.

848
01:13:09,813 --> 01:13:24,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on the fact that these streets are only lasting now maybe 15 to 20 years if you're lucky, you can see how we're never gonna get ahead of the game in the allocation that we're using right now to repave our roads.

849
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:33,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time it was supported by this council and recommended that the mayor put a budget line item, which there is currently no budget line item to repave

850
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:37,036
[SPEAKER_05]: roads in our streets, in our community.

851
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:49,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was hoping that, I requested a million dollars, and I was hoping that at least the mayor in good faith would recognize the need in this community and would put something towards a line item.

852
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:57,882
[SPEAKER_05]: But needless to say, Mr. President, that never amounted in the budget and never came to fruition.

853
01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:02,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is one of the major concerns I have as a member of the council

854
01:14:03,788 --> 01:14:05,250
[SPEAKER_05]: um, the condition of our roads.

855
01:14:05,891 --> 01:14:18,484
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, that is one issue, Mr. President, that I'm hoping, uh, that the mayor will, uh, hear this loud and clear that, um, you know, when you have 950,000 or 980,000, the city puts forward

856
01:14:22,867 --> 01:14:34,514
[SPEAKER_05]: and then gets 100% of that back, so we get reimbursed 100%, then we have the $980,000 back, we should be reinvesting that $980,000 into roads.

857
01:14:36,195 --> 01:14:37,336
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that's a no-brainer.

858
01:14:37,636 --> 01:14:39,938
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be a reinvestment right back into our roads.

859
01:14:40,358 --> 01:14:43,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, we're not using it for that purpose, Mr. President.

860
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:51,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hope the mayor hears this loud and clear based on the information that I brought forward

861
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:59,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that our current way of doing business in the community is we're always going to be chasing our tail.

862
01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:01,375
[SPEAKER_05]: We're never going to get ahead on our streets.

863
01:15:01,775 --> 01:15:04,876
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always, every year, going to be facing, you know what?

864
01:15:04,896 --> 01:15:05,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all these potholes.

865
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the curbs.

866
01:15:07,037 --> 01:15:08,398
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't match the street.

867
01:15:08,438 --> 01:15:10,439
[SPEAKER_05]: The curbs are the same level as the street.

868
01:15:10,725 --> 01:15:12,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the manhole covers, they're sinking.

869
01:15:12,687 --> 01:15:15,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the catch basins, they're all sinking in the community.

870
01:15:16,089 --> 01:15:22,875
[SPEAKER_05]: This money, Mr. President, can be used, Chapter 90 money, can be used for, according to our city engineer.

871
01:15:24,096 --> 01:15:27,198
[SPEAKER_07]: In the back, can we cut the talking down to some of the speaking?

872
01:15:28,219 --> 01:15:29,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, Councilman.

873
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:29,680
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

874
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:37,086
[SPEAKER_05]: This money could be used, Mr. President, not only for repaving a street, it's also used for sidewalks,

875
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:45,501
[SPEAKER_05]: handicap accessibility, maintenance on the water and sewer, so if it's a manhole cover or a catch basin, that Chapter 90 money can be used for that.

876
01:15:46,362 --> 01:15:56,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're falling short of the mark in a city this size, six, seven square miles with 91 miles of road and fixing our roads.

877
01:15:57,083 --> 01:16:06,205
[SPEAKER_05]: And it may seem like a minor thing, but it's a major thing for traffic in this community, for pedestrian safety, and for our residents.

878
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:10,762
[SPEAKER_05]: that have to traverse these streets that are littered and lined with potholes.

879
01:16:11,102 --> 01:16:15,984
[SPEAKER_05]: We know we have streets in the community that we've discussed six decades.

880
01:16:17,624 --> 01:16:19,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Six decades never repaved.

881
01:16:20,965 --> 01:16:25,747
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think a street looks like after six decades of a New England weather?

882
01:16:26,307 --> 01:16:29,628
[SPEAKER_05]: New England snow, plowing, salt, everything else.

883
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:31,769
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think the street looks like?

884
01:16:32,549 --> 01:16:35,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know what it looks like, because we all went down to some of these streets.

885
01:16:36,838 --> 01:16:40,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. President, you know what, I will support the budget this year.

886
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:49,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year I voted against the budget for a number of reasons that I was unhappy with, of which some of those reasons found their way in the budget this year.

887
01:16:50,002 --> 01:16:54,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is one other issue that I would like to mention.

888
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:59,365
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this council back, I believe it was two or three years ago,

889
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:08,943
[SPEAKER_05]: that offered a resolution, it was actually my resolution, requesting that a line item be placed in the budget for arts in the community.

890
01:17:09,444 --> 01:17:16,326
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first time, it was supported unanimously by this council, it was the first time ever we had a line item for arts in the community.

891
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:20,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very proud of that, and at the time Mayor McGlynn I think funded it,

892
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:31,293
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe 15,000, and we made a promise to the art community at the time, because the state, when they start making their cuts, which they're doing now, the arts is the first to get cut.

893
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:35,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always stated, that's our biggest bang for our buck.

894
01:17:35,895 --> 01:17:43,539
[SPEAKER_05]: When you see 15 to $30,000, it goes to thousands of children and programs within this community that keep this city functioning.

895
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:50,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And the following year, I think it was Mayor McGlynn or Mayor Burke, it might have been Mayor McGlynn,

896
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:54,094
[SPEAKER_05]: we requested as the council that we double it to 30,000.

897
01:17:54,254 --> 01:18:08,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And not just giving money away, the arts council came to us and said, this is what the programming went for, this is how the outreach went, this is how many people we touched in the community, these are the projects, and I thought it was a home run, Mr. President.

898
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:17,570
[SPEAKER_05]: This year I asked her the budget deliberation, if we can look at adding to the 30,000, and I didn't get any support from the administration again.

899
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:21,012
[SPEAKER_05]: However, as far as I know, the arts funding,

900
01:18:21,696 --> 01:18:29,422
[SPEAKER_05]: and I stand to be corrected on this, has been slashed by at least 45%, their budget, Mr. President, from state and federal funding.

901
01:18:29,783 --> 01:18:30,823
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been slashed by at least 45%.

902
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:38,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So they count on our measly 15 or $30,000 to run all these different events.

903
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:47,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone likes to go out to circle the square and the river at the Hatch Shell and all these other events they run, and funding has to come somewhere.

904
01:18:48,778 --> 01:18:51,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was happy we stepped up to the plate

905
01:18:51,443 --> 01:18:59,066
[SPEAKER_05]: but I am disappointed this year, Mr. President, that we couldn't find additional money to support the arts movement in our community.

906
01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:11,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on those few things, Mr. President, I'm hoping next year will be a different case from the streets and from the arts, and I will move approval on this budget, Mr. President.

907
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:12,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

908
01:19:12,691 --> 01:19:14,591
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso.

909
01:19:15,572 --> 01:19:15,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

910
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:20,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

911
01:19:20,953 --> 01:19:22,814
[SPEAKER_17]: John Sterello, 20 Metcalf Street.

912
01:19:23,415 --> 01:19:35,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, if other councillors want to speak on the budget, by the way, Councillor De La Russa's motion was on the school budget, not on the city, total city budget.

913
01:19:37,442 --> 01:19:38,022
[SPEAKER_17]: City budget.

914
01:19:38,082 --> 01:19:38,942
[SPEAKER_17]: City budget.

915
01:19:38,962 --> 01:19:42,184
[SPEAKER_17]: So that motion does not affect what's on the floor right now.

916
01:19:42,204 --> 01:19:48,047
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I did want to say is that following the protocol, if there are other councillors who want to speak,

917
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,201
[SPEAKER_17]: on the total city budget before I do.

918
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,621
[SPEAKER_07]: There are councilors who do want to speak before you do.

919
01:19:54,641 --> 01:19:54,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

920
01:19:54,721 --> 01:19:55,782
[SPEAKER_17]: But they're giving you the floor.

921
01:19:57,062 --> 01:19:58,162
[SPEAKER_17]: But they're giving me the floor now?

922
01:19:58,182 --> 01:19:58,962
[SPEAKER_17]: They're giving you the floor.

923
01:19:59,123 --> 01:19:59,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that.

924
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:00,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

925
01:20:00,503 --> 01:20:03,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I want to thank you, Mr. President.

926
01:20:04,244 --> 01:20:10,425
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, I want to thank the whole city council, whom I consider my friends and neighbors.

927
01:20:11,426 --> 01:20:17,547
[SPEAKER_17]: I want my relationship to the council to be the same as the council's relationship to the people.

928
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:21,609
[SPEAKER_17]: and that is one of support and service.

929
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:34,154
[SPEAKER_17]: First, I want to express my appreciation to the city council for its many days of attendance at the review of the 2018 budget as presented by our mayor.

930
01:20:35,515 --> 01:20:44,039
[SPEAKER_17]: The council listened to all the department heads and asked questions about details in the budget, and you are well informed.

931
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:47,140
[SPEAKER_17]: The council takes an oath to support

932
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:50,537
[SPEAKER_17]: and defend the Massachusetts Constitution.

933
01:20:51,278 --> 01:20:58,023
[SPEAKER_17]: And our Constitution is there to serve the people and the city, which I know our councilors love.

934
01:20:59,224 --> 01:21:03,507
[SPEAKER_17]: The city council is not elected to serve the mayor.

935
01:21:05,148 --> 01:21:12,194
[SPEAKER_17]: There are about 37 items in the budget whose costs can be reduced by a simple majority vote of the council.

936
01:21:12,995 --> 01:21:17,298
[SPEAKER_17]: However, the council is not allowed to increase the budget

937
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:21,349
[SPEAKER_17]: That is how we get checks and balances.

938
01:21:22,349 --> 01:21:29,270
[SPEAKER_17]: The council is empowered to check the mayor if it thinks there are excesses in the budget.

939
01:21:33,771 --> 01:21:40,473
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the council is aware of all this, but I say it in order to inform the television audience.

940
01:21:42,415 --> 01:21:46,798
[SPEAKER_17]: The 2018 budget amounts to $167 million.

941
01:21:46,978 --> 01:21:52,882
[SPEAKER_17]: That is $5 million more than last year's budget of $162 million.

942
01:21:53,643 --> 01:22:10,855
[SPEAKER_17]: If the city council passes this budget, it is voting today, right now, to raise taxes on all the people of Medford, including senior citizens, fixed income residents, and minimum wage earners.

943
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:18,487
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think the council wants to do that, but that is what will happen if this budget is passed.

944
01:22:19,427 --> 01:22:27,251
[SPEAKER_17]: That tax increase amounts to four to $500 more for each taxpayer.

945
01:22:27,271 --> 01:22:30,292
[SPEAKER_17]: $400 is very painful to our vulnerable people.

946
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:40,457
[SPEAKER_17]: The budget spending is $167 million and more than 80% of that goes to compensation for city of Medford employees

947
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:47,261
[SPEAKER_17]: And those loyal employees will continue to be rewarded, but we will not tolerate waste by others.

948
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:49,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me repeat that.

949
01:22:50,022 --> 01:22:56,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Our loyal employees will continue to be rewarded, but we will not tolerate waste by others.

950
01:22:57,165 --> 01:23:01,107
[SPEAKER_17]: That leaves less than 20% for materiel and supplies.

951
01:23:02,307 --> 01:23:10,091
[SPEAKER_17]: And that explains why Medford cannot carry out proper and timely maintenance, as Councilor Marks said,

952
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:14,236
[SPEAKER_17]: of buildings, infrastructure, and natural resources.

953
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:23,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Heads of departments, out of respect for the executive, do not insist on proper allocation of funds for their departments.

954
01:23:24,244 --> 01:23:28,227
[SPEAKER_17]: But department heads need and want proper allocation.

955
01:23:29,048 --> 01:23:32,590
[SPEAKER_17]: As a result, potholes are not filled.

956
01:23:34,212 --> 01:23:35,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Sidewalks are not repaired.

957
01:23:37,254 --> 01:23:39,295
[SPEAKER_17]: Street bumps are not maintained.

958
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:41,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Speed bumps, rather.

959
01:23:41,556 --> 01:23:41,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

960
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:43,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Speed bumps are not maintained.

961
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Crosswalks are not painted.

962
01:23:47,599 --> 01:23:49,320
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was promised in a campaign.

963
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Street cleaning is sparse.

964
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Trees are not trimmed.

965
01:23:55,642 --> 01:23:57,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Tree stumps are not removed for many months.

966
01:23:59,244 --> 01:24:01,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Underground water leaks are not repaired.

967
01:24:02,946 --> 01:24:05,267
[SPEAKER_17]: Roof leaks are not repaired.

968
01:24:06,978 --> 01:24:09,239
[SPEAKER_17]: Public toilets are not sanitary.

969
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:13,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford Square is not made to work.

970
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:18,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Traffic lights at dangerous intersections have not been synchronized.

971
01:24:19,444 --> 01:24:23,245
[SPEAKER_17]: No foot patrol police officers, as promised in the campaign.

972
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:27,827
[SPEAKER_17]: No end of unpopular kiosk parking program.

973
01:24:29,168 --> 01:24:30,228
[SPEAKER_17]: No charter review.

974
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:35,891
[SPEAKER_17]: No improvement in public school abysmal MCAS ranking.

975
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:43,179
[SPEAKER_17]: and $25 for a permit to park in front of your own house.

976
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:48,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this what we are paying high taxes for?

977
01:24:49,624 --> 01:24:50,325
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's face it.

978
01:24:51,706 --> 01:24:54,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Our Medford is not a vital city.

979
01:24:55,309 --> 01:24:57,230
[SPEAKER_17]: The city's finances are unstable.

980
01:24:58,331 --> 01:25:03,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Its head is bumping the ceiling when 80% of the budget is spent on the bureaucracy.

981
01:25:04,536 --> 01:25:04,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Soon,

982
01:25:06,112 --> 01:25:10,816
[SPEAKER_17]: For all practical purposes, the city will become a welfare department.

983
01:25:12,077 --> 01:25:30,010
[SPEAKER_17]: If the council passes this budget, it becomes responsible for raising taxes and it must be held responsible by the voters for separating the people from their money without an improvement in services and then redistributing that money to prosperous people.

984
01:25:30,771 --> 01:25:33,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Many of them, not even residents of Medford.

985
01:25:35,316 --> 01:25:42,940
[SPEAKER_17]: To quote Oscar Wilde, our mayor knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.

986
01:25:44,021 --> 01:25:59,210
[SPEAKER_17]: To vote for this budget is to follow the mayor down that path of depression, and worse, to injure our very own children who will inherit a sad, poorly educated city.

987
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:01,571
[SPEAKER_17]: One last quotation.

988
01:26:02,632 --> 01:26:04,893
[SPEAKER_17]: This is from Marcus Aurelius, who said,

989
01:26:06,142 --> 01:26:11,085
[SPEAKER_17]: And in a sense, people are our proper occupation.

990
01:26:12,386 --> 01:26:15,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Our job is to do them good.

991
01:26:16,969 --> 01:26:17,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Schroeder.

992
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

993
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,070
Thank you, Governor.

994
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:20,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falco.

995
01:26:21,631 --> 01:26:24,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I will yield to the resident.

996
01:26:26,234 --> 01:26:26,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

997
01:26:26,674 --> 01:26:27,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

998
01:26:28,215 --> 01:26:29,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

999
01:26:29,216 --> 01:26:31,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1000
01:26:31,698 --> 01:26:34,119
[SPEAKER_21]: Through the chair, thank you, Councilor Falco, for yielding.

1001
01:26:34,742 --> 01:26:35,523
[SPEAKER_21]: some time to me.

1002
01:26:35,903 --> 01:26:38,365
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I just want to talk about a few things.

1003
01:26:38,745 --> 01:26:44,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, I, I definitely echo everything Mr. Starella just said, uh, in, in spades.

1004
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:51,575
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to echo a few things from what, uh, counselor marks was, was talking about.

1005
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:55,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, he's mentioned one street that hasn't been done in six decades.

1006
01:26:55,438 --> 01:26:57,219
[SPEAKER_21]: That's, that's my street, Evan street.

1007
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:59,821
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been before the city council before, uh,

1008
01:27:02,873 --> 01:27:06,283
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's a very sad commentary on the city of Medford.

1009
01:27:06,647 --> 01:27:24,823
[SPEAKER_21]: to see a budget of $167 million when residents on my street, Mr. President, were told by at least two counselors that the repairs that were in dire need, critical condition, were going to be done this May.

1010
01:27:25,504 --> 01:27:32,710
[SPEAKER_21]: I came to the city hall and I spoke to the engineer who told me all the red tape it has to go through.

1011
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,161
[SPEAKER_21]: about a contract.

1012
01:27:34,961 --> 01:27:49,410
[SPEAKER_21]: A neighbor of mine told me yesterday that upon speaking to somebody in City Hall, I won't mention any names, said that contract is now having problems, so it doesn't look like our street's going to be done this year.

1013
01:27:50,750 --> 01:28:00,116
[SPEAKER_21]: After being told by several people that it was going to be done, the residents of Evans Street are outraged.

1014
01:28:00,822 --> 01:28:28,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, when we're paying two income taxes, excise taxes, property taxes that go up every year, a new connectivity fee coming at us in the water tax account that has a surplus in it, to see a $167 million budget that's about to be approved, as Mr. Storella said, that 80% of it is going towards salaries and the infrastructure repairs not being done,

1015
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:31,985
[SPEAKER_21]: It will be reflected on this body.

1016
01:28:33,346 --> 01:28:37,329
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a primary reason why I am running for city council this year.

1017
01:28:37,349 --> 01:28:38,430
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not a campaign speech.

1018
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:41,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I can announce that I'm a candidate, Mr. President.

1019
01:28:42,153 --> 01:28:42,453
[SPEAKER_21]: I can.

1020
01:28:42,493 --> 01:28:44,154
[SPEAKER_21]: If that threatens you, good.

1021
01:28:45,215 --> 01:28:45,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Good.

1022
01:28:46,246 --> 01:28:49,711
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we need new voices on the city council, Mr. President.

1023
01:28:49,771 --> 01:28:55,940
[SPEAKER_21]: We need new people that are going to come in here and have the political will to finally stand up and say no.

1024
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,963
[SPEAKER_21]: This is not a political step.

1025
01:28:58,143 --> 01:28:59,105
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that, Mr. President.

1026
01:28:59,185 --> 01:29:00,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for reminding me that.

1027
01:29:05,852 --> 01:29:16,099
[SPEAKER_21]: The reinvestment in the arts that Councillor Marks spoke to is a stabilizing tax base, especially with that Chevalier Theatre.

1028
01:29:16,219 --> 01:29:19,421
[SPEAKER_21]: That's only going to get $97,000 this year under this budget.

1029
01:29:19,641 --> 01:29:20,301
[SPEAKER_21]: It's outrageous.

1030
01:29:20,762 --> 01:29:30,368
[SPEAKER_21]: It's outrageous, especially when this downtown business district is suffering so much for the extended repair of the Craddock Bridge that's now added another year, another $10 million to it.

1031
01:29:33,499 --> 01:29:44,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Far too many residents of this community are at their wits end with vital repairs that are not being done and seeing a budget increase to $167 million.

1032
01:29:45,682 --> 01:29:58,484
[SPEAKER_21]: I respectfully ask you to vote no on this budget until such a time that it reflects adequate responsibility for all the millions of millions of tax dollars that these residents are paying.

1033
01:29:58,764 --> 01:29:59,765
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1034
01:29:59,785 --> 01:30:00,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1035
01:30:00,665 --> 01:30:01,285
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

1036
01:30:02,568 --> 01:30:05,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I can wait if the... If you prefer.

1037
01:30:05,169 --> 01:30:05,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, please.

1038
01:30:05,929 --> 01:30:07,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Then I'll make it very brief as usual.

1039
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:08,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your time.

1040
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:10,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Castanetti, Cushing Street, 02155.

1041
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:17,071
[SPEAKER_18]: To hear Mr. Starella speak, it gives me hope for mankind.

1042
01:30:17,672 --> 01:30:19,152
[SPEAKER_18]: He reminds me of my father.

1043
01:30:19,192 --> 01:30:24,073
[SPEAKER_18]: He uses a lot of common sense, but I'm sure he has more than a sixth grade education.

1044
01:30:26,914 --> 01:30:31,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, I think the translation would be, let's cut the waste.

1045
01:30:33,472 --> 01:30:37,775
[SPEAKER_18]: and take care of what we have, and maintain what we have.

1046
01:30:39,736 --> 01:30:54,385
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a gut feeling that the old high school, 1970, that was closed on Forest Street, will still be standing when all these so-called new schools will become rubble, and have to be rebuilt at our children.

1047
01:30:54,405 --> 01:30:56,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, Mr. Kessling.

1048
01:30:56,946 --> 01:31:01,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, if you wanna talk, please go out in the hallway, so other people can hear what's happening.

1049
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:03,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very hard to hear in this room.

1050
01:31:03,612 --> 01:31:05,713
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought you were telling me not to campaign.

1051
01:31:06,153 --> 01:31:08,875
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not running at this juncture.

1052
01:31:11,796 --> 01:31:12,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So, excuse me.

1053
01:31:13,537 --> 01:31:16,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, people can't hear in this room.

1054
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:18,600
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need to talk, please go out into the hallway.

1055
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:19,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1056
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, Mr. Castanetti.

1057
01:31:23,022 --> 01:31:25,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, thank you very much.

1058
01:31:26,343 --> 01:31:28,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize again, Mr. Castanetti.

1059
01:31:28,925 --> 01:31:29,525
[SPEAKER_18]: It's okay.

1060
01:31:29,565 --> 01:31:31,986
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe I remember the key point.

1061
01:31:32,026 --> 01:31:33,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Starella brought up

1062
01:31:35,672 --> 01:31:43,136
[SPEAKER_18]: it would probably be a $400, $500 increase in that real estate tax, I presume he meant.

1063
01:31:44,016 --> 01:31:48,599
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's probably right on from the last couple of years standing in a row.

1064
01:31:48,619 --> 01:31:53,241
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems like my real estate tax has gone up $400 annually.

1065
01:31:54,862 --> 01:32:02,667
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I would like to say, as you people spent lots of time, and if I may commend you,

1066
01:32:03,923 --> 01:32:06,024
[SPEAKER_18]: an effort on this budget process.

1067
01:32:07,365 --> 01:32:20,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully you've taken into consideration, God willing, I'll be back in December, about the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, because we're talking about money now, budget.

1068
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:31,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead of that $400 increase that Mr. Sorella presumed it's gonna be, would a 35% owner-occupied real estate tax exemption

1069
01:32:32,098 --> 01:32:41,423
[SPEAKER_18]: which has never been adopted in this city, but has been in Everett, Somerville, and Malden, and Nantucket, and Brookline, and in Boston, mind you.

1070
01:32:42,743 --> 01:32:51,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead of a $400 increase, we would see a $700 decrease in my estimation with my simple mathematics.

1071
01:32:52,148 --> 01:32:53,589
[SPEAKER_18]: That's $1,000 swing.

1072
01:32:54,489 --> 01:32:58,632
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you really wanna jack up the budget three, four, 5%,

1073
01:33:01,635 --> 01:33:15,224
[SPEAKER_18]: At least give us what the commonwealth of Massachusetts gave to we the people, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, so we could have a $1,000 swing of a savings.

1074
01:33:16,725 --> 01:33:25,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead of at this rate, our tax rate will be $10,000 a year on a house instead of six in the next five years.

1075
01:33:26,611 --> 01:33:30,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially for the seniors, it's not easy for a lot of people.

1076
01:33:32,716 --> 01:33:33,656
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you're listening.

1077
01:33:34,496 --> 01:33:35,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Hope to see you in December.

1078
01:33:36,717 --> 01:33:37,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1079
01:33:38,277 --> 01:33:39,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

1080
01:33:42,518 --> 01:33:43,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco, you have the floor.

1081
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:46,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass.

1082
01:33:46,658 --> 01:34:01,561
[SPEAKER_19]: The interesting part about this budget goes back to October or November of last year and January of this past year regarding the mayor's original state of the city address, where she talked about she had incorporated a liaison officer between her office

1083
01:34:02,055 --> 01:34:05,077
[SPEAKER_19]: and this council, and the interesting part about this whole thing.

1084
01:34:05,297 --> 01:34:08,999
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, Mr. President, I don't know if I should say this, but I am.

1085
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:19,246
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, because I'm at the podium, Councilor Knight and Councilor Del Rosso like to take this opportunity from walking away and shirking their responsibility to listen to whoever the person is at this podium.

1086
01:34:19,706 --> 01:34:27,334
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a complete disrespect to this councilor and to the taxpayers of this community for which they're getting paid $30,000 each, which is $60,000.

1087
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:39,285
[SPEAKER_19]: And if anybody is watching, I would hope that they do not vote for Mr. Knight or Mr. De La Russo, because they show complete disrespect to people at this podium, including a former member of this body.

1088
01:34:39,986 --> 01:34:55,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Therefore, as I said before and I will repeat it, this council has never had the opportunity to sit down with this man to go to every single one of you, seven of you, one at a time, to find out what you would like to see in this budget as your particular project, over and beyond her particular projects.

1089
01:34:55,722 --> 01:34:56,463
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't exist.

1090
01:34:56,503 --> 01:34:57,223
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't happen.

1091
01:34:57,744 --> 01:34:59,105
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not a transparent

1092
01:35:00,026 --> 01:35:00,726
[SPEAKER_19]: administration.

1093
01:35:00,766 --> 01:35:05,769
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a fake administration of telling things that happen that don't happen.

1094
01:35:06,469 --> 01:35:08,150
[SPEAKER_19]: It's as fake as a nine dollar bill.

1095
01:35:08,851 --> 01:35:16,094
[SPEAKER_19]: And the unfortunate part is that you seven members, all of you, especially the one that support her, she's making complete fools out of you.

1096
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:20,637
[SPEAKER_19]: You're making yourself look like a bunch of clowns because you've never held her feet to the fire once.

1097
01:35:20,917 --> 01:35:22,478
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is the year that it should have been done.

1098
01:35:23,098 --> 01:35:24,900
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Stirella is absolutely right.

1099
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:33,869
[SPEAKER_19]: As an elderly taxpayer in this community, he has taken the time to understand and at least manage, through this particular budget, the needs of this community.

1100
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:42,218
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you have more building permits going out, if you have more construction coming in, and you have more money coming in, and you continuously keep taxing,

1101
01:35:42,718 --> 01:35:53,844
[SPEAKER_19]: the Medford taxpayers, over and beyond, then they have the connectivity tax, surpluses in the water and sewer account for which you have no major projects going on, $9 million in thereabouts of the free cash account.

1102
01:35:54,704 --> 01:35:56,985
[SPEAKER_19]: Where are the preferences taking place?

1103
01:35:57,265 --> 01:36:03,249
[SPEAKER_19]: Councillor Marks, you alluded to the fact of the gear, the washing machine gear, which goes back to February of this past year.

1104
01:36:04,469 --> 01:36:06,710
[SPEAKER_19]: $100,000 in the Office of Community Development.

1105
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:10,952
[SPEAKER_19]: You've been begging for more people in that office to help you out here in this community.

1106
01:36:11,612 --> 01:36:12,373
[SPEAKER_19]: We could go through it.

1107
01:36:12,393 --> 01:36:13,433
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to go through it.

1108
01:36:13,773 --> 01:36:23,378
[SPEAKER_19]: Sitting behind me over here are four ladies that work in the mayor's office that make in excess of $400,000 a year that Medford taxpayers are paying for.

1109
01:36:24,178 --> 01:36:36,008
[SPEAKER_19]: And none of you will have the opportunity to sit down and to get your particular issue in this particular budget to show an act of conciliation, an act of remediation, and more importantly, an act of incorporation.

1110
01:36:36,409 --> 01:36:37,270
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't exist.

1111
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:49,220
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why there are so many people running for city council, and that's why there are so many people running for mayor, because the people in this community are dissatisfied as to what's going on in this particular building.

1112
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:51,002
[SPEAKER_19]: They're running it as a closed shop.

1113
01:36:51,662 --> 01:36:55,364
[SPEAKER_19]: And every single one of you should be ashamed of yourself if you'll allow this to continue.

1114
01:36:55,844 --> 01:36:56,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1115
01:36:57,105 --> 01:36:57,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1116
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Falco.

1117
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:00,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1118
01:37:01,146 --> 01:37:03,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to thank all the residents for coming up here tonight.

1119
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:08,010
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we all know, the budget process is a long process.

1120
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:11,491
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of our most important responsibilities that we have.

1121
01:37:11,511 --> 01:37:13,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to thank

1122
01:37:13,736 --> 01:37:14,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to begin.

1123
01:37:15,017 --> 01:37:17,299
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually my, I guess, probably closing speech in the budget.

1124
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:23,184
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd like to begin by thanking the mayor and the department heads for all their hard work.

1125
01:37:23,444 --> 01:37:26,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is not easy as far as going through the budget process.

1126
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:30,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of energy, a lot of collaboration.

1127
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:39,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate that during our budget hearings, and they've been going on for a number of weeks, the quick turnaround, which helps us try to analyze the data.

1128
01:37:40,258 --> 01:37:42,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps us try to make a decision in a timely fashion.

1129
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:42,900
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1130
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:43,840
[SPEAKER_03]: to all of you.

1131
01:37:44,501 --> 01:37:53,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to thank the superintendent of schools and the school committee and all the department heads in the school department for all of their hard work.

1132
01:37:55,406 --> 01:38:01,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever we had questions, those questions were answered the same way in a timely fashion, and I appreciate that as well.

1133
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:08,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, it's not easy crafting a budget and presenting this budget, but there are also a lot of people to thank.

1134
01:38:09,653 --> 01:38:11,314
[SPEAKER_03]: My fellow council members here tonight,

1135
01:38:12,425 --> 01:38:13,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Asked great questions.

1136
01:38:14,167 --> 01:38:18,511
[SPEAKER_03]: The deliberation process, I thought, was pretty smooth and, for the most part, professional.

1137
01:38:18,771 --> 01:38:22,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication.

1138
01:38:22,794 --> 01:38:24,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of all, the residents.

1139
01:38:24,176 --> 01:38:26,698
[SPEAKER_03]: The residents that came to the budget meetings.

1140
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:33,324
[SPEAKER_03]: They asked good questions, made points, and their input was very beneficial.

1141
01:38:34,545 --> 01:38:37,888
[SPEAKER_03]: But although no budget is perfect, I believe that this is a good budget.

1142
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:46,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this is a good, solid budget that protects core services, it provides educational and recreation opportunities to our youngest residents.

1143
01:38:48,135 --> 01:39:04,143
[SPEAKER_03]: A recreation department, which I believe this city has been asking for for years, and it was supported by us on the council, I am very excited to see that in the budget, and that's going to happen, and I can't wait to see the opportunities that that will present to our residents.

1144
01:39:04,683 --> 01:39:07,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a look at things that, personally, that I have lobbied for,

1145
01:39:08,429 --> 01:39:14,091
[SPEAKER_03]: over the past two years, a traffic engineer, something that I have advocated for continuously.

1146
01:39:14,511 --> 01:39:16,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you to my colleagues, you've supported that as well.

1147
01:39:17,352 --> 01:39:19,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that is in the budget.

1148
01:39:19,932 --> 01:39:32,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a look at legislative software, something that I've advocated as well over the past year, and something that I believe will increase the transparency that we have here at City Hall, with us and the council, with boards and commissions hopefully.

1149
01:39:33,236 --> 01:39:36,897
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I think improves government, it makes it more transparent,

1150
01:39:37,374 --> 01:39:38,955
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone becomes part of the process.

1151
01:39:38,975 --> 01:39:41,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And happy to say that that's part of the budget.

1152
01:39:41,117 --> 01:39:45,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are things that I've been advocating for, but you have been supporting as well.

1153
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are part of this budget.

1154
01:39:47,362 --> 01:39:49,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something that is good.

1155
01:39:49,764 --> 01:39:51,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a look at other parts of the budget.

1156
01:39:51,346 --> 01:39:54,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I see library funding increased, another plus.

1157
01:39:55,149 --> 01:40:00,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a look at the additional positions in the Medford Police Department with the crime scene analyst.

1158
01:40:00,473 --> 01:40:01,554
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another great addition.

1159
01:40:02,395 --> 01:40:04,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a look at the school system.

1160
01:40:05,914 --> 01:40:13,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as a former member of the school committee and a parent that has kids in the Medford public schools, I take a look at this budget and I think this is great.

1161
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:20,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when I was on the school committee and I came on during the recession, I saw things cut because we couldn't afford those things.

1162
01:40:20,724 --> 01:40:22,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are all coming back now.

1163
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:23,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a look at

1164
01:40:24,088 --> 01:40:28,970
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, paraprofessionals or librarians coming back into the system.

1165
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:29,830
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

1166
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:32,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are good things that are being added back in.

1167
01:40:32,872 --> 01:40:40,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a look at the increase in maintenance and repair by $200,000, $20,000 for each school.

1168
01:40:40,455 --> 01:40:41,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Another great addition.

1169
01:40:42,355 --> 01:40:43,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Low class size.

1170
01:40:43,276 --> 01:40:44,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say enough about this.

1171
01:40:44,556 --> 01:40:47,197
[SPEAKER_03]: As a former member of the school committee, low class size.

1172
01:40:47,277 --> 01:40:48,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a look at this list.

1173
01:40:49,398 --> 01:40:50,259
[SPEAKER_03]: In some of our schools, 19, 18, 15,

1174
01:40:55,018 --> 01:40:57,639
[SPEAKER_03]: 17, you can't get lower than that.

1175
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,880
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go across the state, you'd be hard pressed to find.

1176
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:02,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, there's someone speaking.

1177
01:41:02,821 --> 01:41:03,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1178
01:41:04,842 --> 01:41:05,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

1179
01:41:05,282 --> 01:41:06,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be professional about it, please.

1180
01:41:07,263 --> 01:41:07,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1181
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:12,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, let's be professional about it.

1182
01:41:14,546 --> 01:41:15,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It's distracting.

1183
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:20,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So class size is some of the best in the state and we should be proud of that.

1184
01:41:21,666 --> 01:41:26,268
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that the school committee throughout the years has always focused on.

1185
01:41:26,688 --> 01:41:27,588
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be proud of that.

1186
01:41:27,668 --> 01:41:28,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Class size has come down.

1187
01:41:29,449 --> 01:41:32,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to have a class with 15 students, that's amazing.

1188
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:33,451
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dream to a teacher.

1189
01:41:33,491 --> 01:41:36,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is another great budget addition.

1190
01:41:37,952 --> 01:41:40,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Activity accounts in our schools increasing.

1191
01:41:41,033 --> 01:41:41,714
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fabulous.

1192
01:41:41,754 --> 01:41:44,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're getting students involved in what's going on in the schools.

1193
01:41:46,022 --> 01:41:50,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And you take a look at our vocational school program, from 11 programs, I believe, to 20.

1194
01:41:51,223 --> 01:41:52,183
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fabulous.

1195
01:41:52,363 --> 01:41:54,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is all part of this budget.

1196
01:41:54,164 --> 01:41:57,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that I look at.

1197
01:41:58,344 --> 01:41:59,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I support it.

1198
01:41:59,344 --> 01:42:00,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good budget.

1199
01:42:00,605 --> 01:42:02,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We're replacing textbooks in addition.

1200
01:42:03,925 --> 01:42:08,126
[SPEAKER_03]: We're adding technology with the Chromebooks throughout our school system.

1201
01:42:08,606 --> 01:42:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all good additions to the budget.

1202
01:42:12,347 --> 01:42:14,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, not all budgets are perfect.

1203
01:42:15,042 --> 01:42:19,083
[SPEAKER_03]: but this is something I think, I think this is a good budget, and I think this is something that we can be proud of.

1204
01:42:19,423 --> 01:42:20,524
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to second the motion.

1205
01:42:21,464 --> 01:42:22,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1206
01:42:22,985 --> 01:42:23,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1207
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:26,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1208
01:42:26,546 --> 01:42:36,149
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to start by also thanking the department heads who are at our countless hours of budget meetings over the last three weeks.

1209
01:42:36,729 --> 01:42:44,392
[SPEAKER_16]: There was at least three or four that were there constantly, and definitely, even if they didn't have the answer, they got us mostly every

1210
01:42:45,108 --> 01:42:45,909
[SPEAKER_16]: answer we needed.

1211
01:42:46,629 --> 01:42:54,995
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd second like to disclose that before the vote is taken, I do have a family member that's in the school budget.

1212
01:42:55,215 --> 01:42:56,996
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to make full disclosure on that.

1213
01:42:57,076 --> 01:42:58,357
[SPEAKER_16]: She is a teacher, my sister.

1214
01:43:00,539 --> 01:43:03,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Third, I want to talk about the positives of the budget.

1215
01:43:04,061 --> 01:43:09,225
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, we put a lot of hours into it, as did the administration and the school department and school committee.

1216
01:43:10,088 --> 01:43:15,249
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are some great additions to the budget and a lot of things that I'm happy to see.

1217
01:43:15,269 --> 01:43:19,130
[SPEAKER_16]: I know some of my other colleagues have gone over a number of them.

1218
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:21,930
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to point out what I think was important.

1219
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:27,931
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe the recovery coach, he's a fine young man who's done a lot of work so far.

1220
01:43:27,971 --> 01:43:31,012
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's great to see a recovery coach added to the budget.

1221
01:43:31,132 --> 01:43:38,393
[SPEAKER_16]: And he'll be in our health department and obviously working with Penny, our coordinator, a great deal.

1222
01:43:39,015 --> 01:43:45,679
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe the traffic engineer that we've advocated for with the lead of Councillor Falco is going to be a great addition.

1223
01:43:46,419 --> 01:44:06,710
[SPEAKER_16]: The fact that we made the recommendation during the budget hearings that that traffic engineer also have a job duty of looking over street repairs by utility companies, a problem that I know a number of us have had and we've had meetings on, keeping up to date with regards to

1224
01:44:07,546 --> 01:44:20,296
[SPEAKER_16]: follow-up of work that's done by utilities and the fact that we'll have an engineer, a traffic engineer, looking at that as well, as well as a vote we took last week, hopefully looking over the gas leaks in the community.

1225
01:44:20,316 --> 01:44:22,818
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a great position that's going to be added.

1226
01:44:23,579 --> 01:44:26,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank Councilor Scarpelli for working on the rec department.

1227
01:44:26,641 --> 01:44:35,949
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a good addition to the budget, and I know there were over 1,000 families that were interested in it, so it's good to see that that was added.

1228
01:44:36,939 --> 01:44:44,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Finally, having a year where the library is fully funded to levels that are appropriate and then some is a positive.

1229
01:44:46,466 --> 01:44:48,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Class size, Councilor Falco spoke about it.

1230
01:44:48,928 --> 01:44:55,853
[SPEAKER_16]: I had to advocate myself for one specific grade in the city that I have a child in.

1231
01:44:56,254 --> 01:44:58,595
[SPEAKER_16]: But other than that, our class size is very low.

1232
01:44:58,715 --> 01:45:03,619
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was great last Monday to hear that no class size will go over 22.

1233
01:45:05,131 --> 01:45:15,237
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe a lot, looking at the chart, there are a lot that are in the, I think we have an average of 19 or 20, which is just really a big deal to families in this city.

1234
01:45:15,337 --> 01:45:20,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Having class sizes low is extremely important for learning.

1235
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,461
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can ask anybody, and that's pretty important.

1236
01:45:24,242 --> 01:45:34,128
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had two of the biggest complaints that I get is speeding and then the condition of our roads and sidewalks, non-removal of tree stumps.

1237
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:37,912
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's been good to know that radar guns have been ordered.

1238
01:45:38,272 --> 01:45:43,575
[SPEAKER_16]: We've also, within this budget, the past budget, have received laser guns.

1239
01:45:43,635 --> 01:45:45,816
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had officers trained in them.

1240
01:45:46,256 --> 01:45:53,780
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're doing the job of the speeding on all of our thoroughfares and inside streets that we obviously get calls on all the time.

1241
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:55,681
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is extremely important.

1242
01:45:55,901 --> 01:46:01,824
[SPEAKER_16]: And on a side note, it's great to have Sergeant Hartnett, who is very responsive to our questions and emails.

1243
01:46:03,782 --> 01:46:06,683
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad that the senior work program is still within the budget.

1244
01:46:06,703 --> 01:46:10,044
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the second year since it was removed years and years ago.

1245
01:46:10,084 --> 01:46:11,204
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's important.

1246
01:46:11,605 --> 01:46:14,946
[SPEAKER_16]: It does help the seniors that are paying the property taxes.

1247
01:46:15,006 --> 01:46:16,626
[SPEAKER_16]: It gives them $1,000 in relief.

1248
01:46:16,706 --> 01:46:18,687
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's great to see in there.

1249
01:46:20,167 --> 01:46:26,910
[SPEAKER_16]: We got a good update with regards to collecting debt and how low we've been able to get it within the city.

1250
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:28,550
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's definitely a positive.

1251
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,331
[SPEAKER_16]: And the leak detection program that

1252
01:46:33,137 --> 01:46:37,559
[SPEAKER_16]: is going to be implemented will hopefully save us on the MWRA side.

1253
01:46:37,619 --> 01:46:39,300
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's good to see that in the budget.

1254
01:46:40,921 --> 01:46:45,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are just some of the good things that I want to point out.

1255
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:49,825
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, I do see some things that I'm concerned with.

1256
01:46:50,105 --> 01:46:52,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Down the road, we're going to run into an issue.

1257
01:46:52,266 --> 01:46:54,887
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we have 107 police officers.

1258
01:46:55,628 --> 01:47:00,650
[SPEAKER_16]: We have hopefully nine that are coming out once we go to civilian dispatch.

1259
01:47:01,917 --> 01:47:07,358
[SPEAKER_16]: But we also have seven or eight retirements that are going to come down the line this next year.

1260
01:47:07,558 --> 01:47:10,598
[SPEAKER_16]: And then five, six, seven more that are in 2018.

1261
01:47:11,539 --> 01:47:24,241
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you're still looking at the numbers, unless we hire within the next year, year and a half, and get some men and women in the academy, we're looking at lower numbers than we had this past year.

1262
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:27,861
[SPEAKER_16]: If you do the calculations by what we were given, we're looking at about 104.

1263
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:30,622
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just have a concern with that.

1264
01:47:31,988 --> 01:47:44,591
[SPEAKER_16]: We should have put, I know we have the crime analyst that was put into this budget, which is great, but I feel like we should have put a few more offices in the book for fiscal year 2018.

1265
01:47:44,631 --> 01:47:49,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Roads and sidewalks, I have a concern.

1266
01:47:49,472 --> 01:47:52,373
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there was money that actually wasn't even spent in

1267
01:47:54,495 --> 01:48:02,179
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the line items, I think it was about $45,000 that wasn't spent on sidewalk and road repairs, sidewalk repairs.

1268
01:48:03,019 --> 01:48:05,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's something that you get complaints about all the time.

1269
01:48:05,561 --> 01:48:14,085
[SPEAKER_16]: If you go walking around the city or you have somebody that calls you and it's with regards to a sidewalk, it's because a sidewalk needs to be fixed.

1270
01:48:14,505 --> 01:48:23,570
[SPEAKER_16]: So the fact that we're not spending certain portions, and we talked about it within the transfers, the fact that we're not spending money on things we need to spend money on

1271
01:48:24,344 --> 01:48:25,685
[SPEAKER_16]: is definitely concerning.

1272
01:48:26,226 --> 01:48:28,148
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we need to invest more.

1273
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:37,216
[SPEAKER_16]: I recommended that we take, I think it was 50,000 extra to pay for our roads and sidewalks and find that money elsewhere.

1274
01:48:37,796 --> 01:48:41,259
[SPEAKER_16]: And that wasn't taken into this budget, but I think it should be.

1275
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:50,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Going back to the vote we took a while ago, I still am concerned about when we're going to do the fire headquarters.

1276
01:48:51,833 --> 01:48:57,596
[SPEAKER_16]: That's something that I believe we should have done with the police headquarters, and I wanted to point that out.

1277
01:48:58,296 --> 01:49:04,699
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also been mentioned, I guess the last of my comments, it's been mentioned by a number of citizens and a counselor or two here.

1278
01:49:05,559 --> 01:49:09,001
[SPEAKER_16]: We really are taxing the people to the ultimate max.

1279
01:49:09,621 --> 01:49:11,542
[SPEAKER_16]: The connectivity fee, I don't like it.

1280
01:49:12,702 --> 01:49:19,325
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand how it's going to affect the next year, and it's not necessarily concerning, but I have a really

1281
01:49:20,477 --> 01:49:25,860
[SPEAKER_16]: big concern with how it's going to come down 2018, 2019, and beyond.

1282
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,783
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just something that I wish was never voted upon.

1283
01:49:32,144 --> 01:49:41,850
[SPEAKER_16]: The fact that we have a water and sewer surplus in the, I believe, we got the answer, I believe it was in the $7 million, $8 million range on top of free cash.

1284
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:49,114
[SPEAKER_16]: And the rate we're charging with regards to

1285
01:49:51,797 --> 01:49:54,078
[SPEAKER_16]: PEG access, the cable fee.

1286
01:49:54,098 --> 01:50:10,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like there needs to be some relief if the budget wasn't so, I think the budget's really good, so if it wasn't as good like last year, last year I voted against the budget, this year I'm on the fence.

1287
01:50:10,984 --> 01:50:20,188
[SPEAKER_16]: I just feel like taxing to the max, to the absolute dollar, the last dollar we can is something we should really strive to

1288
01:50:21,237 --> 01:50:30,345
[SPEAKER_16]: try to give some sort of relief to all the homeowners in this community, all the rate payers, and it's just never done.

1289
01:50:30,365 --> 01:50:33,608
[SPEAKER_16]: I never get the votes, so that's obviously why I'm on the fence.

1290
01:50:33,628 --> 01:50:40,354
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I have the votes tonight either to give some relief to the taxpayer, but I think that's just something that needs to be taken into account.

1291
01:50:42,216 --> 01:50:43,537
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll leave it at that for now.

1292
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:45,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilwoman O'Keefe.

1293
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:46,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1294
01:50:47,685 --> 01:50:49,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1295
01:50:49,366 --> 01:50:56,190
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't go through every single highlight of the budget because the superintendent's done it, members of the administration have done it, members of the council have done it.

1296
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:58,431
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to take an opportunity to thank Ms.

1297
01:50:58,451 --> 01:50:59,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Nunley for her hard work.

1298
01:51:00,012 --> 01:51:00,832
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to thank Ms.

1299
01:51:00,852 --> 01:51:01,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Kahn for her hard work.

1300
01:51:02,113 --> 01:51:03,173
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to thank Ms.

1301
01:51:03,233 --> 01:51:04,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Irwin for her hard work.

1302
01:51:04,514 --> 01:51:10,197
[SPEAKER_14]: We sat through nearly 20 hours of budget debates in a short period of time and these three individuals were there every step of the way with us.

1303
01:51:11,222 --> 01:51:18,624
[SPEAKER_14]: When the budget debates were over and we asked a number of questions, we went home and they went back to the office and they got us the answers that we needed and they got us the answers in a timely fashion.

1304
01:51:19,024 --> 01:51:21,804
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you very much for the hard work and effort that you put into this budget.

1305
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:23,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Belson, I'd like to thank you as well.

1306
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:25,705
[SPEAKER_14]: You did a great job putting your budget together.

1307
01:51:25,965 --> 01:51:30,706
[SPEAKER_14]: You gave a great presentation and I really appreciate the work and effort that you and the school committee put in as well.

1308
01:51:31,786 --> 01:51:40,028
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing that's a highlight of this budget that I haven't heard much about is the work that happened in the electrical department and the work that has been performed by Steven Rendazzo.

1309
01:51:40,663 --> 01:51:44,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And his electrical department budget was decreased by $300,000.

1310
01:51:44,984 --> 01:51:53,666
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was able to decrease his budget by $300,000 through a cost-saving measure, where the electrical department actually purchased the streetlights from National Grid.

1311
01:51:54,226 --> 01:52:02,028
[SPEAKER_14]: And this resulted in a $300,000 savings to our budget, which is actually the equivalent number to the monies that we appropriated for the recreation department.

1312
01:52:02,268 --> 01:52:05,229
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's very important that we recognize the work and effort of Steve Randazzo.

1313
01:52:05,249 --> 01:52:06,669
[SPEAKER_14]: He's one of our newer department heads here,

1314
01:52:07,725 --> 01:52:10,966
[SPEAKER_14]: gone above and beyond the call of duty, and he's done a great job managing that department.

1315
01:52:11,286 --> 01:52:14,627
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's shown us savings, and he's shown us his experience, and it's really paying off.

1316
01:52:15,907 --> 01:52:28,450
[SPEAKER_14]: This budget does build on the successes of the past, Mr. President, and I'm very excited to see that we're utilizing the Office of Substance Abuse Outreach and Prevention and building upon the successes of that office with a recovery coach.

1317
01:52:28,470 --> 01:52:33,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a very important role here in the community, and I'm very thankful that we have it in the budget.

1318
01:52:34,122 --> 01:52:37,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to take a quick moment to thank the school committee for the work that they've done.

1319
01:52:37,885 --> 01:52:41,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Last year they put forward one of the best budgets that I've seen the school committee put forward in a long time.

1320
01:52:41,868 --> 01:52:44,570
[SPEAKER_14]: And this year they've built upon those successes as well, Mr. President.

1321
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:49,494
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to thank the school committee as a body for all their work and effort in putting this document forward.

1322
01:52:50,074 --> 01:52:52,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move the question.

1323
01:52:52,936 --> 01:52:54,137
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a good budget.

1324
01:52:54,177 --> 01:52:56,099
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something that I can wholeheartedly support this evening.

1325
01:52:56,519 --> 01:52:57,860
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd ask for a roll call vote.

1326
01:52:58,961 --> 01:53:00,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

1327
01:53:00,382 --> 01:53:01,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, again.

1328
01:53:02,538 --> 01:53:08,843
[SPEAKER_02]: to follow what Councilor Knight said, and especially after John's eloquent words.

1329
01:53:08,863 --> 01:53:15,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to keep pounding on these points, so I'll leave it to this.

1330
01:53:16,589 --> 01:53:27,358
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I realized two years ago coming on this council with seven different personalities and seven different thought processes, we all had different goals for our community.

1331
01:53:27,879 --> 01:53:31,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone behind this reel works very hard to work together.

1332
01:53:31,041 --> 01:53:32,142
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing I realized.

1333
01:53:33,131 --> 01:53:39,013
[SPEAKER_02]: The perception for the community, if you don't know, if you have your perception, this group doesn't work together.

1334
01:53:39,254 --> 01:53:40,594
[SPEAKER_02]: We work very, very well together.

1335
01:53:40,894 --> 01:53:46,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And I applaud what we bring to the city and how hard we're working.

1336
01:53:47,437 --> 01:53:53,979
[SPEAKER_02]: The city administration, what we've done together in putting out this budget, I thank you very much.

1337
01:53:53,999 --> 01:53:57,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was a lot of work and the time that we put into it.

1338
01:53:59,083 --> 01:54:07,725
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, could cause some problems at home because we miss a lot of very important nights for our children and our families, but that's our job.

1339
01:54:07,785 --> 01:54:12,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we get paid all that money, that $30,000 that we keep hearing.

1340
01:54:14,347 --> 01:54:18,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But sure, when people come to the people's podium, this is their podium.

1341
01:54:18,668 --> 01:54:21,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they come to this podium, I give them my full attention, my full respect.

1342
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:24,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure, we all want

1343
01:54:24,773 --> 01:54:25,894
[SPEAKER_02]: to do better.

1344
01:54:26,314 --> 01:54:30,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to eliminate taxes, we want to fix the roads, we want to fix our streets.

1345
01:54:30,496 --> 01:54:31,997
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many concerns that we have.

1346
01:54:32,958 --> 01:54:45,085
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a councilor that a year ago was appointed by former President De La Russo, and I'll speak to this point personally because I think everybody's really touched upon many different points about this budget.

1347
01:54:45,766 --> 01:54:52,710
[SPEAKER_02]: But as Councilor De La Russo went to the mayor and presented my name to be the chairperson for the focus group for recreation,

1348
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:58,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you, for one counselor, I worked hand-in-hand with our administration.

1349
01:54:59,506 --> 01:55:00,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week we met.

1350
01:55:01,408 --> 01:55:10,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week, every day, I talked to, whether it be Joe Russo, or Allie Fisk, or Jeanine Camuso, or Jen Deverwood.

1351
01:55:11,376 --> 01:55:14,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to, sat and met with the mayor.

1352
01:55:15,099 --> 01:55:18,161
[SPEAKER_02]: We provided the community with input.

1353
01:55:18,722 --> 01:55:21,264
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a focus group that I have to applaud and

1354
01:55:22,225 --> 01:55:33,727
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that we talked about when we hit the campaign trail and how many great people we have in our community, that if you work together and bring in great minds that have some goals that can work together, what you can accomplish.

1355
01:55:35,807 --> 01:55:41,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I started back as one of my number one priorities, bringing a full-time recreation program to the city of Medford.

1356
01:55:42,408 --> 01:55:47,489
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we did with this administration, this lack of communication, I didn't see.

1357
01:55:48,269 --> 01:55:51,610
[SPEAKER_02]: For this point, I will talk on, we worked very closely.

1358
01:55:52,388 --> 01:55:57,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally met with this, our focus group on a weekly basis for at least 10 to 11 months.

1359
01:55:57,831 --> 01:56:08,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And we presented numbers after studies, after deep consideration, after homework that was done and people bringing information back and presented it back to the mayor.

1360
01:56:08,738 --> 01:56:15,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And she brought, she came back to us with this budget that is now implementing a full-time recreation department.

1361
01:56:15,602 --> 01:56:16,243
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unheard of.

1362
01:56:17,678 --> 01:56:26,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had so many, there are so many questions that boy, I would love to do a lot of the fixes that people have asked for.

1363
01:56:27,286 --> 01:56:34,192
[SPEAKER_02]: But for this budget, you see the great process that we've gone through, the great initiatives that have been implemented.

1364
01:56:35,473 --> 01:56:39,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not gonna touch upon it, because I want to, but it's beating a dead horse.

1365
01:56:39,877 --> 01:56:45,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to speak on the recreation again, that for what we see,

1366
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:54,977
[SPEAKER_02]: and the collaboration used by every department head to make this come to fruition for our community, for our babies, for our kids, for our seniors.

1367
01:56:56,038 --> 01:56:59,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even I know that Council Marks, it's not what he wants.

1368
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:06,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the arts, he's been an advocate for the art community and making sure that they are funded to the max.

1369
01:57:06,566 --> 01:57:08,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And I applaud him.

1370
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:13,812
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor has put a line item budget into the recreation budget.

1371
01:57:14,367 --> 01:57:16,308
[SPEAKER_02]: that will address some of those concerns.

1372
01:57:17,149 --> 01:57:24,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot that, you know, that people have when they come to that podium and have an agenda that they want to press.

1373
01:57:25,133 --> 01:57:25,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect that.

1374
01:57:26,614 --> 01:57:36,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But on a personal level, two years on the city council and bringing together this very important department that our community has been crying out for for years, it's happening.

1375
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:37,700
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a small example.

1376
01:57:38,532 --> 01:57:40,893
[SPEAKER_02]: of what I think we are looking for for the future.

1377
01:57:41,153 --> 01:57:47,597
[SPEAKER_02]: The way this council works, the way the city administration has worked for this department to make this happen, I applaud it and I thank them.

1378
01:57:47,737 --> 01:57:55,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I know the recreation people have talked and publicly said that George Scott Pelley keeps talking about the neighboring community all the time.

1379
01:57:56,482 --> 01:57:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanna clear this up to the community.

1380
01:57:58,463 --> 01:58:01,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about Somerville Recreation.

1381
01:58:01,585 --> 01:58:03,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting here talking about Method Recreation.

1382
01:58:04,946 --> 01:58:07,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and it's gonna be 10 times better than any recreation department.

1383
01:58:08,857 --> 01:58:12,039
[SPEAKER_02]: across the Commonwealth, and I can see that, because we have the commitment from our community.

1384
01:58:12,579 --> 01:58:18,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm very excited about this budget, for what is positively put into this budget.

1385
01:58:19,282 --> 01:58:27,167
[SPEAKER_02]: We've looked at every single avenue to get what could be put out to our community, and achieved some great goals.

1386
01:58:27,307 --> 01:58:37,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I thank you, I know it was a little winded, I apologize, but for this councilor, I appreciate all the hard work our city administration has done, and I move forward with this budget.

1387
01:58:38,432 --> 01:58:39,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

1388
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:40,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1389
01:58:40,692 --> 01:58:47,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to, first of all, thank Councilor Scott Pelley on his leadership with the recreation department.

1390
01:58:48,014 --> 01:58:59,216
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing I wanted to mention as well, just to disclose, my mother-in-law works at the Method Public Library, and I just wanted to, she's been an employee long before I was elected, but I disclosed that during the budget hearings.

1391
01:58:59,256 --> 01:59:02,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to disclose it here as well tonight.

1392
01:59:02,837 --> 01:59:03,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1393
01:59:03,097 --> 01:59:03,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1394
01:59:03,697 --> 01:59:04,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

1395
01:59:04,657 --> 01:59:05,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

1396
01:59:05,498 --> 01:59:07,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I too have to disclose that my sister

1397
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:20,149
[SPEAKER_02]: is a teacher at the Roberts, and she had that position well before I became member of this council, but I just wanted to make sure that I followed suit with my colleagues and made sure the public knows that.

1398
01:59:20,189 --> 01:59:20,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1399
01:59:20,789 --> 01:59:22,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone, for the public disclosures.

1400
01:59:22,571 --> 01:59:36,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And I personally, as president, I want to thank the mayor, the staff that came every night, Superintendent Belson came, and mostly I want to thank the other six members of this council who came every night

1401
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:41,141
[SPEAKER_07]: You've heard all the questions they've asked and the answers they've gotten.

1402
01:59:41,161 --> 01:59:46,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to commend them for all the questions and the dedication they put in over these last three weeks.

1403
01:59:47,463 --> 01:59:49,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, this is a good group.

1404
01:59:49,323 --> 01:59:58,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this whole group may not agree on everything, but when it comes to time to do some work, we're able to put things aside and get things done.

1405
01:59:59,185 --> 02:00:04,767
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank them for making my job as president during these budget hearings a lot easier.

1406
02:00:04,847 --> 02:00:05,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank you.

1407
02:00:07,304 --> 02:00:09,326
[SPEAKER_07]: and all the department heads for your dedication in this.

1408
02:00:09,907 --> 02:00:21,197
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso to support the 2018 City of Method budget, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1409
02:00:21,477 --> 02:00:23,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1410
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:26,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor DelaRusso?

1417
02:00:32,286 --> 02:00:32,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1421
02:00:36,024 --> 02:00:36,264

[SPEAKER_10]: President Caviello.

1423
02:00:37,785 --> 02:00:38,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1424
02:00:39,666 --> 02:00:42,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, another negative.

1425
02:00:42,387 --> 02:00:45,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank all my colleagues and I thank everyone.

1426
02:00:45,529 --> 02:00:46,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the budget.

1427
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:49,171
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're under suspension.

1428
02:00:52,872 --> 02:01:06,397
[SPEAKER_07]: 177553, petition for sign denial reversal by Anita Fletcher of Ultimate Tango, 5 High Street, unit B2 and 3, Medford, Mass.

1429
02:01:07,098 --> 02:01:14,300
[SPEAKER_07]: OCD application 2017 exceeds allowable sign limit over public law.

1430
02:01:16,381 --> 02:01:19,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Marks is the chairman of the sign committee.

1431
02:01:19,863 --> 02:01:20,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Marks.

1432
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:22,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1433
02:01:22,392 --> 02:01:23,614
[SPEAKER_05]: If the petitioner is here.

1434
02:01:23,634 --> 02:01:26,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, she is.

1435
02:01:26,318 --> 02:01:28,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Just explain to the council what you'd like to do.

1436
02:01:29,952 --> 02:01:30,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1437
02:01:30,193 --> 02:01:31,294
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Anita Flater.

1438
02:01:31,314 --> 02:01:36,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the manager of the Ultimate Tango Dance School.

1439
02:01:36,098 --> 02:01:38,981
[SPEAKER_01]: We just moved here from Somerville.

1440
02:01:39,041 --> 02:01:40,342
[SPEAKER_01]: We're opening August 1st.

1441
02:01:41,383 --> 02:01:46,368
[SPEAKER_01]: And we basically put the application for the sign over the sidewalk.

1442
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:51,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to thank you all for having me here.

1443
02:01:51,633 --> 02:01:54,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very interesting experience to see how this works.

1444
02:01:55,356 --> 02:02:01,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that you guys, whatever the decision, you guys doing your job and you want the best for the Medford.

1445
02:02:02,219 --> 02:02:11,042
[SPEAKER_01]: From our part, basically we did our research about what will fit the historic look of Medford City.

1446
02:02:11,082 --> 02:02:18,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did our research to find the sign that matches the style of the building of 5 High Street, which has a very unique round facade.

1447
02:02:20,385 --> 02:02:35,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself study art restoration back in my country of Poland, as I mentioned in my letter, so I can say that I have some experience with the historic art and restoration and preservation.

1448
02:02:35,871 --> 02:02:43,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as I mentioned in my letter, I would not propose something that is in disagreement of the historic appearance of Medford.

1449
02:02:45,135 --> 02:02:47,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now our application was refused because of the size

1450
02:02:48,627 --> 02:02:59,270
[SPEAKER_01]: The sign is perpendicular towards the building, so according to the rules, it should not exceed four square feet.

1451
02:02:59,950 --> 02:03:04,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Our sign, together with all the brackets that hold it, is 16 square feet.

1452
02:03:05,812 --> 02:03:11,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it doesn't follow the rules, but I think it matches size-wise.

1453
02:03:11,873 --> 02:03:15,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Size-wise, it matches the appearance of the building, the small size.

1454
02:03:15,692 --> 02:03:19,755
[SPEAKER_01]: two by two feet is just going to look kind of funny on the building this size.

1455
02:03:20,736 --> 02:03:22,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that's all I'm going to say.

1456
02:03:22,417 --> 02:03:24,178
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for your advice.

1457
02:03:25,499 --> 02:03:28,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, madam chair recognizes Chairman Marks.

1458
02:03:29,962 --> 02:03:40,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Mr. President, um, we currently have, uh, two requests, uh, in subcommittee right now, business and economic, uh, development and signs.

1459
02:03:41,771 --> 02:03:44,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, one is, uh, for another sign permit at five high,

1460
02:03:45,648 --> 02:04:05,461
[SPEAKER_05]: which is right next door to your sign, and one on High Street, and I would ask that this paper be referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development and Science for the purpose of discussion and review, and then potential reporting out of the paper, Mr. President.

1461
02:04:07,723 --> 02:04:11,485
[SPEAKER_08]: On that motion, Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1462
02:04:12,630 --> 02:04:15,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I can certainly understand why the Chairman made this motion.

1463
02:04:16,132 --> 02:04:22,936
[SPEAKER_14]: In the past, we've had a number of requests for signs that have been put into subcommittee, especially at this particular location.

1464
02:04:23,876 --> 02:04:25,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I can understand why the Council wants to do it.

1465
02:04:25,817 --> 02:04:33,922
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like this sign is going to be next to where another proposed sign has been, an application has been submitted for another proposed sign.

1466
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:42,202
[SPEAKER_14]: The business owner of the building has given letters of support in the past as to what it is he'd like to see, and I think that that's something that we might require here.

1467
02:04:42,582 --> 02:04:45,323
[SPEAKER_14]: But in terms of the design of the sign, Mr. President, I think it's a nice design.

1468
02:04:45,803 --> 02:04:56,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it does fit in with the historical nature of the square, and provided that the building doesn't look like a NASCAR, you know, car with advertisements slapped all over it.

1469
02:04:56,686 --> 02:05:02,988
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that I don't think I'll have a problem supporting, but I do think that Councilman Marks is making a proper and appropriate suggestion that it go through the subcommittee process.

1470
02:05:03,357 --> 02:05:05,939
[SPEAKER_14]: so that we can take a look at the whole picture and the whole building at once.

1471
02:05:06,379 --> 02:05:08,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But I agree, it's a classy sign proposal.

1472
02:05:08,581 --> 02:05:16,827
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks that the paper be sent to subcommittee, on that motion, Madam Councilor Langel-Kern.

1473
02:05:17,168 --> 02:05:21,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1474
02:05:22,672 --> 02:05:23,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that the only sign you have?

1475
02:05:23,873 --> 02:05:26,435
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you opened in August, you don't have any signage right now?

1476
02:05:26,915 --> 02:05:27,936
[SPEAKER_01]: No other signage at all.

1477
02:05:32,321 --> 02:05:41,885
[SPEAKER_16]: I just have a... I want everything to be consistent as well, but with us going into summer meetings and to have... Oh, you're opening in August?

1478
02:05:42,125 --> 02:05:42,885
[SPEAKER_16]: August 1st, yes.

1479
02:05:42,905 --> 02:05:43,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, August 1st.

1480
02:05:45,606 --> 02:05:47,747
[SPEAKER_16]: I just am concerned with the time frame.

1481
02:05:47,787 --> 02:05:52,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully, we just want her to be able to get her sign as soon as possible.

1482
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:55,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councillor Knight.

1483
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:59,072
[SPEAKER_14]: It's being referred to subcommittee and the summer meeting schedule doesn't have any reflection

1484
02:06:00,904 --> 02:06:01,905
[SPEAKER_14]: subcommittee meeting schedules.

1485
02:06:01,925 --> 02:06:05,006
[SPEAKER_14]: The subcommittee schedule is usually, uh, taken care of by the chairman.

1486
02:06:05,026 --> 02:06:10,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand we get into vacation schedule and stuff like that, but I'm sure that, um, it's based upon the leadership of counselor marks.

1487
02:06:10,049 --> 02:06:13,111
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that could happen in short order.

1488
02:06:13,131 --> 02:06:22,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I could, if you would like, yes, Mr. Chairman, the subcommittee called for an emergency meeting, uh, back several weeks ago to address the signs that would be for us.

1489
02:06:23,758 --> 02:06:29,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, one out of the three petitioners, uh, presented at the time,

1490
02:06:29,842 --> 02:06:33,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So we handled that one petitioner, and we left the other two in subcommittee.

1491
02:06:34,464 --> 02:06:40,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked Ed Finn just recently, City Clerk Finn, to reach out to the petitioners to see if they're still interested.

1492
02:06:40,947 --> 02:06:42,588
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were told they are.

1493
02:06:42,988 --> 02:06:47,630
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will call a meeting in short order to discuss this, I can assure you.

1494
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:49,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1495
02:06:50,652 --> 02:06:52,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Councilor, you're satisfied?

1496
02:06:52,394 --> 02:06:53,154
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel better, yeah.

1497
02:06:53,254 --> 02:06:55,436
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we have a meeting July 18th, so.

1498
02:06:56,157 --> 02:06:59,259
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have the federal holiday coming up next week as well.

1499
02:07:02,922 --> 02:07:04,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1500
02:07:04,444 --> 02:07:06,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Move the question, Mr. President.

1501
02:07:06,545 --> 02:07:09,768
[SPEAKER_08]: On that, Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Bailey.

1502
02:07:09,828 --> 02:07:18,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President and again, I know that that is in our subcommittee and it doesn't have to be, we don't have to wait till July 18th, correct?

1503
02:07:18,529 --> 02:07:19,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

1504
02:07:19,130 --> 02:07:24,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the whole idea is finding out when the other two petitioners can do it.

1505
02:07:24,376 --> 02:07:32,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for the least, the two of us can sit down and figure out when we can do it so we can get this whole subcommittee to make a decision and then report it out in time for July 18th.

1506
02:07:32,525 --> 02:07:32,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1507
02:07:32,845 --> 02:07:33,066
[SPEAKER_02]: For the 18th.

1508
02:07:33,186 --> 02:07:33,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1509
02:07:33,446 --> 02:07:33,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1510
02:07:35,435 --> 02:07:42,060
[SPEAKER_08]: So on that motion that the paper go to the subcommittee on science, business, and economic development.

1511
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:43,281
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1512
02:07:43,461 --> 02:07:43,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1513
02:07:43,581 --> 02:07:44,082
[SPEAKER_00]: All those opposed?

1514
02:07:44,102 --> 02:07:45,282
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

1515
02:07:45,943 --> 02:07:53,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Next item on the agenda is a return to the regular order of business on the motion of Councilor Knight.

1516
02:07:53,849 --> 02:07:55,270
[SPEAKER_08]: As such, all those in favor?

1517
02:07:55,550 --> 02:07:55,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1518
02:07:55,690 --> 02:07:56,511
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1519
02:07:56,531 --> 02:07:58,893
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion carries.

1520
02:07:58,913 --> 02:08:01,174
[SPEAKER_08]: 17-551, offered by Vice President Marks.

1521
02:08:01,695 --> 02:08:04,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Be resolved that the Eversource Energy Project

1522
02:08:04,966 --> 02:08:07,248
[SPEAKER_08]: be discussed on behalf of Metro residents.

1523
02:08:07,968 --> 02:08:09,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Marks.

1524
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:11,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1525
02:08:11,551 --> 02:08:17,997
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that are not aware, Eversource will be doing a major project in our community.

1526
02:08:18,997 --> 02:08:24,382
[SPEAKER_05]: We were notified roughly a year and a half ago that this would take place sometime

1527
02:08:25,112 --> 02:08:33,117
[SPEAKER_05]: in the year 2017, and now the project, from my understanding, is moving forward, Mr. President.

1528
02:08:33,637 --> 02:08:51,367
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a public hearing where Eversource did appear before the council at my request a while back to allow for residents to come and ask some of the concerns they may have regarding the project, and after that hearing, I didn't hear anything else.

1529
02:08:51,946 --> 02:09:06,197
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm bringing up the issue tonight, Mr. President, because this project is going to have a major impact on residential homes along Winthrop Street, Salt Street, and the Mystic Ave area.

1530
02:09:06,217 --> 02:09:12,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have a major impact on traffic in the community for a period of time.

1531
02:09:13,016 --> 02:09:17,359
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Winthrop Street area.

1532
02:09:17,379 --> 02:09:25,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It has already several thousand vehicles per day, including trucks and MBTA buses that go down Winthrop Street.

1533
02:09:25,843 --> 02:09:41,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And this eight-mile project, which starts in Woburn, goes through Winchester, and then into Meffitt from the Meffitt-Winchester line, down Winthrop Street, down South Main to Mystic Ave,

1534
02:09:42,092 --> 02:09:48,477
[SPEAKER_05]: which is roughly, I believe, about 2.3 miles in our city out of the 8.1 miles.

1535
02:09:49,258 --> 02:09:54,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a number of questions that need to be answered regarding this project.

1536
02:09:54,962 --> 02:10:04,870
[SPEAKER_05]: As we all know, the project is to put an underground utility, electrical utility, which is going to involve the digging of manhole,

1537
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:10,011
[SPEAKER_05]: installations within our street.

1538
02:10:10,571 --> 02:10:16,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Also the trenching of roughly, if you could take a conversation on the hallway, I'd appreciate it, thank you.

1539
02:10:16,534 --> 02:10:20,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, I apologize.

1540
02:10:21,096 --> 02:10:30,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So roughly two miles of trenching and excavation to install the pipe within the street itself.

1541
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:35,922
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna have cabling, which is gonna be extensive, the pulling of cable,

1542
02:10:36,368 --> 02:10:37,689
[SPEAKER_05]: the length of this project.

1543
02:10:38,389 --> 02:10:45,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cable, from my understanding, is going to be inside a pipe, which is also going to be filled with fluid.

1544
02:10:46,452 --> 02:10:48,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And because it's an electrified

1545
02:10:51,091 --> 02:10:57,594
[SPEAKER_05]: this fluid protects, I guess, the cable itself from any type of nicks or so forth.

1546
02:10:58,094 --> 02:11:00,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a very extensive project, Mr. President.

1547
02:11:01,576 --> 02:11:12,201
[SPEAKER_05]: The manhole structures right now, from what I read in the report, there's gonna be 19 precast concrete vaults located underground.

1548
02:11:12,791 --> 02:11:16,732
[SPEAKER_05]: eight feet wide by 20 feet long and six feet high.

1549
02:11:17,112 --> 02:11:21,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can imagine the size of the hole they're gonna be digging in the street.

1550
02:11:21,553 --> 02:11:25,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Each manhole would take roughly seven to 10 days to install.

1551
02:11:25,774 --> 02:11:32,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So 19 precast manholes are gonna be the entire eight miles of the project.

1552
02:11:33,155 --> 02:11:40,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe in this city we're at least getting three or four of those manholes and maybe even more, Mr. President, so you can imagine

1553
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:59,339
[SPEAKER_05]: The manhole coupled with the trenching of a trench, maybe two feet wide, three or four feet deep on the same street is gonna cause a significant traffic delay and impact in the quality of life in many of our neighborhoods, Mr. President.

1554
02:12:00,939 --> 02:12:01,880
[SPEAKER_05]: The trenching will take,

1555
02:12:03,551 --> 02:12:12,796
[SPEAKER_05]: and it'll be roughly 100 to 200 feet per day, and that's followed by roughly 10 to 18 days of construction.

1556
02:12:13,717 --> 02:12:18,519
[SPEAKER_05]: So meanwhile, they're gonna be doing the manhole, the giant manhole concrete vaults.

1557
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:32,827
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also gonna be doing the trenching, and every 100 to 200 feet, they're gonna have to stop and do the cable pulling, the installation of the pipes, and a lot of work involved with that, Mr. President.

1558
02:12:33,258 --> 02:12:39,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So tonight's resolution is the fact that this is supposed to be starting once it's approved.

1559
02:12:39,823 --> 02:12:41,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the first quarter of 2017.

1560
02:12:43,627 --> 02:12:45,268
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm not mistaken, we're in June now.

1561
02:12:45,308 --> 02:12:48,350
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to be in the first quarter of 2017.

1562
02:12:48,771 --> 02:12:50,352
[SPEAKER_05]: This project is about to start.

1563
02:12:51,013 --> 02:12:56,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have seen very little communication between the city

1564
02:12:56,780 --> 02:13:01,205
[SPEAKER_05]: and the neighborhood and the direct abuttance on this project.

1565
02:13:01,245 --> 02:13:05,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a number of motions, Mr. Clerk, I'll pass them along to you.

1566
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:10,875
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's only appropriate that this council

1567
02:13:11,312 --> 02:13:17,356
[SPEAKER_05]: and the community received the traffic impact study, which was done according to the information I read.

1568
02:13:18,117 --> 02:13:20,838
[SPEAKER_05]: The noise impact study of the digging and the trenching.

1569
02:13:22,339 --> 02:13:29,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the host community agreement exist between Eversource and the city of Method to ensure that all the agreements are carried out?

1570
02:13:30,425 --> 02:13:38,030
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure right now if there is a host agreement between us and Eversource, that's very important, so we know that whatever's agreed upon

1571
02:13:39,285 --> 02:13:41,586
[SPEAKER_05]: is carried forth by Eversource.

1572
02:13:42,306 --> 02:13:43,927
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the construction schedule?

1573
02:13:44,747 --> 02:13:47,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Will there be a staging area and where will they be located?

1574
02:13:48,388 --> 02:14:06,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We know from the project that the big FAST 14 project when they did all the 14 bridges in the heart of the square over on 93, they had several staging areas throughout the city and that always poses a concern for residents of the community

1575
02:14:06,442 --> 02:14:08,463
[SPEAKER_05]: that may be abutting one of these work areas.

1576
02:14:09,584 --> 02:14:11,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's very important to find that out.

1577
02:14:13,185 --> 02:14:15,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident notification and outreach methods.

1578
02:14:15,927 --> 02:14:26,692
[SPEAKER_05]: We were told when Eversource appeared before us that they'd have a telephone hotline and email address that was available and manned 24 hours a day during construction.

1579
02:14:27,153 --> 02:14:30,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna make sure that that is still adhered to.

1580
02:14:31,075 --> 02:14:31,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And,

1581
02:14:32,657 --> 02:14:36,799
[SPEAKER_05]: The report I read, Mr. President, talks about electromagnetic fields.

1582
02:14:37,659 --> 02:14:45,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess this underground wire is going to emit electromagnetic fields, and there is a potential health risk.

1583
02:14:46,217 --> 02:14:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't read the 300 pages from the study, to be quite honest with you, but I read some of it, and the health risk is, Mr. President, at spliced areas.

1584
02:14:56,840 --> 02:15:12,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So where they splice the wires together at certain connection zones in these vaults, it emits this electromagnetic field, and if you happen to live in close proximity and you're a newborn or a young child, they're at higher risk for exposure.

1585
02:15:12,944 --> 02:15:27,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is some concern out there, and it was addressed by Eversource, or is being addressed, I should say, by Eversource, to try to mitigate that by putting certain barriers around the splicing and so forth.

1586
02:15:28,193 --> 02:15:35,178
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way I understand it, not all the electromagnetic fields can be eliminated.

1587
02:15:35,258 --> 02:15:37,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a concern, Mr. President.

1588
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:40,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that we have a meeting on this.

1589
02:15:41,047 --> 02:15:48,772
[SPEAKER_05]: with Eversource, with the city engineer, with the Department of Public Works, and with the mayor's office, pretty quickly, Mr. President.

1590
02:15:48,792 --> 02:15:49,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee of the Whole?

1591
02:15:50,013 --> 02:16:03,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee of the Whole, because this project, when it starts, it's gonna move forward quickly, and when residents can't get into their driveway because they're trenching in front of a driveway for a period of time, it's gonna be a concern.

1592
02:16:04,362 --> 02:16:10,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know what happened with some of the blasting that's going on on Winthrop Street, that communication sometimes

1593
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:22,916
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't get out in the manner it should, and this is only a reason why we should move forward with this and put forward the public awareness, Mr. President.

1594
02:16:23,403 --> 02:16:26,004
[SPEAKER_05]: that every resident should be getting notified.

1595
02:16:26,664 --> 02:16:42,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be my motion, Mr. President, that all these particular traffic study, noise impact, be submitted to the council, and that a committee of the whole be set up with the administration, the traffic engineer, DPW, and Eversource to discuss this project.

1596
02:16:42,948 --> 02:16:43,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1597
02:16:44,148 --> 02:16:44,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1598
02:16:45,428 --> 02:16:47,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks, thank you for bringing this issue forward.

1599
02:16:47,429 --> 02:16:50,330
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it's about time we start talking about this project.

1600
02:16:50,390 --> 02:16:51,430
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna be right around the corner.

1601
02:16:52,074 --> 02:16:57,977
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly think that your resolution is one that's rooted in common sense, and it's something that we certainly need to look into.

1602
02:16:58,557 --> 02:17:04,140
[SPEAKER_14]: The question that I have is, would a committee of the whole be beneficial, or do you think that moving forward with a community meeting might be of help?

1603
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:11,164
[SPEAKER_14]: If we have a community meeting, then we can have Eversource come and give yet another presentation on the project, and then maybe have some input from the residents in the community as well.

1604
02:17:11,204 --> 02:17:17,647
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have our own questions, but sometimes I feel as though when we paint something as a committee of the whole, we have a lack of interest and a lack of involvement.

1605
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:27,381
[SPEAKER_14]: If we paint something as a community meeting, and we ask the individuals in the community to come out and express some of their concerns, we might get a better turnout and some more constructive involvement from the personnel in the community.

1606
02:17:28,002 --> 02:17:29,524
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's the councilor's motion.

1607
02:17:29,584 --> 02:17:31,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I support it wholeheartedly the way he wants to go.

1608
02:17:31,747 --> 02:17:32,788
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just merely a suggestion.

1609
02:17:32,808 --> 02:17:36,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I could?

1610
02:17:36,232 --> 02:17:37,193
[SPEAKER_14]: We can do both for that matter.

1611
02:17:38,447 --> 02:17:41,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not opposed to a public hearing on that.

1612
02:17:42,593 --> 02:17:46,638
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing is, I think there are a lot of issues that we really need to sit down and iron out.

1613
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:54,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it is regarding the mitigation and other issues regarding the digging and so forth that may get lost.

1614
02:17:55,309 --> 02:17:58,830
[SPEAKER_05]: at a public hearing, but I'm not opposed to doing either or both.

1615
02:17:59,411 --> 02:18:04,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we do the committee of the whole first and move forward as Councilor Moxley will get some of those technical questions answered.

1616
02:18:04,073 --> 02:18:06,293
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if we see fit, we can move forward with a community meeting.

1617
02:18:06,313 --> 02:18:08,234
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at some point in time, we're going to have to do it regardless.

1618
02:18:09,135 --> 02:18:09,415
Okay.

1619
02:18:09,615 --> 02:18:09,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1620
02:18:10,671 --> 02:18:11,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Russo.

1621
02:18:11,812 --> 02:18:13,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you.

1622
02:18:13,092 --> 02:18:14,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm grateful for this presentation tonight.

1623
02:18:15,493 --> 02:18:29,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I will amend this paper that the Director of the Board of Health be invited to attend the meeting and that she prepare herself by researching the impact of these electromagnetic fields.

1624
02:18:30,161 --> 02:18:34,743
[SPEAKER_08]: They can be disruptive to other equipment, power equipment, and personal

1625
02:18:35,109 --> 02:18:36,450
[SPEAKER_08]: health devices as well.

1626
02:18:36,991 --> 02:18:42,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the vulnerable among us need to be protected and educated in a special way.

1627
02:18:43,156 --> 02:18:43,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1628
02:18:43,797 --> 02:18:55,047
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could ask my fellow councilors, seeing that we have a couple of pending councilors to email me your vacation schedules for July, so we can get this in as soon as possible.

1629
02:18:55,107 --> 02:18:59,371
[SPEAKER_07]: This way we can make sure everyone is able to attend the meeting.

1630
02:18:59,851 --> 02:19:01,453
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the fellow councilors could do that.

1631
02:19:02,177 --> 02:19:05,639
[SPEAKER_07]: the next couple of days so I can schedule something that's amicable to everybody.

1632
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:06,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1633
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:14,365
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Kern.

1634
02:19:14,405 --> 02:19:15,146
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1635
02:19:15,946 --> 02:19:16,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1636
02:19:18,488 --> 02:19:19,048
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended.

1637
02:19:19,068 --> 02:19:28,775
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-552 offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the council resolution tracking be discussed.

1638
02:19:29,575 --> 02:19:30,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox,

1639
02:19:31,458 --> 02:19:32,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1640
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:40,449
[SPEAKER_05]: The council resolution tracking is a very important system that the city clerk keeps track of all of our resolutions.

1641
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:48,039
[SPEAKER_05]: He puts a resolution number, he dates it, who it's offered by, the resolution, a little blurb on what the resolution is.

1642
02:19:49,427 --> 02:19:57,891
[SPEAKER_05]: who it's referred to, typically they're referred to the mayor, and then the mayor refers them to department heads or delegates them to wherever they need to go.

1643
02:19:57,911 --> 02:20:03,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And a date they're referred, Mr. President, and a date we get a response.

1644
02:20:04,854 --> 02:20:18,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And I happen to go through the latest list that the city clerk provided, and I'm a little troubled to see that some of the resolutions that we're offering as a council, we have yet to receive

1645
02:20:19,367 --> 02:20:20,488
[SPEAKER_05]: a department response.

1646
02:20:21,428 --> 02:20:32,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these are very important issues, Mr. President, and they date back, I know the list we got was from January 3rd, 2017 to June 6th of this year.

1647
02:20:33,893 --> 02:20:37,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are many resolutions back in January.

1648
02:20:38,015 --> 02:20:42,257
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance, we had one that council set up a community meeting

1649
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:44,092
[SPEAKER_05]: for how the city should be developed.

1650
02:20:45,594 --> 02:20:47,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And that has yet to be answered.

1651
02:20:48,198 --> 02:20:53,006
[SPEAKER_05]: We had one that was meeting with the developer of the Malden Hospital site.

1652
02:20:53,867 --> 02:20:55,589
[SPEAKER_05]: That has yet to have any answer.

1653
02:20:56,471 --> 02:20:57,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Pop-up community spaces.

1654
02:20:58,373 --> 02:21:00,854
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sent to OCD, never answered.

1655
02:21:02,054 --> 02:21:15,898
[SPEAKER_05]: MBTA idling buses at the corner of Winthrop and Plaisted, as far as this list shows, it was sent to the MBTA, but we have yet to get a response back on that, according to the resolution tracking.

1656
02:21:15,918 --> 02:21:24,881
[SPEAKER_05]: A plaque up at the high school, the William Edgley Memorial plaque, we asked the superintendent of schools,

1657
02:21:27,103 --> 02:21:40,346
[SPEAKER_05]: a business member that actually was here that left just a little while ago, that that plaque be refurbished, Mr. President, and replaced in an area that's prominent and not overgrown and unkept.

1658
02:21:40,946 --> 02:21:44,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, it's in an area right now that's overgrown and unkept.

1659
02:21:45,227 --> 02:21:52,129
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had an issue that was sent regarding discussion of the freight trains traveling through West Method.

1660
02:21:52,925 --> 02:21:55,586
[SPEAKER_05]: and we have yet to get a response from that.

1661
02:21:56,126 --> 02:22:01,008
[SPEAKER_05]: A cost estimate on repointing wall and replace wrought iron gates in Royal Park.

1662
02:22:01,829 --> 02:22:05,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I have yet to see a response from that that was offered by Councilor Knight, I believe.

1663
02:22:07,411 --> 02:22:11,333
[SPEAKER_05]: An update on traffic improvements and pedestrian safety in Wellington Circle.

1664
02:22:12,333 --> 02:22:14,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet to get a department response on that.

1665
02:22:14,814 --> 02:22:21,297
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some important issues that we have yet to receive and I offer this paper tonight, Mr. President,

1666
02:22:22,312 --> 02:22:33,376
[SPEAKER_05]: circle the wagons to make sure that when our papers are sent out, that if we don't get a response, that this council is on top of it requesting a response from the administration, Mr. President.

1667
02:22:33,716 --> 02:22:44,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes responses, even though there's a requirement by, I believe it's a city ordinance that requires a 10 day response, the response can merely be

1668
02:22:44,652 --> 02:22:50,555
[SPEAKER_05]: it's being sent to the Department of Engineering, and then the chase is on.

1669
02:22:51,116 --> 02:22:55,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to wait for the report, and that could take who knows how long.

1670
02:22:55,698 --> 02:22:58,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not just pointing out engineering, it could be any department.

1671
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:12,188
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's crucial as a council, we stay on top of these, and every time we get a council resolution tracking, I think we should make part of our committee report, or our discussions, a report back

1672
02:23:12,989 --> 02:23:15,410
[SPEAKER_05]: to the mayor asking where these papers stand.

1673
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:27,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the mayor should be tracking, these are her department heads that they're being referred to, and she should be tracking where they are and what the final destination and expected date is, Mr. President.

1674
02:23:27,735 --> 02:23:38,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask that we follow up and ask that these papers that I brought forward tonight be reviewed again for a response from the city administration.

1675
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:41,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1676
02:23:42,552 --> 02:23:45,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the resolution and second it.

1677
02:23:46,774 --> 02:23:54,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to ask my council colleague, Councilor Falco, through you if the tracking software is going to have any impact on the way that our resolutions are tracked moving forward, if he's aware.

1678
02:23:55,659 --> 02:23:56,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

1679
02:23:56,659 --> 02:24:01,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to thank you for the question.

1680
02:24:02,462 --> 02:24:08,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And the nice thing is with the legislative software, you will actually follow the resolution from beginning to end.

1681
02:24:08,924 --> 02:24:09,984
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it real time.

1682
02:24:10,024 --> 02:24:18,808
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see the handoffs, the dates, the times of when things were approved, what departments it was sent to, whether or not they were, you know, the questions were answered.

1683
02:24:19,468 --> 02:24:20,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all electronic.

1684
02:24:20,829 --> 02:24:21,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all online.

1685
02:24:21,609 --> 02:24:23,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And the nice thing is you'll be able to, it's all real time.

1686
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:29,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you went in, you'd say, okay, this resolution on, I don't know, fire hybrids went to the water department.

1687
02:24:29,612 --> 02:24:33,514
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll actually see when they got it, whether or not they responded.

1688
02:24:33,934 --> 02:24:35,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure if it follows up with like,

1689
02:24:36,848 --> 02:24:37,328
[SPEAKER_03]: over time.

1690
02:24:37,669 --> 02:24:45,073
[SPEAKER_03]: It might follow up with like, you know, if they don't respond within 10 days, maybe it'll ping them for, you know, a request or back.

1691
02:24:45,113 --> 02:24:46,774
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does track it.

1692
02:24:47,355 --> 02:24:48,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice that it's online.

1693
02:24:48,576 --> 02:24:49,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It holds everybody accountable.

1694
02:24:50,317 --> 02:24:56,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think it's a good feature that adds a lot of transparency to the process.

1695
02:24:57,461 --> 02:25:00,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it'll benefit everyone on this council.

1696
02:25:00,963 --> 02:25:02,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it'll benefit everyone in the city.

1697
02:25:02,665 --> 02:25:04,866
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very transparent product that will help all of us.

1698
02:25:05,208 --> 02:25:06,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1699
02:25:06,208 --> 02:25:10,330
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1700
02:25:10,390 --> 02:25:11,051
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1701
02:25:11,071 --> 02:25:11,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1702
02:25:11,831 --> 02:25:12,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1703
02:25:12,792 --> 02:25:14,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to take current papers under suspension.

1704
02:25:15,453 --> 02:25:18,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1705
02:25:18,874 --> 02:25:19,555
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1706
02:25:19,995 --> 02:25:20,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1707
02:25:21,676 --> 02:25:23,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Mox, being resolved.

1708
02:25:24,598 --> 02:25:31,345
[SPEAKER_07]: that the sidewalk in front of the fire station, Engine 2 on Harvard Avenue, be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1709
02:25:31,665 --> 02:25:32,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Marks.

1710
02:25:33,387 --> 02:25:35,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I don't know if people at home can see this.

1711
02:25:35,649 --> 02:25:40,914
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the actual sidewalk in front of Engine 2 on Harvard Avenue in West Bedford.

1712
02:25:41,615 --> 02:25:44,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It is crumbling at the very best.

1713
02:25:45,227 --> 02:25:52,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's in deplorable condition, not only for the engines that are leaving Engine 2, but also pedestrians.

1714
02:25:52,209 --> 02:25:54,370
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a highly traversed area.

1715
02:25:54,990 --> 02:26:07,794
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask, Mr. President, immediately, in the interest of public safety, as we heard from Councilor Lungo tonight regarding the budget, there was money left in accounts that were earmarked just for this particular purpose.

1716
02:26:08,454 --> 02:26:13,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And to see sidewalks like this, the condition, is unacceptable, Mr. President.

1717
02:26:13,552 --> 02:26:22,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask immediately that this, the length of the sidewalk in front of engine two on Harvard Ave be totally replaced in the interest of public safety.

1718
02:26:23,638 --> 02:26:24,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1719
02:26:24,118 --> 02:26:24,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Knight.

1720
02:26:25,199 --> 02:26:28,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, this is an issue that we just addressed down in Riverside Avenue.

1721
02:26:28,461 --> 02:26:38,447
[SPEAKER_14]: About a year ago, I went down to the Riverside Avenue fire station with Mayor Burke to take a look at the same exact issue that was happening in the driveway apron at the fire station, Riverside Avenue.

1722
02:26:39,005 --> 02:26:48,072
[SPEAKER_14]: And after some discussion with the firefighters on duty, we've determined that it's attributable to the chains that they put on the tires of the trucks and the weight of the vehicle that comes down.

1723
02:26:48,152 --> 02:27:01,441
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm hoping that as we move forward and we look at these issues in the community, we look at the type of material that we're using on these driveway aprons in front of our fire stations, because it's clear that the concrete asphalt mix that we have right now cannot withstand the test of time.

1724
02:27:02,122 --> 02:27:02,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1725
02:27:03,062 --> 02:27:06,365
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Vice President Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1726
02:27:08,210 --> 02:27:10,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

1727
02:27:10,471 --> 02:27:11,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Please call the roll.

1728
02:27:22,234 --> 02:27:23,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor DelaRusso.

1729
02:27:23,235 --> 02:27:23,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Affirmative.

1730
02:27:25,135 --> 02:27:25,956

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: President Caviello.

1741
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:37,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1742
02:27:38,401 --> 02:27:39,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1743
02:27:41,923 --> 02:27:55,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor DelaRusso, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council offer sincere condolences to the family of Rosemary Nalo, longtime secretary to the city clerk and register of voters.

1744
02:27:57,932 --> 02:27:58,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor DelaRusso.

1745
02:28:00,104 --> 02:28:25,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, Mr. President, that we have a number of condolences on there tonight, but Rosemary was a longtime employee here in the city of Medford, worked, I think she may have been retired before Ed came to power, but under the previous regime, she was there, a wonderful woman, a good mother, and a devoted and active person in our community.

1746
02:28:25,852 --> 02:28:28,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, and we have a couple more, so if we could wait before we do this.

1747
02:28:29,838 --> 02:28:39,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered, 17556, offered by President Caravello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its sincere and deepest condolences to the family of Joan Gorman.

1748
02:28:39,824 --> 02:28:49,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Gorman is the mother of Memphis School Community member, Erin DiBenedetto.

1749
02:28:52,051 --> 02:28:57,454
[SPEAKER_07]: 17559, offered by President Caravello and Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council

1750
02:28:58,019 --> 02:29:02,283
[SPEAKER_07]: send our sincere condolences to the family of Kyle Ziggy Bush Galuzzi.

1751
02:29:02,803 --> 02:29:05,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Kyle is best remembered for his weekly TV show on Channel 3.

1752
02:29:06,626 --> 02:29:09,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Galuzzi family.

1753
02:29:09,609 --> 02:29:10,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1754
02:29:11,310 --> 02:29:19,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I'd just like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest condolences to David and Matt and Suzanne and the grandkids on the loss of Kyle.

1755
02:29:20,137 --> 02:29:23,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the last couple of years, it's been very tough for the Galuzzi family.

1756
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:27,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt and Dave lost their mother about a year and a half ago, and they've lost their father.

1757
02:29:27,547 --> 02:29:28,187
[SPEAKER_14]: just this week.

1758
02:29:28,227 --> 02:29:31,389
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, I'd like the council to join me in offering our condolences.

1759
02:29:31,550 --> 02:29:32,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Kyle was a great guy.

1760
02:29:32,890 --> 02:29:41,296
[SPEAKER_14]: He'd always, uh, see him up there on the corner of Winthrop street and Whitney road, uh, the corner of Blakely road and Whitney road, um, hanging around, sitting on the porch.

1761
02:29:41,316 --> 02:29:44,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, he's always the first one to come up to you and shake your hand and tell you a funny story.

1762
02:29:44,438 --> 02:29:46,179
[SPEAKER_14]: And he'll be sadly missed Mr. President.

1763
02:29:46,199 --> 02:29:50,382
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

1764
02:29:50,442 --> 02:29:53,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I can say, you know, uh, Kyle was a good friend of mine for many years and, um,

1765
02:29:54,803 --> 02:30:05,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Every year I get the bag of tomatoes from Whitney Farm, and as they stop and I say, we were good friends over the years, a sad person to miss.

1766
02:30:05,846 --> 02:30:14,309
[SPEAKER_07]: 17558, offered by President Caravello and Councilor Knight, be resolved that the Memphis City Council send its deepest and sacred condolences to the family of Danny Menezes.

1767
02:30:15,089 --> 02:30:18,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Danny was a member of the Memphis Historical Commission and owner of a Ray Auto Center.

1768
02:30:19,451 --> 02:30:23,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Danny is married to Mary Menezes in our Department of Public Works.

1769
02:30:24,210 --> 02:30:26,091
[SPEAKER_07]: His presence in our community will be missed.

1770
02:30:27,392 --> 02:30:27,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Knight.

1771
02:30:29,073 --> 02:30:36,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I think that if we're all going to sit back and talk about some legislation that the council passed this year, one of the things that we did was a demolition delay.

1772
02:30:37,319 --> 02:30:41,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll tell you right now, I wouldn't have supported the paper if it weren't for Danny Menezi.

1773
02:30:42,483 --> 02:30:43,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Danny's a great guy.

1774
02:30:43,443 --> 02:30:47,726
[SPEAKER_14]: He was supporting historical preservation in the city of Medford before it was the cool thing to do.

1775
02:30:48,427 --> 02:30:51,069
[SPEAKER_14]: He was on the forefront of this issue, Mr. President, for a number of years.

1776
02:30:51,569 --> 02:30:52,210
[SPEAKER_14]: His involvement

1777
02:30:53,056 --> 02:31:03,804
[SPEAKER_14]: in the historical society, and his ability to find these old photographs and old articles about the city of Medford was something that I really enjoyed, and he's going to be sadly missed.

1778
02:31:04,205 --> 02:31:06,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I offer my condolences to Mary as well.

1779
02:31:06,206 --> 02:31:13,572
[SPEAKER_14]: She's a very hard worker, who's done a great job up there in the DPW office, and it's reflective on her work during the budget hearings that we just had, Mr. President.

1780
02:31:13,592 --> 02:31:14,733
[SPEAKER_14]: She had every answer to every question.

1781
02:31:15,433 --> 02:31:22,619
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to join me in extending our deep and sincere condolences to the Menizzi family on the recent passing of Daniel.

1782
02:31:23,284 --> 02:31:26,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And I ask that tonight's meeting be held in Danny's memory.

1783
02:31:27,166 --> 02:31:28,546
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could all rise for a moment of silence.

1784
02:31:29,767 --> 02:31:40,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President?

1785
02:31:40,332 --> 02:31:41,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

1786
02:31:42,072 --> 02:31:50,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if I could, because I think it's only appropriate that I just found out that Kyle Galluzzi passed away.

1787
02:31:53,911 --> 02:31:59,332
[SPEAKER_05]: stunned, but he was a dear friend, Mr. President, to a lot of people.

1788
02:32:00,152 --> 02:32:17,176
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, someone that was very active in the community and during a lot of big issues in the community gave people a format when he ran a show on local cable access, whether it was the building of the new schools or the Field of Dreams or

1789
02:32:17,526 --> 02:32:20,867
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever the issue was, he was out in the forefront.

1790
02:32:21,608 --> 02:32:41,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And when he opened up his globe on the Sunday morning and you watched his show, he spoke truly about what was going on in the city and spoke from a standpoint of a resident and not a politician, not anything else, but a resident and what the thoughts are on behalf of the city.

1791
02:32:41,676 --> 02:32:46,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am really taken back by the loss of him

1792
02:32:47,422 --> 02:32:48,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish his family well.

1793
02:32:49,343 --> 02:32:50,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, good man.

1794
02:32:50,063 --> 02:32:53,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say he'd come to my house and we all the time with his olive oil.

1795
02:32:53,685 --> 02:32:58,367
[SPEAKER_07]: And so with my, myself and my wife and the deck and the good man, he'll be missed there.

1796
02:33:00,127 --> 02:33:00,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Knight.

1797
02:33:01,768 --> 02:33:11,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if I could make a brief announcement this morning, I believe it was, I was driving to work and I was listening to the radio and on the radio, there was an individual that came on from Andover, Massachusetts.

1798
02:33:11,867 --> 02:33:20,749
[SPEAKER_14]: who had just appeared before the MBTA's fiscal control board relative to the issue of these communication towers that they're putting up along the commuter rail.

1799
02:33:21,550 --> 02:33:31,052
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, based upon the tone of the article and what was report, uh, the tone of the radio report and what was reported, um, it seemed as though the fiscal control board had some serious concerns over

1800
02:33:31,712 --> 02:33:35,275
[SPEAKER_14]: what's going on with these towers, almost like they didn't know what was happening.

1801
02:33:35,696 --> 02:33:38,979
[SPEAKER_14]: So I look forward to a report back from the MBTA on that, Mr. President.

1802
02:33:38,999 --> 02:33:42,041
[SPEAKER_14]: But I did want to provide some updates to the council based upon what I've learned.

1803
02:33:42,582 --> 02:33:46,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I've placed a call over to the legislative liaison at the MBTA to see if I can find out any more information.

1804
02:33:47,426 --> 02:33:52,491
[SPEAKER_14]: But just heard it this morning on the way to work, just last week or two weeks ago, we talked about the ordinance.

1805
02:33:52,671 --> 02:33:54,673
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is something that I want to keep in the forefront.

1806
02:33:54,753 --> 02:33:57,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is something we all want to keep in the forefront because the 73-foot tower

1807
02:33:59,356 --> 02:34:05,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Right behind Tyler Radley-Chawin Road in Medford isn't something that's going to add to our quality of life, and it's certainly not going to be an improvement to our community.

1808
02:34:06,362 --> 02:34:09,324
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to make that brief announcement.

1809
02:34:09,344 --> 02:34:10,786
[SPEAKER_14]: There should be more information forthcoming.

1810
02:34:11,446 --> 02:34:11,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1811
02:34:12,547 --> 02:34:12,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1812
02:34:12,767 --> 02:34:13,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Records.

1813
02:34:14,649 --> 02:34:14,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

1814
02:34:15,710 --> 02:34:17,231
[SPEAKER_07]: For Pastor Counselor Del Rosso.

1815
02:34:17,692 --> 02:34:20,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Del Rosso, how did you find the records?

1816
02:34:20,374 --> 02:34:22,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I read the records of the previous week's meeting.

1817
02:34:22,916 --> 02:34:24,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I find them to be in order and motion their approval.

1818
02:34:25,583 --> 02:34:30,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank you, motion by Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1819
02:34:30,718 --> 02:34:31,380
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1820
02:34:32,282 --> 02:34:33,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.
