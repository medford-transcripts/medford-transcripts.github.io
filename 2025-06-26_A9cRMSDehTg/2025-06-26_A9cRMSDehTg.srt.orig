[SPEAKER_13]: who will be taking minutes tonight.

39
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:05,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to have you here, Sal and Josh.

40
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:12,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first item on our agenda is a continued public hearing.

41
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:22,283
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a continued public hearing that was opened on April 2nd regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

42
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:32,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle or Alicia, do you have any kind of context you'd like to provide before we pass it off to Innis Associates?

43
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:46,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, I think that we've been discussing this a lot and that Innis Associates has a introduction to explain everything that needs explaining.

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:46,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

45
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:59,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and I understand we're going to be speaking primarily about accessory dwelling units, so very interested to hear about that topic in the context of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

46
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:02,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle?

47
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:05,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I wasn't able to unmute a little while ago.

48
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:08,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, just to add one more thing.

49
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Your volume is very low.

50
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:13,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

51
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:14,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

52
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:19,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?

53
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a little low, but okay.

54
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:25,591
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

55
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:36,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I won't say too much then, but basically, um, so we're not talking about the 80 years as a. As a public hearing to discuss or to devote on the 80 years, but.

56
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:49,798
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't really understand and discuss and vote on the neighborhood residential districts without knowing or understanding how the new ADU law interacts with it.

57
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,182
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you make one decision, what does that mean regarding the law?

58
00:03:55,383 --> 00:04:06,872
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were thinking that this would be a good meeting to kind of educate the board and the public so that we have a better understanding as these are kind of happening in tandem.

59
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:09,899
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, thank you.

60
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great approach.

61
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that context, Danielle.

62
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,303
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I'm going to hand it off to Emily and Paola of Ennis Associates.

63
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:20,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

64
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:20,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

65
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:21,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

66
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:22,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam chair.

67
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:22,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

68
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:24,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone for the record.

69
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:28,932
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Emily and associates and I'm here with my colleague Pelo Ramos Martinez.

70
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:37,658
[SPEAKER_10]: We are going to, as a planner, Evan said, we are going to present to you today information about.

71
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:38,859
[SPEAKER_10]: the ADUs.

72
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:55,235
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a number of questions, so first of all, we found the last public hearing extremely valuable in understanding people's questions, concerns, hopes for the zoning, but it was clear from some of the questions that ADUs and the new state law

73
00:04:55,715 --> 00:05:03,817
[SPEAKER_10]: are interacting with what we're looking at doing in terms of the overall zoning for the residential areas.

74
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,278
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's two things happening today.

75
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:15,500
[SPEAKER_10]: One is we would like to present you basically the background information, give you a sense of what the new law actually is and where

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,803
[SPEAKER_10]: The city has options within that law to make some changes and Paola is going to go through that with you.

77
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:34,448
[SPEAKER_10]: She's going to also update you as part of her presentation on some of the dates we have for the next few public listening sessions on the overall zoning project.

78
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:51,065
[SPEAKER_10]: And then with respect, we are going to ask you and Danielle and Alicia, I apologize if I'm jumping ahead on this, but just to frame the discussion, ask you all to continue the rest of the public hearing for May 7th.

79
00:05:53,487 --> 00:06:04,213
[SPEAKER_10]: In talking with city staff after the last public hearing, there's some additional research and analysis that we would like to do to answer some of the questions that people have.

80
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:16,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was clear in our check-in that we do want to continue to consider public input, change some of the boundaries.

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's, again, valuable information that came out of the public hearing.

82
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:39,524
[SPEAKER_10]: So that additional time would allow us to do some additional research based on the questions that we've heard and then come back and present that to you, the members of the board, and also the members of the public to help with that further conversation.

83
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,666
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where we're headed.

84
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:56,776
[SPEAKER_10]: some additional information tonight that we think the ADUs and understanding that will help with the discussions and then a request to continue so we can just have a little bit more time to address the information needed to answer some of the questions that we heard.

85
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:09,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that I'm going to turn it over to Pella for her presentation and then she and I both will be able to answer the board's or at least attempt to answer the board's questions afterwards.

86
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:15,959
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I may, thank you, everyone.

87
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:18,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Paola Ramos-Martinez.

88
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the senior designer, urban designer at Enos Associates.

89
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:28,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to share my screen to start with the presentation.

90
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:35,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you all hear me correctly?

91
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:36,344
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

92
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:36,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

93
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:37,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for checking.

94
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:51,295
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is my voice or something, let me know so I can maybe open the PDF.

95
00:07:52,235 --> 00:08:05,900
[SPEAKER_05]: As we always do in all of these presentations, to do a little bit of a process timeline, where are we, what are the next dates for public, for the CDB, for any of the topics that we are working on.

96
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:11,840
[SPEAKER_05]: when those opportunities are for public comments, and then we will go into the ADUs.

97
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,123
[SPEAKER_05]: As it was explained, today we're not going to see the draft that we are preparing.

98
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:29,349
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be for a different city board, because it hasn't been yet voted on the city council.

99
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:42,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're going to do is very generic, so not really in depth in the draft, but more the generic so that we understand where are we in that framework that gives us the 80 years.

100
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:51,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we know, we are doing the planning and permitting committee meetings.

101
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:56,685
[SPEAKER_05]: We have done, right now we are in the corridors.

102
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,507
[SPEAKER_05]: We are presenting the corridors and the ADUs.

103
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:09,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And the next one that we will have, we will bring again West Medford Square and the ADUs to discuss on April 30th.

104
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:13,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we are today in the city board.

105
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,833
[SPEAKER_05]: We are looking at there.

106
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:20,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, today's actually the 80 years, but it's in the bigger topic of the residential districts.

107
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:30,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in May 7th, we will have the next iteration so that we bring again the residential districts to be voted or discussed.

108
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:31,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

109
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:37,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have different public meetings.

110
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:41,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We will have the May 8th about squares and the ADUs.

111
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:49,763
[SPEAKER_05]: We will have the May 29th, other corridors, and then June 9th, parking and the TDM strategy.

112
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:53,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are we doing?

113
00:09:54,164 --> 00:10:10,039
[SPEAKER_05]: As we have said many times, but just for if anyone is joining again and is new to all of this process, what we're doing is to look in at the zoning, all of the zoning in Medford after the comprehensive plan was released in January 2023.

114
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was also the climate adaptation plan in April 2022.

115
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:33,386
[SPEAKER_05]: we are taking all of those strategies that were identified in those plans and introducing it in the zoning and changing and updating everything that needs to be updated in the zoning to follow what was identified in those plans.

116
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And we come with this.

117
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:39,596
[SPEAKER_05]: They come with this plan, which is the vision plan.

118
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:49,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're doing is going by the topics of the quarters squares, the residential districts, and those are the ones that we are looking at, uh, right now.

119
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:51,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um.

120
00:10:53,713 --> 00:11:03,775
[SPEAKER_05]: The accessory dwelling units, I've always, I think I've said it in several of the meetings, the city of Boston released an accessory dwelling unit guidebook.

121
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:09,417
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look for it on the internet, it's very easy to find and it has a lot of information.

122
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm using a little bit of their

123
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:19,223
[SPEAKER_05]: diagrams and how they presented it, because I think it's very simple and clear.

124
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:32,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So the ADUs, also known as accessory dwelling units, it's that extra dwelling unit that you can have in your house, but it has certain restrictions.

125
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:36,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is that accessory use is not really the main or principal use.

126
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:46,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Those ADUs can be internal, that means that it's inside the house, some part is being redone as a complete unit.

127
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:57,850
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be attached, so it's attached to the building and it can be a little bit inside and then the, for example, the entrance of that can be from the external, from the attached area.

128
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:05,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it can be detached, it can be a completely different building on its own that is in the same lot as the principal building.

129
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:15,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have these three typologies because usually we think as a detached, but let's think that also can be internal or attached.

130
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:21,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we doing the or why the state is interested in the ADUs?

131
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have many reasons.

132
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:30,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be by providing houses and care for a family member.

133
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:33,465
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be by aging in place so that they can

134
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:44,927
[SPEAKER_05]: The seniors of the house can move into the ADU, or the person that is taking care of the seniors can move into the ADU.

135
00:12:44,987 --> 00:13:00,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Downsizing from an existing home generates extra income, housing young adults, and mainly provides a lot of more space for family, friends, or that extra housing for the city.

136
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:30,397
[SPEAKER_05]: What an ADU must have is a full bathroom and kitchen, living areas that always are going to meet that size regulations, those minimum sizes for habitability, adequate light and ventilation, safe exit routes that are compliant with the safety regulations, all the codes, a design that enables fire department access in case of emergency, electric and water shut-off valves, and then sometimes, depending on where we are, is the sprinkler systems.

137
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:55,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So, to be clear, the ADU, it's not a garage, it has to be a dwelling unit by the code regulation, so it has to meet all the regulations that any other dwelling unit, even if it's main or in any way or form, has to follow.

138
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:16,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So how can be those ADUs and what they have in the guidebook for the city of Boston did, they separate them by typologies and these are in very small lots, medium lots and bigger lots and what are the different strategies that you can do.

139
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:21,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all different typologies that you could have being the pinkish area, the ADU.

140
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:34,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can be by splitting your own unit, by converting your attic, by adding another floor, converting the basement or extend into a rear yard.

141
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:37,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are the different ways that you could do it.

142
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:48,327
[SPEAKER_05]: In a medium lot size, you can adapt the garage, you can extend towards the backyard, you can attach an ADU on the side, or you can attach an ADU on a corner lot.

143
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:51,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have two main streets, let's say,

144
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,306
[SPEAKER_05]: facing a house.

145
00:14:56,327 --> 00:15:06,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when it's a bigger lot, you can attach an ADU in your front yard, build a mid-size ADU in your backyard, or build a large ADU in your backyard.

146
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And they describe and give examples of all of these different typologies.

147
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:17,713
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone is interested, I think that it's good to see it.

148
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:31,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the new law that Massachusetts passed in February, they give new definitions and they define what the Protect Use ADU.

149
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:33,138
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something new, we didn't have this before.

150
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:39,422
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what they do is use the Accessory Dwelling Unity ADUs as a protected use.

151
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that is something that every municipality has to follow.

152
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And what does it mean is an attached, detached, or internal ADU, as we saw before, that is located or is proposed to be located on a lot in a single-family residential zoning district.

153
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,523
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see what that means, the single-family residential zoning district.

154
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:08,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not larger in gross floor area than half of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling.

155
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:11,305
[SPEAKER_05]: or 900 square feet.

156
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So whichever is smaller.

157
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:15,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a restriction in size.

158
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:22,308
[SPEAKER_05]: It cannot be more than half of the gross floor area of your principal dwelling unit or 900 square feet.

159
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:26,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So whichever is more restrictive, that's the one that you would be able to do.

160
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:34,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And then an ADU that is non-conforming to zoning shall still qualify as a protected ADU.

161
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,142
[SPEAKER_05]: if it otherwise meets this definition.

162
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:46,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has to be in a single-family residential zoning district, and it has to have this restriction in the square foot.

163
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:50,109
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the single-dwelling residential zoning district?

164
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:54,812
[SPEAKER_05]: This is any zoning districts where single-unit dwellings are permitted.

165
00:16:55,592 --> 00:17:00,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is as of right or by special permit.

166
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:05,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So any district where we have single-unit dwellings or single family, also known as,

167
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:14,871
[SPEAKER_05]: as a buy right or special permit, then it's considered that they will have this protected use ADU.

168
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:20,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have the new also concept of a local ADU.

169
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:27,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And a local ADU is mainly, it doesn't follow those definitions.

170
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:30,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be in a single family residential zoning district.

171
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:35,118
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that protected ADU, it's all of

172
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It's everything that is not that protected ADUs.

173
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:45,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means the rules for that local ADUs is going to be made by the municipality, in this case Medford.

174
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:50,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't have to be restricted to a single family residential zoning district.

175
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:54,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And also it doesn't have to be restricted by the 900 square feet.

176
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we are going to separate.

177
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:04,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Protected use in one end that is protected by Massachusetts law and everybody has to follow.

178
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:10,242
[SPEAKER_05]: and the local ADUs that depends on the municipality that will adopt those.

179
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,007
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can decide, for example, not to have a local ADUs.

180
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:23,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So by law, there are some prohibited regulations that before were possible.

181
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:27,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, Medford had some of these regulations and right now are not possible.

182
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:35,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are owner occupancy requirement, minimum parking requirement, use and occupancy restriction, unit caps and density.

183
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:39,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So ADUs cannot be counted in any density calculations.

184
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:40,748
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not another dwelling unit.

185
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:43,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And then relationships to principal dwelling.

186
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:46,938
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a requirement to be attached or detached.

187
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,499
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot have any requirement.

188
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,139
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot ask.

189
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,880
[SPEAKER_05]: That was something that Medford had.

190
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now you cannot ask.

191
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,581
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be attached or detached and has different regulations.

192
00:18:58,382 --> 00:18:59,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It cannot be differentiated.

193
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:03,083
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are the prohibited regulations.

194
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:09,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what are, for municipalities, what can they decide?

195
00:19:10,476 --> 00:19:14,477
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can allow accessory dwelling units in any residential district.

196
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And this can be by right or by a special permit.

197
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:23,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have to follow the single dwelling unit district.

198
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be any residential district that we consider.

199
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:32,020
[SPEAKER_05]: It can allow bigger ADUs than the 900 square foot restriction.

200
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,612
[SPEAKER_05]: and it can allow additional ADUs on the same lot by a special permit.

201
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:46,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can allow a second ADU, but that second ADU or third ADU, if you want, those have to be by special permit.

202
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:48,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Those cannot be allowed by right.

203
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:59,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the short-term rental municipalities can establish any restriction or even prohibit that these ADUs are being used as short-term rentals.

204
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:15,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the protected ADUs, what we have are some dimensional standards that we already said about the restriction of the size is 900 square feet or half of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is smaller.

205
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:29,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is an important one that we are still working on, is that it can not have more restrictive dimensional standards than the ones that are required for the principal dwelling.

206
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:40,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that lot has a duplex or a single unit or a three unit, the ADU cannot have more restrictive dimensional standards than those.

207
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:45,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we are going to talk about setbacks.

208
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,571
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about height.

209
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:53,833
[SPEAKER_05]: We're obviously not talking about the square footage because that is restricted.

210
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:59,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So principal dwelling, the single family residential or accessory structure.

211
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:03,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And in these three is whichever is most permissive.

212
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:15,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So, for example, the accessory structure will tell us that the limitation for height is 15 foot, so around three and a half.

213
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,140
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the principal dwelling, it can be two and a half.

214
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I can do for my ADU is going to be that two and a half.

215
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:29,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be whichever is less restrictive from any of those three.

216
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:44,960
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look into what we have in the district that we were working on, the NR1, NR2, NR3, UR1, and UR2, what are those permitted building types?

217
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,101
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, NR1, we have single unit dwelling and then the historic conversion.

218
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:57,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Then in this, because we have that single unit dwelling, we have the protected use.

219
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:11,671
[SPEAKER_05]: if there is no local ADU by right, but there it could be a local ADU by a special permit and that means that as maximum units we will have the single unit.

220
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:25,135
[SPEAKER_05]: This we are going to exclude the historic conversion because we are still studying how we are going to divide that historic conversion if we can allow more units or it's just going to be one more than the districts allow.

221
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:28,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is still that's why I'm not putting it here whenever we have that

222
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,001
[SPEAKER_05]: answer, we will add it.

223
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:43,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So excluding the historic conversion for now, for example, for the NR1, we will have one unit plus the protected ADUs plus the local ADU by a special permit.

224
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:50,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll have at the end these three, in theory, special ADUs, dwelling units.

225
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: For the NR2, we will have the two units plus the protected ADUs plus local ADU.

226
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:58,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are four

227
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:07,562
[SPEAKER_05]: The NR3, we are still allowing single unit by right, so there we have the protected ADUs, so three plus the ADU plus local.

228
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:12,304
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the maximum units that we can have in this district, so it would be up to five.

229
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,085
[SPEAKER_05]: UR1, we would have.

230
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:23,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So in UR1 and UR2, because at this moment we do not allow the single unit, then it doesn't trigger the protected ADUs.

231
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:25,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we have done is

232
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:38,502
[SPEAKER_05]: we could allow the local ADUs, but not for every structure in here, but for the 1, 2, and 3, so up to three unit dwellings.

233
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:47,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we'd have the 3 plus the local ADU in this case, plus another local ADU, but in this case would be by special permit.

234
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:54,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the UR2 would be, again, here we don't have one or two units, so it doesn't trigger

235
00:23:57,545 --> 00:24:04,267
[SPEAKER_05]: protected ADUs, though it will be local ADUs by right, and then another local ADU by special permit.

236
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:06,347
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have that total of five.

237
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:12,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And up to here, there is also the issue of parking.

238
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:18,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something else that is regulated for the protected ADUs.

239
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:23,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that case, we have one parking.

240
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:26,773
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be required one parking if the

241
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:48,349
[SPEAKER_05]: lot if that parcel is outside of the half mile of high frequent transit, and the other one would be zero, they don't have to require any parking if it is within that half a mile of a higher frequent transit.

242
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:56,330
[SPEAKER_05]: The local ADUs, we could have different standards, so we could apply

243
00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:09,558
[SPEAKER_05]: larger square foot, larger dimensions, and we could apply different requirements, and we could allow different parking standards if that was something that would interest.

244
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:12,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of that, we are still working on the draft.

245
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,401
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I don't bring it.

246
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:17,664
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's say that that is not established by law, so we have more flexibility with those.

247
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:24,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm going to stop sharing and very welcome any questions.

248
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:41,174
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very informative.

249
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:46,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to open it up to members of the board to see if anybody has any questions.

250
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:58,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as a reminder, we're seeing this kind of as like a teaser, so we can keep it in mind as we are considering the neighborhood zoning in front of us.

251
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:42,060
[SPEAKER_15]: My question, and I think this is just kind of a potentially lack of creativity on my part, is I was looking at some of the zones and the different zones and the different structures within the zones where you're considering potential ADUs, and this is more of a general forum question.

252
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:57,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to think of like a triple-decker and like how you have an ADU in a unit in a triple-decker, if that's what that means when you're thinking about three, kind of three-unit building or something of that kind of form.

253
00:26:57,173 --> 00:27:02,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle, I see your hand.

254
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:08,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you, through the chair.

255
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:22,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Essentially, the reason why that they would be allowed for, you know, a three family and a two family could have an ADU is because a single family is allowed there.

256
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:36,431
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and I'm trying to get some clarity on this, but I believe that the, so you'd only have one ADU for the entire triple-decker in that case.

257
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:39,112
[SPEAKER_13]: So, not each unit doesn't get their own ADU.

258
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:46,662
[SPEAKER_13]: The triple-decker, that's the building, would be allowed to have an ADU.

259
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:57,234
[SPEAKER_13]: And the size limitation, my understanding, is based on the building, so the triple-decker itself.

260
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:02,130
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a peculiarity of the law.

261
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:11,153
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm trying, I think it's going to end up being sorted out by the courts because I haven't been able to get questions answered from any of the webinars I've been in.

262
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:17,615
[SPEAKER_13]: So say you have a triple-decker and each unit is 900 square feet.

263
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:28,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that mean you can add a 900 square foot ADU, which doesn't have like any real distinction from the other units?

264
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:35,581
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems kind of strange, but that seems to be what we would have to allow.

265
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:43,006
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of my concerns was, say, you have a nonconforming 9 unit building in a zone.

266
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:46,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Could they add the 10th one and not make it affordable?

267
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:48,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Could that be a loophole?

268
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,852
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's been lots of discussions about

269
00:28:53,933 --> 00:29:01,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we should allow single families in this zone, but everyone, you have to remember what the impact would that be with the new law.

270
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,818
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's, I wouldn't have written the law that way, but we are where we are.

271
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:13,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily.

272
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

273
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:31,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's one of the reasons that we're presenting this to you in a general aspect today, to let you know what the parameters are, because there, as Planner Evans says, there's quite a few questions out there still.

274
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:41,458
[SPEAKER_10]: We got an excellent email from the building inspector today, Scott, who said people need to remember, too, that while the zoning may allow

275
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:44,776
[SPEAKER_10]: the ADU to come in, the building code might not.

276
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:55,724
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Paola addressed some of that with that list of things that Boston has of the other things that you need to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to do an ADU.

277
00:29:55,764 --> 00:30:03,710
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, to that point about the triple decker, certainly one of the units could potentially have an internal ADU.

278
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:11,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Or there could be an addition to that triple-decker to add that ADU, or it could be a detached structure.

279
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:18,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe there's enough room in the back of the lot that the triple-decker is on that they could add one.

280
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:25,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the triple deckers, for example, the internal layouts are quite long.

281
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,013
[SPEAKER_10]: They're quite deep.

282
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you can see a small ADU.

283
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:31,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have to be up to the 900 square feet.

284
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:33,116
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be a smaller version.

285
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:37,177
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there's certainly some flexibility in the layout.

286
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:42,379
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think Planner Evans raises some good questions that have not yet been answered.

287
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,280
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we've had some more ourselves.

288
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:47,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

289
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,722
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been very informative.

290
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:49,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Annie?

291
00:30:52,302 --> 00:31:03,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Just, Emily, so a triple-decker has enough land, just say, per code, to add an ADU.

292
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:08,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that be cost-wide very prohibitive?

293
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:13,940
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one thing if it's attached, and it's a whole other thing to

294
00:31:17,715 --> 00:31:20,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Dig and pipe and the whole nine yards.

295
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,358
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my first question.

296
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:30,384
[SPEAKER_11]: And in general, my second question is, I was looking very carefully when Paula did her great presentation.

297
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:38,690
[SPEAKER_11]: If somebody has an ADU in some communities, they're allowed to rent them and other communities not.

298
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:46,395
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's each community to assess, is that correct?

299
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:55,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll address the first one and then Paola, you may be also helping to answer the second one.

300
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:06,676
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the first one, yes, that's another factor, right, is the zoning will allow the ADUs, the building code may further regulate it, and the ability for somebody to

301
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:12,100
[SPEAKER_10]: add an ADU is dependent upon their finances, right?

302
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,223
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not cheap to add an ADU.

303
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:20,447
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not cheap to build a new structure, even rehab an older structure for an ADU.

304
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:24,370
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something else too, especially right now, right?

305
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Commodity prices are up, interest rates are up.

306
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:29,594
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not easy to do.

307
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:44,616
[SPEAKER_10]: On the issue of rentals, so the, I think what Polly you were referring to was the short term rentals, that ability for communities to determine whether or not they're going to allow

308
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:51,522
[SPEAKER_10]: the ADU to be available for a short-term rental, so under 30 days.

309
00:32:51,602 --> 00:33:01,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly some of the communities, I was working in a coastal community, for example, that has a significant summer population, and they're very concerned about short-term rentals.

310
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:05,934
[SPEAKER_10]: However, for long-term rentals, the ADUs can be rented out.

311
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:08,996
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no restriction on a long-term rental.

312
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:10,918
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, that's one of the purposes, right?

313
00:33:11,218 --> 00:33:20,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola mentioned the aging in place, you know, that idea of being able to either have a caretaker or, you know, rentaling for extra income.

314
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:23,627
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the many functions of an ADU.

315
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:26,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that.

316
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,893
[SPEAKER_05]: No, yeah, I think you covered

317
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:34,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, it was only about the short term.

318
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:37,826
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about the renting any unit.

319
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:43,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, you don't have to be the owner of the principal building to rent it out.

320
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:47,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could rent both units or anything if you wanted.

321
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:49,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

322
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:53,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, if I may, I just wanted to add to

323
00:33:54,915 --> 00:34:10,603
[SPEAKER_05]: We also present this so that we understand that whenever we add that, and this is something that Danielle mentioned, whenever we add the single dwelling to any of our districts, that triggers that protected ADUs.

324
00:34:11,063 --> 00:34:17,566
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that then we will have that addition in any of the principal structures that we have.

325
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:22,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say that we have an NR4, and that NR4 would allow

326
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:32,813
[SPEAKER_05]: single unit, two, three, and four units, that means that that protected ADUs is triggered in any of those building typologies.

327
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:42,257
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to the four, that will be four plus protected ADUs plus the local ADU by special permit, that will give us the total of six.

328
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:50,640
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why also we give this so that whenever we say we will include that single unit, that will trigger that protected use.

329
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's helpful context.

330
00:34:56,718 --> 00:35:06,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And then can you walk me through from a process perspective how this is going to work with the planning committee?

331
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:10,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are they going to they're going to come out of it with recommendations?

332
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:12,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will come in front of us.

333
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:13,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

334
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:23,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, if I may, we're still working on what those local option 8 or the local ADUs would be.

335
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:26,714
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the restrictions from Medford's point of view?

336
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:31,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Will Medford allow a local ADU by special permit or not?

337
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,901
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are still part of the conversation.

338
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And if so, what are the restrictions on those?

339
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,685
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are still part of the conversation.

340
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:52,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point in our capacity as community development board members, if we wanted to provide input on those conditions, would we do that as a board member or would it be more appropriate for us to do that as a member of the public?

341
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:56,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's a question for Alicia or Danielle.

342
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:06,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam chair, if I might, I think that's actually a great question because I think that it is very valuable.

343
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:19,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a committee that's working on it and meeting regularly with the subcommittee of the council and the formal way for this board to have opinions would be through the later process.

344
00:36:19,908 --> 00:36:27,313
[SPEAKER_06]: If this board had a consensus opinion and wanted to say that and wanted us to just officially just convey that from the board,

345
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:30,756
[SPEAKER_06]: to that committee, we could absolutely do that.

346
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:37,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, hey, you know, in advance, they wanted to let you know if any individual member wanted to share their opinions.

347
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:42,448
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also honestly, it's really helpful to get that kind of perspective now.

348
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:49,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could do it as a member of the public, you could show up at a meeting, you could email or discuss it with me or Danielle.

349
00:36:52,623 --> 00:37:02,211
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit of me wants to say like, you know, all opinions are equal, but actually the opinions of this board are more, you know, are actually have, are more equal.

350
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:07,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's helpful to have sort of some insight early on.

351
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:17,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of why I just wanted to raise my hand is so the, to make sure that this group was aware that all of this has been presented to the council subcommittee that's been working on this.

352
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,986
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a strong leaning right now

353
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:31,010
[SPEAKER_06]: to allowing the special permit ADUs throughout the city to allow this second ADUs in all the districts.

354
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:41,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like because, and the reason I want you to have that awareness has a lot to do with the density that we're allowing in these zoning districts.

355
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I appreciate this presentation tonight.

356
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel it's really important that an NR2 is actually a location where

357
00:37:50,945 --> 00:38:02,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of parcels could by right have three units and by special permit have four, and that's just something that people should understand as we're doing this.

358
00:38:03,093 --> 00:38:10,138
[SPEAKER_06]: But if people wanted to weigh in on that, I mean, I guess I would invite you to do it however you feel comfortable.

359
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:16,642
[SPEAKER_06]: In order for it to be a board opinion, you'd have to do it in a public meeting and then filter it through.

360
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:19,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you as the chair could show up and speak on behalf of the board.

361
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:26,649
[SPEAKER_06]: but not unless you've gotten an opinion from the board, then you're just showing up as an individual member of the CD board.

362
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:34,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just, I want to respect the process and make sure that, you know, that committee is operating, you know, relatively independently.

363
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:45,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the reality is that they need your opinions and getting, if you all are thinking very differently than they're thinking,

364
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:49,292
[SPEAKER_06]: It would really extend the process a lot, right?

365
00:38:49,472 --> 00:38:50,732
[SPEAKER_06]: They come up with their ideas.

366
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:51,452
[SPEAKER_06]: They send it to you.

367
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:52,473
[SPEAKER_06]: We have public hearings.

368
00:38:52,953 --> 00:38:59,014
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so radical that it has to go back to the start of the city council and re-advertise.

369
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:02,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And that just really draws things out unnecessarily.

370
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:02,415
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

371
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:09,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't have a negative reaction to allowing ADUs through all zones.

372
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:22,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm curious if any other members of the board, if that kind of strikes them as inappropriate.

373
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:22,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Annie?

374
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:28,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's perfectly appropriate.

375
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:44,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think going into how families are structured and how, in a certain sense, families are going back to structures from a couple hundred years ago, and the fact that we want our city to be more

376
00:39:45,668 --> 00:39:54,331
[SPEAKER_11]: livable and not have people age out of a city or leave because it's too expensive to raise a family.

377
00:39:54,351 --> 00:40:03,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that having a nuclear family, an extended family, and having the ability, it seems to be a very good idea.

378
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:07,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's really thoughtful insight.

379
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:16,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, triple deckers were initially, um, I, you know, everybody's probably heard this, but, um, they helped people live in the city more affordably.

380
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:20,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this is like our generations version of the triple Decker.

381
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:24,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, I see you came off mute.

382
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:26,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah, I agree.

383
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I do think there.

384
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:34,492
[SPEAKER_15]: If if what the committee is saying, if what the city council committee is saying is looking at.

385
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:41,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Allowing the special permit ADUs in all zones, I think I agree with that.

386
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:57,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I do think it's appropriate to have the ADUs, and I do think particularly the special permit ADUs, because that does allow for review in case of something being kind of just geographically weird with the site.

387
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:02,907
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it should be, I do like that as it's structured.

388
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:13,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, can you confirm, I thought I heard that it was, well, can you just repeat what you said the committee was leaning towards?

389
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:22,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe they're leaning towards allowing the local ADUs by special permit in all zones.

390
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that, Danielle, am I remembering the same thing you're remembering?

391
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:27,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, through the chair.

392
00:41:27,923 --> 00:41:32,466
[SPEAKER_13]: My understanding is they want to allow

393
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:49,623
[SPEAKER_13]: I think locally to use by right for those one, twos, and threes to achieve kind of like parity with the zoning districts that would have them also by right for those building types.

394
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:51,865
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think that

395
00:41:53,265 --> 00:42:05,236
[SPEAKER_13]: So, up to the NR3 will allow the single families by right, so any of those building types, which goes up to the three family, I believe, would allow an ADU.

396
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:11,441
[SPEAKER_13]: So, in the other districts that don't allow singles, that we would have that local option to have an ADU.

397
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:27,928
[SPEAKER_13]: up to the 3-unit dwelling structure, so not for the 6-unit or 10-unit multiplex or multifamily, but to just to make it fair across the board.

398
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:28,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

399
00:42:29,028 --> 00:42:33,710
[SPEAKER_13]: And then whether to have a second ADU by special permit, whether

400
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:45,383
[SPEAKER_13]: in a single family zoning district, or when I say single family zoning district, I'm using the definition that the state uses as where they're allowed, not just only single families.

401
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:50,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Where was I going?

402
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:55,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, to allow the second one by a special permit.

403
00:42:56,208 --> 00:43:00,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Pella, you had that table in your presentation that I think was very effective.

404
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:03,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that could be a good tool

405
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:10,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, to communicate with the board in the future, just to show kind of, you know, what is allowed.

406
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, what is what is Medford proposing could be different.

407
00:43:15,744 --> 00:43:20,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, yeah, there's that line local by special permit.

408
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:23,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm assuming the gray is that it's not official, right?

409
00:43:25,476 --> 00:43:26,537
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, yes.

410
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:35,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever we trigger that protected ADUs or that second ADU, that will be a local by a special permit.

411
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:48,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we do not trigger that ADU, as Danielle said perfectly, to give that parity with the other, whenever we have a single or two or three, that single would be non-conforming.

412
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:53,977
[SPEAKER_05]: But in any case, we can allow in a single non-conforming to

413
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,156
[SPEAKER_05]: to have that ADU.

414
00:43:56,576 --> 00:44:04,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So anywhere in year one, year two, where you have that single two and three units, you would be able to add that local ADU by right.

415
00:44:04,582 --> 00:44:06,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So then that is the same as in the others.

416
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:18,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we would have that local ADU that second, if they want to add a second, if they have the space and if they follow the requirements, then you can add it by special permit.

417
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

418
00:44:24,603 --> 00:44:25,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily, I see your hand.

419
00:44:26,426 --> 00:44:27,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

420
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:41,646
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to confirm, I think maybe Paula touched on this, but you see the excluding historic conversion, the numbers before we've talked about in the past, that idea of historic conversion, allowing just one more unit.

421
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:43,528
[SPEAKER_10]: than what's allowed in the district.

422
00:44:43,588 --> 00:45:01,966
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to note that we did hear in the last, one of the reasons that this is excluded from the counts that she has below, is we heard in the last public hearing some suggestions that maybe historic conversion should be by size of unit rather than number of units because some of the

423
00:45:03,262 --> 00:45:05,404
[SPEAKER_10]: older homes are quite large.

424
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:12,549
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are considering that, and that's why it's not in this count here, because we're looking at that.

425
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:18,553
[SPEAKER_10]: So it just makes it cleaner to look at the single unit, two unit, three unit calculations here.

426
00:45:18,573 --> 00:45:20,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's helpful clarification.

427
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:30,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, I see your physical hand.

428
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:32,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

429
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:57,102
[SPEAKER_14]: I just had a question if there was any information on like historical demand for ADUs or just to get a sense of like, what are we really talking about from like a, like an impact perspective of like, what do we think is going to be the demand for going forward and if this comes to the city a lot as it is and

430
00:45:58,315 --> 00:45:59,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, maybe Emily can answer.

431
00:46:00,476 --> 00:46:00,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily.

432
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:02,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

433
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:20,166
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not positive on Medford itself, I'll defer to city staff for that, but there's a researcher named Amy Dain, D-A-I-N, and she did a in-depth research report, I believe it was last year.

434
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:25,050
[SPEAKER_10]: historical demand throughout Massachusetts for ADUs.

435
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:33,877
[SPEAKER_10]: What we can do is we can dig up that report and provide it to the city staff to include with the other materials that we've been providing for this project.

436
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:43,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that could be very helpful, but I think if I remember correctly, one of her findings was that throughout Massachusetts ADUs were not

437
00:46:45,948 --> 00:46:47,729
[SPEAKER_10]: used as much as expected.

438
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:54,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, to be fair, many communities had significant restrictions on, you know, they used to be called in-law apartments.

439
00:46:55,095 --> 00:46:58,699
[SPEAKER_10]: There were a lot of restrictions on how you could do them, how long you could have them.

440
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,101
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and her report takes that into account.

441
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:08,307
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the time she did her report, there were some communities who had relaxed some of those restrictions.

442
00:47:09,408 --> 00:47:12,952
[SPEAKER_10]: And it may be an interesting baseline for people to understand.

443
00:47:13,312 --> 00:47:18,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So, but it's been commonly mentioned in local planning circles, I think, could be a useful resource for people.

444
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:28,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will just share that it's hard to, like, we don't have historical because it's been something that's not really been allowed in Medford.

445
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:43,660
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will tell you there is pent up demand, because as this was moving through the, I think we started to allow some level of ADUs with the recodification time, and we started to get applications.

446
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,904
[SPEAKER_06]: And since the law has come out and been passed, we're seeing more and more applications.

447
00:47:48,944 --> 00:47:52,326
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have several in the pipeline right now that we're sort of trying to

448
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:55,861
[SPEAKER_06]: sort through, are these allowed as of right?

449
00:47:55,941 --> 00:47:57,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they meet with the zoning?

450
00:47:57,562 --> 00:48:09,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where some of this testing of like, what does it mean about setbacks and required front yard versus front yard versus, you know, and how does this all get applied?

451
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:17,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We have several in front of the building commissioner that he's been consulting with Danielle and myself right now that we're trying to figure through.

452
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:20,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's definitely a pent up demand

453
00:48:20,962 --> 00:48:23,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But that doesn't mean that suddenly everybody's going to build from.

454
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:27,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question, Adam.

455
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:33,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions from the board?

456
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:37,010
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, I can open it up to the public.

457
00:48:39,231 --> 00:48:40,792
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

458
00:48:42,312 --> 00:48:49,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to kind of set the stage here, typically for public comment, we only

459
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:54,234
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only looking for public comments on the new material that's been presented.

460
00:48:54,254 --> 00:49:04,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recognize that there's a good population of people on here, speaking to the number, not the quality, although you guys are all great as well.

461
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:20,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So ideally, the comments would be thoughts on ADU as applied to the neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

462
00:49:21,317 --> 00:49:28,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I say that is because we haven't seen the modifications from Ennis Associates based on the comments from last meeting.

463
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:28,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So

464
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:35,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the board hasn't seen them, not just anybody hasn't seen them.

465
00:49:36,512 --> 00:49:43,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the comments that were shared last meeting may be in process of being incorporated into the next iteration.

466
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:50,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want you to think that the comments and thoughts that you provided last meeting were disregarded.

467
00:49:51,236 --> 00:49:51,996
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in process.

468
00:49:52,436 --> 00:49:53,336
[SPEAKER_02]: They're currently baking.

469
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:58,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I'm trying to focus the comments on

470
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:04,492
[SPEAKER_02]: the ADU within the context of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

471
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:20,036
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, if you have had epiphanies over the past two weeks and wish to add additional insight that you did not get to share the last meeting, by all means, make your comment.

472
00:50:21,336 --> 00:50:22,757
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to hear as much as possible.

473
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:37,992
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're not gonna be voting on the neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts this evening, just to kind of set expectations for the board and members of the public.

474
00:50:39,163 --> 00:50:41,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'm going to read my standard spiel.

475
00:50:42,784 --> 00:50:44,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm now going to open up the public comment period.

476
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature.

477
00:50:49,086 --> 00:50:50,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to start clicking that now.

478
00:50:52,187 --> 00:51:04,770
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are using Zoom on your desktop, there should be a react option or a raise hand function.

479
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:09,499
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to click it once and you will be in the queue.

480
00:51:14,223 --> 00:51:20,348
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov before providing your comments.

481
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

482
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:33,800
[SPEAKER_02]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as it's not part of the public record.

483
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:48,476
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are having technical difficulties, please do use the chat to message Danielle or Alicia just to alert them that you're not able to participate, and we'll do everything we can to get your insight.

484
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Each participant will have two minutes to speak and be able to speak once.

485
00:51:56,461 --> 00:52:06,124
[SPEAKER_02]: If your comment goes beyond the two minutes, I usually offer a little bit of a warning period and then wrap it up with the final thought.

486
00:52:06,184 --> 00:52:11,006
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it goes beyond that, send an email, ocdmedford-ma.gov.

487
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:18,889
[SPEAKER_02]: We read all of the comments, so I encourage you to use that tool.

488
00:52:21,813 --> 00:52:26,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, I can manage the comment queue.

489
00:52:27,995 --> 00:52:30,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I see three hands raised.

490
00:52:32,036 --> 00:52:32,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to interrupt.

491
00:52:33,036 --> 00:52:34,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to do the timer.

492
00:52:34,497 --> 00:52:35,597
[SPEAKER_06]: You said two minutes?

493
00:52:35,677 --> 00:52:36,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

494
00:52:37,258 --> 00:52:38,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Two minutes, yes.

495
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:41,019
[SPEAKER_02]: If I said something other than two, then I misspoke.

496
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:41,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

497
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:43,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a very long day.

498
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:48,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it has for a lot of people on this call, and I appreciate everyone being here.

499
00:52:49,995 --> 00:52:52,616
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first speaker that I see is Judith Weinstock.

500
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:54,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

501
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:56,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

502
00:52:56,877 --> 00:53:00,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, it's Judith Weinstock at 144 Burgett Avenue.

503
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:04,940
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a little awkward for me to phrase, so bear with me.

504
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a question, and I think it's a question that combines zoning and building at the same time.

505
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:16,924
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm wondering if there is a way to include in documents somewhere

506
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:37,595
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you live on a 4,000 square foot lot and whether you want to request by right or you're in one of the zones that just allows, say, an ADU, is there a way to back into what the minimum lot size needs to be to, say, even accommodate

507
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:41,932
[SPEAKER_01]: the largest one ADU that you could potentially put on that lot.

508
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:51,655
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm talking about like a process of elimination where you would say, oh, gee, we're talking about a 4,000 square foot lot with a 1,300 square foot house.

509
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:56,676
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't be able to build more than 650 square feet.

510
00:53:57,336 --> 00:54:06,999
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the setbacks back, forward, sideways, height, is it possible to say what lot size would actually just be too small, period?

511
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:09,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's my question.

512
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:14,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like an ADU calculator.

513
00:54:14,262 --> 00:54:20,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something that would be by lot size, right?

514
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:30,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Because theoretically, if it's not permissible on 600 square feet, maybe it is on a 7,000 square foot lot.

515
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:33,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it would be helpful for me to even know

516
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:38,055
[SPEAKER_01]: that in terms of all of the building types.

517
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:43,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think it's a combination of zoning plus building department, right?

518
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:48,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it involves math from rules and regulations from both.

519
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:55,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just to ask a follow-up question, and I'm not being glib, I just want to make sure I'm getting your intent here.

520
00:54:55,503 --> 00:55:00,906
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you do with that information, or what conclusions would you want to test?

521
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,247
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that the only thing

522
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:06,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going, sorry.

523
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, I thought it was a movie coming on.

524
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:17,045
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I'm trying to get to is what, you know, where will it be impossible?

525
00:55:17,486 --> 00:55:19,907
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually, it's not a question of where it's possible.

526
00:55:20,227 --> 00:55:25,469
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a question of trying to back into almost where is it not possible to build.

527
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really helpful context.

528
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Judith.

529
00:55:34,903 --> 00:55:40,034
[SPEAKER_02]: The next commenter that I see is Cheryl R. I don't think it's a request to unmute.

530
00:55:40,054 --> 00:55:41,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just unmute you.

531
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:44,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

532
00:55:45,523 --> 00:55:48,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

533
00:55:49,306 --> 00:55:54,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just had a few procedural questions since we didn't see the new neighborhood zoning tonight.

534
00:55:54,450 --> 00:56:04,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wondering how far in advance you'll receive the copies for the presentation that we heard tonight and then two weeks ago, as well as the updated zoning language?

535
00:56:04,938 --> 00:56:10,221
[SPEAKER_12]: because I felt like when I went to look today just to see what was happening, there was nothing to see.

536
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:28,169
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know you need to prepare ahead of time and the public would like to have an idea of what's actually in the zoning ahead of time, just because the slides are nice, but don't really provide the in-depth information that you need, like the size of the lots, the amount of things that can be placed on them.

537
00:56:29,149 --> 00:56:30,170
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was hoping that

538
00:56:31,003 --> 00:56:37,067
[SPEAKER_12]: you could get the materials ahead of time for the next meeting so that we can all know what we're discussing in real time.

539
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:39,428
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it, just simple.

540
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:41,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Cheryl.

541
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And Danielle, I see your hand raised.

542
00:56:44,931 --> 00:56:47,273
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have some insight for us in terms of timing.

543
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:59,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, through the chair, I just want to say there isn't a revised language for dimensional requirements or anything.

544
00:56:59,972 --> 00:57:02,393
[SPEAKER_13]: for the zoning or a revised map.

545
00:57:02,813 --> 00:57:05,253
[SPEAKER_13]: We're still really studying it.

546
00:57:05,313 --> 00:57:24,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing is ready yet, but we had thought about maybe cancelling the meeting because it was the only matter on there, but we felt that we should still have the meeting because there were our things to talk about, despite not having an updated zoning amendment to look at.

547
00:57:25,565 --> 00:57:30,949
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no new materials that have been provided to anyone yet.

548
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:39,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything is still very in draft form, processing the volume of comments and some of the issues that have been raised.

549
00:57:39,575 --> 00:57:40,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So there isn't anything yet.

550
00:57:41,316 --> 00:57:49,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Regarding presentations, I don't know what kind of lead time

551
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:55,466
[SPEAKER_13]: We could expect for those, usually they're being prepared like the day of, I think.

552
00:57:57,008 --> 00:58:01,032
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what's realistic for presentations.

553
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:14,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually we don't request those or require those of anybody ahead of time, but that would be a policy that the board could create if they felt that they needed to see presentations in advance.

554
00:58:15,272 --> 00:58:23,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because we don't even sometimes we see presentation material in advance, but, you know, we, we got a meeting packet right this week.

555
00:58:23,354 --> 00:58:23,515
[SPEAKER_02]: It's.

556
00:58:25,995 --> 00:58:28,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Public comments, it's our agenda notice.

557
00:58:30,697 --> 00:58:37,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the content from the April 2nd meeting, but I think all that had was the map.

558
00:58:39,569 --> 00:58:41,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it even had the presentation.

559
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:53,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, something we can discuss as a board and may help increase accessibility for the public, especially with, you know, very, very meaningful topics like this.

560
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Cheryl, I think you bring up a good point.

561
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,540
[SPEAKER_02]: The next hand I see is Jeremy.

562
00:59:06,201 --> 00:59:09,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeremy Martin, you're going to get a request to unmute.

563
00:59:09,243 --> 00:59:11,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

564
00:59:11,644 --> 00:59:16,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Jeremy Martin, 65, Birgit Ev.

565
00:59:16,508 --> 00:59:17,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you all hear me?

566
00:59:17,628 --> 00:59:17,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

567
00:59:18,049 --> 00:59:18,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jeremy.

568
00:59:19,311 --> 00:59:20,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry for the background noise.

569
00:59:21,913 --> 00:59:32,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheryl actually asked most of my question, but I think just to continue that thought, it's been noted a few times that it's hard to see the maps in the presentation.

570
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I would really ask that as there are new maps and new information provided that

571
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:53,240
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the board schedules their meetings and thinks about voting that there'll be an opportunity not just to review something in a hearing, but then to follow up and have an opportunity to review separately before there is a vote and before the public comment is closed, that would be greatly appreciated.

572
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering if on that point, Danielle or Alicia or Emily, if you could.

573
00:59:59,146 --> 01:00:02,267
[SPEAKER_09]: lay out for us how you see that process playing out.

574
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:12,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of us were under the impression that there would be a vote tonight on changes that would be presented tonight, and I'm glad that that's not the case.

575
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:15,830
[SPEAKER_09]: But can you help us understand, is it next meeting?

576
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it two meetings from now?

577
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:26,152
[SPEAKER_09]: How much time and runway do you need before there is some changes that we can start evaluating and considering?

578
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:27,052
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

579
01:00:27,072 --> 01:00:27,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

580
01:00:28,747 --> 01:00:29,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Jeremy.

581
01:00:30,608 --> 01:00:33,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Paola, I know you had a slide that kind of walked through the process.

582
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:44,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that would be useful now, but what I'll add is, you know, we could vote on it next meeting.

583
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:46,358
[SPEAKER_02]: We could decide to continue it.

584
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:51,321
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really some variability there.

585
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:58,345
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it depends what we see back from the consultant, if we feel like that has appropriately addressed

586
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:06,027
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the public comments, the board's concerns, then, you know, we could vote on May 7th.

587
01:01:07,107 --> 01:01:12,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with the sentiment that Jeremy, you, and Cheryl both shared in terms of, like, let's get material in advance.

588
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:23,292
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe that's something the board can discuss after the public comment period has closed, but it could be May 7th.

589
01:01:23,352 --> 01:01:24,412
[SPEAKER_02]: We could continue it.

590
01:01:26,233 --> 01:01:26,413
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,

591
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:52,909
[SPEAKER_02]: For better for worse, the board is independent, and we can operate on a timeline that we feel is appropriate for what we're hearing from the public and what we're expressing as a board, which I know isn't a great definitive answer, but it's kind of the most transparent one.

592
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:56,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing that, Paola.

593
01:01:59,714 --> 01:02:02,576
[SPEAKER_02]: The next commenter that I see is Gaston Fiore.

594
01:02:02,596 --> 01:02:05,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

595
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

596
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

597
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:11,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road.

598
01:02:12,123 --> 01:02:14,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have first an administrative question.

599
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:20,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the NR underscore UR zoning folder on Google Drive.

600
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:24,371
[SPEAKER_00]: So this presentation will be uploaded into that folder.

601
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:25,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?

602
01:02:25,632 --> 01:02:26,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it currently.

603
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:29,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's not going to currently be in there.

604
01:02:29,753 --> 01:02:31,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.

605
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:44,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 2nd, okay, so that was my administrative questions because I think in particular, the table with all the ideas that are allowed was very helpful and it will be very helpful for us to reference it for the next meeting.

606
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So, then I had a question.

607
01:02:47,622 --> 01:02:48,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in.

608
01:02:49,469 --> 01:02:57,611
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the slide that had the table, my understanding was that townhouses then don't allow local ADUs, right?

609
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?

610
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:02,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to defer.

611
01:03:03,052 --> 01:03:04,292
[SPEAKER_00]: In UR1, I'm talking.

612
01:03:04,332 --> 01:03:09,174
[SPEAKER_00]: So under residential one, we have townhouses and multiplexes of 4 to 6 units.

613
01:03:09,234 --> 01:03:14,255
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that for multiplexes, they won't be allowed, but I wanted to double check regarding townhouses.

614
01:03:15,315 --> 01:03:15,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Paola?

615
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:19,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

616
01:03:19,138 --> 01:03:19,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

617
01:03:19,438 --> 01:03:19,999
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on mute.

618
01:03:20,399 --> 01:03:25,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that that was my, um, if I may share a madam chair.

619
01:03:26,143 --> 01:03:27,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Um yeah, that is right.

620
01:03:27,464 --> 01:03:31,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point, it would be only for 12 and three units.

621
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:38,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it could be that we could allow it if the townhouse is three units in total.

622
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,682
[SPEAKER_05]: six or whatever the maximum units are under the UR1.

623
01:03:51,523 --> 01:04:00,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say that we could allow the ADU if it's only three units under that townhouse as three units for the three-unit dwelling.

624
01:04:01,568 --> 01:04:08,412
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be a possibility if the public is interested in that at this moment because it can be

625
01:04:10,825 --> 01:04:11,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.

626
01:04:11,505 --> 01:04:16,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gaston, if you have additional questions, I'm going to give you another 30 seconds after Paola responds.

627
01:04:17,626 --> 01:04:29,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so if we, because right now it can be from three to six, it's already a lot more than what the others would allow.

628
01:04:29,728 --> 01:04:31,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's in that limit.

629
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:38,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could allow it if it's only three units, but if it's a townhouse that allows four or five or six,

630
01:04:38,813 --> 01:04:39,934
[SPEAKER_05]: then we wouldn't allow it.

631
01:04:40,254 --> 01:04:43,196
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the possibility, but thank you for pointing that out.

632
01:04:45,017 --> 01:04:46,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaston, do you have any additional questions?

633
01:04:46,978 --> 01:04:50,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so very quickly, and thank you so much for giving me 30 extra seconds.

634
01:04:50,240 --> 01:05:03,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to ask whether it has been analysed or thought at least regarding UR1 and UR2, where we would be allowing local ADUs by special permit.

635
01:05:05,546 --> 01:05:06,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's correct, by special permit.

636
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:13,890
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, by right, and then a second one by special permit.

637
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:14,531
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?

638
01:05:14,651 --> 01:05:19,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, so the local ones are actually up to 1,200 square feet.

639
01:05:20,274 --> 01:05:22,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're more, the local ones, they're more than 900.

640
01:05:22,755 --> 01:05:25,577
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just wondering what the analysis has been done comparing

641
01:05:26,646 --> 01:05:34,749
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it would be more advantageous to allow, for example, an extra floor instead of three versus the local ADU.

642
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, for example, green space, right?

643
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:44,773
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we added an extra floor, then it comes from top of the structure.

644
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:47,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask you to wrap up your thought, if you don't mind.

645
01:05:47,674 --> 01:05:49,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that was my question.

646
01:05:49,294 --> 01:05:55,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of is it more efficient to actually allow an extra floor versus allowing a local ADU for UR1 and UR2?

647
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:08,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a clarifying question, maybe for Alicia and Danielle.

648
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:15,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Are members of the public able to provide input directly to the planning committee?

649
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:21,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, those meetings are public meetings.

650
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:21,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

651
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:29,312
[SPEAKER_06]: They are welcome to show up and planning committee almost all I will say actually has always been taking comments on those.

652
01:06:29,832 --> 01:06:30,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

653
01:06:30,273 --> 01:06:34,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So Gaston, you have some really thoughtful and specific questions.

654
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:37,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're great for us to hear.

655
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:38,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think

656
01:06:39,857 --> 01:06:47,881
[SPEAKER_02]: reiterating them or sending a note to the permitting committee, the planning committee may help reinforce your point as well.

657
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:52,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to kind of provide that recommendation.

658
01:07:02,288 --> 01:07:04,810
[SPEAKER_02]: The next commenter that I see is Elizabeth Bale.

659
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:07,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Elizabeth, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

660
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:09,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

661
01:07:15,517 --> 01:07:16,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Elizabeth, are you there?

662
01:07:16,778 --> 01:07:16,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

663
01:07:17,418 --> 01:07:17,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

664
01:07:18,058 --> 01:07:22,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I had my audio muted, so I had to figure that out.

665
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

666
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:32,003
[SPEAKER_07]: 34 Emory Street, and I had submitted comments in writing, so I'm not going to reiterate those.

667
01:07:33,444 --> 01:07:35,164
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to

668
01:07:38,670 --> 01:08:01,843
[SPEAKER_07]: advocate for what others have asked for in terms of having presentations, maps in high resolution that can be zoomed, and I prefer segmented maps where you can see street names and stuff, and the tables that have the details in as much time as possible.

669
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:05,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't think people are really understanding the effects

670
01:08:06,305 --> 01:08:07,888
[SPEAKER_07]: that this is going to have on them.

671
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:09,811
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too hard to figure it out.

672
01:08:10,011 --> 01:08:19,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And just looking at those 10 pages of tables that Innis has provided for the new proposals is tough.

673
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:27,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions on those, I don't know how to get answered, but I'll just run through them quickly and lay them out there.

674
01:08:28,133 --> 01:08:40,504
[SPEAKER_07]: One I have asked in writing before, but commercial use for NR3, it seems to allow commercial use public entertainment or recreation facility.

675
01:08:41,244 --> 01:08:56,533
[SPEAKER_07]: is allowed in NR3 and I was really surprised to see that and I didn't know why such a commercial use would be allowed in a in a residential district at least on one like my street just has single and two family houses and

676
01:08:58,013 --> 01:08:59,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was concerned about that.

677
01:08:59,694 --> 01:09:11,617
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of other uses that have CDB in the block where it would say Y or N. And I wondered what does that mean?

678
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:16,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean maybe you could do it if you go before the CDB?

679
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:26,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I just really wanted to know because there's a lot of things that are allowed in NR3 like lodging and boarding houses and community centers.

680
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:32,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And just one more thing about ADUs, if I may.

681
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:40,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand how, for a two-family or three-family, what family gets to have the ADU?

682
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:44,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Presumably there's three different owners in a three-family.

683
01:09:49,455 --> 01:09:50,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think those are great questions.

684
01:09:51,136 --> 01:10:07,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the, uh, just to answer the questions that I know how to answer, um, in the table items that have CDB, uh, that's indicating that they'd have to come before the community development board, um, for a special permit for those specific uses.

685
01:10:09,601 --> 01:10:15,043
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe there's some clarity that we can add in the language there, um, just in case that's not intuitive.

686
01:10:16,543 --> 01:10:30,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in terms of what family gets the ADU, that'd be subject to the legal agreements, whatever's worked out in the master deed and the condo ownership documents.

687
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:34,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So that wouldn't be for us to determine.

688
01:10:35,447 --> 01:10:38,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, everybody likes each other enough in the condo association to work it out.

689
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they don't, then, you know,

690
01:10:44,113 --> 01:10:45,233
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't an ADU belt.

691
01:10:45,814 --> 01:10:47,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody would have to be in agreement.

692
01:10:48,054 --> 01:10:49,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily, I see your hand.

693
01:10:50,695 --> 01:10:52,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

694
01:10:52,096 --> 01:10:58,117
[SPEAKER_10]: This question came out from a couple of people, so I wanted to address it now so that nobody else would have to ask it.

695
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:05,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So I certainly appreciate the fact that people want the presentations after the meeting, and I apologize.

696
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:08,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we had submitted the April 1, so the earlier April 1.

697
01:11:09,681 --> 01:11:13,164
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we did not, I will double check and make sure that we've done that.

698
01:11:14,325 --> 01:11:17,647
[SPEAKER_10]: For tonight, we made the decision to do the ADUs on Monday.

699
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:25,473
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Wednesday, so we weren't able to get it to you with sufficient time before the meeting, and I apologize for that.

700
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:28,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Going forward for May 7th, there's two things.

701
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:34,340
[SPEAKER_10]: One is we would, we plan to, and that's one of the reasons for asking for the additional time,

702
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,341
[SPEAKER_10]: We do plan to get you the information in advance.

703
01:11:37,401 --> 01:11:46,644
[SPEAKER_10]: We are also, the city doesn't know this, surprise planning staff, we are working on an internal tool that we would like to check with you all first.

704
01:11:47,204 --> 01:11:54,727
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if that works, we're happy with it, release it to the public that it would allow people to more easily, it's an online map.

705
01:11:55,187 --> 01:11:57,891
[SPEAKER_10]: to more easily see what's going on.

706
01:11:57,911 --> 01:12:06,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I would allow them to zoom in and out of specific parcels, so that is also obviously not ready for tonight or we would have demonstrated it to you.

707
01:12:07,342 --> 01:12:12,008
[SPEAKER_10]: But that is something that we are working on now because we think it will help our conversations

708
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:19,993
[SPEAKER_10]: with city planning staff and with the planning and permitting committee and then obviously with you all as well and with the public in between meetings.

709
01:12:20,213 --> 01:12:34,943
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we've kicked that off this week after our last session with the working group, our weekly check in with the working group, and we would expect to have that ready before the next meeting.

710
01:12:35,323 --> 01:12:38,306
[SPEAKER_10]: So, based on the timeline that we talked about in-house.

711
01:12:38,626 --> 01:12:47,193
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we're hoping that will help answer a lot more people's questions and, you know, just, we do recognize that people want that additional information.

712
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:55,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I also, with your permission, Madam Chair, I know we've got one more hand up, but I didn't want Judith Weinstock to feel that we were ignoring her question.

713
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:58,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just not sure if we were going to wait until the end or not.

714
01:13:00,024 --> 01:13:02,506
[SPEAKER_10]: With ADUs, because

715
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:06,348
[SPEAKER_10]: An ADU can be an internal ADU.

716
01:13:07,748 --> 01:13:10,188
[SPEAKER_10]: The lot size is irrelevant.

717
01:13:10,568 --> 01:13:26,772
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you know, for a use that wants to have an ADU, if they do, if they're an existing single-family home, for example, or duplex or whatever, and they want to do internal ADU within the existing building, then the lot size would not have an impact on that.

718
01:13:28,692 --> 01:13:30,152
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, thank you, Paola.

719
01:13:30,212 --> 01:13:31,973
[SPEAKER_10]: This is from that Boston...

720
01:13:34,054 --> 01:13:37,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I strongly recommend that people have a look at this.

721
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:46,305
[SPEAKER_10]: This ADU guidebook that Boston put out is really, really interesting and very useful.

722
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:53,271
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to consider that a lot size, as she requested, as Ms.

723
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:59,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Weinstock requested, that could apply for an attached or a detached, but it wouldn't apply to an internal ADU.

724
01:14:02,259 --> 01:14:05,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, I'll rest and listen to the remainder of the questions.

725
01:14:09,844 --> 01:14:10,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

726
01:14:11,325 --> 01:14:12,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle, I see your hand as well.

727
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:15,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I just wanted to add a little bit to it.

728
01:14:15,447 --> 01:14:19,590
[SPEAKER_13]: So, as far as, yeah, so there's no minimum lot size to

729
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:27,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Required to have in order to have an ADU, but there are those other parameters so we can have setbacks.

730
01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:34,064
[SPEAKER_13]: We can have maximum building coverage, which would apply to accessory structures.

731
01:14:34,664 --> 01:14:34,824
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

732
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:48,336
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, have like a blank, you know, a blank lot, and then you just kind of try to fit everything in there, you'd see that you actually can't, you do need a bigger lot to start to do more of these things.

733
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:51,957
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, you'll see, oh, minimum lot size 3000 square feet.

734
01:14:52,058 --> 01:14:58,521
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, you're allowed to have up to, you know, four units and or six units.

735
01:14:58,581 --> 01:15:03,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's that sounds crazy, but because actually, you wouldn't be able to get all that on there.

736
01:15:03,703 --> 01:15:06,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's like a menu of

737
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:08,147
[SPEAKER_13]: uses you can put on there.

738
01:15:09,328 --> 01:15:21,463
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, so I can understand that the question is to kind of figure out what actually can be done on certain

739
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:26,834
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot sizes to help, you know, allay fears of what actually can be built.

740
01:15:28,015 --> 01:15:44,304
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also wanted to follow up on whose ADU would it be for say you had a three family, like in a rental situation, I've already had inquiries from property owners looking to add an ADU to their property, which would just be another rental unit.

741
01:15:45,905 --> 01:15:50,268
[SPEAKER_13]: And the tenants there, I don't know what their

742
01:15:51,973 --> 01:15:57,619
[SPEAKER_13]: if there's anything in their leases that would prevent them from being built or having to okay it.

743
01:15:57,699 --> 01:15:58,119
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

744
01:15:58,139 --> 01:16:02,124
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that's been tested yet.

745
01:16:02,164 --> 01:16:11,774
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe that really any municipalities allowed ADUs for anything beyond a single family, so I feel like it's probably untested.

746
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:33,942
[SPEAKER_13]: And for condos, just what, you know, Chair Hedeman had said, that it would be, you know, the condo association would, you know, make that call and they all have to agree or, you know, depending on how those condo docs are drawn up of who has, you know, majority vote or whatnot.

747
01:17:00,205 --> 01:17:05,887
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to add that the chair has messaged me saying she just dropped her Wi-Fi dropped.

748
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:07,628
[SPEAKER_13]: This might be her coming in.

749
01:17:14,611 --> 01:17:17,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe she should be able to change her name if she can.

750
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:20,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we unmute that one just to see is this Emily?

751
01:17:20,413 --> 01:17:27,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I was sending.

752
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,684
[SPEAKER_06]: and unmute the iPhone that we just let in.

753
01:17:47,032 --> 01:17:48,033
[SPEAKER_16]: She's not unmuting.

754
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:56,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Should we take a quick recess?

755
01:17:57,622 --> 01:18:08,087
[SPEAKER_13]: or vice chair Calves, what would you like to do in this situation?

756
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:16,531
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, do we know if that is Emily?

757
01:18:16,752 --> 01:18:16,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

758
01:18:17,812 --> 01:18:19,813
[SPEAKER_11]: She just, yeah, she's there.

759
01:18:20,073 --> 01:18:20,633
[SPEAKER_15]: She just got in.

760
01:18:20,814 --> 01:18:21,294
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.

761
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:24,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we want to take a buyer break?

762
01:18:24,718 --> 01:18:26,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you were saying, Danny?

763
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,101
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we're looking to find Emily.

764
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,462
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think now we found Emily.

765
01:18:31,142 --> 01:18:34,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Emily, I saw her name.

766
01:18:34,265 --> 01:18:35,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Her Wi-Fi had dropped.

767
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:39,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Except she's in now.

768
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:41,690
[SPEAKER_06]: The account that joined with her name.

769
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:43,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, now it does have.

770
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:43,771
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

771
01:18:45,652 --> 01:18:46,353
[SPEAKER_06]: There you are, Emily.

772
01:18:46,373 --> 01:18:47,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm back.

773
01:18:47,994 --> 01:18:48,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, all.

774
01:18:48,534 --> 01:18:49,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry about that.

775
01:18:52,498 --> 01:18:54,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for stepping in Peter.

776
01:18:54,839 --> 01:18:59,843
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

777
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I miss anything?

778
01:19:04,067 --> 01:19:09,411
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I was just trying to figure out where you went.

779
01:19:10,352 --> 01:19:12,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you have one question left from admin.

780
01:19:23,268 --> 01:19:25,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm on a good internet connection.

781
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:29,292
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, admin, you are going to be unmuted.

782
01:19:29,392 --> 01:19:32,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

783
01:19:33,214 --> 01:19:34,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to set a timer for two minutes.

784
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Admin, are you available?

785
01:19:49,303 --> 01:19:50,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to unmute you again.

786
01:19:50,344 --> 01:19:52,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Unmute myself.

787
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:55,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

788
01:19:56,102 --> 01:19:56,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me now?

789
01:19:57,464 --> 01:19:57,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

790
01:19:58,225 --> 01:19:59,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you very much.

791
01:20:00,528 --> 01:20:04,553
[SPEAKER_08]: With one of my devices, it's coming under aid meant for administration.

792
01:20:04,954 --> 01:20:06,175
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Sharon DSO.

793
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:08,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a longtime resident of Medford, Mass.

794
01:20:09,155 --> 01:20:11,196
[SPEAKER_08]: corner of Mass Ave and Circuit Road.

795
01:20:12,897 --> 01:20:21,221
[SPEAKER_08]: We have maintained home single family homes in this area now since I was about 15 years old in the Lawrence Estates.

796
01:20:22,461 --> 01:20:24,142
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not the here and there right now.

797
01:20:24,522 --> 01:20:30,665
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get back to something that maybe somebody can answer because there are probably people in the public who would be

798
01:20:31,565 --> 01:20:33,045
[SPEAKER_08]: wanting to know some of this too.

799
01:20:33,445 --> 01:20:34,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little confused.

800
01:20:35,566 --> 01:20:47,768
[SPEAKER_08]: During the last few years, and maybe a little time before then, people were striving to develop more affordable housing.

801
01:20:48,528 --> 01:21:00,670
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this whole plan in this whole planning board came about in the council passing certain different parameters for, you know, permitting really

802
01:21:01,843 --> 01:21:06,828
[SPEAKER_08]: unique places like the beer hall etc for growth, I understand that.

803
01:21:07,148 --> 01:21:08,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So first it was affordable housing.

804
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:10,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's diversity.

805
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:12,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's back to affordable housing again.

806
01:21:13,513 --> 01:21:18,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I really really don't see in my, in my insight into Medford.

807
01:21:20,059 --> 01:21:35,274
[SPEAKER_08]: what the plan is, why I know some things need to be changed, I know some perks needed to come to this city were long overdue, but each town in each city in Massachusetts and actually the country has its own forte.

808
01:21:35,694 --> 01:21:39,137
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, whether it be a long western place or whether it be a historic,

809
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:42,803
[SPEAKER_08]: in a more residential place as Medford.

810
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:51,816
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the plan, and I also don't understand, rather than change and upsetting so many people among the community some of my neighbors have given up.

811
01:21:52,136 --> 01:21:53,699
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they don't even come into zoom.

812
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:57,002
[SPEAKER_08]: it which is very very sad.

813
01:21:57,723 --> 01:22:11,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Why didn't you go into areas where there already was permitting, where you could build up for affordable housing, I'll make a bet on Boston Avenue near Tufts and on Salem Street too which is probably going to be devastated during the next 10 years.

814
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:17,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Why you just didn't work with business owners first, because you can build up in Medford.

815
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:25,904
[SPEAKER_08]: why you didn't ask them to invest some money, build up, most of those people would not have cars or vehicles, parking would not be a problem.

816
01:22:26,505 --> 01:22:33,410
[SPEAKER_08]: You would probably gain then a better tax rate than somebody coming into a- I'm gonna ask you to wrap up your thought if you don't mind.

817
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:34,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

818
01:22:34,631 --> 01:22:34,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

819
01:22:36,085 --> 01:22:38,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

820
01:22:39,106 --> 01:22:40,707
[SPEAKER_08]: But those are my two questions.

821
01:22:40,847 --> 01:22:42,148
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the goal plan?

822
01:22:42,628 --> 01:22:50,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't see that anything that's been presented, especially upsetting residents who really cherish and paid a lot of money for their areas to live in.

823
01:22:52,072 --> 01:22:55,633
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're gaining or what what the goal is, and why you didn't go?

824
01:22:55,733 --> 01:22:55,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

825
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:57,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you going about it backwards?

826
01:22:57,854 --> 01:22:59,375
[SPEAKER_02]: You're about a minute over your time.

827
01:22:59,395 --> 01:23:00,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

828
01:23:01,256 --> 01:23:01,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

829
01:23:01,896 --> 01:23:03,077
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you so much for your comment.

830
01:23:03,117 --> 01:23:04,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I do really appreciate it.

831
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:13,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what the commenter is expressing is, is maybe some concern over just like the larger goals of Medford.

832
01:23:14,242 --> 01:23:20,084
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a Medford comprehensive plan that was a multi-year effort.

833
01:23:20,805 --> 01:23:26,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd encourage, you know, reviewing the comprehensive plan and, you know, in terms of

834
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:31,545
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, convincing private property owners to develop their land.

835
01:23:31,565 --> 01:23:34,006
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the role of the Community Development Board.

836
01:23:35,027 --> 01:23:43,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it is cool things like, you know, the beer halls or, you know, cannabis dispensaries or, you know, subdivisions.

837
01:23:44,954 --> 01:23:49,997
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we're really just operating within the rules that we have as a board.

838
01:23:50,017 --> 01:23:54,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Sal is still on the line.

839
01:23:55,138 --> 01:24:04,825
[SPEAKER_02]: and can speak to like any economic development activities that are happening, but that would probably be a more appropriate venue for those questions.

840
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:13,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, he had to drop off at 7.30.

841
01:24:13,912 --> 01:24:18,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I appreciate him joining us for the first part, but understand.

842
01:24:22,908 --> 01:24:24,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other public comments?

843
01:24:25,411 --> 01:24:26,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any hands raised.

844
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:39,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniela or Alicia, have you received any messages with people that have technical difficulties?

845
01:24:39,026 --> 01:24:42,409
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have not.

846
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:42,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

847
01:24:46,263 --> 01:24:52,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and close the public comment period for this meeting, not for the topic, just for this meeting.

848
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:56,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to open it up to the board for any questions or discussion.

849
01:25:01,302 --> 01:25:08,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, if I could just share for those who are still watching that we did receive a copy of this presentation as the meeting was starting.

850
01:25:08,769 --> 01:25:16,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I did ask Paola for it, so I have uploaded it to the file for this meeting.

851
01:25:16,136 --> 01:25:19,960
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't always upload the presentations to that

852
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:23,009
[SPEAKER_06]: that file on the Google Drive.

853
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:25,992
[SPEAKER_06]: But because it was asked for and I had it, I did put it in there.

854
01:25:26,072 --> 01:25:28,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So if people look now, it's there now.

855
01:25:28,473 --> 01:25:29,514
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not there.

856
01:25:29,594 --> 01:25:30,675
[SPEAKER_06]: People are not confused.

857
01:25:30,715 --> 01:25:32,796
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not there 15 minutes ago.

858
01:25:33,537 --> 01:25:34,718
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a helpful clarification.

859
01:25:34,758 --> 01:25:35,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

860
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:41,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand we don't want to share the presentations without context.

861
01:25:42,363 --> 01:25:45,665
[SPEAKER_02]: We in the board don't even get the presentations ahead of time.

862
01:25:48,242 --> 01:25:53,245
[SPEAKER_02]: But I agree with the public's comments about having information available in advance.

863
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:57,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily and Paola, I'm very interested in that tool that you just discussed.

864
01:25:57,808 --> 01:26:16,659
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for something like that to actually be effective, it would have to be released several days in advance of our meeting so that people can use it to prepare and research and refine their comments and their understanding, not something that we review during the meeting.

865
01:26:17,503 --> 01:26:22,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, people are listening to the content and clicking through and, you know, then providing comment.

866
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:24,390
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that, you know, everybody, you know.

867
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:29,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yourselves and associates and the board are all comfortable and well prepared.

868
01:26:29,775 --> 01:26:31,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Understood.

869
01:26:31,617 --> 01:26:31,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

870
01:26:31,897 --> 01:26:32,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam chair.

871
01:26:33,178 --> 01:26:39,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm curious if members of the board have any other comments.

872
01:26:46,525 --> 01:26:53,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know I'm very excited to see the progress for the next meeting.

873
01:26:55,229 --> 01:27:07,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's no additional comments by the board, what I'd be looking for is a motion to continue to a date certain, and that date certain would be May 7th.

874
01:27:08,835 --> 01:27:14,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily and Paola, does that date potentially work with you all, realizing that we're all humans and

875
01:27:15,537 --> 01:27:17,699
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, things happen and there's only so many hours in a day.

876
01:27:17,719 --> 01:27:20,661
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be delighted to be there.

877
01:27:21,141 --> 01:27:22,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, wonderful.

878
01:27:22,022 --> 01:27:26,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking for a motion to continue to a date certain which is May 7.

879
01:27:28,066 --> 01:27:29,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anyone like to propose that motion?

880
01:27:29,467 --> 01:27:30,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Annie?

881
01:27:31,508 --> 01:27:37,432
[SPEAKER_11]: I make a motion to continue the discussion to our next meeting on May 7.

882
01:27:38,393 --> 01:27:38,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

883
01:27:39,133 --> 01:27:39,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have a second?

884
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:41,275
[SPEAKER_15]: A second.

885
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:42,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Peter.

886
01:27:42,615 --> 01:27:44,796
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

887
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:45,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Kaufs.

888
01:27:46,836 --> 01:27:46,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

889
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:48,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Annie Strang.

890
01:27:50,517 --> 01:27:50,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

891
01:27:51,478 --> 01:27:52,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Behrens.

892
01:27:53,298 --> 01:27:53,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

893
01:27:54,118 --> 01:27:54,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Sabrina Alpino.

894
01:27:55,779 --> 01:27:55,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

895
01:27:56,899 --> 01:27:57,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben LaValle.

896
01:27:58,840 --> 01:27:58,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

897
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:03,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, Emily Henneman, am also an aye.

898
01:28:06,758 --> 01:28:11,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to all members of the public who listened and provided comment.

899
01:28:13,241 --> 01:28:18,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm truly inspired by how consistent and thoughtful all of your comments are.

900
01:28:18,864 --> 01:28:26,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So continue sending them in, show up to the meetings where we're taking your thoughts and your comments very seriously.

901
01:28:26,547 --> 01:28:28,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you all for being here.

902
01:28:29,749 --> 01:28:31,510
[SPEAKER_02]: The next item that we have is minutes.

903
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:36,172
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any minutes ready for acceptance tonight, so we're gonna move forward.

904
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:44,327
[SPEAKER_02]: The next item is zoning updates, given that that is the meat and potatoes of what we're talking about here.

905
01:28:44,347 --> 01:28:50,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do still want to provide space in case there are any other zoning updates.

906
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia or Danielle, do you have anything to add?

907
01:28:55,711 --> 01:28:59,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say nothing beyond what was in the presentation about what's upcoming.

908
01:29:01,053 --> 01:29:01,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

909
01:29:04,483 --> 01:29:07,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next item that we have is adjournment.

910
01:29:07,465 --> 01:29:10,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for a motion to adjourn.

911
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:11,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved.

912
01:29:12,809 --> 01:29:13,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Peter.

913
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:14,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have a second?

914
01:29:15,691 --> 01:29:16,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I will second.

915
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:16,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

916
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:16,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion.

917
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:18,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I think I can take it.

918
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:20,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's jumping at adjournment.

919
01:29:21,955 --> 01:29:22,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't take it personally.

920
01:29:22,996 --> 01:29:23,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.

921
01:29:23,436 --> 01:29:25,818
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

922
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:26,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Calves?

923
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:27,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

924
01:29:28,379 --> 01:29:28,920

01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

926
01:29:30,381 --> 01:29:31,161

[SPEAKER_02]: Ben LaValle.

931
01:29:35,775 --> 01:29:37,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

932
01:29:38,016 --> 01:29:40,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye for adjournment.

933
01:29:42,376 --> 01:29:44,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone who came tonight.

934
01:29:45,037 --> 01:29:46,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Danielle and Alicia.

935
01:29:47,097 --> 01:29:48,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Could not do this without you.

936
01:29:49,798 --> 01:29:51,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate your support and guidance.

937
01:29:52,358 --> 01:29:55,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And see everybody in a couple weeks.

938
01:29:57,639 --> 01:29:58,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

939
01:29:58,499 --> 01:29:59,520
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of work.

940
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:00,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

941
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:01,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.
