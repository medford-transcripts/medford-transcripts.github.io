1
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:14,983
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this press conference.

2
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:20,464
We wanted to give some updates about our community so that everybody's aware of what's going on in the city of Medford.

3
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:23,004
I am lucky enough to be here this morning.

4
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:29,666
We have President Carriello, we have Councilor Knight, Councilor Scott Kelly, and Councilor DelaRusso.

5
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:31,086
So thank you all for joining us today.

6
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:34,007
We have with us as well many department heads and members of the press.

7
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,647
First off, we're in budget season right now.

8
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:40,088
As people may realize, it's night four of budget hearings.

9
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:46,056
And this year we were really proud to deliver a budget that was full of additional services being offered to the community.

10
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:49,579
First being a recreation, full-time recreation department.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,041
So we're really thrilled.

12
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:55,244
We've had a study group that has been working on this since well before January.

13
00:00:55,665 --> 00:01:01,350
And they came through with many recommendations and a survey to determine what do the people of Medford want from us.

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,632
So we came up with a plan.

15
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:17,825
We have a lot of people that have supported it and they're really eager to see this budget go through so that we can start the hiring process to have a full-time rec director, an assistant director, as well as people working to staff the rec department.

16
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,848
Councilor Scarpelli was integral to the whole process.

17
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:24,509
He spearheaded the group that had the meeting weekly.

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,132
George, if you'd like to say a few words about it, we'd be more than happy to have you come up.

19
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:33,099
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

20
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:54,039
First of all, through the initiatives of our Mayor and then-Councilor, President Fred DelaRusso gave me the opportunity to be appointed to the focus group of recreation and to put together a wonderful group of constituents and stakeholders in our community that wanted to see a full-time recreation program come to fruition.

21
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:06,907
After weeks of meetings and different initiatives that came through and thoughts and ideas through the survey process, we put together an unbelievable program.

22
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:14,171
The summer pilot program is just a piece of what our community will see this fall and this winter, and it's so exciting.

23
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:31,675
Again, I can't thank the mayor's office enough to give our community something that's been screaming for for years and all I can say is please reach out to our website and start registering for those programs and share some ideas and I can't wait to see what the future brings.

24
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:43,018
We do have a summer break program here, our guide for city recreation so please pick up a copy at the library, city hall, throughout the city and get online and sign up for some of these amazing classes that are being offered.

25
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,318
Thank you so much.

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:57,930
Secondly, I just actually left Tufts University for an opioid conference and we're proud to be supportive of the efforts in trying to fight this addiction that's out there.

27
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:05,117
With that being said, we are appointing in the budget, we've asked for a recovery coach to be put into our budget.

28
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:13,781
We think it's really important for someone to be on the ground, really meeting with the people on a regular basis, and coming up with solutions to this problem, this epidemic.

29
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:23,314
So with that, I also have initiated a position in the budget for that, so we're really eager to see this budget take off on July 1st, so that we can augment services to our community.

30
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:25,286
the library.

31
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:28,908
It's probably the most beloved asset in our community.

32
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:36,374
And not only have we met the state guidelines for funding, but we've augmented those funding recommendations to the City Council.

33
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:50,184
So we're about $100,000 over what is required of us, but with that we are increasing one more position so that we can have a media technology specialist at the library to help all of the people in Medford, from youth to senior citizens,

34
00:03:50,536 --> 00:04:00,261
so that they can have access to some of the latest and greatest opportunities online, with media, as well as on tape, and the various opportunities to have books on your phone and whatnot.

35
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:08,946
So we're really thrilled about that, and we've also increased the library's part-time budget so that we can have additional staff on hand to help the citizens of Medford.

36
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:15,210
Lastly, we have increased, we've offered a traffic engineer position.

37
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,232
If you watched any of the city council meetings over the last six months to a year,

38
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:29,299
You'll see that there's been a cry out for a traffic engineer on staff that can address some of the development that's going on as well as development in other communities, specifically the Malden Hospital site.

39
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:40,207
So we're really proud, based upon this collaboration that we've formed, very strong collaboration, that we have put a traffic engineer in the engineering department for the upcoming budget cycle.

40
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,108
So we're really thrilled about that.

41
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,330
And our police department.

42
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:56,320
Chief Sacco, I've been involved in this budget, barring the year when I took a little hiatus, for the last seven years and each and every year Chief Sacco has asked for crime scene technologists,

43
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,198
and an information technologist.

44
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:04,001
So we're really thrilled that we have put those positions into his police budget for this upcoming year.

45
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,783
And that just augments the services that are offered.

46
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:19,511
It allows our police officers to be out in the streets and doing the job that they're tasked to do while someone else can pick up the load and perform all of those technical jobs that are mandated in police departments of today.

47
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,552
So we're really eager about that as well.

48
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:27,459
Lastly, our school department in the budget is about $2.1 million over last year.

49
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,842
Some of it is in negotiated salaries, but also we know there's a need in our schools.

50
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:33,143
We still call them the new schools.

51
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:37,506
But they were in 2001, they were dedicated, and there's a need for increased maintenance.

52
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:47,794
And we've met with parents, we've met with school boards, you know, PTOs, and all of them have come out and said, we need more maintenance money, we need to be able to keep the school's spick and span.

53
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:56,558
and address some of the smaller things that are so very important for the children of our community as well as the parents that peruse our schools.

54
00:05:56,978 --> 00:06:06,783
So we're increasing the budget line for maintenance in our schools by $200,000 strictly for supplies and repairs and also we're hoping to get a position on that as well.

55
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:08,944
So we're really thrilled with this budget.

56
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:10,385
We think it's very comprehensive.

57
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:15,067
We feel that we've listened to the needs, the issues that have been raised at city council meetings.

58
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:21,251
and from our department heads, so we really feel like we're addressing the needs of our community through these various outlets.

59
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:26,756
So thank you very much for your support, thank you for the budget hearings, and for bringing good ideas.

60
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:31,759
Like I've said before, good ideas come from anyone, anywhere, and we're open to them.

61
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:39,265
So keep on keeping on, bring them up to us and we certainly will evaluate them and move forward to the best we can within budgetary constraints.

62
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:45,369
Secondly, it's come up in the council as well, Mr. Gabb and our zoning.

63
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,733
As many may realize, our zoning really hasn't been updated since we did the station landing project.

64
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:55,636
That was our mixed-use zoning that we developed for that particular Wellington area.

65
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,279
We think it's a good zoning, write-up of zoning.

66
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,321
However, it doesn't always fit into other areas of the city.

67
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:09,826
So I'm really proud to announce that we are receiving $40,000 to conduct a zoning review of Mystic Avenue.

68
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:15,891
$10,000 of that is through MAPC with the DLTA grant, as well as $30,000 from the Mass Housing Trust.

69
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,152
So we're really thrilled with that, and I think Ms.

70
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,995
Counselor Knight would like to come up and say a few words about zoning.

71
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:26,919
He's a member of the Zoning Committee, along with Counselor DelaRusso and Counselor Fatlow-Chiazat.

72
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,587
Well, first of all, Madam Mayor, thank you very much.

73
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:33,249
I appreciate your work and your efforts in being able to secure this grant.

74
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:43,655
Zoning has been a topic of discussion during the last term, week in and week out, and it's very important that we take a long, hard look at our zoning here in the City of Medford to determine what direction

75
00:07:46,269 --> 00:08:04,839
a strong focus and a strong effort to look at maintaining sustainable parcels of commercial and industrial parcels to be sure that we can offset our residential tax burden as well as looking at developing some more infrastructure down on Mystic Avenue to allow us to grow.

76
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,640
It's an untapped resource that's in the community.

77
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,682
It's something that we've heard a lot of outcry about and it's something that I'm looking forward to working with the Mayor.

78
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,423
and the residents of the community and the members of the council with.

79
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:15,544
I'd really like to thank you for your efforts.

80
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,225
Since Mayor Burke's election, we really have been partners in progress.

81
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:23,687
We've done a great job working together, coming across the island, across the hall, and that's going to continue going forward.

82
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:26,128
So thank you very much, Madam Mayor, for your efforts and your work.

83
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,568
And thank you very much for having me this evening.

84
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:32,890
There's no bigger supporter of job creation than the councillors that sit on the Zoning Subcommittee.

85
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,411
So I thank you for all of your service.

86
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:37,812
And we want to see commercial development as well.

87
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,233
It's not just about housing.

88
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,133
It's about commercial.

89
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:43,288
bringing jobs to our city, which we feel strongly about.

90
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:47,229
So that's one step in that direction, and we look forward to many more occurring that way.

91
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:51,510
And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Medford Square process that we've been undergoing.

92
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,151
We're getting draft reports back now from MNPC.

93
00:08:55,231 --> 00:09:00,392
As you know, we did a $90,000 grant study that paid for all the services.

94
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:01,492
They did a lot of outreach.

95
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:02,773
We've had community meetings.

96
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,333
We've had vision boards.

97
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:10,035
and they're now ready to come back in with their recommendations for zoning for Medford Square.

98
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:21,460
Actually, our zoning is okay for Medford Square, but what we have written into it is setbacks and lot lines, and that's what's deterring from development in Medford Square.

99
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,122
So we're really eager to fine-tune and finesse the zoning of Medford Square, and we'll be working with the council on that as well.

100
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:35,120
City Hall, we all know City Hall is under construction right now and we have a schedule of renovations.

101
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,582
So basically the roof and the parapet will be done in the first week of July.

102
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:44,524
They'll begin the council chamber work at the end of July, which we're really eager about.

103
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:53,208
We want to get that room, it's the people's room, we want to get it up looking really fine and nice and we want it to be used by the people on an ongoing basis.

104
00:09:53,648 --> 00:10:01,297
It's a beautiful building, it will be turning 80 years old in September, and it was a fine time for us to do some improvements to this gorgeous building.

105
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:08,184
Phase 3 is up front, which began in earnest at the beginning of May, and they're very much underway.

106
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:11,188
We have some sketches, we have one sketch there and one behind.

107
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,335
that show what it will look like, but it will be a much more friendlier, handicapped accessible facility.

108
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:26,704
It certainly will be an open area where we can have summer concerts and community events like Circle the Square that's kicking off this Thursday, so make sure you come down to Medford Square.

109
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:34,131
But we're really eager to get this project finished so that we can give her an 80th birthday party, hopefully beginning of October sometime.

110
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,192
So stay tuned.

111
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:40,994
There's another item that we kicked off last January.

112
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:43,235
It was a senior work-off abatement process.

113
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:49,400
We feel that our seniors should be brought into City Hall.

114
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,641
We really want to collaborate with them.

115
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,102
They bring so much to the table.

116
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:58,426
And we have opened up a new round that will be beginning in July as well for the senior work-off abatement.

117
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:00,748
Last year we had 35 seniors that came to work here.

118
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:05,291
And they're able to work, earn about $1,500 that go against their tax bill.

119
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,953
So it's a win-win for us.

120
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:13,199
They pleasure us with their smiles each and every day, and they in turn get an abatement on their taxes.

121
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:19,625
So we're really thrilled with the outcome from last year, and we're eager to get it off the ground again for this upcoming fiscal year.

122
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:22,848
And we're getting applications, so please come into room 204.

123
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:33,576
Fill out an application and we will find something that works for both sides so that we get the benefit of your history, your education, and your strengths in the city of Medford.

124
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:36,839
And we in turn, we get greeters that welcome people.

125
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:44,685
I think people feel really good when they walk into this building now because they're greeted with a smile and they're not walking around randomly trying to find an office.

126
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:49,549
So we're really thrilled with the program and we look forward to its expansion in the upcoming fiscal year, 18.

127
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:55,505
Summer Rec, we touched upon it a little bit.

128
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:58,788
We do have the guide out, so please make sure you check it out.

129
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:04,212
There's lots of opportunities for enrichment as well as just summer fun.

130
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:09,136
We have our park program kicking off in the second week, third week of July.

131
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:12,599
It'll be a six week program and it'll be moving throughout the city.

132
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,481
So everyone will be coming to the park.

133
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:15,942
So the kids will get to meet each other.

134
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:20,466
So that when they do go to middle school, they have friends that they've already met through our summer youth program.

135
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:30,733
We're really excited about that and it was part and parcel of Constance Scarpelli's as well as people on the rec committee that worked hard as well as activists from our office.

136
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,356
Veterans Wall, moving right along.

137
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:40,080
We are going to be dedicating it on June 25th on Emerald Park at 10am.

138
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,573
We are collaborating with the Elks Club that does an annual Flag Day event.

139
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:49,938
We thought it'd be a nice day to join forces and do something for our community.

140
00:12:50,258 --> 00:13:02,749
There's about 40 names that will be entered upon the wall at Honor Roll Park and we urge you to come on out and support those people that have fought for our freedoms, fought for our flag, and allow us to be here today to do what we do.

141
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:11,693
And finally, something that I'm really saddened by, our illustrious Diane McLeod, our diversity director, is retiring.

142
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:15,554
Actually, today is her final day of service in the city of Medford.

143
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,356
She has been with us for 24 years.

144
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:21,698
She, tears coming, don't make me cry.

145
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:24,139
She has done so much for this community.

146
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:29,522
She has worked so very hard with outreach and collaboration and conversations.

147
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:31,743
Diane has really done it all.

148
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:37,543
It's been a really tough, I know, a tough month for her to get to this point.

149
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:43,885
She's been trying to tick and time, go over lists and make sure nothing falls through the cracks because this really has been her baby.

150
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:49,026
She was our first diversity director and she's done a fantastic job.

151
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:51,087
We're really proud to call her friend.

152
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:58,408
We were proud to have her in the city of Medford and she brought her wealth and her knowledge to the city and she will be missed for sure.

153
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,649
But in her last days,

154
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,065
Diane was able to pull off a grant in the amount of $130,000.

155
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:07,065
So Diane, take it away.

156
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:17,776
The first time the Mass.

157
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:24,463
Office on Disability had a municipal grant, an ADA grant, that was available for the first time.

158
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:34,091
So after talking with Mayor Burke, I met with Director Heidi Riccio and with Roy Bellson and we sat down and talked about the vocational school.

159
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:42,699
And as many of you know, or don't know, we've done a lot of work at the high school, piece by piece over the years, but not really to the vocational school.

160
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:53,808
So there's several needs that we've outlined and the $130,000 will go for accessible hardware, accessible signage for all the rooms,

161
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,103
There'll be a lift that will go into the automotive department.

162
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:02,845
This grant was both for physical and programmatic access.

163
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,588
There will be automatic doors, new doors, as well as automatic doors.

164
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:15,852
And I just think it's an exciting grant, and there's going to be another one coming up for next year, so there's something else we can do there.

165
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:18,014
But it's been great working here.

166
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,316
I love this job.

167
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:25,942
Everyone in this building loves dining in as well.

168
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:52,520
So of course when Diane announced that she would be leaving the great city of Medford for retirement and to spend time with her family and she has two weddings coming up with her two boys and I know she's a proud mama and she's really excited about those opportunities for her to continue and to have a golfer by the way.

169
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,586
There's been a lot of calls I've received in my office, a lot from the Human Rights Commission, people have just been calling and saying

170
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,260
What are you going to do?

171
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,460
How are we going to do this?

172
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,681
We need someone from Medford.

173
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:05,082
We need someone that knows Medford.

174
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:09,806
We need someone that shows diversity in every aspect of their life.

175
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:16,951
So, and with those calls have come many recommendations, mainly for this one individual.

176
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:20,213
And we're really thrilled to have him here with us today.

177
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,855
His name is Mr. Neil Osborne.

178
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:23,976
Neil, you can stand up.

179
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:38,263
Neil has served on various commissions throughout the city from planning board to the human rights commission.

180
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:42,146
He's chair of the NAACP, president of the NAACP.

181
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:46,029
He is just a person that is out in the city.

182
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:47,971
He knows the issues we're facing.

183
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:55,537
I know that he will embrace all that we have to offer and to make our city, we have a great city here.

184
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,898
We have a welcoming city here.

185
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,241
And we know that Neil is going to add to that and really bring in everyone so that there's a comfort level.

186
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:06,944
Everyone feels safe, especially in these times that we're dealing with right now on the federal level.

187
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:08,544
So we're really thrilled.

188
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:11,126
He's an attorney by trade.

189
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:14,248
He's done a lot with personnel issues.

190
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:17,349
And I'm sure Neil can elaborate a little bit more about his experience.

191
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,831
And I'd like to welcome him to the City of Medford's department.

192
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:21,772
To the department head.

193
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,260
Thank you very much, Mayor Burke.

194
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,264
When you tapped me on the shoulder and said, Neil, would you consider this position?

195
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:35,045
I was like, oh my goodness.

196
00:17:35,526 --> 00:17:38,628
Can I still be of great service to the city of Medford?

197
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,810
I look forward to joining your team.

198
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:48,937
I look forward to serving the citizens of Medford in a deeper, more intimate way as being professional in City Hall.

199
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:52,100
And Diane McLeod, I have known you for years.

200
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,942
We have interacted so much.

201
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:55,820
You will be greatly missed.

202
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,423
I am thankful for the work that you've done for this city.

203
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:01,307
You've built a foundation, and hopefully I can build upon that.

204
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:05,373
So congratulations on your retirement, and I promise not to call during the day.

205
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:05,993
I'll let you get off.

206
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:16,845
I have complete faith in Neil's abilities.

207
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:19,726
And like he said, we'll probably be calling Diane.

208
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:21,346
We're going to give her the wedding time off.

209
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:24,387
But probably come August, we're going to be tapping in.

210
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,067
We know it's a big transition.

211
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,428
We understand what transitions are all about.

212
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:29,028
Come on now.

213
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,088
We just took office a year and a half ago.

214
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,308
So we know what it's like.

215
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:36,969
And we know that Diane will be there, as she has been, there to support our administration.

216
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:39,390
And you're going to be missed, my dear.

217
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:39,910
Thank you.

218
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,890
Definitely going to be missed.

219
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:43,666
So with that, I will end this press conference.

220
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,127
And stay tuned.

221
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:47,770
In a couple of weeks, we'll have another one on some more updates.

222
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,854
We have some more grants that we're waiting to get solidified and to make some big announcements.

223
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:54,436
So stay tuned.

224
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,377
And now we over and out.

225
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:57,098
Thank you.
