1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:06,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome everyone to the September 5th, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

2
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:11,497
[SPEAKER_14]: So our first agenda item is the minutes from the August 1st meeting.

3
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:13,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Did everyone have a chance to review them?

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:15,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

7
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:19,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second it.

8
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:19,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

9
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,302
[SPEAKER_14]: All in favor?

10
00:00:22,343 --> 00:00:22,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

11
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:22,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

12
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:23,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

13
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:24,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Any opposed?

14
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:26,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

15
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:28,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

16
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:42,990
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so our work for tonight is to, we got last time, we got through the first three articles of the draft charter.

17
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,473
[SPEAKER_14]: So our work tonight is to get through the rest of it.

18
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:57,439
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just going to open the floor and ask if anybody has any amendments that they want to propose.

19
00:00:58,465 --> 00:00:59,705
[SPEAKER_14]: starting with Article 4.

20
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:05,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything in Article 4?

21
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:10,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a couple of things.

22
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:17,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I noticed in Section 4-1, the term of office,

23
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:37,608
[SPEAKER_11]: reads, the term of office for the six school committee members elected by the voters shall be two years each beginning on the first day of January in the year following the regular municipal election until their successors are qualified.

24
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:49,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it matters or not, but this is not consistent with the city council and the mayor, which indicates, well, no,

25
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I suppose it is somewhat consistent.

26
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,537
[SPEAKER_11]: The word is just a little bit different.

27
00:01:56,098 --> 00:02:10,828
[SPEAKER_11]: It says beginning on the 1st, Monday in January, succeeding the Councilor's election, except when that 1st, Monday falls on a legal holiday, in which event, the term shall begin on the following day and shall end when their successes have been qualified.

28
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:12,550
[SPEAKER_11]: So my thought was.

29
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:22,130
[SPEAKER_11]: shouldn't this, other than, you know, changing the name of the body, shouldn't the rest of the wording be identical?

30
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Consistent.

31
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:24,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, consistent.

32
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:30,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony or someone from the Collins Center, can you speak to that?

33
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:37,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, is it because the school committee meets on Mondays and the city council meets on Tuesdays?

34
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,880
[SPEAKER_08]: As simple as that.

35
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:42,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

36
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:43,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Good question.

37
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:55,474
[SPEAKER_00]: My memory is, I actually don't have the old version, the older version here, but my memory is that the intent was to keep it consistent.

38
00:02:55,694 --> 00:03:07,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the language we received from the committee originally had the provision about not meeting on a holiday in the city council and not in the school committee.

39
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:12,477
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just kept the language consistent except for that addition.

40
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:13,797
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to add it there, you could.

41
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:29,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so Eunice, do you want, are you making a proposal that we add that language so that the term of office for the school committee is consistent with the city council and the mayor?

42
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think Ron has a bit of an interesting point there about the Monday versus Tuesday thing.

43
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:37,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me under this for a second.

44
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:40,788
[SPEAKER_11]: First business day.

45
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,774
[SPEAKER_11]: of January versus beginning of the first Monday.

46
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:49,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the city council is also the first Monday in January.

47
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:53,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it should be consistent.

48
00:03:53,799 --> 00:04:00,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless anybody has a compelling reason for it not to be.

49
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:07,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and the school committee just says the first business day of January, not necessarily the first Monday, right?

50
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:12,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're in effect identical, but I agree that the language should be the same.

51
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:15,989
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Ron.

52
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a point of information.

53
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:35,133
[SPEAKER_08]: When they're inaugurated and become who they are, isn't that their effective date, not the first meeting?

54
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:35,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

55
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:40,154
[SPEAKER_08]: So like on that Sunday, they are the city councilor, not Tuesday.

56
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:49,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of a, I'm trying to make it a moot point, but they don't become, oh, go ahead, I'm sorry.

57
00:04:49,769 --> 00:05:08,582
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding as far as like getting sworn in is, I mean, we traditionally have the inauguration on what, the first Sunday in January usually, you know, and it's, you know, a big celebratory deal, but I think they actually,

58
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:16,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Get sworn in prior to that in the office and then they elect their officers.

59
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:18,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, you're right.

60
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:19,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's more an end.

61
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Via the clerk as soon after I think the.

62
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:40,446
[SPEAKER_11]: celebration, inauguration that the public sees on that first Sunday that's held in one of the local halls and so forth, I think that's largely ceremonial.

63
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:53,354
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they've all already been sworn in on or about the first day of the month of January.

64
00:05:55,687 --> 00:06:18,461
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought, because I've seen photos of, and I think I came across this with, I'd have to go back and find the correspondence, I didn't think of this earlier, that a lot of them, you know, go into the clerk's office, you know, one by one as their schedule allows, and they take the oath.

65
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:22,944
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding, I think, is that they're,

66
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:27,187
[SPEAKER_11]: December 31st is the last day of the term.

67
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:34,432
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the 1st of January is the first day officially of the new term.

68
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:45,560
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think most of them get sworn in, not on the 1st necessarily because that's a holiday and City Hall is closed, but on the 2nd or the 1st business day after the 1st.

69
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:50,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my point is being that it has nothing to do with meeting dates.

70
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,817
[SPEAKER_08]: It more has to do with an effective date of January 1st.

71
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,240
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all active at that point.

72
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:03,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so I think that that's consistent with the language we have now.

73
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:23,519
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to throw out and say, Eunice, tell me if this sounds like what you intend, that a motion to make the language in Article 4.1 under term of office consistent with the mayor and the city council, to make the eligibility language, I mean, the term of office language consistent.

74
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:27,403
[SPEAKER_14]: with all three elected bodies.

75
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:29,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you're going for?

76
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:30,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

77
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:30,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

78
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:30,805
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

79
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:31,706
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

80
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:32,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded.

81
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:34,387
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, great.

82
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody understands what we're voting on?

83
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:42,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I went ahead and put what I imagine the language would look like in the chat, if anybody wants to take a look.

84
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:44,373
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, thank you.

85
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:46,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not exciting, but it's there.

86
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:47,014
OK.

87
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,774
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and yeah, we can send that.

88
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:58,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I was thinking maybe the call-in center would just standardize it for us.

89
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that sound right, Anthony Wilson?

90
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:01,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

91
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:02,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

92
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:03,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

93
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:04,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

94
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:07,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So all in favor, well, let's do a roll call.

95
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andriado.

96
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:10,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

97
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:12,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice.

98
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:13,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

99
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:15,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

100
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just reading David's words, and he includes Monday.

101
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:23,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we saying effective January 1st, or are we saying Monday?

102
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:34,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the motion is that we'll just make the language consistent and leave it to the Collins Center to standardize for us.

103
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:41,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Articles two and three, I put the language from articles two and three above where I wrote proposal, and they both use Monday.

104
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:42,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

105
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:50,148
[SPEAKER_14]: But this motion is that we're just standardizing it and the call-in center will use the best language.

106
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:53,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

107
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Phyllis?

108
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to abstain.

109
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:00,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

110
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:02,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Gene?

111
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:03,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

112
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:06,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury?

113
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:07,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

114
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:09,257
[SPEAKER_14]: David?

115
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:10,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

116
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,351
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm also yes.

117
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:13,292
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, great.

118
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:14,452
[SPEAKER_14]: So that passes.

119
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:21,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody have any other amendments or changes to Article 4?

120
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:35,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Also under 4.1, again, going with consistency, under the district eligibility, Milva, would it be possible for you to put up

121
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:45,169
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, on the screen share screen with the draft so that we can all kind of see what we're looking at.

122
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:49,695
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

123
00:09:52,478 --> 00:10:08,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So it reads, a school committee candidate shall at the time of election be a Medford voter and shall have resided in one of the wards of the district from which they are seeking office for one year prior to submitting nomination papers for the office of school committee.

124
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:14,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And then over on the city council side in section 2.1,

125
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:18,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And we voted on this on August 1st.

126
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:31,130
[SPEAKER_11]: A ward candidate for city council shall at the time of the election be a Medford voter and shall have resided in the ward for which they are seeking office for one year prior to inauguration.

127
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:35,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we should standardize that.

128
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:36,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

129
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:37,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

130
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:39,037
[SPEAKER_11]: We could go either or.

131
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever is the will of the body.

132
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:47,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, while we're, can I broaden this section?

133
00:10:47,559 --> 00:11:04,352
[SPEAKER_14]: This district eligibility, because I noticed another issue that doesn't match up or that's not consistent where about

134
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:12,725
[SPEAKER_14]: the about moving, whether if the school committee member moves from Medford, then the office shall be immediately deemed vacant.

135
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:28,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and in the city council, I believe we had if the if the if a ward Councilor moved from the ward and stayed in Medford, that Councilor could finish out their term.

136
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,976
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm wondering if we want to add that in.

137
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think that's implied here.

138
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:37,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, OK.

139
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:43,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, because it says if they move from Medford, it doesn't say if they move from their ward.

140
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, that's right.

141
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:54,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I guess I'm just wondering whether the fact that it's not specified might raise questions for people.

142
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:00,118
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is specified in the city council section.

143
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:06,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, so I guess I would move that we add the specification that as long as they stay in Medford, they can finish up their term.

144
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:14,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And along with that, I would say I personally prefer the from one year prior to inauguration language.

145
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:20,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would so I don't know if we want to do that as one motion, both of those things.

146
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:24,028
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I if we can, that would be my preference.

147
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:26,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so

148
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:33,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we'll do them separately just to avoid confusion.

149
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:49,702
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first thing that we're going to vote on is whether the person has to reside in the district from one year prior to nomination papers or one year prior to inauguration.

150
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:54,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask the call-in center whether you have any comments on whether one of these is preferable?

151
00:12:56,505 --> 00:13:04,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we would say that the preference would be for from the date of inauguration as that will be a great as that will be a specific date.

152
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:06,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

153
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:08,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so.

154
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:15,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to, David, since you are bringing that up and saying you preferred inauguration, do you want to make that motion?

155
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

156
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask a question before we do that?

157
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

158
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,301
[SPEAKER_07]: We're referring to people as voters.

159
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:27,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have to be a registered voter in that ward for a year?

160
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:34,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Does their voter registration status come into play or is it just their residency?

161
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Just their residency.

162
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:41,272
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're not saying that, though.

163
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:44,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because it says shall have resided in one of the wards.

164
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,434
[SPEAKER_07]: But they could have voted somewhere else.

165
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:55,536
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's in general against the law to vote in a place where you're not a resident, so.

166
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:59,177
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can be multi, like I'm right now, I'm in Maine.

167
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I can vote in Maine and I can vote in Mass.

168
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,718
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's it can be.

169
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,642
[SPEAKER_06]: In general, in the United States, you need to be a resident of exactly one place.

170
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:10,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

171
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:17,525
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be Maine or you could be Medford, but you only get one choice.

172
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Wilson, did you have a comment?

173
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:26,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just sort of add some information there.

174
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:31,310
[SPEAKER_00]: So this comes up in a number of communities like vacation communities.

175
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:39,598
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be a resident in terms of owning property and being in a place sort of part-time like six or three months out of the year.

176
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:41,740
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically be a resident and not be a voter.

177
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:48,146
[SPEAKER_00]: The provision here where you're limited to people who have registered to vote, that is,

178
00:14:50,136 --> 00:15:01,283
[SPEAKER_00]: excluding, I guess, a number of people who might live in Medford, but not have taken the active action of signing up to vote.

179
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,024
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to be aware.

180
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:06,926
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a class of people that are residents, but not voters.

181
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:13,090
[SPEAKER_14]: That issue is

182
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:20,675
[SPEAKER_14]: different than the one we were about to vote on.

183
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:27,919
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's stick with our motion and then we'll go and discuss the voter issue.

184
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:28,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron?

185
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:41,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing I'm thinking is if we, the difference between inauguration day and pulling papers, is there a possibility that someone who pulls papers in whatever the date is,

186
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:48,899
[SPEAKER_08]: will not be eligible to meet that secondary requirement, and if so, should not be qualified to pull papers.

187
00:15:51,140 --> 00:16:02,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the timeline is, but that's my thing, is if you pull papers and it turns out you don't meet the requirement of one year before inauguration, you shouldn't be allowed to pull papers.

188
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:05,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if we cover that in this document.

189
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:20,329
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're, I mean, yeah, I think that's certainly, I think, like, I think that's in general, like a problem we have in the United States.

190
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:22,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I should just let Anthony talk about it.

191
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Wilson.

192
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:26,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just going to say, so one of the.

193
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:45,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I think why having the inauguration date as a preference is that it's a specific date that you can look to in the charter, whereas if you have a time period, I wonder which poll papers, and technically, you know, the nomination papers become available on some date, it varies from community to community, but you have up until the deadline for submission.

194
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:54,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So you leave a lot of ambiguity as to when someone would have to make the determination that this person meets your residency requirements.

195
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,541
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes simpler.

196
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,923
[SPEAKER_00]: You choose a specific date, like the inauguration date.

197
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:08,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So as long as the language states that when you pull the papers, a validation that you will be meeting that requirement.

198
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:14,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want somebody on the ballot that we find out on the inauguration day they don't meet the requirement.

199
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:16,003
[SPEAKER_08]: and pull votes from somebody who does.

200
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:28,457
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you feel like our language is, I'm not sure, but do we have our language covered so that someone who will not be eligible on Inauguration Day a year back does not get to pull papers?

201
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:35,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess from my perspective, I would say having an Inauguration Day be the date would make that determination easier to make.

202
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:47,146
[SPEAKER_08]: But do we have in the, does the clerk now in his process have that check on when papers, or he just counts the 10,000 votes that you need?

203
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,109
[SPEAKER_14]: You mean the signatures?

204
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Signatures, yeah.

205
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:56,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, you know, I guess it's there if we say one year.

206
00:17:56,773 --> 00:18:05,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't, I'm trying to avoid the scenario where somebody's on the ballot, and then we discover on election day that they will not be able to meet that requirement.

207
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,306
[SPEAKER_08]: if they shouldn't be on the ballot in the first place.

208
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:10,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not sure that that would happen.

209
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:14,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that be up to the Elections Commission to specify that?

210
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:26,092
[SPEAKER_11]: If I walk in and go to pull papers, it's incumbent on me to read the rules that the Election Commission would disseminate to me.

211
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:30,173
[SPEAKER_11]: about, you know, whether or not I'm eligible.

212
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:35,235
[SPEAKER_08]: And my curiosity is, is that part of the qualification package that they follow?

213
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:35,635
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

214
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:36,475
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the reason why.

215
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:38,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron, I think that's super reasonable.

216
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:45,118
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, I know that almost every four years you get like 22 year olds who are running for president in some state or another.

217
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:49,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's because in general, we just don't specify those kinds of things.

218
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:49,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

219
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:59,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I don't know what happens if you, like, win the election but aren't actually eligible to take office, but I imagine that it's exceedingly rare.

220
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:01,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would agree.

221
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,607
[SPEAKER_08]: But on this local level, it's definitely a possibility.

222
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:08,169
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we're saying Inauguration Day, I'm fine with that.

223
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:13,932
[SPEAKER_08]: My concern is, as I said, how do we ensure that the Election Commission is following that?

224
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:18,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can write a recommendation at the bottom, outside of the charter.

225
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:20,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a good idea.

226
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Anthony?

227
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:23,192
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to add to the discussion.

228
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:33,200
[SPEAKER_00]: No one specifically has information about your residency for candidates other than what you provide on the papers.

229
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:42,768
[SPEAKER_00]: What usually happens in this situation is someone, usually an opponent, will challenge someone's residence, and then it becomes a fact-finding issue.

230
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:47,272
[SPEAKER_00]: where people will have to present evidence as to their residence or what.

231
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:55,660
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I was making a point that it becomes easier to make the determination if you have a specific date rather than adding to the fact-finding mission.

232
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,342
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to figure out when this person pulled papers.

233
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:00,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

234
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:08,852
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess that we can't prevent everything in the world, but we can put language in to make it

235
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,974
[SPEAKER_14]: more streamlined and easier if such a thing does occur.

236
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:30,951
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would be with Ron in, we put a recommendation in somewhere wherever appropriate, maybe in the final report somewhere that, you know, the Elections Commission needs to be on top of this.

237
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so next month is the final report.

238
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:41,985
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll make note of that and we can talk about adding that next month if it didn't get in.

239
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:42,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

240
00:20:45,233 --> 00:21:03,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so the motion is that under district eligibility in all, not just school committee, not just 401, but we make that consistent with city council and we use one year prior to inauguration.

241
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,992
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have to be with mayor too.

242
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:07,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Want to be consistent across the board.

243
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:10,657
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have the residency requirement with mayor.

244
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, we don't?

245
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:17,028
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just with ward Councilors and school committee.

246
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:20,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

247
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:21,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll second it.

248
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:22,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

249
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:23,289
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

250
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:28,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to do that thing again where I can't see everybody because I'm sharing screen, so I'm going to try to do it by memory.

251
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice.

252
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

253
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:33,771
[SPEAKER_14]: David.

254
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:34,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

255
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:36,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

256
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:37,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

257
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:38,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury.

258
00:21:39,352 --> 00:21:39,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

259
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:40,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Gene.

260
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:41,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

261
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Phyllis?

262
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:44,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

263
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:46,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andreottola?

264
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:50,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what I'm voting on, so I'll abstain.

265
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:51,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

266
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:55,109
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm yes.

267
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I get everybody?

268
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:07,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so the next issue that we had in section 4.1

269
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:24,076
[SPEAKER_14]: was to standardize if someone moves out of, in this case, for the school committee, it's the district.

270
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:26,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make that motion.

271
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:28,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

272
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,343
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's be clear about what the motion is, that we're standardizing language.

273
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:38,687
[SPEAKER_06]: If they move within the city, they are allowed to finish out their term.

274
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:43,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, okay, so we don't have, yeah, and that's what the city council says.

275
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:55,724
[SPEAKER_14]: So the motion is that if a district school committee member moves out of the district during their term and stays within Medford, they're allowed to finish out their term.

276
00:22:58,525 --> 00:22:59,086
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll second it.

277
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Daveed.

278
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

279
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:08,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

280
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:10,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

281
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:12,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice.

282
00:23:13,336 --> 00:23:13,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

283
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:16,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Morris, Maury.

284
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:18,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

285
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:26,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm writing a word and talking.

286
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:27,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andreottola.

287
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,160
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

288
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

289
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:33,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Phyllis.

290
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:34,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

291
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:36,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Gene.

292
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:37,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

293
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,444
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think I'm the last person left, and I'm a yes.

294
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:45,705
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, great.

295
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:46,705
[SPEAKER_14]: So that passes.

296
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:50,148
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

297
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:59,895
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, now we did have something come up during this discussion.

298
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:08,341
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a question about the use of the word voter, which I believe we used in other sections as well.

299
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:14,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody, do people still feel comfortable with that?

300
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:17,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm comfortable with it.

301
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

302
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:24,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember we talked about it pretty extensively when we were talking about sections two and three, so.

303
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:25,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

304
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:28,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Then there's no proposal to change that.

305
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:28,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

306
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:28,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

307
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,630
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

308
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody have any other changes in article four?

309
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:39,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a couple of others, but I don't want to hog the, you know, if other people do.

310
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody does, so go ahead.

311
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:44,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

312
00:24:45,335 --> 00:25:11,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought if I recall that Paulette had a concern about this one, and I know she's not here and I may be off base, but in board 2, and this is something that in going through the notes from our phone center friends, the secretary or clerk part,

313
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:27,140
[SPEAKER_11]: that the Collins Center deleted the language about the secretary is responsible for overseeing and approving the bills unless the school committee votes to form a subcommittee, et cetera.

314
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:39,792
[SPEAKER_11]: The Secretary, as far as I know, the Secretary has been approving the bills, you know, for years and years and years.

315
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,192
[SPEAKER_11]: It's how things have always been done.

316
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:48,534
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is that it's a check and balance sort of situation.

317
00:25:48,554 --> 00:25:53,015
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess the question of, you know, should it continue that way?

318
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:55,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And in that case, should the language go back to the way it was?

319
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:57,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, you know,

320
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Should the finance director, you know, be consulted before we change any language?

321
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:11,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think the language was deleted, so I don't think it may be.

322
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,969
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it would.

323
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well, Paulette didn't.

324
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:20,256
[SPEAKER_14]: contact me with any amendments, first of all.

325
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:26,539
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't think we say anything about the handling of the bills or anything.

326
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,381
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was deleted.

327
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:39,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it means that that system can't continue just because we took it out.

328
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:41,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

329
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:42,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

330
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:52,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so the school committees could still choose to do that either by voting that way or just by practice.

331
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what it seems like.

332
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:58,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take that process away from them.

333
00:26:58,427 --> 00:26:59,508
[SPEAKER_02]: They can choose that.

334
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:00,348
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

335
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:07,972
[SPEAKER_14]: So does that change what you, do you still want to look at adding it back in, Eunice?

336
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:19,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to do something from memory with what I thought Paulette had mentioned, so I don't want to misspeak necessarily.

337
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:33,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if it's something maybe we can just leave it, I suppose, and if she has an issue with it, she can bring it up.

338
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:34,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

339
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:36,330
[SPEAKER_02]: She's pretty thorough.

340
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if she had anything about this, she would have gotten in touch with Milner about it.

341
00:27:42,638 --> 00:27:42,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

342
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:43,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

343
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:44,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

344
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:46,019
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

345
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,159
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're moving on from that?

346
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

347
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Then under the filling of vacancies part, section 4.6.

348
00:27:54,482 --> 00:28:01,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you make it a little bit bigger too, Melissa, please?

349
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:02,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

350
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:04,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

351
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:08,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's my notes?

352
00:28:11,547 --> 00:28:12,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

353
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:16,656
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of quick things here.

354
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:31,800
[SPEAKER_11]: In section 1, I think it might be just a typo where third line down, it says Office of Councilor at Large.

355
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:38,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we want to probably say School Committee Member at Large on that.

356
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:42,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think that was a copy-paste job from

357
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:45,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, city council stuff.

358
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:48,819
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, just want to change that to thank you.

359
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we probably don't have to vote on that.

360
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:51,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

361
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:52,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Because no, I don't think so.

362
00:28:52,703 --> 00:28:55,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's just something that I picked up and then.

363
00:28:57,508 --> 00:29:02,573
[SPEAKER_11]: A note from the call and center on this and I guess.

364
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:07,718
[SPEAKER_11]: There isn't anything in there, but it was a suggestion from them and just, you know.

365
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:18,733
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, they suggested under four six, which is where we are now that the, we mirror the city council vacancy provision, which I think we're doing.

366
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:31,216
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, um, the project team suggested the committee consider allowing the school committee and the city council to fill a school committee, um, vacancy jointly.

367
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:36,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, um, I would say absolutely not.

368
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:41,148
[SPEAKER_11]: think each body should fill their own vacancies.

369
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:52,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if that's something that we wanted to talk about in their notes to us.

370
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:58,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Wilson, do you remember?

371
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

372
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:03,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

373
00:30:04,318 --> 00:30:06,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Anthony.

374
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a copy paste mistake as well.

375
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:15,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because I'm looking at, uh, we're talking about, uh, filling of vacancies here, right?

376
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:27,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but we're talking, we're talking about, um, that in the memo from the call-in center, they recommended mirroring the city council vacancy provision, which I think we're, we're, we agree is a good idea.

377
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:36,700
[SPEAKER_14]: And but the other part of it was suggesting that the committee consider allowing the school committee and city council to fill the vacancy joint.

378
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,381
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's, can you, Anthony Wilson, talk about maybe the reasoning behind that recommendation?

379
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:44,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I just want to double check.

380
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:46,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is, Marilyn, are you on the call?

381
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:48,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that you at the 781 number?

382
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:48,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess not.

383
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:55,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess not.

384
00:30:56,643 --> 00:30:58,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is a suggestion.

385
00:30:58,143 --> 00:31:01,485
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the suggestions.

386
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:03,065
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't actually change the language.

387
00:31:03,086 --> 00:31:03,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here.

388
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:04,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I was muted.

389
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:05,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go on.

390
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:10,809
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know if you wanted to, you could probably speak a little bit more succinctly than me on this suggestion from us to them.

391
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:12,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

392
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:23,895
[SPEAKER_09]: In the case of a school committee vacancy, the council gets involved because they are representing the voters.

393
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:33,038
[SPEAKER_09]: at large, the school committee shouldn't fill its own vacancy.

394
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:38,241
[SPEAKER_09]: There should be some way to represent the voters of the city.

395
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:43,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And most communities use an approach like the one we've proposed here.

396
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:52,709
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of a check and balance system so that it's not sort of dominated, but that's, yeah.

397
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:57,978
[SPEAKER_10]: But the school committee is elected by the voters.

398
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't think it makes any sense.

399
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,281
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're not participating in filling the vacancy.

400
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:09,243
[SPEAKER_09]: So the council is actually representing the voters in that instance.

401
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:14,946
[SPEAKER_10]: But the school committee doesn't get involved in city council vacancies.

402
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:15,986
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

403
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:16,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

404
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:19,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the school committee is secondary too.

405
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:24,310
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee is a single, is an entity with a single job.

406
00:32:25,306 --> 00:32:29,071
[SPEAKER_09]: To they do not represent the whole city they represent.

407
00:32:29,812 --> 00:32:34,898
[SPEAKER_09]: The, the school department, essentially, the city council represents the whole city.

408
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,265
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're trying to that that's why other communities do this.

409
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:41,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

410
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:44,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

411
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:48,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer the idea that the school committee fills its own vacancies.

412
00:32:49,736 --> 00:32:52,279
[SPEAKER_06]: There is also, I think, a paste error in section 46.3.

413
00:32:52,419 --> 00:33:00,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here's where we are anyway.

414
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:01,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

415
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:07,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, the typos and things will get to those.

416
00:33:08,814 --> 00:33:10,916
[SPEAKER_14]: I, you know, we've actually already addressed.

417
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:15,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It says the remaining members of the school committee shall elect a person to fill the vacancy.

418
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:17,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it says a person elected by the city council.

419
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, I see.

420
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is maybe actually even why we're discussing this.

421
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:26,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that should be a person elected by the school committee.

422
00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:29,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

423
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:41,063
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've heard the reasons for potentially having the city council involved.

424
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:58,074
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think the first level is that it's the next highest vote ever, right?

425
00:33:58,114 --> 00:34:02,938
[SPEAKER_14]: The only time appointment is going to happen is if there's nobody to do that.

426
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:03,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

427
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Milda, can I just interrupt?

428
00:34:10,454 --> 00:34:17,337
[SPEAKER_08]: To that point, we're also saying you have to have achieved 30% in order to be next man up.

429
00:34:19,718 --> 00:34:20,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what that says?

430
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:21,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not reading.

431
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it is.

432
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:36,846
[SPEAKER_08]: So my point to that is, why don't we just leave it as, you know, going by the next most all the way down, because that also eliminates a vote of somebody who didn't even run.

433
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:40,731
[SPEAKER_08]: as the last option, should be the very, very last option.

434
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:46,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody who ran, it's just my opinion, if you... You're saying we should just go down the list.

435
00:34:46,977 --> 00:34:56,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess... At least go down to 20% to add two more names to that pile before we go to this city council vote.

436
00:34:57,486 --> 00:35:02,311
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, no, I think along the lines of the Collins Center argument,

437
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:09,182
[SPEAKER_14]: the threshold of, you know, those people didn't get a very high threshold of votes.

438
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:14,450
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the city council who did get the votes and represents the whole city.

439
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,993
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you could look at it that way.

440
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:17,516
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I'm saying.

441
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:20,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron, I got to say, I'm comfortable with with 20%.

442
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:23,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly wouldn't want it to be lower than that.

443
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:26,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think there are enough cranks who run.

444
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:35,311
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if 90% or 80% of the city... You meant to say non-favorable candidates, I think.

445
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sorry.

446
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:41,714
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people who didn't get votes for a reason.

447
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:42,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

448
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:55,447
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, so now we have another idea on the table, which is to lower the threshold to 20%, not less than 20% of the total vote cast gene.

449
00:35:56,867 --> 00:36:06,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for city council, we have the, if you just want to think about consistency, we have the 30% is what we require for city council.

450
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:07,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

451
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:15,595
[SPEAKER_10]: If we change it to 20%, we should have a good reason for being different there.

452
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:16,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

453
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:18,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.

454
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:20,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I would prefer to see consistency.

455
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:21,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

456
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:23,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

457
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,710
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've had a discussion about this.

458
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:29,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody want to make a proposal on any of the issues we've been discussing?

459
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to, I would, uh, Jean.

460
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:41,634
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I don't completely understand the city council, um, piece.

461
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:42,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess I,

462
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:50,189
[SPEAKER_10]: prefer to have the school committee vote and fill the vacancy and not have the city council involved.

463
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,090
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my proposal.

464
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:54,232
[SPEAKER_14]: I second that.

465
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:56,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Daveed?

466
00:36:57,995 --> 00:36:59,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to make the same proposal.

467
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we are voting on

468
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:17,361
[SPEAKER_14]: that a person after the 30% threshold and after, if the position still needs to be filled, that the school committee would fill the position.

469
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone?

470
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:28,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I apologize for interrupting, Madam Chair, but the current language is just for the school committee to make the election.

471
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,112
[SPEAKER_00]: The city council part there, that's a typo.

472
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:36,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a corrected version in front of me that already has it, so we can do that update.

473
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:40,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's the city school committee on that.

474
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

475
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:45,583
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a vote to confirm that we all agree that that's what we want.

476
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:47,985
[SPEAKER_06]: As it currently stands.

477
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:51,007
[SPEAKER_14]: So, basically, it's to leave the language the way it is.

478
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And 2, we're just reiterating that because.

479
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:56,611
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we're going against the recommendation.

480
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we don't know.

481
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:00,133
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to vote on that.

482
00:38:00,213 --> 00:38:00,934
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to see.

483
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:29,981
[SPEAKER_11]: So then if we choose to leave the wording the way it is in section three there, filling your vacancies by the school committee, then are we, and maybe this is a different motion, changing the 30% threshold to 20%, and then another arm of that is, are we changing it over for city council as well?

484
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:32,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, we're not talking about that right now.

485
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:57,812
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just talking about when a opening needs to be filled that can't be filled by someone who has run and met that 30% threshold currently, as it is, then the motion on the table is that we leave this as is and say that the city council will fill the vacancy, which is contrary to the recommendation of the policy.

486
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:01,334
[SPEAKER_14]: You mean the school committee?

487
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:02,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I misspeak?

488
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:03,496
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

489
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:08,979
[SPEAKER_14]: The school committee fills the vacancies.

490
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:15,122
[SPEAKER_14]: If you vote yes, you're voting for the school committee to fill the vacancy and not the city council.

491
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:17,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that clear to everyone?

492
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,445
[SPEAKER_14]: David?

493
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

494
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:24,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron?

495
00:39:26,308 --> 00:39:26,548
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

496
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:28,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury?

497
00:39:29,189 --> 00:39:29,469
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

498
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:30,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice.

499
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:31,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

500
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:32,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean.

501
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:35,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

502
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andreadov.

503
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:38,611
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

504
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:40,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Phyllis.

505
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:43,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

506
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:44,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a no.

507
00:39:45,912 --> 00:39:53,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, we have a tie because we only have eight people here tonight.

508
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:58,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I think then that means the yes gets it.

509
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:06,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

510
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:09,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the motion was, doesn't pass.

511
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:17,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it's immaterial because it was a motion not to change anything, but it seems like then people want to change something.

512
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:21,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're split on that.

513
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:23,850
[SPEAKER_14]: The eight people that are here now are split on that.

514
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,750
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm trying to understand.

515
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, as I said in the beginning,

516
00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:39,526
[SPEAKER_11]: That I thought that the school committee should be handling their own affairs That's we just had the vote Voting.

517
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:43,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes was it support of school committee handling its own affairs, right?

518
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:44,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that david.

519
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:54,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Um what i'm trying to understand is why You know what the reasoning is that people would vote against that Um, I mean maryland spoke to it.

520
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:59,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean to me this isn't the affairs of the school committee It's who's on the school committee.

521
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,330
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's not

522
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,046
[SPEAKER_14]: The affairs of the school committee are the job of the school committee.

523
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:07,666
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I see it.

524
00:41:07,826 --> 00:41:12,147
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I'm saying.

525
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:13,507
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look at it like this too.

526
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:28,130
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have ward Councilors, two ward Councilors that would represent that district that could have a say and who would fill that role, who would know the people from that district.

527
00:41:28,748 --> 00:41:43,315
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so in a way, having the city council kind of, which would be 11 people, you know, decide rather than the school committee, which would be minus one.

528
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:50,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're talking just a handful of people making the decision that affects the whole city.

529
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,522
[SPEAKER_14]: You're also talking about the mayor, because the mayor's on the school committee.

530
00:41:58,263 --> 00:41:58,363
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

531
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:02,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

532
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:15,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to answer Eunice's point, I mean, listen to Marilyn talking about the perception of the city council not being more, you know, having, representing the city in a different way than the school committee.

533
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:23,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Having the school committee be impacted by that decision makes me lean towards the city council decision.

534
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:23,967
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I voted no.

535
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:26,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Maury.

536
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:31,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron stole my thunder because that's exactly how I felt.

537
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:43,015
[SPEAKER_01]: The way Marilyn explained it and so forth like that was a different perspective than when we went over this a few months ago and so forth and came up with this.

538
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:49,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I never looked at the city council as really representing the public in general.

539
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:52,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of why I voted the way I did.

540
00:42:53,582 --> 00:42:55,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the feedback.

541
00:42:56,244 --> 00:43:10,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if, since we have a tie, if it's something that we table in the hopes and revote in the next month, in the hopes that we have, you know, I mean, we're missing three people, so.

542
00:43:10,693 --> 00:43:17,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and actually, yeah, Danielle actually told me she would be here late, so.

543
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:21,233
[SPEAKER_14]: We're missing Danielle, we're missing Paulette, and we're missing- I know.

544
00:43:21,613 --> 00:43:24,915
[SPEAKER_14]: We might get Danielle tonight, but okay.

545
00:43:25,115 --> 00:43:28,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need a point of clarification.

546
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:35,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the vote went, the language stays the same with the update of the typographical appraised errors, correct?

547
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:38,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the vote was tied.

548
00:43:38,722 --> 00:43:39,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

549
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:41,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So the language would stay the same as it is right now.

550
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,951
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not going to be the same.

551
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:50,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the motion was that the language would stay the same, and it was tied.

552
00:43:50,215 --> 00:43:53,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And if the motion falls, that means the language wouldn't stay the same.

553
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,319
[SPEAKER_14]: But we didn't vote on what to change the language to, although I think it's already.

554
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody knows what the choices are.

555
00:43:58,941 --> 00:44:00,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Just so far, I'm clear.

556
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:00,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

557
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:09,168
[SPEAKER_02]: The language right now after that vote is not going to change with the exception of any typographical or pasting errors.

558
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:10,089
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't.

559
00:44:10,629 --> 00:44:35,327
[SPEAKER_08]: point of information it's all we did was vote nothing so it stays the same way before we took the vote we still need no no no no we need a vote because otherwise i think i think we are going to table this particular vote and do it again and when we have at the next meeting and and to that end i think you know we're missing one person that not that everybody's you know

560
00:44:37,763 --> 00:44:44,846
[SPEAKER_11]: opinion isn't valuable, but we're missing one person who, you know, served on the school committee, who may have some valuable input for us.

561
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:50,028
[SPEAKER_08]: With all due respect, Eunice, if Danielle shows up tonight, we should take the vote.

562
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:55,550
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't be holding votes to make sure everybody's here, just that's the process.

563
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,331
[SPEAKER_08]: So if Danielle shows up, we can split the vote.

564
00:44:58,511 --> 00:44:59,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I say we move the vote.

565
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:01,232
[SPEAKER_14]: I think

566
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:06,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron, what we're going to do is we're going to take this vote again when Danielle shows up.

567
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:13,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you're right, it's possible that at our next meeting we won't have the other three of us.

568
00:45:14,498 --> 00:45:15,778
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's take the vote again.

569
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:18,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Just point of process, too.

570
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,882
[SPEAKER_08]: We can vote when Danielle gets here to table it.

571
00:45:22,162 --> 00:45:22,983
[SPEAKER_08]: That we can do.

572
00:45:23,443 --> 00:45:24,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we can.

573
00:45:24,064 --> 00:45:24,904
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to be a vote.

574
00:45:25,705 --> 00:45:28,266
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to revisit it when Danielle gets here.

575
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:28,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

576
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:29,947
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

577
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:31,168
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

578
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:37,164
[SPEAKER_14]: There was some, does anybody, do we have anything else?

579
00:45:37,224 --> 00:45:42,547
[SPEAKER_14]: It was discussion about lowering the threshold and then Jean pointed out that it's 30% with city council.

580
00:45:42,627 --> 00:45:48,871
[SPEAKER_14]: So does somebody want to make a proposal to make a change?

581
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:50,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I withdraw my amendment to change it.

582
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:52,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

583
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:54,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

584
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:56,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else in article four?

585
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:57,937
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm good.

586
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:00,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

587
00:46:00,815 --> 00:46:01,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

588
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:03,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Article 5.

589
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:07,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Article 5, which is short.

590
00:46:08,777 --> 00:46:13,638
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was pretty much boilerplate language, but does anybody have anything they want to change for that?

591
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:15,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Administrative procedures?

592
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:16,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Administrative organization?

593
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:17,878
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

594
00:46:17,918 --> 00:46:20,299
[SPEAKER_14]: What about Article 6 is financial procedures?

595
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:21,239
[SPEAKER_11]: The budget?

596
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:24,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have one question on 5, but it's kind of a practical question.

597
00:46:27,547 --> 00:46:35,531
[SPEAKER_11]: It talks about somewhere in there, City Council, I think it's somewhere in Section 5.1.

598
00:46:36,471 --> 00:46:44,355
[SPEAKER_11]: The City Council shall hold one or more public hearings on the proposal, giving notice by publication in a local newspaper.

599
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:49,757
[SPEAKER_11]: My point to this in its consistency and all over is that,

600
00:46:57,395 --> 00:47:09,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the clerk does put things in like the Medford-Somerville Journal or something, but we've talked about ensuring that things are publicized by all means possible.

601
00:47:10,445 --> 00:47:19,011
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, making sure that language such as that gets put in, you know, everywhere that it says newspaper.

602
00:47:20,612 --> 00:47:21,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make sense?

603
00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:36,094
[SPEAKER_14]: So your proposal is that whenever there's an incidence in the charter that says that something needs to be publicized in a local newspaper, that that language is changed to?

604
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:45,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we had it somewhere in section 9, too, about, let's see if I can find it.

605
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanwhile, Maury, did you want to say something?

606
00:47:54,411 --> 00:48:08,435
[SPEAKER_01]: We went over this when we went over the different articles, and I thought it came back that the clerk uses either the Herald or the Globe for all their announcements, as well as anything like maybe the Summerville Journal and so forth like that.

607
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:19,318
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought we were led to believe through the clerk's office that it was either the Herald or the Globe that they consider the newspaper for advertising.

608
00:48:20,451 --> 00:48:20,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

609
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's what we came up with.

610
00:48:23,112 --> 00:48:23,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

611
00:48:23,432 --> 00:48:24,212
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you're right.

612
00:48:24,452 --> 00:48:25,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry about that.

613
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:26,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

614
00:48:26,472 --> 00:48:27,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

615
00:48:27,893 --> 00:48:31,773
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, OK, to be all this stuff and committee meetings and so forth.

616
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:49,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would certainly support the idea that we replace the word newspaper with like something else about, you know, public by publication in a reasonable manner or something like it doesn't seem like

617
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:58,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I think fewer people every year are getting physical newspapers, and I have no idea where those kinds of announcements are on the Globe website.

618
00:49:00,996 --> 00:49:07,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think it would be completely reasonable to find something to replace newspaper with there.

619
00:49:09,102 --> 00:49:13,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Collin Center, can you speak to this?

620
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:19,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Because this is obviously not, other communities deal with this decline of newspapers as well.

621
00:49:20,402 --> 00:49:25,604
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fairly, I guess I would sort of classify this as sort of vanilla language.

622
00:49:26,665 --> 00:49:28,146
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reflected in state law.

623
00:49:28,246 --> 00:49:33,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the times when there's a state law that requires a publication, it uses newspapers.

624
00:49:33,768 --> 00:49:41,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee member DeVete's point, I apologize if I'm messing up your name, is something that committees do.

625
00:49:42,255 --> 00:49:45,936
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've heard communities are dealing with, what are the best ways to get our information out there?

626
00:49:47,357 --> 00:49:52,799
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see as you look at sort of most laws, they're gonna still say newspaper for any number of reasons.

627
00:49:53,419 --> 00:49:59,102
[SPEAKER_00]: If the committee wants to change it, there's language about having it posted on the website.

628
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:05,504
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things is a lot of older language talks about bulletin boards.

629
00:50:06,324 --> 00:50:07,565
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually it's language

630
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:20,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to sort of give you the wrong, but usually there's language around sort of any accessible method and on the community's website is some places where communities do change.

631
00:50:21,962 --> 00:50:31,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I feel like something like publication in a manner, you know, like reasonably available to the public or something.

632
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:36,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And that concludes newspapers or websites or anything else.

633
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,092
[SPEAKER_06]: But I imagine we have to pay to publish these announcements.

634
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:42,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think you do.

635
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:52,758
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm sure it's not a large expense, but it also seems a little silly, especially given that we don't have a newspaper that directly covers Medford.

636
00:50:53,378 --> 00:50:57,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury, did you want to say something?

637
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.

638
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:03,047
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, listen to what Anthony just said.

639
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,589
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, newspapers generally the

640
00:51:10,428 --> 00:51:13,729
[SPEAKER_01]: the vehicle of choice that everyone uses.

641
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:29,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand it's different today with emails and websites and so forth, but I still think you have a sector out there of seniors and so forth that may not have computers, that may not have email, that may not have Instagram or whatever.

642
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,213
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want to include that as a

643
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:37,435
[SPEAKER_01]: options are in addition to, that'd be fine.

644
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:42,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I still would keep newspapers as the primary for this, at this point.

645
00:51:42,277 --> 00:51:47,538
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I guess my interpretation of newspaper is that it doesn't have to be a paper newspaper.

646
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:53,640
[SPEAKER_14]: It can be an electronic newspaper or some sort of newsletter or something.

647
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,281
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway, that's just my interpretation.

648
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:56,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron?

649
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:08,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think we should be encouraged to keep it as general as possible because if we say newspapers and in 20 years, there's no such thing as a newspaper, then we'd have to make an amendment.

650
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:17,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just think, you know, saying finding the best ways of communicating to the community leaves it up to the details to somebody else.

651
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:20,228
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we should stay away, particularly in this kind of

652
00:52:21,392 --> 00:52:30,381
[SPEAKER_08]: issue, which is not a major issue, that we should just leave it to a general statement and let the people at the time decide how that's done.

653
00:52:32,063 --> 00:52:34,866
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're saying we should change newspaper, Ron?

654
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:36,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to be clear on what you're saying.

655
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:43,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying eliminate newspaper and just call it general community distribution of information.

656
00:52:45,043 --> 00:52:51,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make a motion that we specifically change it to giving notice by publication in a reasonable and standard manner.

657
00:52:51,988 --> 00:52:52,529
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

658
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I just want to circle back for one second to Anthony's.

659
00:52:58,213 --> 00:53:06,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to, Anthony, can you address again that this language is a reflection of state law because this is state law still says newspaper?

660
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:19,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it's a reflection of state law, but I would say is that in most places in state law, when you look at requirements for publication or advertisement, they're talking about, they use the word newspaper.

661
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:31,105
[SPEAKER_14]: But do you feel that because of that, that the charter should say that as well, or do you think it's fine to change it?

662
00:53:32,382 --> 00:53:34,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll let Marilyn jump in here.

663
00:53:34,563 --> 00:53:41,706
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we gave you was sort of the most sort of inoffensive language possible for this section.

664
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:52,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say, you know, a lot of charters in a lot of places where they ask for publication or publications required of some document or some meeting, it does use the word newspaper.

665
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:55,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the most prevalent and the most prevalent.

666
00:53:55,892 --> 00:53:57,572
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the most common.

667
00:53:58,513 --> 00:54:01,474
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, Marilyn, did you want to add to that?

668
00:54:02,702 --> 00:54:07,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yes, I just think that what's being proposed is is far too vague.

669
00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:11,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And it, it allows for discretion.

670
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:18,710
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't know that anything would get meet the requirement.

671
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:26,593
[SPEAKER_09]: The old requirement was that a newspaper guaranteed you quote unquote, general circulation reaches everyone.

672
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:29,015
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we say that

673
00:54:31,144 --> 00:54:32,884
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be on the city bulletin board.

674
00:54:32,924 --> 00:54:34,925
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be on the city website.

675
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:47,188
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be in the newspaper if, you know, if it's available and, you know, maybe post notices in other public places, such as the senior center and the library, but you really can.

676
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:57,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, you really have to define what general you have to.

677
00:54:57,692 --> 00:55:01,315
[SPEAKER_09]: try to meet that standard of general circulation to the best of your ability.

678
00:55:02,196 --> 00:55:04,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And that sentence just does not do it.

679
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:05,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

680
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:17,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I would only just add, just for the committee's consideration, in the public, in the open meeting law, it allows an additional newspaper posting on the city's website.

681
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:24,135
[SPEAKER_00]: So website is a term that is used, you know, in the place of the law that, again, it seems acceptable.

682
00:55:26,224 --> 00:55:26,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

683
00:55:26,664 --> 00:55:31,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I just propose amending David's statement to add within state guidelines?

684
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:36,006
[SPEAKER_08]: That seems to be able to cover the newspaper issue, whatever changes.

685
00:55:36,526 --> 00:55:36,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And again.

686
00:55:37,686 --> 00:55:41,207
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there are no state guidelines.

687
00:55:41,987 --> 00:55:44,507
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to say what we want in the charter.

688
00:55:46,268 --> 00:55:52,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to, and you've talked about transparency, and you've talked about people having access to information.

689
00:55:53,602 --> 00:56:00,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, we're going to define that so that the information is out there in as many places as it is reasonable to be.

690
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:11,846
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Marilyn, would you think that leaving newspaper and adding something else would be specific?

691
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:13,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you're?

692
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:14,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

693
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:15,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's where I'm going.

694
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:17,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

695
00:56:18,448 --> 00:56:18,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean.

696
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:28,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was going to be my proposal, is newspaper and website, or say- Or digital media.

697
00:56:29,277 --> 00:56:44,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Or digital media, but or use standard language throughout and then define general circulation in the definition section, which would say at a minimum, it would have to be newspaper and website.

698
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:50,127
[SPEAKER_10]: So those were my two thoughts.

699
00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:54,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, can I just say, I just, I'm, I'm a little concerned.

700
00:56:54,576 --> 00:57:10,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want it to end up that city businesses advertised on social media where it might be restricted to certain groups and not access to everyone, even though, like, people have everyone has access to social media.

701
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people don't have it.

702
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,691
[SPEAKER_07]: So, when we.

703
00:57:14,818 --> 00:57:17,142
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of go step away from newspaper.

704
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:26,978
[SPEAKER_07]: We are trying to bring it into a more digital realm and maybe newspapers can be shared

705
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:45,021
[SPEAKER_07]: other ways, you know, like through digital kind of, you know, people may not get a physical newspaper, but you can get the Globe or the Herald or the City Announcements, you know, at your fingertips.

706
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,202
[SPEAKER_07]: So this way it's equal access.

707
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:49,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

708
00:57:50,689 --> 00:57:53,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury and Ron, did you want to say something?

709
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:55,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury, did you want to say something?

710
00:57:55,452 --> 00:57:57,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to Anthony, what he was saying.

711
00:57:57,994 --> 00:57:59,314
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of basically where I was going.

712
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:10,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that there's all kinds of public notices of what's going on within the government, whether it be for zoning, liquor licenses, public hearings and meetings and so forth.

713
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:16,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is a lot of advertising going on out there on a continual basis.

714
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:20,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Ron, did you have another point?

715
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:29,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just want to move the question to just say communication by newspaper and city website minimally.

716
00:58:31,956 --> 00:58:40,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so I just want to check in with David and see in light of this discussion, because you did have a proposal on the table.

717
00:58:40,702 --> 00:58:42,563
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to check in with David about that.

718
00:58:43,718 --> 00:58:51,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, so the goal I had in proposing a difference was really just kind of to future-proof the thing, right?

719
00:58:51,583 --> 00:59:02,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine that if what we're saying is reasonable in standard manner, that might mean for the next 10 years that we continue to publish in a newspaper.

720
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:03,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more

721
00:59:06,825 --> 00:59:20,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Along the idea that like maybe 10, 15 years in the future, the city council decides that publishing in a newspaper is a waste of the, I don't know, five, $10 per publication, then the city could decide to do something more reasonable.

722
00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:23,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a big deal either way.

723
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:34,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I would prefer, I think, like my specific goal in making the proposal was to remove the word newspaper as a requirement to give that flexibility.

724
00:59:35,893 --> 00:59:39,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I don't think I prefer Ron's, uh, suggestion.

725
00:59:40,295 --> 00:59:44,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I also don't have a super strong feeling on this either way, if that makes sense.

726
00:59:45,216 --> 00:59:57,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the goal is flexibility and it newspaper just to me feels like a silly requirement for people 25 years from now, obviously for today, I think it's a very reasonable one.

727
00:59:58,681 --> 00:59:59,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

728
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:04,583
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm, um, I'm going to throw out a proposal and say that

729
01:00:06,153 --> 01:00:11,274
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, I'm going to propose that we leave newspaper and add city website.

730
01:00:11,394 --> 01:00:13,534
[SPEAKER_14]: So we say newspaper and city website.

731
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:21,616
[SPEAKER_14]: And also just want to say in conjunction with that, that it doesn't mean that the city can't publicize things in other places.

732
01:00:22,636 --> 01:00:26,297
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the charter says this is what they have to do.

733
01:00:27,437 --> 01:00:29,397
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't stop them from doing other things.

734
01:00:31,818 --> 01:00:33,798
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and I guess,

735
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:39,874
[SPEAKER_14]: As I said before, to me, newspaper includes digital media.

736
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:56,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Going into on Article 9, which we had talked about a while ago, one of our prior meetings that we were going to ask to be included in that section,

737
01:00:58,944 --> 01:01:17,113
[SPEAKER_11]: For the rules, regulations, periodic review of ordinances, and so forth, we asked to have included language that requires all information, like rules, regulations, agendas, meeting notices, et cetera, to be shared with the public via all available means.

738
01:01:17,794 --> 01:01:20,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm wondering if we could apply that here.

739
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:26,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we could, but I think that falls under Marilyn's comment about being vague.

740
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's not defined.

741
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:32,861
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not defined.

742
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:34,442
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

743
01:01:34,462 --> 01:01:35,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

744
01:01:35,722 --> 01:01:39,383
[SPEAKER_14]: If we say newspaper and city website, that's defined.

745
01:01:39,784 --> 01:01:46,206
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't prevent the city from putting it out in other places, but it defines the minimum that they have to do.

746
01:01:46,606 --> 01:01:48,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you agree with that, Anthony Wilson?

747
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:52,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.

748
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:53,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

749
01:01:54,295 --> 01:02:05,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so that's my proposal that, you know, we keep newspaper in all the places where it says things have to be disseminated by newspaper, but we add that newspaper and city website.

750
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:07,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I will second that.

751
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:08,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

752
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:10,446
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, one quick question.

753
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:22,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed today, too, and I don't know if this was by charter or not, that everything is also posted on a board in the clerk's office for the public to go in and see.

754
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:25,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's part of the charter or not.

755
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,511
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be, I mean.

756
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:36,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a requirement right now that the clerk is obligated to post all meetings in his office?

757
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:42,718
[SPEAKER_14]: You're saying is there a requirement in the charter?

758
01:02:42,738 --> 01:02:43,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

759
01:02:43,779 --> 01:02:45,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there is in our current charter.

760
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:45,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

761
01:02:46,712 --> 01:02:50,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's part of open meeting law that it had to be.

762
01:02:50,795 --> 01:02:52,736
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it had to be somewhere accessible.

763
01:02:52,756 --> 01:02:55,198
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was outside of the clerk's office.

764
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:56,779
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought that there was.

765
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:06,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It was posted also posted at the police station as well, because that's the only building in the city that's open 24 7. and then, I don't know, I think it was.

766
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:16,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe when mayor came to be that she started using the city website.

767
01:03:17,058 --> 01:03:19,481
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and that became.

768
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:26,651
[SPEAKER_11]: 1 of the main methods of communications prior to that, I don't think I think it was just.

769
01:03:28,403 --> 01:03:31,065
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're talking about more than just city meetings.

770
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:40,092
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about other things because the charter references all kinds of stuff that has to be shared with the public, not just meetings.

771
01:03:40,593 --> 01:03:41,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle, welcome.

772
01:03:42,254 --> 01:03:57,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, there's a motion on the table that wherever the charter directs that something has to be publicized to the public in a newspaper, we're going to add city website so that there would be required by the charter

773
01:03:58,495 --> 01:04:01,056
[SPEAKER_14]: to put it in a newspaper and on the city website.

774
01:04:03,437 --> 01:04:03,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Daveed?

775
01:04:03,797 --> 01:04:09,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I got any seconds, but are we just skipping my motion?

776
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:10,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

777
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:14,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you had... Okay.

778
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:15,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go.

779
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:19,762
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you had sort of let it go, but I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

780
01:04:20,743 --> 01:04:22,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

781
01:04:23,844 --> 01:04:24,604
[SPEAKER_14]: All good.

782
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:27,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Then can you just state what you want your motion to be?

783
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:39,029
[SPEAKER_06]: My motion was to replace the word newspaper with giving notice by publication in a reasonable and standard manner, which supports general circulation of the information.

784
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,092
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, and that language is in the chat.

785
01:04:44,133 --> 01:04:44,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

786
01:04:44,674 --> 01:04:44,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

787
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:45,374
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

788
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:46,335
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

789
01:04:46,555 --> 01:04:47,176
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

790
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:53,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Phyllis.

791
01:04:58,687 --> 01:04:59,347
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a second.

792
01:04:59,387 --> 01:05:02,409
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not voting on the motion that you presented.

793
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:03,849
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we're doing Daveed's first.

794
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:05,270
[SPEAKER_14]: We're doing Daveed's.

795
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:06,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second it.

796
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second it.

797
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

798
01:05:08,131 --> 01:05:08,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm saying no.

799
01:05:09,691 --> 01:05:10,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

800
01:05:11,452 --> 01:05:12,612
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're doing Daveed's first.

801
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:14,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Eunice?

802
01:05:15,213 --> 01:05:15,433
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

803
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:18,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Anthony Andreottola?

804
01:05:19,335 --> 01:05:19,575
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

805
01:05:21,075 --> 01:05:22,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Ron Giovino?

806
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:23,656
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

807
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:25,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Daveed?

808
01:05:27,997 --> 01:05:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

809
01:05:29,879 --> 01:05:30,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean.

810
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:31,340
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

811
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:37,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Danielle.

812
01:05:37,885 --> 01:05:40,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

813
01:05:40,067 --> 01:05:40,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I get you, Rory?

814
01:05:40,987 --> 01:05:42,629
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Vanessa, no.

815
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,271
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also a no.

816
01:05:45,531 --> 01:05:47,633
[SPEAKER_14]: So that doesn't pass.

817
01:05:48,093 --> 01:05:50,755
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we'll vote on my motion, which is to

818
01:05:53,178 --> 01:05:59,783
[SPEAKER_14]: where it to keep the word newspaper wherever the charter specifies it and add city website.

819
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:04,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And I seconded that already.

820
01:06:07,068 --> 01:06:09,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so Phyllis, go ahead.

821
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:10,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

822
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:12,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury.

823
01:06:12,992 --> 01:06:13,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

824
01:06:14,313 --> 01:06:14,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

825
01:06:15,814 --> 01:06:16,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

826
01:06:16,754 --> 01:06:17,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Daveed.

827
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:18,675
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

828
01:06:20,537 --> 01:06:20,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Gene.

829
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:22,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

830
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:24,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice.

831
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:25,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

832
01:06:29,302 --> 01:06:29,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle.

833
01:06:31,883 --> 01:06:32,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

834
01:06:34,404 --> 01:06:35,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Who did I miss?

835
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:36,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Me.

836
01:06:37,145 --> 01:06:37,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

837
01:06:38,366 --> 01:06:38,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

838
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:39,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Anthony.

839
01:06:39,926 --> 01:06:40,707
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm also a yes.

840
01:06:40,887 --> 01:06:41,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

841
01:06:41,647 --> 01:06:43,188
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's good.

842
01:06:43,228 --> 01:06:44,228
[SPEAKER_14]: We got that passed.

843
01:06:45,912 --> 01:06:53,634
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so before we start Article VI, I want to go back to the tie vote that we had so that we can retake that vote.

844
01:06:55,255 --> 01:06:56,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle, the pressure is on you.

845
01:06:57,135 --> 01:06:57,415
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

846
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:03,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle, we had a tie vote, so we would like to revisit it.

847
01:07:05,258 --> 01:07:08,679
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was under filling vacancies on the school committee.

848
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:11,480
[SPEAKER_14]: The current draft says that

849
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:28,980
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's nobody, if there's a vacancy and a candidate and the next candidate who didn't get elected and who meets at least 30% of the vote isn't available, then the school committee chooses the replacement.

850
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,320
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we currently have.

851
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:41,142
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Collins Center made a recommendation that the city council do it rather than the school committee because the city council

852
01:07:42,545 --> 01:07:57,913
[SPEAKER_14]: The school committee's job is narrow and focused on running the school department, and the city council represents the whole city and the workings of the city, so that they recommend that the city council do it and that that's common practice in other cities.

853
01:07:58,374 --> 01:07:59,574
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to let Anthony Wilson.

854
01:07:59,614 --> 01:07:59,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Melva.

855
01:08:00,395 --> 01:08:01,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.

856
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:05,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Marilyn was going to do what I, but to clarify, it's the school committee.

857
01:08:05,537 --> 01:08:09,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's the school committee and the city council meeting together.

858
01:08:09,379 --> 01:08:10,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Together, OK.

859
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:14,052
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that the city council is doing it.

860
01:08:14,092 --> 01:08:15,452
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee is there.

861
01:08:16,212 --> 01:08:16,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

862
01:08:17,112 --> 01:08:19,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Did everybody understand that the first time around?

863
01:08:22,594 --> 01:08:22,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

864
01:08:23,694 --> 01:08:24,994
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's retake that vote.

865
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:30,996
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically what we're going to vote on is that currently we have just the school committee doing it.

866
01:08:31,096 --> 01:08:33,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we have the school committee and the city council doing it together.

867
01:08:34,957 --> 01:08:36,537
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we would be voting on.

868
01:08:36,717 --> 01:08:37,698
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you vote yes,

869
01:08:40,865 --> 01:08:45,108
[SPEAKER_14]: you want, this isn't exactly how we did the vote last time, but we'll do it this way.

870
01:08:45,308 --> 01:08:46,469
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll simplify it this way.

871
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:55,075
[SPEAKER_14]: If you vote yes, you're saying yes, it should be the city council and the school committee together, and if you vote no, you're saying no, it should just be the school committee.

872
01:08:56,236 --> 01:08:56,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that make sense?

873
01:08:58,078 --> 01:08:58,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

874
01:08:59,078 --> 01:08:59,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

875
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:01,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just make a point there?

876
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:06,844
[SPEAKER_08]: The assumption that if I say no, I mean I just want the school committee is not necessarily correct.

877
01:09:07,325 --> 01:09:10,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's either yes, we're going to have the city council and the school committee,

878
01:09:11,392 --> 01:09:16,774
[SPEAKER_08]: and move it, or if it's a no, it's defeated and we must decide another amendment.

879
01:09:16,994 --> 01:09:21,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the correct procedural thing to do.

880
01:09:22,796 --> 01:09:27,037
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just voting up or down this one piece.

881
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let's see where the vote falls.

882
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:40,562
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a vote to have the city council and the school committee involved in replacing a

883
01:09:41,773 --> 01:09:43,074
[SPEAKER_14]: vacancy on the school committee.

884
01:09:47,215 --> 01:09:47,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron?

885
01:09:49,276 --> 01:09:49,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

886
01:09:50,816 --> 01:09:51,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Jean?

887
01:09:53,517 --> 01:09:53,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

888
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:55,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice?

889
01:09:56,678 --> 01:09:56,938
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

890
01:09:59,379 --> 01:09:59,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Phyllis?

891
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:00,860
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

892
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:03,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andreottola?

893
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:04,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

894
01:10:07,342 --> 01:10:07,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle?

895
01:10:08,883 --> 01:10:09,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

896
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury, did I get you?

897
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,981
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I'm a yes.

898
01:10:15,242 --> 01:10:15,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Daveed?

899
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:16,742
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

900
01:10:19,063 --> 01:10:19,783
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm a yes.

901
01:10:20,084 --> 01:10:22,024
[SPEAKER_14]: So that motion carries.

902
01:10:22,645 --> 01:10:22,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

903
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:26,986
[SPEAKER_14]: So the call-in center will change that language.

904
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:28,487
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

905
01:10:28,767 --> 01:10:29,708
[SPEAKER_14]: So now we're on Article 6.

906
01:10:30,548 --> 01:10:33,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Did anybody have any amendments that they wanted to propose to Article 6?

907
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:34,830
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

908
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:35,850
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

909
01:10:37,951 --> 01:10:39,872
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to section

910
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:43,331
[SPEAKER_10]: 6.2.

911
01:10:42,691 --> 01:10:43,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

912
01:10:43,351 --> 01:11:03,980
[SPEAKER_10]: The annual budget meeting currently reads on or before March 1st, the mayor shall call a joint meeting of the city council and school committee before the commencement of the budget process to review the financial condition of the city and share relevant information.

913
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:04,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

914
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I propose changing that to February 1st.

915
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:25,095
[SPEAKER_10]: is we had a range, I don't know if you remember, we had like 60 to 100 days and the Collins Center picked a specific date to be clear and more directive.

916
01:11:26,576 --> 01:11:38,064
[SPEAKER_10]: But the new budget ordinance that the city came up with has the city council submitting their budget priorities on March 1st.

917
01:11:39,642 --> 01:11:48,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it would be hard for the city council to submit their budget priorities to the mayor if they meet on March 1st.

918
01:11:49,725 --> 01:12:01,528
[SPEAKER_10]: So they would need, I'm basing this on the city ordinance, which I understand could change, but just give city council more time to develop their priorities.

919
01:12:02,648 --> 01:12:08,290
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a range, so they picked a specific date, the Collins Center did, and I'm just proposing making it February 1st.

920
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:34,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I like just the thing is with that though you have to think about if there's a new mayor who just gets sworn in and in January and then being faced with preparing that in such a short period of time that you know I don't I think there needs to be a little bit you

921
01:12:35,979 --> 01:12:40,003
[SPEAKER_07]: more time to do that.

922
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:58,458
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a significant piece of work for somebody just stepping into a role and to be prepared to present to the school committee and the city council and the whole city just within a few weeks of taking office.

923
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:02,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just my- Sure, that makes sense.

924
01:13:03,058 --> 01:13:19,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you both have good points, but Gene makes a good point about the budget ordinance that specifies March 1st as a date for the city council to, can you say again, the city council is submitting their budget recommendations to the mayor on March 1st?

925
01:13:20,111 --> 01:13:28,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're submitting their budget priorities to the mayor on March 1st.

926
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:31,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

927
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:36,500
[SPEAKER_10]: February 15th, I'm not wedded to February 1st.

928
01:13:39,943 --> 01:13:43,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to give some time for city council to develop.

929
01:13:43,605 --> 01:13:44,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

930
01:13:44,766 --> 01:13:47,528
[SPEAKER_14]: It says on or before March 1st now.

931
01:13:48,669 --> 01:13:55,374
[SPEAKER_10]: We could just leave it, but if the meeting happened on March 1st.

932
01:13:55,654 --> 01:14:01,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Anthony brings up a very good point though.

933
01:14:01,999 --> 01:14:05,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we have a new mayor, that's a very short window.

934
01:14:05,862 --> 01:14:06,763
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

935
01:14:06,803 --> 01:14:08,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see what other people.

936
01:14:08,164 --> 01:14:09,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice, did you have a comment about this?

937
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:10,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

938
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:15,911
[SPEAKER_11]: A comment about this, and I'm going to say the same thing when we get to Section 6-5 as well, possibly.

939
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:23,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Melville, was it you and Maury that met with the CFO and Chief of Staff Barian?

940
01:14:23,938 --> 01:14:23,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

941
01:14:26,767 --> 01:14:38,375
[SPEAKER_11]: How do these, I mean, the charter obviously will overrule anything else, but how do these things jive with what they've told you in terms of what's within the realm of possibility?

942
01:14:38,915 --> 01:14:44,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I can tell you they were concerned about being able to fulfill this.

943
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:49,221
[SPEAKER_14]: But that was one of the reasons that we generalized the language.

944
01:14:51,903 --> 01:14:53,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Because people still wanted to keep it.

945
01:14:54,187 --> 01:14:56,828
[SPEAKER_14]: committee members still wanted to keep it, but there was a concern.

946
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:00,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I think something to keep in mind.

947
01:15:00,188 --> 01:15:02,549
[SPEAKER_14]: David?

948
01:15:04,049 --> 01:15:20,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Given that the city's year ends the end of June, it's surprising to me that they wouldn't be ready at the beginning of February to discuss how the previous fiscal year's finances went.

949
01:15:23,373 --> 01:15:36,139
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I mean, I guess that doesn't really say anything about whether the CFO could be reasonably ready by February 1st, but I would say that kind of regardless of whether or not there's a new mayor, I imagine the city staff will work on this.

950
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:51,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And so while I see the argument that it could be a lot of work for a new mayor, I feel like this is probably more of a here's where our budget is for, you know, for the year that ended,

951
01:15:51,737 --> 01:15:55,799
[SPEAKER_06]: in June at the beginning of February.

952
01:15:55,899 --> 01:15:57,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's super reasonable.

953
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:58,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

954
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:08,526
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the budget that ended in June, it's the budget for the year, for the term.

955
01:16:09,686 --> 01:16:14,529
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a retro look at the previous year, it's a forecast.

956
01:16:15,049 --> 01:16:20,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, currently it just says to review the financial condition of the city and share relevant information.

957
01:16:22,002 --> 01:16:24,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I guess even more so it's not anything specific.

958
01:16:24,886 --> 01:16:28,131
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just requiring the mayor to show up and have a meeting.

959
01:16:29,573 --> 01:16:35,481
[SPEAKER_06]: They could say vibes are good and fulfill this requirement as long as they have the meeting.

960
01:16:38,028 --> 01:16:40,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think February 1st is much more reasonable.

961
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:50,619
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the things that people expressed on this committee and in the public was that they wanted more collaboration and they wanted more interaction between the branches of government.

962
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:53,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was one of the other reasons for this.

963
01:16:54,462 --> 01:16:56,744
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's actually they wanted more information.

964
01:16:57,384 --> 01:17:06,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, you'd be putting, say, a new mayor in a position to to not have gathered the information that

965
01:17:06,825 --> 01:17:08,746
[SPEAKER_07]: people want and need.

966
01:17:08,966 --> 01:17:17,070
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when we talk about transparency, you have to have the facts to be transparent with them.

967
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:28,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And if someone is not going to have the ability to gather all those facts in a short period of time, you would rather have someone, you know, be transparent and accurate.

968
01:17:28,572 --> 01:17:45,962
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of just kind of coming out and you know just just having a meeting and just saying yeah things sound good and then be faced with oh look there's no transparency i mean it's good to be transparent but it's also good to have you know

969
01:17:47,277 --> 01:17:51,199
[SPEAKER_07]: command of what's going on in the city.

970
01:17:51,219 --> 01:18:00,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And to put that on a new mayor, I don't think is... And financial people turn over too with administrations.

971
01:18:01,104 --> 01:18:07,148
[SPEAKER_07]: So you may have a transitional period that you're asking.

972
01:18:08,168 --> 01:18:12,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the charter will be asking a lot to only give a month.

973
01:18:12,911 --> 01:18:13,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

974
01:18:13,771 --> 01:18:14,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

975
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:22,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, first off, the new mayor thing would only happen once every four years if our charter gets approved.

976
01:18:22,718 --> 01:18:24,599
[SPEAKER_08]: So it kind of makes it less of an issue.

977
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:28,623
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, we're not defining what happens at this February 1st meeting.

978
01:18:28,743 --> 01:18:36,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the first meeting would be a discussion of what expectations will be on the March 1st meeting when every department comes in with their requests.

979
01:18:36,349 --> 01:18:39,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So to me, I think it's extremely valuable to get the process going,

980
01:18:40,412 --> 01:18:46,495
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no budget that's going to be expected to be in front of them, because March 1st is when they make all their requests.

981
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:55,500
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm strongly in favor of first business day after February 1st.

982
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

983
01:18:57,261 --> 01:19:01,704
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think, Jean, your original proposal, you said February 1st, right?

984
01:19:02,464 --> 01:19:02,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

985
01:19:03,325 --> 01:19:06,126
[SPEAKER_14]: On or before February 1st, changing March 1st to February 1st.

986
01:19:06,266 --> 01:19:06,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

987
01:19:07,507 --> 01:19:08,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ron.

988
01:19:08,347 --> 01:19:09,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury, did you want to speak?

989
01:19:13,171 --> 01:19:14,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury, maybe he stepped up.

990
01:19:14,836 --> 01:19:15,297
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

991
01:19:15,357 --> 01:19:16,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry.

992
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:16,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

993
01:19:18,618 --> 01:19:24,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about this after our meeting at City Hall.

994
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:31,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we were trying to do was to get the different parties together.

995
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:33,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what Anthony is saying.

996
01:19:33,842 --> 01:19:34,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron's 100% correct.

997
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,563
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a mayor every four years.

998
01:19:37,003 --> 01:19:40,264
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a condition of previous years.

999
01:19:40,744 --> 01:19:42,745
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to review the financial condition for

1000
01:19:46,845 --> 01:19:55,152
[SPEAKER_01]: the city in the present fiscal year looking to put together a budget that would be starting in July of the following year.

1001
01:19:55,572 --> 01:20:01,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought, you know, only given four or five months was not enough of a

1002
01:20:04,058 --> 01:20:09,320
[SPEAKER_01]: to make a decision on how the upcoming budget should go.

1003
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:12,401
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took this.

1004
01:20:12,701 --> 01:20:15,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, February or March, I agree.

1005
01:20:15,502 --> 01:20:31,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but it's imperative that they all get together and that the different bodies know how close they are to the existing, keeping the numbers the same to what the budget was for the fiscal year they're in.

1006
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

1007
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,201
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're gonna, oh, Eunice, you have one more point?

1008
01:20:36,722 --> 01:20:40,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just gonna say I propose that we split the baby and go for February 15th.

1009
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:43,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean, how do you feel about that?

1010
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:45,185
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fine with me.

1011
01:20:46,265 --> 01:20:47,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we'll vote on that.

1012
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:57,229
[SPEAKER_14]: But before we do, I just want to ask if the Collins Center has anything to add to this discussion about an annual budget meeting and

1013
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:08,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there were a lot of dates as I understand it in the budget ordinance, and that was a concern, was conflicting with the ordinance.

1014
01:21:09,374 --> 01:21:15,423
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm glad you brought that up, but I would like to know if Anthony Wilson or Marilyn have any thoughts about this.

1015
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:20,546
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we have any specific thoughts.

1016
01:21:20,586 --> 01:21:22,108
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I can't remember that.

1017
01:21:22,728 --> 01:21:30,094
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're aware of the budget ordinance, but I don't think we, off the top of my head, I don't have all the specifics, but we don't have any, I don't have anything to add.

1018
01:21:30,154 --> 01:21:41,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just add, tell you that one of the reasons we removed the range, I mean, added a specific date is I think over time, the way to work operationally is that the administration would pick basically the end of the range.

1019
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:45,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd end up with a date by default, just because people want as much time to do these things.

1020
01:21:45,247 --> 01:21:48,009
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one of the reasons for picking a date, sir.

1021
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:50,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1022
01:21:51,681 --> 01:22:02,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I guess I'm slightly concerned about February 15th because the people who would be doing this express concern about being able to get information together.

1023
01:22:06,344 --> 01:22:12,045
[SPEAKER_14]: But we also, I guess, conflicting with the budget ordinance.

1024
01:22:12,365 --> 01:22:18,326
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the charter would supersede the ordinance, although they're two different things.

1025
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:23,000
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they would both exist, right, Anthony?

1026
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1027
01:22:25,462 --> 01:22:36,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's more, it's not conflicting with the ordinance, it's just the meeting is occurring at the same time that the process is starting at city council.

1028
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:38,871
[SPEAKER_10]: So city council has no information.

1029
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:44,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to move it up so city council has- So that they have information for their march.

1030
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:44,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1031
01:22:47,089 --> 01:22:53,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just trying to give them at least a couple of weeks before they prepare their budget requests or their budget priorities.

1032
01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:59,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Because otherwise, the meeting is kind of not timed very well.

1033
01:23:00,038 --> 01:23:00,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1034
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:00,939
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1035
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:08,464
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, based on what we've heard and what I understand, I don't know how much information they're going to get in February anyway.

1036
01:23:08,644 --> 01:23:09,365
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah.

1037
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:16,427
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're doing this, people feel strongly about it.

1038
01:23:17,587 --> 01:23:23,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And so February 15th, we'll change it to February 15th.

1039
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:24,730
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the proposal on the table.

1040
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:25,890
[SPEAKER_14]: OK?

1041
01:23:27,471 --> 01:23:28,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll second it.

1042
01:23:28,311 --> 01:23:32,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So does everyone understand what they're voting on?

1043
01:23:33,053 --> 01:23:35,814
[SPEAKER_14]: A yes is we're changing from March 1st to February 15th.

1044
01:23:38,194 --> 01:23:38,494
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1045
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:40,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury?

1046
01:23:42,636 --> 01:23:42,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1047
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:44,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean.

1048
01:23:46,507 --> 01:23:46,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1049
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:48,007
[SPEAKER_14]: David.

1050
01:23:48,948 --> 01:23:49,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1051
01:23:50,728 --> 01:23:51,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle.

1052
01:23:53,349 --> 01:23:53,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1053
01:23:54,969 --> 01:23:55,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Phyllis.

1054
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:56,310
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1055
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:00,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron, did you vote?

1056
01:24:01,191 --> 01:24:01,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not.

1057
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1058
01:24:05,572 --> 01:24:06,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andriodala.

1059
01:24:07,573 --> 01:24:07,673
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1060
01:24:09,982 --> 01:24:10,823
[SPEAKER_14]: I missed one person.

1061
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:13,745
[SPEAKER_14]: I met with Eunice.

1062
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:14,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1063
01:24:15,046 --> 01:24:15,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1064
01:24:15,866 --> 01:24:16,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to vote no.

1065
01:24:16,947 --> 01:24:17,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So, all right.

1066
01:24:18,028 --> 01:24:18,809
[SPEAKER_14]: So that carries.

1067
01:24:19,049 --> 01:24:19,749
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll change that.

1068
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:21,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1069
01:24:21,591 --> 01:24:23,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody else have anything in an article six?

1070
01:24:26,474 --> 01:24:26,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1071
01:24:27,615 --> 01:24:37,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Just moving down to the capital improvement stuff, which I know pretty much

1072
01:24:38,518 --> 01:24:43,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the call-in center added all of that, which was nicely detailed.

1073
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:45,800
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, I'll ask the same question.

1074
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:56,822
[SPEAKER_11]: What we propose is what we propose, but how did Nina and Bob Dickinson feel about that?

1075
01:24:57,102 --> 01:24:59,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything that we should be considering there?

1076
01:25:00,863 --> 01:25:03,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury, do you want to speak to that?

1077
01:25:03,983 --> 01:25:04,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Want to repeat?

1078
01:25:09,766 --> 01:25:24,453
[SPEAKER_11]: The capital improvement piece, section 6-5, the Collins Center had added into that a good deal of detail based on past practices and so forth.

1079
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:33,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just wondering if there's anything there that we should be concerned about based on what

1080
01:25:34,798 --> 01:25:41,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief of staff and CFO said if there's any adjustments that we should make based on that.

1081
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:48,142
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you my true opinion is I kind of like this.

1082
01:25:48,242 --> 01:25:51,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should stay that every individual

1083
01:25:56,493 --> 01:26:01,637
[SPEAKER_01]: operating government is going to put their own two cents in what works for them.

1084
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:08,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily what works for the city or what's in the best interest of the city.

1085
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:09,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what's done here.

1086
01:26:09,984 --> 01:26:11,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it covers it.

1087
01:26:11,985 --> 01:26:24,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it works for the entire city and not just for like one regime that's in there is operating at that time.

1088
01:26:27,527 --> 01:26:28,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Maury.

1089
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:37,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, my recollection was that there was concern about doing it annually, but... Yeah, they had concerns about, you know, what works best for them, you know, and... I agree, right.

1090
01:26:37,851 --> 01:26:40,492
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, you know... It's going to have what works for them.

1091
01:26:40,732 --> 01:26:42,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, you know... Yeah.

1092
01:26:42,953 --> 01:26:50,196
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also was, you know, we're reporting as a communication secondhand and...

1093
01:26:51,421 --> 01:27:00,986
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel that since the Collins Center has strongly told us that this is standard practice and it's important, is that correct?

1094
01:27:02,406 --> 01:27:04,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I feel comfortable with it.

1095
01:27:05,368 --> 01:27:10,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm with you.

1096
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you want to make a proposal about that, Eunice?

1097
01:27:12,011 --> 01:27:13,351
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was just concerned.

1098
01:27:13,411 --> 01:27:18,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to make sure that we had listened to what they had to say.

1099
01:27:18,474 --> 01:27:19,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1100
01:27:19,314 --> 01:27:20,035
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like we did.

1101
01:27:21,776 --> 01:27:22,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1102
01:27:23,717 --> 01:27:24,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Elections, Article 7.

1103
01:27:25,577 --> 01:27:28,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody want to make any amendments there?

1104
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,641
[SPEAKER_11]: I had one question.

1105
01:27:35,761 --> 01:27:37,502
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was under this section.

1106
01:27:37,522 --> 01:27:38,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me find it here.

1107
01:27:39,903 --> 01:27:43,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Conditions making a preliminary unnecessary.

1108
01:27:43,284 --> 01:27:46,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I messed up my papers.

1109
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:54,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Section 72 probably.

1110
01:27:54,278 --> 01:27:56,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1111
01:27:58,059 --> 01:27:58,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1112
01:27:58,679 --> 01:27:59,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what I did here.

1113
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,860
[SPEAKER_11]: It talks about filing statements of candidates.

1114
01:28:05,701 --> 01:28:09,901
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to look through that a couple of times trying to figure out what's a statement of candidate.

1115
01:28:11,322 --> 01:28:12,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we define that anywhere?

1116
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:17,283
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't remember what section it is?

1117
01:28:17,363 --> 01:28:18,243
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just skimming.

1118
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:47,682
[SPEAKER_11]: 7.2 7-2d okay exactly the candidates statements have thus been filed shall be deemed to be to have been nominated to the office um i mean i i guess so anthony wilson tell us yeah so that that that's um um

1119
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:55,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of using a different word than the one that's in the language, but it's basically the paperwork that you're filing to say I want to be a candidate for office.

1120
01:28:57,096 --> 01:29:15,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to sum up that section saying, you know, if only two people, I'm sorry, if, you know, pick a seat or a board position, however many positions are going to be available for that election, the candidates have to file a statement saying that they want to be candidates and appear on the ballot.

1121
01:29:15,957 --> 01:29:18,258
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get that from state election law.

1122
01:29:18,299 --> 01:29:19,739
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of like standard language.

1123
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:30,506
[SPEAKER_00]: If only two people, I'm sorry, if only two times the available seats, if only individuals were two times the number of, I'll make this simple.

1124
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:40,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming that there's one seat available, and if only two people pull papers and then submit them for that to appear on the ballot for that seat, then it's saying there's no need to have a preliminary election.

1125
01:29:43,354 --> 01:29:52,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I was just I'd never seen the term statement of candidate before and I didn't know if it was like some big official thing that we should be defining.

1126
01:29:54,925 --> 01:29:55,726
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't sound like it.

1127
01:29:56,687 --> 01:29:57,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

1128
01:29:59,669 --> 01:30:00,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else in article 7?

1129
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:05,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, article 8.

1130
01:30:06,656 --> 01:30:07,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody have any?

1131
01:30:12,562 --> 01:30:13,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody okay?

1132
01:30:15,524 --> 01:30:17,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Article 8, anybody?

1133
01:30:21,367 --> 01:30:24,109
[SPEAKER_14]: I have one change to Article 8.

1134
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:38,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Section 8.5, because- Can you put that up, Melva, because that article was mega confusing.

1135
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:42,367
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an awful lot in that article.

1136
01:30:44,209 --> 01:30:48,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, my proposal is very simple.

1137
01:30:48,152 --> 01:30:48,993
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not complicated.

1138
01:30:49,013 --> 01:30:57,780
[SPEAKER_14]: 8-5, which is about recall.

1139
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:07,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me find where the party.

1140
01:31:14,115 --> 01:31:16,176
[SPEAKER_14]: A recall petition may be initiated.

1141
01:31:16,196 --> 01:31:25,780
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to find the language.

1142
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:26,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see.

1143
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,662
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking for... Oh, here it is.

1144
01:31:30,682 --> 01:31:31,502
[SPEAKER_14]: It's down here.

1145
01:31:32,859 --> 01:31:33,499
[SPEAKER_14]: And there it is.

1146
01:31:34,519 --> 01:31:43,182
[SPEAKER_14]: It happens to be highlighted right now, where it says, from which removal is sought in the grounds of recall, as stated in the affidavit.

1147
01:31:43,862 --> 01:31:54,684
[SPEAKER_14]: So since the recalls that we're proposing are not for cause, I'm suggesting that we remove grounds of recall.

1148
01:31:56,725 --> 01:32:00,226
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to say why you want this person recalled.

1149
01:32:02,307 --> 01:32:10,151
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that you that recall, you could just get the signatures to recall someone and you didn't have to say why.

1150
01:32:11,972 --> 01:32:13,093
[SPEAKER_09]: There has to be a reason.

1151
01:32:15,574 --> 01:32:19,936
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to state that you're unhappy with something that the person did or did not do.

1152
01:32:20,357 --> 01:32:20,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1153
01:32:21,517 --> 01:32:24,879
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what my understanding was about recalls.

1154
01:32:24,979 --> 01:32:26,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean, do you remember when we discussed this?

1155
01:32:29,272 --> 01:32:30,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, I do.

1156
01:32:30,472 --> 01:32:42,036
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember there was, I thought that you could have like a no fault recalls type of, in Massachusetts.

1157
01:32:42,136 --> 01:32:44,536
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you didn't have to have a reason by law here.

1158
01:32:46,197 --> 01:32:49,198
[SPEAKER_09]: No, recall is not defined in Massachusetts state law.

1159
01:32:49,258 --> 01:32:51,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only available locally in a charter.

1160
01:32:52,839 --> 01:32:57,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have to state the reason why you want this person recalled.

1161
01:32:58,368 --> 01:33:00,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you have to state the reason if there's no state law?

1162
01:33:03,932 --> 01:33:06,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, most charters require it, I guess I should say.

1163
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:07,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1164
01:33:07,755 --> 01:33:12,859
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not, so we can make that decision to have our charter say whatever we want it to say.

1165
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think you're, you're, you're challenging.

1166
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:24,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Once it, once it goes to court, the lawyer will, the judge will question it because he's used to seeing it.

1167
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:38,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what we talked about, Melva, was maybe some states you had to have, there were only particular reasons that you could recall someone.

1168
01:33:38,573 --> 01:33:39,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Does this sound familiar?

1169
01:33:40,074 --> 01:33:41,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Like improper conduct?

1170
01:33:43,135 --> 01:33:43,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1171
01:33:45,075 --> 01:33:47,476
[SPEAKER_10]: We weren't going to limit it in that way.

1172
01:33:48,116 --> 01:33:52,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what I remember is that we read some materials that indicated that

1173
01:33:55,146 --> 01:34:11,397
[SPEAKER_14]: in Massachusetts, and maybe what Marilyn is referring to is the fact that it's not in state law and it's just by charter, but that you could do recalls just with signatures for no particular cause, and said causes are not defined.

1174
01:34:11,977 --> 01:34:20,983
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think maybe what Marilyn is saying, and you can correct me, Marilyn, if I'm misunderstanding, is that it's going to come up at some point anyway.

1175
01:34:23,238 --> 01:34:25,379
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's best to include it.

1176
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:34,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just, there's a difference between only allowing recall for particular reasons, which we discussed.

1177
01:34:34,883 --> 01:34:35,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

1178
01:34:35,584 --> 01:34:36,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to do.

1179
01:34:36,684 --> 01:34:45,108
[SPEAKER_10]: But what Marilyn is saying is that there just needs to be a stated reason, but it doesn't have to be any distinction.

1180
01:34:45,488 --> 01:34:46,688
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it says now.

1181
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:47,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Daveed?

1182
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:54,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was just going to say that if you still want to remove it, I'm totally down to remove it.

1183
01:34:55,164 --> 01:35:04,590
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems like a pretty arbitrary requirement, especially because that seems to imply you could just say we want them recalled because they wear blue shirts.

1184
01:35:05,331 --> 01:35:05,991
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1185
01:35:06,031 --> 01:35:10,514
[SPEAKER_09]: And we could assign that recall petition, but that's legitimate.

1186
01:35:10,694 --> 01:35:15,798
[SPEAKER_14]: No, well, in light of this discussion, I'm withdrawing because I think, you know,

1187
01:35:17,077 --> 01:35:22,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand now the distinction and the reason that it's there.

1188
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:30,522
[SPEAKER_14]: If anybody else wants to bring it up, they can, but I'm good with it the way it is.

1189
01:35:35,084 --> 01:35:36,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody else has anything in Article 8?

1190
01:35:38,965 --> 01:35:41,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I had one more just from the Collins Center.

1191
01:35:42,227 --> 01:35:45,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just looking at the recommendation that they recommend in

1192
01:35:46,852 --> 01:35:53,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Section 8 to be that every member of the committee received a copy of the solicitors decision.

1193
01:35:53,113 --> 01:35:55,173
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um.

1194
01:35:59,094 --> 01:36:04,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just that's every member of the petitioners committee, which is the 1st, 10 signers.

1195
01:36:05,235 --> 01:36:10,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I am okay with that adding that.

1196
01:36:13,016 --> 01:36:14,077
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in there now, right?

1197
01:36:17,089 --> 01:36:17,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it?

1198
01:36:17,830 --> 01:36:22,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, are you looking at the recommendation sheet, not the active?

1199
01:36:22,793 --> 01:36:24,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, the recommendation sheet.

1200
01:36:24,915 --> 01:36:26,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was trying to figure out if it's in there.

1201
01:36:27,117 --> 01:36:27,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it?

1202
01:36:27,537 --> 01:36:28,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we put it in?

1203
01:36:28,318 --> 01:36:29,118
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not in there.

1204
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:29,579
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1205
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:32,301
[SPEAKER_10]: So the recommendation is that we add it.

1206
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:32,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1207
01:36:33,262 --> 01:36:33,602
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1208
01:36:36,844 --> 01:36:37,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll second that.

1209
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:46,132
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we're voting on is adding that every member of

1210
01:36:47,392 --> 01:36:53,436
[SPEAKER_14]: the committee received a copy of the solicitor's decision, and this is in reference to recalls, right?

1211
01:36:54,236 --> 01:36:55,057
[SPEAKER_09]: No, initiative.

1212
01:36:55,497 --> 01:36:56,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Initiative.

1213
01:36:56,418 --> 01:36:57,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, sorry.

1214
01:36:57,819 --> 01:37:10,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the decision by the solicitor, correct me if I'm wrong here, about whether the proposed initiative is lawful or not.

1215
01:37:11,127 --> 01:37:11,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it?

1216
01:37:11,508 --> 01:37:12,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1217
01:37:12,268 --> 01:37:13,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have that right, Marilyn?

1218
01:37:13,509 --> 01:37:13,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1219
01:37:13,969 --> 01:37:14,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1220
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:15,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1221
01:37:17,368 --> 01:37:18,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Anthony Wilson.

1222
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:23,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I guess, kind of a question for Marilyn.

1223
01:37:24,532 --> 01:37:32,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last sentence of that section, Marilyn, is a copy of the opinion of the solicitor shall be mailed to the members of the Petitioner's Committee.

1224
01:37:32,776 --> 01:37:34,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that encompass that suggestion?

1225
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:38,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it in the document now?

1226
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,561
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the copy I have.

1227
01:37:42,421 --> 01:37:46,243
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the last.

1228
01:37:46,363 --> 01:37:51,004
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not part of the changes that you sent that I'm looking at.

1229
01:37:51,525 --> 01:37:51,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1230
01:37:51,925 --> 01:37:53,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anybody else is.

1231
01:37:54,226 --> 01:37:54,526
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1232
01:37:54,566 --> 01:37:57,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we made it and then overlooked it.

1233
01:37:57,227 --> 01:37:58,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1234
01:37:58,907 --> 01:37:59,668
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it should be.

1235
01:38:00,968 --> 01:38:05,770
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm having trouble finding it right now, but let's just look at it on the screen and then we can.

1236
01:38:07,775 --> 01:38:09,396
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we believe that it is there.

1237
01:38:10,316 --> 01:38:12,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm looking at my local copy.

1238
01:38:12,156 --> 01:38:13,857
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not have it on what you have.

1239
01:38:13,877 --> 01:38:16,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm just putting it out there to double check.

1240
01:38:16,618 --> 01:38:19,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So, 8-2 paragraph B. I'm going there now.

1241
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:21,079
[SPEAKER_00]: The last sentence.

1242
01:38:21,099 --> 01:38:22,960
[SPEAKER_09]: 8-2D.

1243
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:24,520
[SPEAKER_09]: B. Yes.

1244
01:38:25,061 --> 01:38:25,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Says it right there.

1245
01:38:26,321 --> 01:38:26,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1246
01:38:26,641 --> 01:38:27,841
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it is there.

1247
01:38:27,941 --> 01:38:28,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1248
01:38:28,482 --> 01:38:29,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking at the comments.

1249
01:38:29,702 --> 01:38:31,162
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's there.

1250
01:38:31,222 --> 01:38:31,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1251
01:38:32,183 --> 01:38:32,643
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we're good.

1252
01:38:32,663 --> 01:38:32,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1253
01:38:32,823 --> 01:38:33,643
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1254
01:38:33,703 --> 01:38:34,263
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to draw.

1255
01:38:35,124 --> 01:38:35,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1256
01:38:35,624 --> 01:38:35,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1257
01:38:36,807 --> 01:38:37,928
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're good on that one.

1258
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:43,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we're good with article eight?

1259
01:38:45,995 --> 01:38:46,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Now nine.

1260
01:38:50,558 --> 01:38:51,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody have anything?

1261
01:38:51,639 --> 01:39:00,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we had a new section added to article nine about the financial statements.

1262
01:39:01,307 --> 01:39:02,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I sent it.

1263
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:28,801
[SPEAKER_11]: thoughts okay and i sent everybody what the collins center reiterated about their recommendation so um i had some other questions about article nine before we get to that though okay go ahead um looking at the draft that we put together and notes that we had there was um and i didn't see this in the final copy that we got um

1264
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:41,013
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked, as I had kind of read out earlier before rules and regulations, periodic review of ordinances, multi member bodies.

1265
01:39:41,654 --> 01:39:51,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Please use language that requires all information rules, regulations, recommendation reports, agendas, meeting notices, meeting recordings.

1266
01:39:51,897 --> 01:40:00,320
[SPEAKER_11]: to be shared with the public via all available means and require meetings to be accessible via all available means, i.e.

1267
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,181
[SPEAKER_11]: live broadcast and recordings.

1268
01:40:02,841 --> 01:40:17,146
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't, I don't think that I saw any of that included in the, um, three relevant sections, um, uh, the rules and regulations, the periodic review of ordinances in the multi-member bodies.

1269
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:19,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

1270
01:40:21,472 --> 01:40:23,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony, do you want to address that?

1271
01:40:26,155 --> 01:40:28,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just, I'm actually just re-reading, re-orienting myself.

1272
01:40:29,277 --> 01:40:37,843
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we, we did look at some suggestions, I don't, I'm just double-checking the memo, but what we wrote was to comply with... Wait a minute, are we in Article 9?

1273
01:40:37,883 --> 01:40:37,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1274
01:40:38,504 --> 01:40:44,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so there's quite a lot in Section 9-7 that says

1275
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:59,463
[SPEAKER_09]: that all documents shall be public record and certified copies shall be placed on file and posted on the city's website.

1276
01:40:59,483 --> 01:41:16,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And to the extent practical, all related submissions to any agenda item provided, however, that such, if such cannot reasonably posted, such as, you know, plans, development plans.

1277
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:22,913
[SPEAKER_09]: the meeting men shall state when and where such admissions shall be referenced and can be viewed.

1278
01:41:25,073 --> 01:41:26,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, perhaps I missed that.

1279
01:41:26,674 --> 01:41:27,535
[SPEAKER_11]: My apologies.

1280
01:41:30,016 --> 01:41:34,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it under the section on?

1281
01:41:34,118 --> 01:41:45,863
[SPEAKER_11]: 97 clause C. I'm just reading it, Marilyn.

1282
01:41:54,888 --> 01:42:05,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I think, you know, I don't know, maybe I was expecting, you know, sort of a standalone section or something like that.

1283
01:42:07,336 --> 01:42:14,400
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, so that applies to the multi member bodies, the periodic review of ordinances.

1284
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:15,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I think

1285
01:42:21,238 --> 01:42:22,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else following along?

1286
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:24,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I making any sense?

1287
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:31,423
[SPEAKER_14]: You're saying you wanted similar requirements to apply to other sections?

1288
01:42:32,383 --> 01:42:33,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1289
01:42:33,784 --> 01:42:47,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, in the interest of transparency is to ensure that all of this, within any meeting or discussion of anything that

1290
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:56,172
[SPEAKER_11]: any reports, agendas, but I guess it does fall under the multi-member body part best.

1291
01:43:00,133 --> 01:43:07,615
[SPEAKER_14]: The ordinance, it says that copies of any recommendation shall be made available to the public at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of the reproduction.

1292
01:43:08,335 --> 01:43:08,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1293
01:43:12,356 --> 01:43:12,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1294
01:43:13,637 --> 01:43:14,297
[SPEAKER_14]: My apologies.

1295
01:43:15,517 --> 01:43:17,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody have anything else in article 9?

1296
01:43:20,634 --> 01:43:25,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Did we have anything for the multi-member boards?

1297
01:43:25,136 --> 01:43:31,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm missing that too, but didn't we talk about residency?

1298
01:43:34,739 --> 01:43:39,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like we did talk about it and we voted on it and we didn't vote.

1299
01:43:39,901 --> 01:43:42,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought we voted because our

1300
01:43:45,938 --> 01:43:51,561
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, approved for article nine, um, all appointed monthly member bodies shall be residents of the city.

1301
01:43:52,061 --> 01:44:06,068
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the residency requirement established by the subsection may be, uh, maybe waived by the majority vote of the city council upon recommendation of the mayor.

1302
01:44:06,689 --> 01:44:11,691
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor's recommendation shall set out the reasons why said waiver is in the best interest of the city.

1303
01:44:12,532 --> 01:44:15,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, did that, did that get in there?

1304
01:44:16,697 --> 01:44:16,857
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1305
01:44:17,497 --> 01:44:22,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would have been in, what's that?

1306
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:24,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Multi-member bodies are addressed in another article.

1307
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:25,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that right?

1308
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I imagining things?

1309
01:44:29,982 --> 01:44:35,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it's in their appointment section, whether it's in where the mayor appoints them.

1310
01:44:36,344 --> 01:44:38,604
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm wondering.

1311
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we did talk about this though.

1312
01:44:43,386 --> 01:44:43,706
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

1313
01:44:58,869 --> 01:45:01,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not finding it right now.

1314
01:45:06,273 --> 01:45:11,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So that language, Eunice, can you read it again, please?

1315
01:45:13,035 --> 01:45:28,263
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, language for residency requirement for multi-member boards, all appointed multi-member board, multi-member body members shall be all appointed multi-member body members shall be residents of the city.

1316
01:45:28,523 --> 01:45:37,288
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the residency requirement established by this subsection may be waived by the majority vote of the city council

1317
01:45:38,293 --> 01:45:40,134
[SPEAKER_11]: upon recommendation of the mayor.

1318
01:45:41,314 --> 01:45:46,936
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor's recommendations shall set out the reasons why said waiver is in the best interest of the city.

1319
01:45:46,956 --> 01:45:49,757
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know we had a long discussion about this.

1320
01:45:52,218 --> 01:46:05,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna have to look back at the minutes and find the vote where we voted on that, but Anthony- Isn't that somewhere else because we talked about the police chief not living in the city and I thought we went through this all.

1321
01:46:06,269 --> 01:46:09,171
[SPEAKER_14]: What I want to ask is what section would that go under?

1322
01:46:09,231 --> 01:46:14,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that go under the appointment section or would it go under the article 9?

1323
01:46:15,175 --> 01:46:18,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it would go in the appointment section.

1324
01:46:18,237 --> 01:46:19,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would go under the appointment.

1325
01:46:20,659 --> 01:46:21,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1326
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,882
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need to just make sure that that gets in there.

1327
01:46:27,003 --> 01:46:28,223
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I'm going to look back and

1328
01:46:29,343 --> 01:46:35,285
[SPEAKER_14]: just refresh myself on what meeting we discussed that and when we voted.

1329
01:46:35,485 --> 01:46:36,486
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked for it.

1330
01:46:36,586 --> 01:46:37,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just looking through here.

1331
01:46:37,766 --> 01:46:40,847
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we asked for it to be included in section 9-7.

1332
01:46:41,067 --> 01:46:44,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, those are procedures.

1333
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:49,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are procedures of the multiple member body.

1334
01:46:49,671 --> 01:46:52,772
[SPEAKER_11]: So it wouldn't necessarily belong there?

1335
01:46:52,812 --> 01:46:54,412
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a condition of appointment.

1336
01:46:57,285 --> 01:47:07,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Residency appears to be a requirement that you want to see with the waiver exception.

1337
01:47:07,554 --> 01:47:09,416
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be in the appointment process.

1338
01:47:09,976 --> 01:47:12,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1339
01:47:12,378 --> 01:47:13,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to look.

1340
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:14,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, go ahead, Ron.

1341
01:47:15,521 --> 01:47:16,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick question.

1342
01:47:16,482 --> 01:47:19,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we actually approve Article 9 and we move it to this meeting?

1343
01:47:20,685 --> 01:47:23,488
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we didn't last meeting.

1344
01:47:24,798 --> 01:47:28,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it wasn't last meeting, but we finished it up.

1345
01:47:28,621 --> 01:47:31,183
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we got the draft charter with everything in it.

1346
01:47:31,823 --> 01:47:35,866
[SPEAKER_14]: But we did have something added to it, which was the financial statements.

1347
01:47:36,267 --> 01:47:39,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just don't remember a discussion on section 913, that's all.

1348
01:47:39,769 --> 01:47:46,374
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what we... Well, we may not... If nobody brought it up, we didn't discuss it.

1349
01:47:47,335 --> 01:47:47,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1350
01:47:48,616 --> 01:47:48,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Gene?

1351
01:47:50,648 --> 01:47:54,690
[SPEAKER_10]: We discussed the residency requirement on our June 6th meeting.

1352
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:59,472
[SPEAKER_10]: And it passed with eight yes votes, one abstain.

1353
01:48:01,953 --> 01:48:08,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so I will pull up that language and make sure it gets added to the appropriate section.

1354
01:48:12,715 --> 01:48:33,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I just believe I, you know, my summer memory is not like my winter memory, but I do, I do recall on section 913 talking briefly about the waiver that the mayor has for her own appointment and wondering if that should be looked at.

1355
01:48:33,808 --> 01:48:35,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't remember discussion on it.

1356
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:41,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we do say unless otherwise allowed by law or by this charter.

1357
01:48:42,487 --> 01:48:47,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mayor's on the school committee as a result of Article 4 of the charter.

1358
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:55,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So... Yeah, this is referring to having more than one city office or position of employment.

1359
01:48:55,793 --> 01:49:00,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and the first clause is unless otherwise allowed by law or this charter.

1360
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:03,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So your charter does allow it for the mayor.

1361
01:49:05,778 --> 01:49:07,479
[SPEAKER_08]: But what it's allowing is that a...

1362
01:49:09,421 --> 01:49:16,343
[SPEAKER_08]: appointed official or an employee of the city can have two jobs and that's decided on by the mayor.

1363
01:49:16,363 --> 01:49:19,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that, am I reading that correctly, 913?

1364
01:49:19,724 --> 01:49:31,027
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor has the authority to make an exception, but once again, the mayor would have to justify that.

1365
01:49:35,519 --> 01:49:37,380
[SPEAKER_14]: So you wanna question that.

1366
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:38,701
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you're saying.

1367
01:49:38,841 --> 01:49:41,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see the checks and balances in that scenario.

1368
01:49:41,783 --> 01:49:52,149
[SPEAKER_08]: If the mayor says he'll be in charge of fire and police because he's a good guy, that follows this direction.

1369
01:49:52,849 --> 01:50:05,077
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's some other, you know, the mayor submits a name to the city council for approval or whatever other rule there is, to me, it's like, why do we even have, why do we even need an exception if the mayor can

1370
01:50:06,043 --> 01:50:08,085
[SPEAKER_08]: do this any way they want.

1371
01:50:08,786 --> 01:50:09,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my point.

1372
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:17,394
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor appoints a department head who's the head of DPW already.

1373
01:50:18,415 --> 01:50:23,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And they say, well, I want them to be chief of police and the DPW.

1374
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:29,266
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's the waiver because it's convenient for us to have one person instead of two for the lunch menu.

1375
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:32,651
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we stop that from happening?

1376
01:50:32,872 --> 01:50:37,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't see the mechanism that is a checks and balances for it.

1377
01:50:37,254 --> 01:50:38,475
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what bothers me about it.

1378
01:50:39,636 --> 01:50:40,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Ron, I agree.

1379
01:50:40,516 --> 01:50:46,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be super reasonable to require that that waiver be approved by the city council.

1380
01:50:48,481 --> 01:50:56,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Marilyn and Anthony, can you just speak a little bit about sort of how this kind of thing works in practice?

1381
01:50:56,846 --> 01:51:00,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Is the city council involved generally or?

1382
01:51:02,571 --> 01:51:08,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say if we're talking about appointments to boards and committees, I assume we're not talking about appointments.

1383
01:51:08,915 --> 01:51:14,259
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a position of employment.

1384
01:51:14,519 --> 01:51:16,520
[SPEAKER_02]: City office, a position of employment.

1385
01:51:17,341 --> 01:51:17,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1386
01:51:17,741 --> 01:51:27,067
[SPEAKER_08]: So my example of a DPW guy filling the fire chief's job is potential that the mayor says, yes, and that happens.

1387
01:51:29,695 --> 01:51:32,537
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, well, I guess I would just make two points.

1388
01:51:32,577 --> 01:51:40,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd say to the extent that some communities have provisions about residency for those positions, they'd be in an ordinance, not necessarily the charter.

1389
01:51:41,541 --> 01:51:46,964
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that I've seen, it's the way the waiver is granted by the mayor.

1390
01:51:47,124 --> 01:51:51,827
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they, you know, it's filed with the city council or just filed with the clerk to be available for inspection.

1391
01:51:52,768 --> 01:51:53,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1392
01:51:53,128 --> 01:51:57,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it has to be a written explanation and a justification with the city clerk.

1393
01:51:58,070 --> 01:52:00,691
[SPEAKER_08]: but it doesn't say it needs approval.

1394
01:52:00,911 --> 01:52:07,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It just says, this is my neighbor and I feel like I can reach out to him when I need fire or DPW issues.

1395
01:52:08,334 --> 01:52:10,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there's your explanation, fine.

1396
01:52:11,015 --> 01:52:12,896
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying about checks and balances.

1397
01:52:12,936 --> 01:52:14,056
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what's bothering me about this.

1398
01:52:14,637 --> 01:52:17,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question then following along what Ron's saying.

1399
01:52:17,718 --> 01:52:27,382
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get down to section 917, conflict of interest, does a conflict of interest in any way affect this section here?

1400
01:52:28,126 --> 01:52:29,447
[SPEAKER_02]: or is that two separate things?

1401
01:52:29,507 --> 01:52:37,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So the conflict of interest says all city employees shall be considered municipal employees under this and shall comply with the state conflict of interest laws.

1402
01:52:38,491 --> 01:52:45,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So Anthony in Maryland, does that have anything to do with this section that we're talking about where the mayor can appoint anyone where they want to be?

1403
01:52:46,436 --> 01:52:54,020
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conflict of interest provisions that we drafted for you that was sent over this week or last week was

1404
01:52:55,518 --> 01:52:57,920
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about financial conflicts.

1405
01:52:58,341 --> 01:53:01,303
[SPEAKER_00]: This provision is about residency.

1406
01:53:03,806 --> 01:53:06,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's chapter 2688 of the general law.

1407
01:53:06,789 --> 01:53:08,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's residency and financial.

1408
01:53:09,551 --> 01:53:13,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Anthony, it's not really about residency 913.

1409
01:53:14,716 --> 01:53:16,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about an appointment of the mayor.

1410
01:53:17,395 --> 01:53:23,280
[SPEAKER_08]: and the ability for the mayor to say, well, even though he's the DPW guy, I'm gonna make him the chief of police.

1411
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:26,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1412
01:53:26,443 --> 01:53:30,066
[SPEAKER_00]: This provision is talking about, 913 is talking about holding more than one office.

1413
01:53:30,766 --> 01:53:31,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1414
01:53:31,687 --> 01:53:31,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1415
01:53:32,107 --> 01:53:42,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And what this says is whether you should have a stronger provision other than just filing a justification with the city clerk.

1416
01:53:45,558 --> 01:53:49,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, but I'm going back to the question about the conflict of interest provision that you guys asked.

1417
01:53:49,759 --> 01:53:50,359
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

1418
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,460
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different.

1419
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,720
[SPEAKER_00]: That's talking about external.

1420
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:54,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about that.

1421
01:53:55,101 --> 01:53:57,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the question I got.

1422
01:53:57,921 --> 01:53:59,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I did ask about that.

1423
01:53:59,422 --> 01:54:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I did ask about that.

1424
01:54:00,422 --> 01:54:09,864
[SPEAKER_14]: You asked about section 917, which I think to me, what I read is that it just says that the municipal employees have to comply with the state conflict of interest laws.

1425
01:54:10,324 --> 01:54:10,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1426
01:54:10,564 --> 01:54:12,465
[SPEAKER_02]: But I needed to clarify that for me.

1427
01:54:13,588 --> 01:54:17,191
[SPEAKER_02]: if that had any impact on 913 we were talking about.

1428
01:54:17,572 --> 01:54:20,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Ron on what he's saying here.

1429
01:54:20,494 --> 01:54:28,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we just get to willy nilly, pick anyone and say, oh, you're my neighbor, you can have this other job.

1430
01:54:29,402 --> 01:54:37,889
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Ron, are you looking to propose that we just delete the waiver or that it be maybe have,

1431
01:54:40,142 --> 01:54:41,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it has to be submitted.

1432
01:54:41,684 --> 01:54:51,792
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the two ways with the one you just said, but the way I'd like to see it is the mayor can seek approval through the city council for an exception.

1433
01:54:52,352 --> 01:54:56,075
[SPEAKER_14]: That to me is checks and balances.

1434
01:54:56,115 --> 01:55:07,204
[SPEAKER_14]: You wanted to say that this section may be waived by the mayor with approval of the city council?

1435
01:55:07,565 --> 01:55:11,247
[SPEAKER_08]: This exception can be submitted to the city council for approval.

1436
01:55:11,967 --> 01:55:14,788
[SPEAKER_08]: That way, it's only the mayor that can submit the name.

1437
01:55:14,808 --> 01:55:17,709
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like the Supreme Court scenario.

1438
01:55:17,749 --> 01:55:17,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1439
01:55:18,389 --> 01:55:29,634
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanted to hear from Marilyn and Anthony whether, you know, I'm just only interested in standard practice and whether that's typical or whether there's a reason not to do that.

1440
01:55:29,654 --> 01:55:31,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Without checks and balances is why you didn't have it.

1441
01:55:32,015 --> 01:55:32,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1442
01:55:35,283 --> 01:55:39,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it's typical, but I don't.

1443
01:55:39,164 --> 01:55:42,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the 913 is standard language.

1444
01:55:43,204 --> 01:55:44,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1445
01:55:45,925 --> 01:55:48,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't see where you can stop it from being done.

1446
01:55:49,365 --> 01:56:00,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the committee wants to vote to require city council approval, then it can be changed.

1447
01:56:00,807 --> 01:56:04,328
[SPEAKER_09]: But what is before you is what appears in those charters.

1448
01:56:05,017 --> 01:56:13,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so I guess my thing is I always think if something is standard language, maybe sometimes there's no reason, but maybe sometimes there is a reason.

1449
01:56:13,101 --> 01:56:17,323
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was just trying to sort of discern whether there's a reason to keep this way.

1450
01:56:18,944 --> 01:56:20,705
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just thinking about it.

1451
01:56:20,765 --> 01:56:33,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, maybe there's a scenario where it makes sense to fill this position of employment, fill with two positions with the same person and

1452
01:56:35,588 --> 01:56:48,615
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, whether the the situations that I'm aware of, where this has been used is saying, you know, somebody has a part time position.

1453
01:56:49,056 --> 01:56:53,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's there's another position that's only, you know, 10 or 12 hours a week.

1454
01:56:54,359 --> 01:56:55,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you give that.

1455
01:56:55,940 --> 01:57:01,803
[SPEAKER_09]: So the person is working, like, let's say 18 hours, and you give them another 10 hours.

1456
01:57:03,204 --> 01:57:05,085
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only way I've seen this used.

1457
01:57:05,730 --> 01:57:06,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, never seen.

1458
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:10,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen department heads, you know, combined.

1459
01:57:11,271 --> 01:57:16,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, because, you know, there would be political consequences for the mayor.

1460
01:57:17,573 --> 01:57:24,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, if that was done, and they would have to think through, you know, how that would be received in the community.

1461
01:57:25,435 --> 01:57:30,876
[SPEAKER_09]: But like I said, the only ones I know of have been these combination of part time position.

1462
01:57:31,997 --> 01:57:33,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you, Jean.

1463
01:57:36,172 --> 01:57:47,836
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just wondering about your proposal, Ron, and how that squares with, we decided not to have the city council be able to reject department heads.

1464
01:57:49,237 --> 01:57:55,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, like the, so it started giving them that power here, but not giving them a power.

1465
01:57:55,719 --> 01:58:03,022
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a policing scenario that if it, it technically the way the charter is written now, if I'm,

1466
01:58:03,588 --> 01:58:09,972
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm a mayor for four years, and my plan is to go teach at college in the fifth year, I don't really care what happens.

1467
01:58:10,072 --> 01:58:16,336
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me give you three jobs at $75,000 each, and I don't have to justify it to anybody.

1468
01:58:16,696 --> 01:58:20,619
[SPEAKER_08]: If the voters don't vote for me or they recall me for abuse, that's a different thing.

1469
01:58:20,999 --> 01:58:25,382
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, it just makes sense that those scenarios that Marilyn talks about make sense.

1470
01:58:25,722 --> 01:58:40,449
[SPEAKER_08]: a part time player getting becoming a full time in two different departments, an emergency scenario that we need to fill a position, but not lose a position and those things seem like they're justifiable I just want the ability to say.

1471
01:58:42,024 --> 01:58:43,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't anticipate battles.

1472
01:58:43,947 --> 01:58:48,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I anticipate, okay, we agree with you, just out of transparency.

1473
01:58:48,192 --> 01:58:55,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, we may have appointments being made, sent to the clerk's office without any public form or information at all.

1474
01:58:56,258 --> 01:58:57,299
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm saying.

1475
01:58:57,699 --> 01:59:07,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I think transparency, checks and balances is the reason why I think it's important that mayor submit a name for approval to the council.

1476
01:59:07,246 --> 01:59:14,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And the council is then responsible for making sure that the voters are happy too by the way they handle that request.

1477
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:15,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody's accountable.

1478
01:59:16,172 --> 01:59:22,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want not one person who has the desire to be the approver of the desire as well.

1479
01:59:23,185 --> 01:59:29,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Would we use the same language we use for like multi-member boards or the city council has certain amount of time to object?

1480
01:59:30,391 --> 01:59:33,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they don't object, then it's approved?

1481
01:59:33,873 --> 01:59:36,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's a fair thing to do.

1482
01:59:36,876 --> 01:59:40,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I haven't really thought out the whole process, but yes, that's fair.

1483
01:59:41,159 --> 01:59:42,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly that's fair.

1484
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:43,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1485
01:59:43,961 --> 01:59:52,348
[SPEAKER_14]: So we start by, you want to propose that we add city council approval to the mayor's-

1486
01:59:53,448 --> 02:00:01,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to clearly state that it's the mayor's submission to be subject to city council approval, simple majority.

1487
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:09,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, okay, um, would you be willing just to.

1488
02:00:09,653 --> 02:00:15,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it the same, just so the language is kind of the same that the mayor has to submit it to the city council.

1489
02:00:16,057 --> 02:00:18,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they don't, what do you call it?

1490
02:00:18,419 --> 02:00:24,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, uh, say, no, it goes into effect in 30 days or whatever, whatever we did for the.

1491
02:00:27,474 --> 02:00:28,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Number thing.

1492
02:00:28,735 --> 02:00:34,540
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is that check and balance, but we're not like doing it different than what do you know what I mean?

1493
02:00:34,701 --> 02:00:35,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of keep it.

1494
02:00:35,381 --> 02:00:35,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1495
02:00:35,541 --> 02:00:36,342
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I agree.

1496
02:00:36,442 --> 02:00:42,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Once it's submitted to the city council, they should have a timeframe, whatever that timeframe is in our other.

1497
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:58,419
[SPEAKER_08]: other writing i'm okay with that they need to respond quickly because obviously it's a crisis situation that we're trying to resolve but yeah i agree with that i agree with that but only that the city council touches it to me is very important so i

1498
02:00:59,357 --> 02:01:06,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I feel like if we vote yes on this, I think the Common Center will craft language that would cover those bases.

1499
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:10,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony, is that okay?

1500
02:01:10,461 --> 02:01:24,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we're voting on adding city council approval to the mayor's waiver on no person being able to hold more than one city office or position.

1501
02:01:26,367 --> 02:01:28,708
[SPEAKER_14]: And the city council approval would be a simple majority.

1502
02:01:30,048 --> 02:01:31,288
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is the time frame?

1503
02:01:32,089 --> 02:01:32,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry?

1504
02:01:33,109 --> 02:01:34,249
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be the time frame?

1505
02:01:34,269 --> 02:01:36,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's an important consideration for me.

1506
02:01:37,010 --> 02:01:37,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1507
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:40,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever Jean would know, what was the time frame we gave?

1508
02:01:40,951 --> 02:01:41,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it two weeks?

1509
02:01:42,552 --> 02:01:43,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Or a month?

1510
02:01:43,612 --> 02:01:46,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 30 days.

1511
02:01:46,713 --> 02:01:48,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 30 days we put in there.

1512
02:01:48,774 --> 02:01:49,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1513
02:01:49,274 --> 02:01:51,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's be consistent.

1514
02:01:52,355 --> 02:01:52,995
[SPEAKER_08]: You think it's less?

1515
02:01:53,015 --> 02:01:53,275
[SPEAKER_14]: 30 days.

1516
02:01:54,336 --> 02:01:55,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Within 30 days.

1517
02:01:55,876 --> 02:01:56,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1518
02:01:56,216 --> 02:01:58,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they could just not act.

1519
02:01:59,305 --> 02:02:00,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1520
02:02:00,666 --> 02:02:01,747
[SPEAKER_07]: They can just not act.

1521
02:02:02,507 --> 02:02:04,128
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have to vote.

1522
02:02:04,228 --> 02:02:06,109
[SPEAKER_07]: If they want to vote, they can't.

1523
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:08,370
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't do it by 30 days, it's approved.

1524
02:02:09,651 --> 02:02:10,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1525
02:02:10,872 --> 02:02:13,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Non-action is approved.

1526
02:02:13,193 --> 02:02:13,834
[SPEAKER_14]: We got it.

1527
02:02:13,874 --> 02:02:19,597
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to say with the same process that they would approve a multi-member board person.

1528
02:02:19,617 --> 02:02:21,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you're saying?

1529
02:02:22,218 --> 02:02:22,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1530
02:02:22,999 --> 02:02:23,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1531
02:02:24,179 --> 02:02:24,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

1532
02:02:28,065 --> 02:02:29,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say yes.

1533
02:02:31,146 --> 02:02:32,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andreottola.

1534
02:02:33,047 --> 02:02:33,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1535
02:02:34,727 --> 02:02:35,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Danielle.

1536
02:02:42,510 --> 02:02:43,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes, okay.

1537
02:02:43,810 --> 02:02:44,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Dean.

1538
02:02:47,011 --> 02:02:47,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1539
02:02:48,052 --> 02:02:48,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Phyllis.

1540
02:02:52,508 --> 02:02:55,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to abstain because I think 30 days is too long.

1541
02:02:55,269 --> 02:02:57,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go along with it if it was a shorter period of time.

1542
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:58,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll abstain.

1543
02:03:00,251 --> 02:03:02,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Phil, it's just a little point of information.

1544
02:03:02,432 --> 02:03:08,354
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we did 30 days is the way the current council set up the only meet every other week.

1545
02:03:08,955 --> 02:03:16,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand, but- They do have committee- And honestly, Maury, I agree, but- No, no, I'm just saying- Okay.

1546
02:03:16,678 --> 02:03:17,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

1547
02:03:17,058 --> 02:03:17,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1548
02:03:21,741 --> 02:03:22,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury.

1549
02:03:22,621 --> 02:03:22,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1550
02:03:24,722 --> 02:03:25,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Daveed.

1551
02:03:27,903 --> 02:03:28,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1552
02:03:31,443 --> 02:03:32,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Who did I miss?

1553
02:03:32,784 --> 02:03:34,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Yourself.

1554
02:03:34,624 --> 02:03:35,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm voting no.

1555
02:03:36,445 --> 02:03:37,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Who did I miss?

1556
02:03:37,485 --> 02:03:38,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I get everybody?

1557
02:03:38,925 --> 02:03:40,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I missed one person.

1558
02:03:41,326 --> 02:03:41,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1559
02:03:42,626 --> 02:03:43,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Paulette has joined us.

1560
02:03:43,866 --> 02:03:44,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Paulette.

1561
02:03:44,867 --> 02:03:45,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Paulette.

1562
02:03:46,067 --> 02:03:46,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Paulette.

1563
02:03:50,221 --> 02:03:50,882
[SPEAKER_14]: She's on mute.

1564
02:03:51,442 --> 02:03:51,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1565
02:03:53,444 --> 02:03:53,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1566
02:03:53,844 --> 02:03:55,045
[SPEAKER_14]: So that motion passes.

1567
02:03:55,446 --> 02:03:56,507
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will add that.

1568
02:03:57,768 --> 02:04:01,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else for Article 9?

1569
02:04:02,872 --> 02:04:07,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a question and a thing that I think we need to change.

1570
02:04:08,477 --> 02:04:08,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1571
02:04:10,369 --> 02:04:15,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Under section 9, 8, loss of office, excessive absences.

1572
02:04:17,634 --> 02:04:20,295
[SPEAKER_11]: It talks about multi-member bodies.

1573
02:04:22,237 --> 02:04:25,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Does this apply to elected officials as well or no?

1574
02:04:26,259 --> 02:04:26,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember.

1575
02:04:26,939 --> 02:04:30,161
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't say it does.

1576
02:04:30,882 --> 02:04:31,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Should it?

1577
02:04:31,242 --> 02:04:31,282
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1578
02:04:34,544 --> 02:04:36,485
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it.

1579
02:04:36,866 --> 02:04:37,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Who said no?

1580
02:04:37,846 --> 02:04:38,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Marilyn?

1581
02:04:39,027 --> 02:04:39,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1582
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:42,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I don't think it can.

1583
02:04:42,402 --> 02:04:45,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's why we have recall.

1584
02:04:46,546 --> 02:04:46,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1585
02:04:46,867 --> 02:04:47,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Good point.

1586
02:04:47,467 --> 02:04:48,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my other.

1587
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:53,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Point was in section 911.

1588
02:04:53,173 --> 02:04:58,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Oaths and affirmations for the office of mayor city council school committee and city clerk.

1589
02:04:59,699 --> 02:05:14,090
[SPEAKER_11]: And it says mayor elect, the city council members elect, the school committee members elect, and city clerk elect shall on the first Monday in January of each even number year meet and take the oath of affirmation, et cetera, et cetera.

1590
02:05:15,391 --> 02:05:16,572
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't elect a city clerk.

1591
02:05:17,393 --> 02:05:17,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1592
02:05:18,494 --> 02:05:19,154
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll take that out.

1593
02:05:19,835 --> 02:05:20,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1594
02:05:21,296 --> 02:05:21,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1595
02:05:22,297 --> 02:05:23,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that, Eunice.

1596
02:05:23,818 --> 02:05:24,919
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all I got.

1597
02:05:25,519 --> 02:05:26,880
[SPEAKER_14]: The leading city clerk from 9-11.

1598
02:05:29,348 --> 02:05:29,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1599
02:05:31,789 --> 02:05:33,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody else have anything else for Article 9?

1600
02:05:37,893 --> 02:05:38,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1601
02:05:39,214 --> 02:05:40,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Paulette, welcome.

1602
02:05:40,875 --> 02:05:41,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for joining us.

1603
02:05:44,764 --> 02:05:48,605
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you remember this, but when you first called this meeting, I said I couldn't come.

1604
02:05:50,005 --> 02:05:55,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that you elongated it, but I do have to ask you, did you do the school committee piece already?

1605
02:05:55,747 --> 02:05:56,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1606
02:05:56,347 --> 02:05:57,487
[SPEAKER_14]: We've just finished up basically.

1607
02:05:57,507 --> 02:06:01,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we'll go back and ask you if you have any amendments to any section.

1608
02:06:07,890 --> 02:06:21,180
[SPEAKER_14]: But before we do that, I just want to check in and make sure everybody saw the language that was added about the financial statements and that the message that I sent you from the call center and see if anybody had any comments or.

1609
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:26,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one comment on the financial statements thing.

1610
02:06:26,583 --> 02:06:26,924
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1611
02:06:28,885 --> 02:06:30,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the so this is F4.

1612
02:06:30,946 --> 02:06:35,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like family members is maybe too vague.

1613
02:06:37,125 --> 02:06:55,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and should either be, you know, defined in some way, or we should specifically say, you know, like family members up to, uh, you know, let, let, uh, decided by, uh, the city council or what, you know, by what's the word I'm looking for now.

1614
02:06:56,050 --> 02:07:04,012
[SPEAKER_11]: We do define family, family members is defined, um, under section C. That's yeah.

1615
02:07:05,092 --> 02:07:05,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, then my bad.

1616
02:07:06,562 --> 02:07:08,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we read the same thing.

1617
02:07:08,185 --> 02:07:13,033
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I, I just missed it the 1st time through apologies.

1618
02:07:13,614 --> 02:07:17,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, everybody else good with that section.

1619
02:07:19,859 --> 02:07:24,203
[SPEAKER_11]: I had just under the statement of financial disclosure part.

1620
02:07:26,245 --> 02:07:28,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Just 2 thoughts.

1621
02:07:30,888 --> 02:07:35,052
[SPEAKER_11]: The statement of financial disclosure form shall include the following and then it lists 5.

1622
02:07:37,719 --> 02:07:52,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Areas that it should include, um, my suggestion would be, um, should include, um, but are not limited to, um, so that the commission could include other things.

1623
02:07:53,130 --> 02:07:57,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, should they wish to, and I was just wondering how.

1624
02:07:57,753 --> 02:08:02,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, the 5 things that are listed there.

1625
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:20,153
[SPEAKER_11]: How that compares to I know when we had this discussion and I had spoken at length to George King from Framingham, they're using, as I stated before.

1626
02:08:21,094 --> 02:08:30,843
[SPEAKER_11]: the state form, which is a zillion pages long, and as we all decided, quite intrusive, he suggested a more targeted form.

1627
02:08:31,183 --> 02:08:41,792
[SPEAKER_11]: We looked at the Cambridge form, and I was wondering if any of these five line items had been modeled after the Cambridge,

1628
02:08:43,494 --> 02:08:51,042
[SPEAKER_11]: A statement of financial interest, because it also seemed that there were other things on the Cambridge form that.

1629
02:08:52,324 --> 02:08:54,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't necessarily fall under.

1630
02:08:56,648 --> 02:08:58,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me these particular 5.

1631
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:00,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Line items.

1632
02:09:03,742 --> 02:09:05,284
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the short answer is yes.

1633
02:09:05,564 --> 02:09:12,432
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a number of forms like this across really not just the Massachusetts, but across the state, I mean across the country.

1634
02:09:12,472 --> 02:09:14,534
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was sort of the most common ones.

1635
02:09:15,195 --> 02:09:15,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that.

1636
02:09:16,918 --> 02:09:31,690
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, it's the, I mean, we have our, we sent this language and then we sent the sort of, I guess, cautionary message in addition, but number five really is meant to encompass other things.

1637
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:34,472
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that it's the city council that determines.

1638
02:09:36,535 --> 02:09:44,225
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense, how intrusive the form that the committee ultimately creates will be versus the committee doing that sort of on its own.

1639
02:09:45,347 --> 02:09:46,468
[SPEAKER_00]: But sort of that's how it's drafted.

1640
02:09:46,509 --> 02:09:49,352
[SPEAKER_00]: But the short answer is yes, it's drafted on Cambridge and then

1641
02:09:51,039 --> 02:10:06,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether other things are included beyond these, there's the four sort of defined categories, but then the fifth is the option that gives the city council the power to determine in the future other areas that it may wish to have included in these disclosures.

1642
02:10:06,753 --> 02:10:08,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay, that is covered.

1643
02:10:09,194 --> 02:10:19,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know, you know, it talks about, you know, who this applies to, the electeds, we chose not to include candidates.

1644
02:10:20,419 --> 02:10:28,643
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to be elected only the superintendent, the CFO, chief procurement, public works, any other municipal officers.

1645
02:10:29,564 --> 02:10:35,907
[SPEAKER_11]: So that, that means any other, I suppose, I would like to see,

1646
02:10:37,209 --> 02:10:39,170
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe not all boards and commissions in there.

1647
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:56,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's necessary, but certainly, you know, zoning and community development are pretty big ones, um, you know, and are pretty impactful in terms of their charge that the, what they're charged with insofar as their task.

1648
02:10:57,200 --> 02:11:06,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but I guess the other municipal offices, they could then include those boards if they so desired at a later date.

1649
02:11:06,245 --> 02:11:06,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1650
02:11:09,128 --> 02:11:20,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct the language is by ordinance, so it would be again that by ordinance basically means through the city council to determine who else should be included in section E. Okay.

1651
02:11:21,437 --> 02:11:21,818
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1652
02:11:22,658 --> 02:11:23,599
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I got there.

1653
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:24,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1654
02:11:26,941 --> 02:11:38,090
[SPEAKER_07]: You said the caution, can you, with the caution, talk a bit about what you're cautioning us about?

1655
02:11:39,466 --> 02:11:46,263
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Framingham being the outlier, most places do not have

1656
02:11:49,032 --> 02:11:50,333
[SPEAKER_00]: this type of language in the charter.

1657
02:11:50,353 --> 02:11:54,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not say it's not, it's not something people should do, but it's not in the church, usually by ordinance.

1658
02:11:56,576 --> 02:12:01,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I don't know if I put this in my email, but again, it allows flexibility.

1659
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:06,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that some discussion was on, you know, there's the work that comes into creating these forms.

1660
02:12:06,662 --> 02:12:13,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, this is very sort of generic, you know, here we're creating committee, the committee's gonna create a form and it's gonna cover these areas.

1661
02:12:14,306 --> 02:12:42,475
[SPEAKER_00]: but again usually this type of thing that would be done through ordinance and not included in a charter which is much more high level and we again we recommend not having certain organs of city government specifically articulated in the charter sort of generally thank you but and and we haven't gotten any feedback from our elected officials if this is something that

1662
02:12:43,187 --> 02:12:47,329
[SPEAKER_07]: they want to take on halfway as a group?

1663
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:51,691
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not officially.

1664
02:12:53,892 --> 02:12:56,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury talked to some former elected officials.

1665
02:12:58,154 --> 02:12:59,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct, Maury?

1666
02:13:01,395 --> 02:13:03,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and they were, did something against it.

1667
02:13:10,226 --> 02:13:16,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just felt as though it would discourage other people and so forth like that on this disclosure and so forth.

1668
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:23,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of what I found in my research elsewhere was that it didn't seem to discourage others.

1669
02:13:25,326 --> 02:13:27,688
[SPEAKER_01]: from running over this and gone over this.

1670
02:13:27,748 --> 02:13:29,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this all coming up tonight?

1671
02:13:29,249 --> 02:13:33,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We had subcommittee meetings, we had radio meetings.

1672
02:13:33,093 --> 02:13:35,635
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just coming up because we just got the language.

1673
02:13:36,676 --> 02:13:44,882
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't met since, so we wanted to make sure everybody was okay with the language and with the language came this note that I shared.

1674
02:13:44,963 --> 02:13:50,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to check in and see if people had any thoughts or comments about that.

1675
02:13:50,908 --> 02:13:51,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.

1676
02:13:53,036 --> 02:13:54,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we're good.

1677
02:13:56,077 --> 02:14:00,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so now Paulette, is there something you wanted to revisit?

1678
02:14:00,998 --> 02:14:04,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, so you probably already discussed section 4-2.

1679
02:14:04,700 --> 02:14:15,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, but don't we have to vote on that language for finance?

1680
02:14:16,643 --> 02:14:17,063
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't.

1681
02:14:19,604 --> 02:14:20,945
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we have to vote on it unless

1682
02:14:23,928 --> 02:14:25,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we didn't include it.

1683
02:14:26,595 --> 02:14:30,565
[SPEAKER_14]: We voted to include it and the call and center created wrote it.

1684
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:37,123
[SPEAKER_14]: We voted to include it, and then the Collins Center created the language.

1685
02:14:37,363 --> 02:14:50,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Just as the whole charter has partially been created by us and partially by the Collins Center, so the process tonight is to go through all that language and see if anybody has any proposals for changes.

1686
02:14:50,972 --> 02:14:55,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So- I propose we change the language to zero.

1687
02:14:56,036 --> 02:15:00,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so you're proposing removing the- The language

1688
02:15:01,694 --> 02:15:03,475
[SPEAKER_14]: for the financial reporting.

1689
02:15:04,416 --> 02:15:07,018
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to remove that whole thing from the charter.

1690
02:15:07,778 --> 02:15:08,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1691
02:15:08,939 --> 02:15:09,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1692
02:15:09,339 --> 02:15:11,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have the section number in front of me.

1693
02:15:11,261 --> 02:15:11,821
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1694
02:15:12,502 --> 02:15:12,902
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it?

1695
02:15:14,763 --> 02:15:16,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Off the top of their head.

1696
02:15:16,304 --> 02:15:17,045
[SPEAKER_14]: It's okay.

1697
02:15:17,065 --> 02:15:17,725
[SPEAKER_00]: 9-18.

1698
02:15:18,226 --> 02:15:18,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1699
02:15:21,288 --> 02:15:21,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1700
02:15:21,908 --> 02:15:25,991
[SPEAKER_14]: So Anthony wants to vote on removing section 918 from the charter.

1701
02:15:26,672 --> 02:15:28,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Does everybody understand what that would be?

1702
02:15:30,868 --> 02:15:33,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Just have a quick point for information.

1703
02:15:33,589 --> 02:15:42,273
[SPEAKER_08]: We took a vote, and by the rules of the committee, are we opening this vote back up for reconsideration?

1704
02:15:42,293 --> 02:15:45,575
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm making an amendment that the language

1705
02:15:46,327 --> 02:16:05,109
[SPEAKER_08]: you know we've already voted we voted that it stays and you're you're actually acting asking that the vote that was already taken be reconsidered not we voted yeah we voted to put it in the charter and but we didn't have the language so now we're not voting

1706
02:16:06,944 --> 02:16:09,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Once we voted, you can't amend it.

1707
02:16:09,726 --> 02:16:10,887
[SPEAKER_08]: You can reconsider it.

1708
02:16:11,627 --> 02:16:13,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And the language is a separate issue.

1709
02:16:13,409 --> 02:16:14,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Anthony wants to reconsider it.

1710
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:16,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to move.

1711
02:16:16,671 --> 02:16:25,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he's proposing an amendment to the charter, which is to remove Section 9, which, you know, is so.

1712
02:16:27,858 --> 02:16:31,361
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, so does everyone understand what they'll be voting on?

1713
02:16:32,501 --> 02:16:32,681
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1714
02:16:34,423 --> 02:16:35,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Did someone say no?

1715
02:16:36,024 --> 02:16:36,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I did.

1716
02:16:37,325 --> 02:16:47,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Paulette, section 918 is the language that we bought that lays out the creation of an ethics commission to create a financial reporting form.

1717
02:16:50,071 --> 02:16:55,494
[SPEAKER_14]: So the amendment that's being proposed is to remove that entire section from the chart.

1718
02:16:55,614 --> 02:16:58,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

1719
02:16:58,835 --> 02:17:00,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Danielle.

1720
02:17:03,097 --> 02:17:05,158
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1721
02:17:05,939 --> 02:17:06,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

1722
02:17:07,605 --> 02:17:07,805
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1723
02:17:08,585 --> 02:17:08,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Paulette.

1724
02:17:09,406 --> 02:17:09,586
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1725
02:17:11,046 --> 02:17:11,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice.

1726
02:17:11,826 --> 02:17:12,006
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1727
02:17:13,027 --> 02:17:13,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Phyllis.

1728
02:17:14,087 --> 02:17:14,327
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1729
02:17:16,348 --> 02:17:16,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean.

1730
02:17:18,348 --> 02:17:20,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1731
02:17:20,969 --> 02:17:21,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury.

1732
02:17:22,009 --> 02:17:22,249
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1733
02:17:24,650 --> 02:17:25,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Daveed.

1734
02:17:25,950 --> 02:17:26,130
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1735
02:17:27,051 --> 02:17:28,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andreottola.

1736
02:17:28,851 --> 02:17:29,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1737
02:17:30,231 --> 02:17:32,732
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll vote yes too, but it stays.

1738
02:17:34,253 --> 02:17:35,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so now,

1739
02:17:37,331 --> 02:17:40,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Paulette.

1740
02:17:41,154 --> 02:17:53,584
[SPEAKER_12]: At the last meeting, we didn't get to section 4-1, the school committee one, and the Collins Center had written

1741
02:17:55,530 --> 02:17:58,112
[SPEAKER_12]: The project team deleted the following language.

1742
02:17:58,753 --> 02:18:07,841
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, the secretary is responsible for overseeing and improving the bills of the school department unless the school committee votes to form a subcommittee especially for reviewing the bills.

1743
02:18:08,642 --> 02:18:13,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they say, that's a quote, the school department is a large conflict organization.

1744
02:18:13,446 --> 02:18:19,072
[SPEAKER_12]: They should have a business manager or a dedicated financial team to monitor this issue and report to the school committee.

1745
02:18:19,672 --> 02:18:24,596
[SPEAKER_12]: The project team doubts that an elected individual would have time and specialized training needed to address this issue.

1746
02:18:25,177 --> 02:18:29,661
[SPEAKER_12]: So may I ask, did you guys go along with this recommendation or not?

1747
02:18:32,183 --> 02:18:39,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, we didn't vote to change the language that's in the proposed chart.

1748
02:18:40,030 --> 02:18:42,873
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess that means we went along with the recommendation because

1749
02:18:45,361 --> 02:18:46,902
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have a vote one way or the other.

1750
02:18:47,183 --> 02:18:49,724
[SPEAKER_06]: We discussed it briefly and no motions were made.

1751
02:18:49,965 --> 02:18:51,526
[SPEAKER_12]: But Collins took it out.

1752
02:18:52,246 --> 02:18:53,707
[SPEAKER_12]: The Collins Center took it out.

1753
02:18:54,328 --> 02:18:56,289
[SPEAKER_12]: And they said, oh, well, there's a business manager.

1754
02:18:56,809 --> 02:18:59,551
[SPEAKER_12]: And that unfortunately

1755
02:19:00,632 --> 02:19:09,878
[SPEAKER_12]: explicitly is clear that they don't understand why the school committee would have a person looking at the bills.

1756
02:19:10,638 --> 02:19:21,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of course we have a financial person, and there's a further sign-off on the school department side where both the financial person and the superintendent signs off bills.

1757
02:19:22,065 --> 02:19:30,692
[SPEAKER_12]: But the school committee has always had the secretary, a designated person, which in Medford, it's the school committee.

1758
02:19:31,172 --> 02:19:34,294
[SPEAKER_12]: In other communities, it might be a subcommittee.

1759
02:19:34,855 --> 02:19:47,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason is because we don't want to only be at the beck and call of what's being told us, but we get to see with our own eyes that list of what's being paid out.

1760
02:19:48,345 --> 02:19:57,832
[SPEAKER_12]: So I could go to the superintendent when I was the secretary and say, tell me, how come this retired person is collecting this money and this money and this money?

1761
02:19:58,493 --> 02:20:06,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Or tell me, why are we spending so much money on pizza at the middle school level or whatever?

1762
02:20:07,620 --> 02:20:17,508
[SPEAKER_12]: So it meant that somebody who wasn't in the superintendent's office, if you would, weren't just feeding us information, but that we could

1763
02:20:19,242 --> 02:20:23,324
[SPEAKER_12]: We had someone who was looking over all of the information.

1764
02:20:24,284 --> 02:20:30,466
[SPEAKER_12]: And so by just saying, well, they have a business manager, so frankly, they shouldn't have this.

1765
02:20:31,947 --> 02:20:35,588
[SPEAKER_12]: It undermines, it shows a lack of understanding.

1766
02:20:35,628 --> 02:20:37,669
[SPEAKER_12]: And believe me, I don't want to offend the Collins Center.

1767
02:20:37,969 --> 02:20:43,731
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly understand that they wouldn't understand this level of detail, but it's not accurate.

1768
02:20:45,182 --> 02:20:52,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, if you don't like the sentence, I'm willing, the sentence could be changed in some way.

1769
02:20:53,387 --> 02:21:04,555
[SPEAKER_12]: But to just say, well, we're not going to include what the duties of the secretary are in the charter, to me is like, so why, you know, this is what we're doing.

1770
02:21:04,815 --> 02:21:09,118
[SPEAKER_12]: We're explaining to people what the duties of these people are.

1771
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:13,200
[SPEAKER_12]: You look mystified.

1772
02:21:16,167 --> 02:21:17,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to explain this earlier.

1773
02:21:19,110 --> 02:21:21,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony or Marilyn, do you want to respond to that?

1774
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:28,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll just say it's probably our fault in how we wrote the recommendation in the memo.

1775
02:21:29,065 --> 02:21:34,569
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saying that the school committee wouldn't see the bills or anything like that.

1776
02:21:35,050 --> 02:21:37,732
[SPEAKER_00]: The school committee has general oversight over the school department.

1777
02:21:38,732 --> 02:21:44,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Our concern was with tasking one member, particularly the secretary, with that task.

1778
02:21:44,317 --> 02:21:49,901
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an elected person as part of this body that does that.

1779
02:21:49,921 --> 02:21:51,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, in other communities,

1780
02:21:52,283 --> 02:21:54,865
[SPEAKER_00]: They can review the financial information of the school department as the body.

1781
02:21:54,885 --> 02:21:56,427
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do it as a subcommittee.

1782
02:21:57,127 --> 02:22:02,972
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just concerned with trying to specify a specific individual on the committee to do it.

1783
02:22:03,332 --> 02:22:05,955
[SPEAKER_12]: But in Medford, that is the way it is done.

1784
02:22:07,703 --> 02:22:17,768
[SPEAKER_12]: And we continued by saying, unless the school committee votes to form a subcommittee, especially for reviewing the bills, because that could happen in the future.

1785
02:22:18,548 --> 02:22:25,771
[SPEAKER_12]: But the key point is that there's always oversight from the school committee to be able to look at the bills.

1786
02:22:25,991 --> 02:22:29,053
[SPEAKER_12]: The superintendent can't say to us, no, you can't look at the bills.

1787
02:22:30,015 --> 02:22:31,497
[SPEAKER_12]: or you don't need that subcommittee.

1788
02:22:32,218 --> 02:22:38,147
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now, for years and years and years, the role has always been given to the secretary.

1789
02:22:40,762 --> 02:22:49,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if you watch the meetings, the secretary gives a report, and then members ask about a certain thing, because they all get to see it.

1790
02:22:49,825 --> 02:22:54,746
[SPEAKER_12]: They get to ask a certain thing, and the secretary often fields the question.

1791
02:22:55,046 --> 02:23:01,828
[SPEAKER_12]: And if they can't, then they turn for assistance to the financial person.

1792
02:23:03,348 --> 02:23:08,710
[SPEAKER_12]: But to just take it out and not say that it's part of our duties, it's just inaccurate.

1793
02:23:12,648 --> 02:23:23,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I guess I don't see it as inaccurate because to me taking it doesn't mean that it can't, that the school committee can't still continue with that process if they want.

1794
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:31,665
[SPEAKER_14]: But putting it in means that they can never change it until the charter is changed.

1795
02:23:33,625 --> 02:23:35,126
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how that's kind of how I see it.

1796
02:23:35,226 --> 02:23:39,867
[SPEAKER_12]: But, um, well, we did write it unless the school committee votes to change.

1797
02:23:40,027 --> 02:23:44,929
[SPEAKER_12]: So we did give an option, knowing that there are other communities who do it differently.

1798
02:23:46,509 --> 02:23:48,090
[SPEAKER_12]: You could also write well.

1799
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:57,301
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, you could refer to the school committee's rules and regs.

1800
02:23:57,821 --> 02:24:14,506
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying that if you're, you know, we're saying what the role of the chair and the vice chair, you've got another elected position where other members vote for the secretary.

1801
02:24:15,406 --> 02:24:16,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Why wouldn't you put it in?

1802
02:24:17,006 --> 02:24:22,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if it's unique to Medford, it's unique to Medford, but that's what it is.

1803
02:24:25,184 --> 02:24:27,245
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, Jean, did you want to say something?

1804
02:24:29,205 --> 02:24:38,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Paulette, I'm hearing that you have a concern that if it's not in the charter, the school refused to provide the information.

1805
02:24:38,908 --> 02:24:42,549
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're creating a checks and balance.

1806
02:24:43,669 --> 02:24:44,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that part of it?

1807
02:24:44,990 --> 02:24:50,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't imagine that the school would, but that potential certainly exists.

1808
02:24:50,831 --> 02:24:53,352
[SPEAKER_12]: And to me, it's just, I mean,

1809
02:24:56,066 --> 02:24:56,887
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wouldn't.

1810
02:24:57,688 --> 02:24:58,669
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have a secretary.

1811
02:24:59,971 --> 02:25:05,858
[SPEAKER_12]: And we specify that they take the role of the school committee.

1812
02:25:06,118 --> 02:25:06,859
[SPEAKER_12]: They call the role.

1813
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:11,985
[SPEAKER_12]: But we never say, I mean, their other duty is to do this.

1814
02:25:15,223 --> 02:25:19,667
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand the Collins Center's concern, like Medford can keep doing it.

1815
02:25:19,727 --> 02:25:20,848
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not stopping us.

1816
02:25:20,888 --> 02:25:22,510
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just not putting it in the charter.

1817
02:25:22,570 --> 02:25:29,436
[SPEAKER_10]: We're giving the school committee the flexibility to determine whether the secretary would continue to do that.

1818
02:25:30,317 --> 02:25:38,905
[SPEAKER_10]: However, if you're concerned that the school would refuse to provide that financial accounting to the school committee,

1819
02:25:40,285 --> 02:25:47,190
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, is there a way to make sure the school committee has that power if we haven't written it appropriately so far?

1820
02:25:47,330 --> 02:25:48,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

1821
02:25:48,571 --> 02:25:49,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we already?

1822
02:25:49,692 --> 02:25:51,013
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand what you're saying.

1823
02:25:54,055 --> 02:25:56,837
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, I see it as the defining of the roles.

1824
02:25:56,877 --> 02:25:58,958
[SPEAKER_12]: You're saying, well, what if they change it?

1825
02:25:58,998 --> 02:26:02,641
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we've put a sentence in to explain that.

1826
02:26:05,802 --> 02:26:08,163
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't want to belabor the point.

1827
02:26:08,243 --> 02:26:13,905
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that if we're we've done this whole thing, we looked at all the roles of the school committee.

1828
02:26:14,345 --> 02:26:16,706
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a clearly designated thing.

1829
02:26:17,186 --> 02:26:18,586
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm running for school committee.

1830
02:26:18,606 --> 02:26:21,928
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to find I'm looking at the charter to see what it tells me.

1831
02:26:22,008 --> 02:26:25,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand what the what the secretary position is.

1832
02:26:26,149 --> 02:26:27,650
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, this adds clarity.

1833
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:27,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

1834
02:26:31,437 --> 02:26:39,602
[SPEAKER_12]: It has nothing to do with when the project team doubts that an elected individual would have the time and specialized training needed to address this issue.

1835
02:26:40,263 --> 02:26:45,766
[SPEAKER_12]: That sentence doesn't make any sense at all.

1836
02:26:45,786 --> 02:26:55,772
[SPEAKER_12]: The justification that the Collins Center gave to remove that just doesn't make any sense to me at all to say, well, we're just giving them flexibility.

1837
02:26:58,057 --> 02:27:06,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, then how come we write what the chair of the school committee does?

1838
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:09,201
[SPEAKER_12]: How come we write what the vice chair of the school committee does?

1839
02:27:09,521 --> 02:27:11,482
[SPEAKER_12]: How come you get to the secretary and you don't say anything?

1840
02:27:11,622 --> 02:27:12,662
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand that.

1841
02:27:12,802 --> 02:27:14,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, to me, it's just, of course you would.

1842
02:27:15,886 --> 02:27:32,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to, I think section four or five powers and duties gives the school committee the power to demand, request all financial accounting, because they oversee the operation of the annual budget.

1843
02:27:32,419 --> 02:27:35,661
[SPEAKER_10]: So they could do that however they wanted to pursue that.

1844
02:27:35,801 --> 02:27:36,962
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I wanted to say.

1845
02:27:36,982 --> 02:27:39,164
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, it's just a clarification of the role.

1846
02:27:39,905 --> 02:27:40,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

1847
02:27:40,885 --> 02:27:44,786
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's probably, we've done it for a long, long time this way.

1848
02:27:45,126 --> 02:27:46,646
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a clarification of the role.

1849
02:27:48,227 --> 02:27:54,628
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't talk about, it's not really in our purview to decide how we're gonna do it.

1850
02:27:56,588 --> 02:28:03,989
[SPEAKER_12]: The way that it's traditionally done is either, it might be a portion of the school committee.

1851
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:06,370
[SPEAKER_12]: We've not done that.

1852
02:28:08,272 --> 02:28:11,857
[SPEAKER_12]: But we gave leeway for that to happen in this charter.

1853
02:28:12,578 --> 02:28:16,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So I, you know, again, it just, I read it and I said, well, you know, how come?

1854
02:28:17,063 --> 02:28:17,964
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand it.

1855
02:28:19,486 --> 02:28:26,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes I've been bothered by us coming to a point of sort of saying, well, it's not in any other charter.

1856
02:28:28,339 --> 02:28:32,002
[SPEAKER_12]: And for me, it's sort of saying, well, this is something, if it is unique to Medford, it's unique to Medford.

1857
02:28:32,022 --> 02:28:33,203
[SPEAKER_12]: So we should put it in the charter.

1858
02:28:34,224 --> 02:28:37,867
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyway, I know you guys have been going on for a long time.

1859
02:28:38,587 --> 02:28:41,130
[SPEAKER_12]: This one obviously just stuck out to me.

1860
02:28:41,950 --> 02:28:42,651
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1861
02:28:42,911 --> 02:28:46,054
[SPEAKER_14]: So are you proposing, do you want to make a proposal that we add it back in?

1862
02:28:46,614 --> 02:28:46,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1863
02:28:47,515 --> 02:28:47,895
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1864
02:28:48,616 --> 02:28:53,400
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I just want to hear what Ron and Eunice and David have some comments.

1865
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:53,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron?

1866
02:28:54,787 --> 02:28:58,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Just simply being involved in this process.

1867
02:28:58,716 --> 02:29:05,870
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no better master of the subject than Paulette, who did this job for year after year after year.

1868
02:29:07,442 --> 02:29:20,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the words that allow the school community to elect a suitable replacement process, it gives them the option to change this.

1869
02:29:21,045 --> 02:29:23,045
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the way we do business in the city.

1870
02:29:23,085 --> 02:29:26,786
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the way that veterans like Paulette are comfortable with.

1871
02:29:27,226 --> 02:29:31,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we owe it to that process that appears.

1872
02:29:31,927 --> 02:29:33,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, one question for Paulette is,

1873
02:29:34,081 --> 02:29:37,044
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have verbiage in there that you serve a term of one year.

1874
02:29:37,084 --> 02:29:41,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe you were like a secretary for multiple years in a row.

1875
02:29:41,208 --> 02:29:46,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that, what is your opinion on the, you know, you do it for a year and then you must pass it on?

1876
02:29:47,054 --> 02:29:54,942
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely think, and when we discussed this, we said that no person should do the role for continuous years.

1877
02:29:55,968 --> 02:30:04,573
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can do it year A, you can do it year C, you can do it year E, but that one person shouldn't have a lock on these roles.

1878
02:30:05,434 --> 02:30:05,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1879
02:30:05,794 --> 02:30:07,155
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a different issue.

1880
02:30:07,175 --> 02:30:14,019
[SPEAKER_14]: But let's stick to this issue of the secretary's job description.

1881
02:30:14,259 --> 02:30:14,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice?

1882
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:24,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Ron kind of said what I was going to say and what I tried to say earlier when we first went through this, that I

1883
02:30:25,907 --> 02:30:28,528
[SPEAKER_11]: the, I think the checks and balances piece is important.

1884
02:30:28,608 --> 02:30:42,172
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, um, you know, we should be listening carefully to, um, you know, what Paulette says and, um, and she's right, you know, in terms of just because it hasn't been done in a charter before.

1885
02:30:42,192 --> 02:30:44,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we just proved that with the ethics part.

1886
02:30:44,893 --> 02:30:50,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and if this is, you know, what works in Medford, then, you know, I think we should heed that.

1887
02:30:52,015 --> 02:30:52,115
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

1888
02:30:53,049 --> 02:31:01,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to make a motion to add the language back so that we could move on.

1889
02:31:01,879 --> 02:31:02,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1890
02:31:04,061 --> 02:31:06,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask Melva, can you put the language up on the screen please?

1891
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:11,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1892
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:16,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I'm not sure I can do that because it's not in the draft charter.

1893
02:31:16,462 --> 02:31:18,882
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just going to read it.

1894
02:31:18,942 --> 02:31:19,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1895
02:31:20,463 --> 02:31:23,844
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're voting to add in this language.

1896
02:31:24,504 --> 02:31:37,108
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition, the secretary is responsible for overseeing and approving the bills of the school department unless the school committee votes to form a subcommittee expressly for reviewing the bills.

1897
02:31:38,626 --> 02:31:42,227
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be the section that we would add back in.

1898
02:31:44,028 --> 02:31:45,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean.

1899
02:31:45,228 --> 02:31:48,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I second.

1900
02:31:49,450 --> 02:31:49,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1901
02:31:49,850 --> 02:31:50,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1902
02:31:50,530 --> 02:31:50,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean.

1903
02:31:51,911 --> 02:31:52,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1904
02:31:54,051 --> 02:31:54,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury.

1905
02:31:54,992 --> 02:31:55,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1906
02:31:56,732 --> 02:31:57,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis.

1907
02:31:59,153 --> 02:32:01,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to abstain.

1908
02:32:03,594 --> 02:32:03,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice.

1909
02:32:04,515 --> 02:32:04,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1910
02:32:06,495 --> 02:32:06,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Paulette.

1911
02:32:07,336 --> 02:32:07,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1912
02:32:10,199 --> 02:32:10,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I get Maury?

1913
02:32:13,601 --> 02:32:14,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you already got him.

1914
02:32:14,362 --> 02:32:14,862
[SPEAKER_01]: You already got him.

1915
02:32:15,402 --> 02:32:16,283
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't get Ron.

1916
02:32:16,803 --> 02:32:17,504
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't get Ron.

1917
02:32:17,804 --> 02:32:18,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

1918
02:32:19,005 --> 02:32:19,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Ron says yes.

1919
02:32:20,706 --> 02:32:21,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony Andreotila.

1920
02:32:22,507 --> 02:32:26,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I get Danielle?

1921
02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:28,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, guys.

1922
02:32:28,351 --> 02:32:29,492
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't, but I'm a yes.

1923
02:32:30,212 --> 02:32:30,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1924
02:32:32,954 --> 02:32:34,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think I'm the only one left.

1925
02:32:34,956 --> 02:32:35,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a no.

1926
02:32:35,156 --> 02:32:35,796
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't get me.

1927
02:32:36,297 --> 02:32:36,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a no.

1928
02:32:37,431 --> 02:32:47,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so it gets added back in.

1929
02:32:48,157 --> 02:32:48,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else?

1930
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:53,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

1931
02:32:54,841 --> 02:32:56,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Paulette, did you have anything else?

1932
02:32:56,362 --> 02:32:57,322
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1933
02:32:58,723 --> 02:32:59,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second that.

1934
02:33:00,444 --> 02:33:03,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there no public available?

1935
02:33:03,186 --> 02:33:03,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody's here.

1936
02:33:04,346 --> 02:33:06,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we still have the final report subcommittee?

1937
02:33:07,725 --> 02:33:08,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

1938
02:33:08,225 --> 02:33:08,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1939
02:33:08,826 --> 02:33:10,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Eunice.

1940
02:33:10,347 --> 02:33:11,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1941
02:33:12,189 --> 02:33:15,691
[SPEAKER_14]: The final report, it was sent to you all in draft form.

1942
02:33:15,711 --> 02:33:17,693
[SPEAKER_14]: There have been some changes made since then.

1943
02:33:18,714 --> 02:33:26,019
[SPEAKER_14]: We are going to have one more meeting next week so that we can send you a final draft.

1944
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:30,082
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the next meeting will be our last meeting.

1945
02:33:30,603 --> 02:33:33,025
[SPEAKER_14]: What I would like to do is ask the call-in center.

1946
02:33:33,065 --> 02:33:35,086
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to send the call-in center all these changes.

1947
02:33:37,759 --> 02:33:56,690
[SPEAKER_14]: hopefully get a new draft of the entire charter and the final report, which I will send to you in advance of our October meeting so that we can just make those officials vote them and then we will submit that to the mayor.

1948
02:33:58,591 --> 02:33:59,312
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the plan.

1949
02:34:00,956 --> 02:34:03,898
[SPEAKER_11]: So you said you already sent the final report once to us?

1950
02:34:04,519 --> 02:34:08,001
[SPEAKER_14]: I sent a draft, yeah, so that you guys could sort of take a look at it.

1951
02:34:08,761 --> 02:34:10,543
[SPEAKER_14]: But you'll get a more final draft.

1952
02:34:11,183 --> 02:34:11,443
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1953
02:34:11,583 --> 02:34:15,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember seeing the first one, but I could have just missed it.

1954
02:34:16,107 --> 02:34:17,568
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll get a more final draft.

1955
02:34:20,290 --> 02:34:24,753
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we have one more meeting, and we'll be good to go.

1956
02:34:24,773 --> 02:34:27,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1957
02:34:28,876 --> 02:34:29,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I was right.

1958
02:34:30,946 --> 02:34:32,586
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so we're good.

1959
02:34:33,007 --> 02:34:35,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody, we managed to finish before 9.30.

1960
02:34:35,327 --> 02:34:39,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got through the whole thing.

1961
02:34:39,608 --> 02:34:40,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1962
02:34:40,749 --> 02:34:41,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you made it.

1963
02:34:42,789 --> 02:34:43,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you made it.

1964
02:34:43,850 --> 02:34:46,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great that you got to have your input in there.

1965
02:34:46,190 --> 02:34:46,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1966
02:34:47,871 --> 02:34:48,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sorry about that.

1967
02:34:48,871 --> 02:34:51,112
[SPEAKER_12]: I have company, out-of-state company.

1968
02:34:51,992 --> 02:34:52,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, geez.

1969
02:34:54,132 --> 02:34:54,432
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1970
02:34:57,018 --> 02:34:57,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to adjourn.

1971
02:34:57,944 --> 02:34:59,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1972
02:34:59,473 --> 02:35:00,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, everybody.
