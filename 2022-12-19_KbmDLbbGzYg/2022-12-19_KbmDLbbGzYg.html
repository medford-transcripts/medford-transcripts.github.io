    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1.681s">We</a>  want to let everybody know that the teachers union has ratified their contract and the school committee has voted in approval of that contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9.406s">So</a>  I wanted to start with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=15.89s">We're</a>  gonna give people the chance to speak right after the superintendent's comments, which is very close with regards to the incident today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=25.376s">First</a>  up quickly is the consent agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=28.254s">bills</a>  and payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes, December 5th, 2022.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=38.922s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=40.123s">Minutes</a>  are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=42.565s">We</a>  have number five. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=45.327s">I'm</a>  not sure if anybody wants to table this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=46.709s">Report</a>  of subcommittees, rules and policy, subcommittee minutes.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=49.711s">Motion</a>  to table to the next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=51.192s">Motion</a>  to table by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=54.815s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=56.076s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=56.516s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=58.038s">reports</a>  of subcommittees have been tabled until our first meeting in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=62.603s">Next</a>  up we have number six report of the superintendent superintendent superintendents updates and comments, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Reese Edward Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=76.374s">I</a>  too would like to open by just saying that I'm very pleased that our teachers contract was ratified this evening, and there will be further labor update later on today's agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=92.344s">I</a>  do want to just start with saying once again that during this month of December, we want to first recognize those that started celebrating Hanukkah last evening, and that Hanukkah will be celebrated for eight days, and again, we wish all of our Jewish friends a happy Hanukkah as they celebrate the Festival of Lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=117.347s">The</a>  winter solstice, sometimes also referred to as Yule Day, that will begin on Wednesday, December 21st, which is the shortest day of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=127.429s">And</a>  in some cultures, the winter solstice signifies renewal and fresh beginnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=135.731s">Following</a>  that, Christmas Day this year falls on Sunday, December 25th, and Kwanzaa begins on the 26th and lasts until January 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=148.294s">No</a>  matter your celebration, all of the holidays mentioned celebrate with the lighting of candles. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=157.42s">Maya</a>  Angelou once said that we are more alike my friends than we are unalike. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=164.586s">So</a>  in the spirit of the holiday season, I would like to extend thanks to the following who have helped to make sure all of our families within Medford have had a happy holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=176.482s">The</a>  Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn School are both hosting Trees of Warmth, which collect donations of hats, new hats, gloves, socks, scarves, and even coats that will be accessible to students in need before the holiday break and throughout the winter season. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=197.97s">The</a>  book school hosted their monthly food drive donations and collected over 160 bags of food. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=207.335s">Special</a>  thanks to Whole Foods for providing bags and our vocational school for providing color flyers that went home with every student. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=219.161s">I'd</a>  like to recognize our Director of Arts, Suzanne Fee, and our high school teacher, Medford High School teacher, Kaylee Lanzilli. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=227.434s">They</a>  are determined to make numerous students' holiday wishes come true. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=232.737s">Working</a>  in collaboration with the Medford Family Network, as well as all of our K to 12 families, they reached out to our teachers, administrators, parents, administrative assistants, and others in the school community to help provide them over 15 families with wonderful holiday gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=253.989s">So</a>  thank you for your work in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=257.091s">I</a>  also want to recognize the Mustang football team. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=261.012s">They</a>  are busy collecting gift cards for the Medford family network families, and the Mustang boys basketball team are also collecting non perishable items for all of the micro pantries in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=276.396s">For</a>  those who attended the home opener this Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=280.228s">and</a>  bring a brand new non perishable food item, the ticket price to attend the game will be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=288.058s">Again,</a>  if you go to the home opener this Thursday and you bring a non perishable food item, your ticket price will be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=297.822s">I</a>  also want to thank Teamsters Local 25 for providing bags and bags of toys to the Medford Family Network, as well as Gilbane Company, the Medford Kiwanis Club, the Medford Fire and Police Departments, Toys for Tots, and the Wonder Fund, of which the mayor is a big supporter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=321.721s">We</a>  are so lucky to reside in a diverse and historic community that remembers to take care of those in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=329.492s">The</a>  goodness in Medford reminds me of a quote from the movie, It's a Wonderful Life. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=335.2s">Remember,</a>  no man is a failure who has friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=340.7s">We</a>  have a huge village of friends who take care of each other in our school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=345.342s">We</a>  are not called the mighty Mustangs for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=348.684s">Great</a>  job, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=350.324s">You</a>  make me very proud to be your superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=354.046s">I</a>  would also like to take a moment to recognize our fall 22 GBL all-stars. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=362.57s">For</a>  boys cross country, we recognize Sam Orcutt, TJ Higgins, and Colin Lally. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=371.465s">For</a>  girls cross country, we recognize co-MVPs of the league, Anna Casey and Yasmin D'Souza Vieira. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=382.052s">For</a>  boys soccer, we would like to recognize Oliver Lolliker and Jordan Ionkeith. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=390.077s">For</a>  girls soccer, MVP of the league, Emma Casey, Maria Colombo, Riley Walker, and Haley Duarte. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=402.233s">For</a>  girls soccer, Eastern Mass all stars, Emma Casey, and Maria Colombo for golf we'd like to recognize Devin page, and Lewis Pacheco for girls volleyball, we'd like to recognize Isabella second ratio, and Sophia. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=424.949s">For</a>  football, we would like to recognize Stevens, Exeter, Dom Rizzo, and Samuel Nazer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=432.613s">Thank</a>  you and congratulations to all of our fall sports athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=437.997s">And</a>  we wish our winter athletes all the best as they begin their games this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=443.268s">There</a>  are a few reminders. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=445.489s">This</a>  coming Wednesday, December 21st is the last opportunity for our seniors to take their class portraits. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=453.333s">Please</a>  do not miss out on this opportunity so that you can be included in the yearbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=459.476s">Also,</a>  we are continuing to pass out our COVID tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=463.699s">This</a>  Friday is a half day before we break for our holiday break. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=468.921s">We</a>  return to school on Tuesday, January 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=474.588s">My</a>  final remarks that I would like to share are about a very serious incident that took place today at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=487.013s">Earlier</a>  today at the high school, we had a student, one of our students was involved in an altercation and that student was stabbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=497.937s">I</a>  have spoken with the student's mother and she has shared with me that her child is stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=507.054s">I</a>  also want to share that the defendant in this situation has been identified and is in police custody at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=519.705s">I</a>  want to say a special thank you to our teachers, our staff, who supported all of their students while we were conducting the stay in place at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=533.191s">I'd</a>  like to also extend special thanks to our nursing staff for their immediate response to the Medford Police Department for their support, Medford Fire Department, the mayor's office that was with us today, and EMS for all of their support during today's situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=555.999s">We</a>  will continue to work collaboratively with the police department, as this investigation is still ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=565.243s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=570.546s">Thank</a>  you from the chair if I may, I want to thank the superintendent for comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=577.438s">First</a>  and foremost, our teachers who navigated the almost two hours in the shelter in place while the police were able to do their work at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=589.202s">We</a>  thank the teachers, staff, the nurses, thank the police department for being there and obviously going to be a presence throughout the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=599.346s">We</a>  do have chief of police here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=601.368s">also</a>  Captain Covino, who will be able to answer questions if we do have any questions, and maybe give us an update right off the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=608.63s">But</a>  please know we are taking this extremely seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=612.792s">Safety</a>  of our students is our utmost priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=616.473s">I</a>  think you've heard from this committee that we recognize there's a systemic issue, and there's a culture and climate study that needs to be done, and that's just one thing that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=627.096s">I</a>  know many of you have said it on the floor, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=630.755s">I</a>  say what I need to say quite often behind the scenes, especially out of respect and pushing for that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=638.622s">Everybody</a>  knows I'm making the changes on the city side, and we do want to see positive changes for our students on the school side too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=647.389s">We</a>  do recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=648.53s">We</a>  have asked for a culture and climate study a year ago, and I know that's out in procurement now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=654.074s">Dr.</a>  Cushing told us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=656.892s">Just</a>  also please know, as soon as I heard about this, I was at the high school with our communications team, also our board of health director, who is our emergency management coordinator for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=667.938s">We</a>  went to the high school just to make sure we could lend a hand any way possible, work with central administration to get communications out, to make sure we were crossing all our T's and dotting all our I's, and the students are our utmost priority in their safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=686.073s">There</a>  is no imminent threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=687.334s">I'll</a>  ask Captain Covino to maybe come up and give a little more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=691.276s">There's</a>  no imminent threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=693.097s">We</a>  have a plan for tomorrow between the bathroom plan, extra staffing in the hallways and the cafeterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=700.98s">We're</a>  asking our teachers for support. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=703.602s">We</a>  do have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=704.442s">We're</a>  gonna implement that tomorrow and any other details you can give Captain Covino. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=709.484s">I</a>  know you're actively working the situation.</p>

    <p>[Covino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=712.006s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=714.659s">We</a>  have already planned to have some added personnel at the high school to be visible in the hallways and around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=723.792s">support.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=724.312s">They're</a>  not doing an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=725.713s">They're</a>  just there for support for the school, the students, the faculty, and everybody else that may need to talk to them or pass on any information. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=735.237s">They</a>  will be there for the week until school break. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=738.699s">And</a>  after that, we can reassess the needs of the school and the properties and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=744.021s">Does</a>  anybody have any questions for me?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=746.082s">You</a>  could tell us a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=747.043s">I</a>  know everybody's been watching the news and <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=750.416s">Schools</a>  have sent out a number of communications to parents and faculty and staff, but is there anything else you can share about the incident that we don't know about in the last hour that we've been in executive session?</p>

    <p>[Covino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=760.06s">Nothing's</a>  changed since the news has been on since late this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=764.001s">Everything's</a>  been already spoken about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=767.103s">So</a>  everything you've seen in the news today is where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=770.024s">The</a>  investigation is still ongoing and pretty much status quo right now.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=779.298s">And</a>  we'll have additional professionals and counselors in the high school to deal, along with the police presence. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=786.862s">We'll</a>  have additional supports in place for our faculty and staff tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=792.524s">We've</a>  called in outside agencies as well as additional counselors from the other schools to come help. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=800.768s">Any?</a> </p>

    <p>[Covino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=801.628s">No,</a>  very welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=802.629s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=824.809s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=826.63s">Thank</a>  you, George Scott Pele. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=829.091s">27</a>  Butler Street, Matthew, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=831.432s">Um,</a>  what I'm hearing on what we've seen today was horrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=840.37s">What</a>  I hear and see from this committee is just as bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=845.812s">This</a>  isn't something that we're looking at systemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=848.693s">This</a>  is something right now that's happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=851.374s">Our</a>  kids are afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=852.235s">My</a>  daughter doesn't want to go back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=856.856s">Where</a>  is the urgency? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=859.978s">Where</a>  is your urgency? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=862.179s">A</a>  few weeks ago, we had parents up here talking about the fear they had about their daughter being beaten up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=869.753s">And</a>  we had a consultant and I've asked teachers, I've asked students, have you seen the change? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=875.556s">Nothing,</a>  nothing, nothing has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=883.78s">And</a>  to sit back, I'm gonna speak and then I'm gonna leave because I don't want it back and forth, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=891.004s">This</a>  is what we're seeing with my daughter, her friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=895.734s">I</a>  ran up to the high school just so I could be present for her, just so I could tell her her dad's outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=905.601s">I</a>  see over and over again, I saw Madam Superintendent, this is not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=911.846s">To</a>  write that this is an isolated incident and to say publicly this is an isolating incident is false. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=917.93s">This</a>  is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=921.092s">This</a>  is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=924.073s">And</a>  I'm scared, and I'm disgusted, and I feel bad for my daughter and her friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=931.317s">And</a>  this might be not the best thing a city council should do, coming up in front of a body and expressing themselves with this motion, but I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=943.843s">You</a>  have principals and assistant principals that are running around that school with no support. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=951.886s">for</a>  rules that have been implemented by this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=955.53s">Give</a>  him back the tools, give them back the tools so they can run the school system the way they see fit to keep our kids safe, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=965.079s">And</a>  then look at your studies and then look at your consultants and see what they said.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=974.005s">you're</a>  not willing to listen.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=975.025s">I'll</a>  be honest with tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=976.846s">We've</a>  asked for an emergency meeting didn't didn't go through only three members voted for an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=982.508s">We</a>  have a forum for people don't feel like they've been heard today to be up for the city council tomorrow and express their concerns and I will be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=990.831s">My</a>  daughter will not be going to school and her friends are not going to school.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=999.605s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1001.727s">I</a>  think it's unfortunate when a city counselor won't have a back and forth with constituents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1006.011s">And</a>  I am a constituent and I would like to have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1008.553s">I</a>  would say that it is inaccurate to say that nothing has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1012.576s">That's</a>  not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1013.657s">Number</a>  one, our police have been involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1015.899s">Our</a>  school counselors have been involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1017.741s">And</a>  particularly from someone who served on the other side of this table, and you know what the restrictions are, to sit here and politicize in front of cameras is completely egregious. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1026.624s">and</a>  unacceptable, I'm sorry, Mr. Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1029.785s">And</a>  my children go to school as well, and I worry about all of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1033.327s">I'm</a>  not here because it's enjoyable, I'm here because I care as well.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1037.188s">And</a>  if I may, just about the tools, Councilor Scarpelli, about the tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1042.631s">I</a>  know it's out there that we got rid of suspensions and detentions, that is absolutely not true.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1050.414s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1051.314s">So</a>  I will tell you, as a parent, you're asking me to have a back and forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1057.139s">As</a>  a colleague, I haven't heard one word from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1060.301s">I</a>  haven't had one word from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1062.903s">I've</a>  publicly put this out there because we haven't heard one word from any of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1067.639s">Well,</a>  one word, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1069.52s">So</a>  I will tell you, as a former member of this body, I worked diligently to make sure that we implemented a plan to keep our children safe from bullies, not the opposite, because that's what we're feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1081.608s">That's</a>  what our kids are feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1083.369s">Whether</a>  you want to see it or not, our children are telling us that they feel that you're protecting the bullies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1090.954s">You're</a>  allowing them to run the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1094.278s">If</a>  you ask any kid, any child up there, they're telling me that they feel unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1100.203s">They're</a>  telling me that they don't have the structure that they felt in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1105.027s">So</a>  to tell me that the tensions, suspensions, well guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1109.19s">If</a>  you're saying that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1111.175s">And</a>  that's not happening, it's not getting to the ones that it's happening to, because the kids are saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1117.703s">The</a>  kids are telling me that there's no suspensions, that they're not gonna get detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1123.029s">The</a>  kids are saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1126.273s">Maybe</a>  so, but let me ask you one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1130.171s">We've</a>  had assemblies for everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1132.473s">After</a>  that incident with that young lady, did you bring that student body in? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1136.276s">Did</a>  you bring that student body in and give them security to let them feel that they would be safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1141.119s">Have</a>  any of you, other than Go Mustangs or emails to people that if they get to them or not, did you sit in front of the student body yourselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1151.707s">After</a>  that incident, look them in the eye in the gymnasium, like you did when you were all there cheering them on for the football game, and look them in the eye and say, you're safe because of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1161.191s">You're</a>  safe because we're going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1163.993s">You</a>  did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1167.114s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.195s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1169.615s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1173.537s">That</a>  doesn't have to be a law.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1175.318s">There</a>  are laws that we have to follow, and I know that you understand that because you were on their side. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1180.219s">But</a>  you're not explaining that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1182.816s">Every</a>  child has rights, we have to make sure.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1184.777s">We</a>  understand that, but that doesn't mean the tact and the professionalism that you have from your teachers and administrators up there to bring the rest of the student body in and to let them know that they're in a safe environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1198.261s">You</a>  don't have to disclose anything, any other news about what's legally can be said and what can't be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1204.383s">You're</a>  all educated, very bright people to sit our student body down and look them in the eye and say, you're okay and this is why it's gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1212.006s">I'm</a>  not asking you to disclose any information about the perpetrator, the person who was injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1219.769s">I'm</a>  not saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1221.61s">Let</a>  the kids know that they're safe, because you haven't done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1225.052s">You</a>  haven't.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1229.454s">Thank</a>  you, counselor.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1240.759s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, school committee people, superintendent, Richard Carabiello, Memphis City Council, 74 Prescott Street, Memphis. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1248.426s">Now,</a>  I know the fear that Mrs. Brantley felt when I got that call from my granddaughter this morning saying, Pa, I'm afraid, come and get me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1258.474s">The</a>  school is supposed to be their safe place, not where they should be afraid to come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1263.459s">And</a>  for far too long, it's not a safe place for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1266.67s">And</a>  listen, I know you're trying to do the best you can, but obviously it's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1270.395s">And</a>  to say that today was an isolated incident was a little shocking to me when I heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1277.16s">It's</a>  not the way it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1278.521s">Our</a>  kids should be protected up there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1281.123s">Whether</a>  it has to be more public safety up there or whatever, more needs to be done than what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1288.568s">I</a>  mean, I hear stories about kids eating in bathrooms because they're afraid to go in cafeterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1294.192s">They</a>  fight all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1295.633s">This</a>  cannot continue to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1297.954s">I</a>  know you said it's systemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1299.075s">It</a>  is systemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1300.276s">And</a>  it's got to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1301.197s">And</a>  it has to stop now before somebody gets hurt and gets hurt bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1305.439s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1305.94s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1307.13s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1311.694s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, then you're next.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1313.856s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1314.396s">And</a>  I wanted to add in terms of the isolated incident, I believe that, you know, if there are officers here and or the superintendent that wants to speak to what that actually means, it means that <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1323.922s">It</a>  was an isolated incident in the bathroom in that instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1326.443s">It</a>  does not mean that there's not a systemic issue that has been ongoing and that we understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1331.144s">This</a>  was an isolated incident today in terms of what happened to this individual student in the school today at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1337.206s">That</a>  was the isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1338.507s">It's</a>  not that any of these are isolated incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1341.108s">We</a>  know there's a systemic issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1343.008s">That's</a>  why we're here to try to help change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1345.089s">But</a>  it takes more than seven people to change a school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1348.49s">It</a>  takes a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1349.69s">It</a>  takes a community working together <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1351.67s">to</a>  change a school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1352.552s">It</a>  takes a city council that is willing to work with their school committee and not get up here and yell at them in front of TV cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1360.126s">It</a>  takes working together as a community, all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1364.525s">and</a>  being good examples for our children, not bullying each other, not yelling at each other, not fighting with each other.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1370.129s">First</a>  of all, I wasn't yelling at anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1371.45s">No,</a>  that wasn't directed at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1372.651s">I</a>  wasn't yelling at anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1374.032s">But</a>  again, this is not isolated. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1376.554s">Whether</a>  getting a beating or getting stabbed, they're both like threatening injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1382.239s">So</a>  that's not isolated. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1383.039s">That's</a>  all one and the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1385.782s">And</a>  just don't say that the city council isn't willing to work with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1390.545s">We</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1393.902s">Okay,</a>  anytime, anytime, the school committee needs us, we've been there to support the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1403.066s">Okay,</a>  well, I say, anytime, anytime this group wants to be collaborative, we'll do it tomorrow, we'll do it Wednesday, you do it any day, any day they want to meet, I'll be there to meet, and I guarantee all my other people will meet also with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1416.171s">So,</a>  again, this is again, not isolated.</p>

    <p>[Kelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1420.112s">Mayor,</a>  there's also someone online. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1424.309s">Good</a>  evening, Danny Kelly 41 Myrtle Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1426.59s">I</a>  actually teach at the high school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1428.79s">So</a>  this is actually my last week at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1431.391s">I</a>  just took a new position with the Laborers Union so I feel like it's a good time to talk, not on really the negatives of today of course it's a bad issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1438.633s">But</a>  I did want to say I think one of the most important things before I leave just to say, I think this culture in the school can be strong because of Mr. Paul DeLeva and Chad Fallon. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1447.496s">They're</a>  two unbelievable leaders, but what needs to happen a little bit there needs to be a little bit more fun with the kids to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1453.278s">We</a>  talked to them, I've coached baseball and football in the city for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1456.84s">I</a>  went to Medford high school, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute working here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1460.583s">But</a>  to be honest, the things I worked in another school district after MCAS testing, we had events we had rock climbing walls come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1467.287s">We</a>  had people coming that was a little bit more fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1469.348s">I</a>  think to be honest, I think one of the things that needs to change, in my personal opinion, and leaving and teaching for a long time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1475.752s">is</a>  this needs to be a little bit more fun and events throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1478.593s">Even</a>  in assembly about anything, when we do have assemblies and the superintendent holds them, they're good and they help improve the culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1484.014s">The</a>  pep rally once a year helps improve the culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1486.535s">If</a>  we can do that multiple times a year, after an MCAS testing, when finals happen, when I was here in high school, after finals, they used to let us go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1495.237s">You</a>  know, it's kind of like little stuff you can look forward to after MCAS, if they could bring in a type of event, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1500.279s">That</a>  stuff helps improve culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1502.139s">I</a>  think even more pep rallies throughout the year, not just one in the fall, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1505.02s">Maybe</a>  one the spring anything to help improve that just school morale, me looking as an outsider now loving every minute of being here working here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1512.646s">That's</a>  the culture stuff just what we sit and talk to the kids in the construction shop all the time so just something you guys consider and thank you.</p>

    <p>[Reynolds]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2046.445s">I'm</a>  going to be very quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2047.746s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2048.506s">It's</a>  Kathleen Reynolds, Lambert Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2050.787s">I</a>  just want to read you a couple of text messages that I got from my daughter today while she was at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2059.011s">Mom,</a>  I'm scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2059.852s">I'm</a>  very scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2063.453s">And</a>  I had to go look and find out why, like, why are you scared? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2067.896s">And</a>  she said somebody got stabbed at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2072.355s">And</a>  it was horrifying to know that just not two months ago, another girl was assaulted at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2084.398s">And</a>  I can't get to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2088.259s">I</a>  cannot get to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2090.199s">And</a>  she's scared, and I'm scared for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2092.84s">I</a>  just don't feel like these kids feel safe anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2101.653s">and</a>  it's starting to become a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2106.395s">And</a>  instead of protecting the kids that are doing well, we're protecting the kids that need help, and they do need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2117.4s">And</a>  let's give them help, but let's also look at the kids that are doing things that are well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2123.162s">She</a>  lost four hours of education today because she was stuck in a room <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2132.185s">and</a>  couldn't go anywhere because somebody stabbed somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2135.687s">This</a>  is not our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2139.969s">We</a>  need to do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2145.333s">Sorry,</a>  but I'm upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2148.614s">I'm</a>  very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2151.796s">And</a>  we need to do better.</p>

    <p>[Flynn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2161.641s">Jackie</a>  Flynn, live on Rockwell Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2164.163s">My</a>  child was in that school today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2166.004s">She</a>  didn't even know why she was locked down. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2168.446s">I</a>  couldn't get my TV to work, couldn't find out, ran out the door in my pajamas to find out that everyone was there, there was a stabbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2175.491s">You</a>  could see staff sitting there through the windows and one particular teacher with her hand like this, like we were inconveniencing her. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2185.219s">Why</a>  don't we know things? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2187.0s">Understood</a>  things evolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2188.541s">We</a>  got emails later, nothing, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2191.223s">What</a>  about, hey, if you haven't heard from us, this is not your child. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2194.926s">Many</a>  of us didn't know if it was our kid that was hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2197.668s">All</a>  of you have kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2199.43s">Imagine</a>  sitting out there just wondering, is that your child? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2202.112s">Just</a>  hoping for a glimpse of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2204.734s">The</a>  school has terrible cell phone service. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2206.616s">Luckily,</a>  half of us were able to hear from our kids, but that's how we found out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2211.482s">Bullying</a>  is allowed in our school because our school allows it, and I blame all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2217.064s">Laws</a>  aside, everything aside, we all know it's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2220.285s">We</a>  have children, we have social media, you see it every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2224.187s">Between</a>  the stupid things on TikTok and everyone filming it on Snapchat, it's seen, we know it's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2230.609s">My</a>  daughter has been bullied in the Medford public school system for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2235.371s">I</a>  have personally reached out to everyone and forever have been told it is her fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2240.373s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2240.753s">Because</a>  she's different? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2243.216s">That's</a>  not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2244.096s">She</a>  got hit in the face with a 2x4 last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2246.779s">She</a>  got sent home with a bloody mouth and she was told she shouldn't ask the student for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2252.664s">She</a>  missed days of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2254.646s">She</a>  had her braces removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2256.787s">And</a>  that kid went on like it was nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2259.37s">He</a>  was fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2259.81s">My</a>  child missed the first two weeks of Medford High because I was terrified to send her for this reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2267.543s">She</a>  had a hard time learning remote and wanted a chance to go make friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2273.107s">I</a>  won't send her back. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2275.408s">I</a>  don't want that phone call that something happened to her just because she's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2278.91s">She's</a>  not going to be beat up in the school just because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2282.333s">I've</a>  talked to people, and you know what I get told? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2284.554s">It</a>  doesn't sound like it's a serious threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2287.876s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2288.857s">So</a>  it's not serious until it happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2292.697s">Nothing's</a>  done, so we take the step after a child's been stabbed, after a child's been beat. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2298.039s">We</a>  all come here, we're all mad, and we tell you how we feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2300.841s">A</a>  week and a half later, you guys will pretend to do your studies, we'll see a bunch of it, half of us won't even see it or understand it, because you know, it's just how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2311.045s">And</a>  everyone goes on their merry way like nothing happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2316.307s">The</a>  other superintendent, that was at your school, you were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2321.243s">How</a>  come another teacher came out instead of you to address us?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2326.846s">I</a>  was supporting and working with the police earlier in the day during the ongoing investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2332.909s">I</a>  did go out later in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2335.531s">So</a>  we knew that staff had gone out earlier to speak with parents.</p>

    <p>[Flynn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2340.913s">How</a>  come an email could have gone out saying, hey, we can't release names? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2343.735s">Understandable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2344.755s">It's</a>  a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2345.456s">I</a>  get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2346.596s">If</a>  you haven't heard from us, your child was uninvolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2350.165s">What's</a>  wrong with an email like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2352.005s">For</a>  parents to know, like, okay, I haven't heard, at least I know my child's not on his way to a hospital or on her way to a hospital or just lying somewhere in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2360.627s">And</a>  there's another school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2362.087s">There's</a>  another school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2363.047s">The</a>  Brooks isn't that far from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2364.388s">And</a>  that kid got out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2366.028s">What</a>  if he happened to go over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2367.168s">I</a>  mean, this world's going crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2370.509s">Look</a>  at the other elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2373.269s">How</a>  are we going to keep all of our kids safe?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2378.21s">I</a>  just want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2379.311s">I</a>  think it's, I'm really sorry about what happened to your daughter, and what continues to happen to your daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2384.214s">And</a>  I think coming up and offering solutions like an example of that is a really great <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2389.648s">example</a>  of things that we can do and that we can put into place I think you're right you know we should be able to send out a letter and say if your child is not involved in email or something on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2398.518s">If</a>  your child if you weren't contacted your child was not involved, I think that's completely reasonable and I think being able to have back and forth with folks like you who have had real experience on the ground is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2408.362s">And</a>  I wanna hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2409.222s">I</a>  haven't heard from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2409.822s">I</a>  would really like to hear from you, especially when you say your daughter's different and she's being bullied because she's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2414.624s">Nobody</a>  should be bullied and especially nobody should be bullied because they're different. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2417.685s">So</a>  however we can help, I do wanna talk and think about positive solutions that we can come up with together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2423.426s">So</a>  please reach out or leave me your, I'll take your phone, whatever, leave your number whenever. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2427.607s">And</a>  I'm really, really sorry about your daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2430.348s">And</a>  if there's anything I can do to help improve that, please really reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2434.229s">And</a>  I know my colleagues feel similarly.</p>

    <p>[Flynn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2438.274s">I</a>  have reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2439.294s">I</a>  reached out to you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2442.475s">Many</a>  times, my child's not only bullied at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2445.376s">I</a>  have the emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2446.236s">I'm</a>  not going to expose you all here, but I have reached out to you personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2450.378s">My</a>  kids, not even only in school, they're bullied. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2452.218s">They're</a>  bullied going up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2453.719s">They're</a>  not allowed to leave the house because of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2456.099s">You</a>  told me to find a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2457.94s">I</a>  went to Medford Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2458.92s">Medford</a>  Police sent me to several courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2460.561s">Some</a>  of them sent me to Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2462.801s">So</a>  as we say, we're going to do stuff that prevents it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2465.697s">All</a>  you do is send parents on a wild goose chase and walk kids in their room, so.</p>

    <p>[Gonzalez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2480.06s">Maria</a>  Gonzalez, graduating class of 1996. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2483.781s">And</a>  I state that because in 1991, there was a racial riot on December 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2489.022s">I</a>  was two months into my freshman year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2491.502s">A</a>  boy was stabbed by another boy at lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2495.393s">And</a>  to think after 30 years that this is still happening at Medford High School is really sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2501.758s">30</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2504.68s">That's</a>  all I can say.</p>

    <p>[Santiago]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2646.513s">Diana</a>  Santiago, Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2649.938s">It's</a>  very concerning everything that's been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2652.561s">And</a>  I hear a lot of the law, the law, the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2657.017s">And</a>  yes, there is a law, but sometimes laws have changed and evolved, and they've gone too far in one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2663.219s">And</a>  you're saying your back is against the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2665.82s">Well,</a>  this can be the element of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2669.681s">The</a>  laws need to change so that your back is not against the wall saying, I'm sorry, I can't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2675.382s">Kids</a>  are getting beaten. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2676.543s">Are</a>  we going to be here three months from now when someone's kid is dead? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2679.524s">Then</a>  will the law change? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2682.071s">Let's</a>  instead of being the legacy of Medford of violence for the last 30 years let's be Medford leading the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2689.177s">My</a>  sister is a fourth grade teacher in New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2691.699s">I</a>  have friends who are teaching in California. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2694.081s">It's</a>  the same systemic problem everywhere that's adopted this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2699.105s">My</a>  teacher, friends and my sister have been told, if a child is beating up another child, no matter how severely you can not touch them, or you will be fired. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2709.078s">That</a>  is the message that is getting delivered to the children, and the teachers in other school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2714.184s">I'm</a>  not saying it's Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2716.087s">I'm</a>  talking about the systemic problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2719.997s">We</a>  need to make sure that is not where our country is going and that's not where our town is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2724.838s">I'm</a>  asking you guys to do better, be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2727.219s">If</a>  law doesn't work, then get in Desi, get in whoever we need to, the governor, and change it for our town and for everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2739.342s">Because</a>  we have hundreds of victims at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2742.162s">There's</a>  the one that got beat, but there's all the other kids who are suffering the anguish of, am I next? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2749.747s">No</a>  one should have to move here and send their kids to school being like, oh, well, which one is gonna get pummeled next or seriously hurt? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2758.773s">This</a>  should be happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2760.694s">Let's</a>  do better, be better together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2764.116s">Don't</a>  just sit there and tell me I can't do anything because the law, then let's change it to make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2769.64s">Let's</a>  find who is succeeding in this country in having better programs for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2775.924s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2776.505s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Began]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2786.237s">Good</a>  evening, Sean Began, Lawrence Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2790.761s">I</a>  wanted to talk a little bit about messaging and perceptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2798.006s">And</a>  I think there's a problem with both the messaging and it's become a problem of perception. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2806.213s">Right</a>  now, there seems to be a perception amongst some of the students at the high school that the high school is an acceptable and maybe even the preferred place <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2816.499s">to</a>  settle your differences by having a fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2819.401s">And</a>  those fights are becoming more serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2821.083s">There's</a>  no doubt about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2823.044s">Uh,</a>  so how did we get to this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2826.887s">And</a>  I think that also goes to the messaging that's been coming in from adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2833.773s">And</a>  I'm not blaming teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2836.515s">I'm</a>  not blaming administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2837.976s">I'm</a>  not blaming politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2840.512s">I'm</a>  speaking in regards to adults in general, and that includes me as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2844.495s">It</a>  includes everyone who has a child in the school system, the messaging to these kids over the past two years, when they were dealing with COVID in regards to their education has been horrible and we've allowed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2859.947s">And</a>  I think we're reaping what we sowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2863.009s">This</a>  is some of the messaging that I've heard and that I've experienced and that I've been told about over the past couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2871.482s">Come</a>  to class or don't, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2873.783s">If</a>  you don't show up to class, there's no consequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2876.644s">Cheat</a>  your way through the school year, doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2880.246s">We</a>  know you're doing it, we're not gonna do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2884.228s">Talk</a>  back to your teacher, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2888.59s">In</a>  general, do whatever makes you feel good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2891.852s">And</a>  it's little wonder to me that when we reinforce bad behavior, it then becomes criminal behavior sooner or later. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2901.547s">And</a>  that's what we're dealing with today is criminal behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2904.97s">And</a>  if there's a perception, and I think it's a misperception, but there seems to be a perception amongst some students and some parents that there's no consequences for students that misbehave. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2921.782s">And</a>  I think this perception needs to be corrected immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2927.846s">If</a>  this perception is not corrected, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2931.064s">rather</a>  this misperception, then the perception becomes the reality, the fighting will continue, and it will continue to escalate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2942.67s">The</a>  school handbook, and I'm surprised, maybe I missed it, but I haven't heard this tonight from anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2951.074s">The</a>  school handbook very clearly states that fighting is a suspendable offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2956.337s">It</a>  states it right there, it's in black and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2964.309s">There's</a>  Massachusetts general laws that very clearly state that if a student brings a weapon onto campus, nevermind using the weapon, just brings the weapon, that's an expellable offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2976.715s">That's</a>  state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2978.716s">Now,</a>  these are also guidelines and state laws that Medford has adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2985.04s">These</a>  are things that apply to Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2987.781s">So</a>  we shouldn't have the misperception that they don't apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2992.657s">But</a>  I think we have a misperception that they're not enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2996.718s">And</a>  I think that also, again, is a misperception. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3002.0s">I'm</a>  going to assume, and I don't think it's a big assumption, I'm going to assume that the student that brought a knife onto campus today and used that knife in a fight is being expelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3015.124s">And</a>  if I'm wrong, I'd like someone to correct me now because that <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3021.007s">I</a>  think is a misperception that's going into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3024.349s">That</a>  student should be expelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3026.09s">I</a>  expect that student will be expelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3028.272s">Everyone</a>  in the community needs to know that that student is being expelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3033.055s">And</a>  we don't need to know the student's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3036.157s">But</a>  when we get an email like we did today from the high school that says that the procedures in the student handbook will be followed, all right, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3047.079s">I</a>  don't want to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3048.34s">Don't</a>  make me go hunt for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3049.9s">I</a>  mean, I'm an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3051.161s">I</a>  love to look up laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3052.321s">I</a>  research, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3053.922s">Most</a>  people don't want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3055.362s">You</a>  know, I spent an hour today doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3058.804s">You</a>  know, that's me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3060.285s">Most</a>  people don't have the time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3062.966s">Don't</a>  make them go look for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3065.007s">Let</a>  them know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3066.954s">If</a>  something like what happened today is going to happen, that child will no longer be in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3072.597s">End</a>  of story. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3074.058s">You</a>  don't have to worry about that child coming back to school because that's the worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3079.001s">And</a>  that's the worry of the kids too, that these, that the children that are misbehaving, that have been allowed to get this, be emboldened to, to the extent that they think nothing is going to happen to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3091.969s">That</a>  has to change very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3094.887s">If</a>  it requires expelling 10 kids, expel 10 kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3098.529s">If</a>  it requires expelling 50 kids, expel 50 kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3102.492s">Do</a>  it quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3103.613s">Make</a>  the change now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3105.654s">And</a>  please, please, I would love to see a little emotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3112.819s">Get</a>  angry about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3114.7s">Someone</a>  on this committee, get angry about what's happened today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3117.662s">Let</a>  us hear that you're pissed off. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3122.205s">Okay,</a>  don't sit on your hands tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3125.296s">I</a>  know everyone's worried about public meeting law and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3130.56s">Don't</a>  worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3131.581s">No</a>  one's reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3132.401s">You</a>  get a little angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3134.043s">Let</a>  us hear what's going to happen and don't be so coy in the

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3150.831s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3152.052s">I,</a>  this is a question I don't know if our attorney can answer the question or the superintendent knows the answer but I do not believe we can legally tell anybody what the consequences of a disciplinary action were, even if we are not talking about a student by name. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3166.583s">Nobody</a>  in Medford knows who the student is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3168.505s">I'm</a>  assuming somebody knows who the student is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3170.527s">I</a>  also assume somebody knows who the victim was. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3173.089s">So,</a>  you know, it'd be like talking about, well, the president, we won't mention his name, is in trouble and this is the consequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3180.355s">So</a>  the school committee also does not receive any notification and cannot have access to information about the consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3188.622s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3190.345s">That's</a>  just a fact, whether or not the superintendent can tell the community that expulsion will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3195.308s">I</a>  don't know the answer to that question but I do know that we cannot receive notification that a student will be expelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3203.352s">I</a>  can read the law as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3204.872s">If</a>  there was a murder, I think it's fairly safe to say that most of us would conclude an expulsion was on its way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3214.015s">You</a>  know, but, but we will not receive that notification, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3219.181s">And</a>  so I just think it's important when asking these questions to, to be clear who you're asking, because you won't get the answer from the seven school committee members, what the answer is, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3234.318s">We</a>  do not write the law, you all get to change the law by going to your state reps, we write resolutions all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3241.246s">We</a>  are always calling our state reps and state senators and saying, we don't like this law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3246.231s">We</a>  want this law change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3247.933s">We</a>  have one on the thing tonight, exactly that I have the floor, so you can wait Mr beacon. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3253.899s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Began]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3255.43s">I'll</a>  wait patiently.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3256.35s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Began]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3256.931s">But</a>  I want to be heard.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3258.231s">I've</a>  heard people say they want to change the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3260.512s">There</a>  are so many laws I want to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3262.593s">And</a>  I think many of us have very specific laws in common with all of you that we want to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3268.676s">But</a>  we don't write those laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3270.537s">We</a>  call our state reps most many of us know our state reps and state senators, and we give them our opinion very often. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3278.775s">Okay,</a>  but we don't like the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3281.379s">So,</a>  you have a choice, we can break the laws, which I know that some people are quite comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3288.408s">And</a>  therefore, if we break the laws, if we break the laws, then the people that we broke the laws, you know if we just sit up here and we somehow know the information about somebody who's accused of something, and we disclose it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3301.924s">Well,</a>  that make make us all feel good until we have to write the check as a city for violating the law, so we are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3310.39s">None</a>  of us are afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3311.57s">We</a>  are also not going to get that information to share it with you because we're not going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3315.752s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3315.972s">Mr.</a>  Beacon is going to tell me how I'm wrong now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3317.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3318.053s">No,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Began]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3325.155s">Madam</a>  chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3329.797s">I</a>  can't believe that I just asked this body to not be coy and be more direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3338.64s">And</a>  what I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3339.721s">And</a>  what I heard was five minutes of being coy and not being direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3345.784s">This</a>  is a very simple matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3347.825s">It's</a>  a simple matter of messaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3350.286s">Let's</a>  not get into the weeds about what the law is or isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3355.569s">It's</a>  a simple matter of messaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3357.99s">A</a>  kid brought a knife to school today and stabbed someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3362.873s">That's</a>  what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3364.293s">That</a>  person is going to be expelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3368.507s">If</a>  that person is not expelled from school, we have a serious problem because the law allows and calls for an expulsion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3377.909s">End</a>  of story. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3379.509s">I</a>  don't need to know who the kid is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3382.01s">I</a>  don't need to know what the ultimate punishment was because in my mind, if it's not an expulsion and I find out that kid is back in school, I'm going to be back here and I'm going to be livid. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3396.277s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3396.737s">And</a>  everyone behind me is going to be livid. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3399.098s">And</a>  this is what I'm talking about when I'm talking about messaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3402.519s">Be</a>  straight with the people in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3405.76s">It's</a>  very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3407.901s">Just</a>  be straight with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3410.121s">This</a>  is what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3411.982s">If</a>  X happens, Y will be the result. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3414.983s">It's</a>  very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3416.583s">Let's</a>  stop, please, with the coyness, the smugness, the lectures. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3422.685s">Enough.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3432.349s">I</a>  appreciate that an attorney, I'm assuming who is a member of the bar doesn't think that the law matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3442.759s">The</a>  law actually, if I could speak, the law does not actually include the school committee and discipline. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3448.462s">The</a>  principals have all authority on suspensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3451.683s">In</a>  fact, students can't even appeal it to the superintendent unless it's more than 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3458.426s">So,</a>  you know, if you wanna come and ask us to do stuff we can't do, and that makes you feel good, then you should do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3464.929s">But</a>  if you want something to happen, then we do have to pay attention to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3472.432s">You</a>  know, my daughter was also in that school texting me and I was very upset too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3477.813s">I'm</a>  not just like some rando. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3480.734s">Okay,</a>  I know how you felt. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3483.155s">I</a>  know how you felt. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3484.595s">My</a>  daughter was texting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3486.556s">Point</a>  of order.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3488.096s">Hi,</a>  my name is Ashley. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3491.037s">Point</a>  of order, member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3493.678s">I</a>  just wanted to ask if I might speak in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3497.099s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3497.639s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3499.399s">I</a>  just, thank you, Mr. Began. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3502.073s">for</a>  your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3503.054s">I</a>  think that there's a little bit of misinformation in that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3506.997s">And</a>  I'm sorry that people feel that we're being corny, but I do have to say that there are very strict laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3512.542s">However,</a>  that said, in terms of FERPA and other things, I know people don't wanna hear it, but it is the fact, like it really is, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3519.427s">Number</a>  two, we should care about all of our kids, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3522.449s">We</a>  really should care about all of our kids and we really should. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3525.432s">And</a>  I don't know the circumstances of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3527.073s">I</a>  know what I'm hearing from other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3528.514s">I</a>  know what the bit that I've heard <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3530.456s">Um,</a>  from, from administration or what have you, but I don't know the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3533.859s">I</a>  don't even entirely know the details from the previous event because of some of the things that I am not literally allowed to know because of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3541.264s">Now</a>  you guys do because, or I assume many do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3544.707s">If</a>  you have children in the high school, your children can come home and tell you who that child was. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3548.79s">Maybe</a>  if you have kids in elementary school that you don't, it gets to the grapevine. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3552.172s">People</a>  start talking in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3553.473s">It</a>  was this kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3554.034s">It</a>  was that kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3554.834s">That's</a>  how people know who that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3556.075s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3556.816s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3557.574s">You</a>  know, as a, as an individual, we can't say that, but I do want to say like going back to the bullying law, when we're talking about laws being changed, laws being changed, like the bullying law in Massachusetts, do people know how that law was created? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3568.099s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3569.06s">Phoebe,</a>  right from Western Massachusetts, the girl that was bullied to death, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3573.382s">That</a>  was the law that happened here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3575.043s">We</a>  don't, none of us want to see this happen with our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3577.604s">None</a>  of us want to see a Parkland. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3579.825s">or</a>  Newtown or any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3582.108s">This</a>  is horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3583.009s">We</a>  know this is horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3584.431s">I'm</a>  losing sleep over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3585.572s">I'm</a>  sure you guys are losing sleep over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3587.474s">It's</a>  my kids too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3588.315s">It's</a>  your kids too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3589.476s">We</a>  all really care. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3590.438s">I</a>  know people are groaning because it's like drone on, drone on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3592.9s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3593.421s">I</a>  care too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3594.402s">I</a>  really, really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3596.384s">And</a>  what are we going to do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3599.505s">People</a>  are coming up here saying change the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3601.486s">How</a>  do you change the law? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3602.787s">Do</a>  you guys know how you do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3605.568s">Same</a>  thing, I've been advocating for years for laws to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3608.569s">I</a>  go to the State House, I protest, I do hearings, I give my story, I do all kinds of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3613.07s">I</a>  don't just get to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3614.591s">Change</a>  the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3615.391s">I</a>  wish I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3616.792s">We</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3617.932s">But</a>  we can, as a community, get together and make a friggin' difference and change our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3622.833s">Like,</a>  we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3624.334s">So</a>  we have to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3625.614s">We</a>  can't fight with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3628.075s">Follow</a>  the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3628.895s">If</a>  it says, okay, if it says, if the handbook says. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3632.216s">okay</a>  if a handbook says there's a weapon and if the handbook says there's a weapon and weapons result in expulsion if that's what the handbook says then that I assume is going to be what is going to be happening because that is what the handbook says but if there's a legal issue that we don't know about because maybe there's some presumption of innocence for something not this case I don't know I'm talking about any cases we don't know all the details nor do you so we can't just automatically and arbitrarily say this is what should happen with that kid and that's what should happen with this kid that's not how it works <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3662.117s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3663.158s">I</a>  can sit here and argue with you guys all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3664.858s">You</a>  don't want to hear it because you're angry, and I don't blame you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3667.62s">Yeah,</a>  blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3669.14s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3669.46s">I</a>  don't blame you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3670.521s">When</a>  your kid is in danger, you feel your kid is threatened, I would be the exact same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3674.863s">I</a>  have been the exact same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3676.704s">We</a>  should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3677.564s">But</a>  how do we turn this negativity into community and frigging collaborate? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3682.106s">Oh,</a>  just follow the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3683.387s">That's</a>  all we have to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3684.827s">No,</a>  that's not all we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3686.008s">That's</a>  not going to change at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3687.649s">No,</a>  it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3688.769s">I</a>  disagree, but I'm happy to work with anybody that does want to make positive change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3692.673s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3693.154s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Gabrielle Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3711.866s">I</a>  spoke about a year ago voicing the same concerns I'm going to talk about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3717.958s">I</a>  was one of the first students appointed to student advisory board and I'm senior class president. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3723.59s">And</a>  I've understood the patterns in the city and I know that most of my concerns will either be ignored, swept under a rug or misunderstood, but I'm gonna try and get through to you for the sake of my classmates and for those who aren't lucky enough to graduate this year with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3737.978s">The</a>  only things I want to be worrying about during my senior year are upcoming deadlines and tests, but the reoccurring violence at my school is not only horrifying, but leaves me left to wonder what's to happen to me each day as I walk through the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3751.966s">Will</a>  I be body slammed into cold floor tiles, or will I be repeatedly stabbed with a knife? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3758.408s">Will</a>  I be sent to the hospital with life-threatening injuries? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3762.829s">If</a>  the student safety is so important to this entire committee, then why are we only hearing from two members? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3769.151s">Jobs</a>  are not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3770.431s">Just</a>  because it's not your child does not mean it's any less important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3774.54s">I'm</a>  tired of my parents worrying about me each morning when I say goodbye to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3778.901s">I'm</a>  tired of being educated in an environment where I have to fear for my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3782.582s">I'm</a>  tired of these incidents not having solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3785.123s">And</a>  most of all, I'm tired of having to share my concerns to a group who does not implement change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3790.604s">Political</a>  agendas and fall promises do not save student lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3794.585s">Ignoring</a>  the issue is one step closer to a student losing their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3798.226s">And</a>  at this rate, none of us would honestly be surprised, please, for the sake of the students in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3804.744s">Please</a>  find a way to ease our anxiety and propose ideas to improve this broken system. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3809.487s">This</a>  is what you were elected to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3811.029s">And</a>  right now it's unfortunate that you're failing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3814.371s">I</a>  think you'd all rather listen to our concerns than attend our funeral. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3817.813s">Please</a>  expel all the students involved in the incident today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3820.856s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Barr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3829.692s">Hi,</a>  my name is Ashlyn Barr, 50 Brooks Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3833.155s">I</a>  was gonna say something about changing the laws, and I understand that it's not just snap your fingers, change the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3838.379s">There's</a>  a lot that goes into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3840.2s">I</a>  think what's really important is to have a better communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3843.443s">The</a>  communication, just for a small piece for today's incident, was terrible, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3848.747s">It</a>  was on three different platforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3851.949s">It</a>  wasn't good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3853.451s">I</a>  mean, the communication at the high school is to the point where if I even try to call my kid out sick, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3859.235s">The</a>  phone system doesn't even work so we're starting from the but we need to start from the bottom up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3863.859s">But</a>  aside from all of that, and communication from your representatives you were voted to be our representatives you work for us, we need communication from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3872.366s">I</a>  don't know how to change laws, I'm an average citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3875.309s">This</a>  is the first time I've ever come to a school committee meeting, because I'm enraged with what's going on in my kids high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3882.034s">Our</a>  children feel like we're not going to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3885.398s">We</a>  heard it from four students today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3887.38s">We</a>  heard it from the president of the class and I heard it from my sophomore and his best friend today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3891.926s">Shame</a>  on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3894.529s">Our</a>  children should not feel like we're not going to do anything and that none of this is going to elicit change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3900.489s">They</a>  should be going to school to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3902.471s">Teachers</a>  should not be using bathroom monitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3905.134s">Teachers</a>  went to school to teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3906.555s">They</a>  didn't teach to go to school to be security officers and break up fights. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3910.86s">It</a>  shouldn't come with the territory. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3913.191s">Maybe</a>  I'm thinking in La La Land, but it's not the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3916.895s">Our</a>  kids need to be able to feel safe in school and learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3920.758s">You</a>  heard it from the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3922.34s">I</a>  want you to do a forum with leadership for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3928.286s">And</a>  so you can hear them talk and hear directly from them that they don't feel supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3933.991s">and</a>  that they feel that nothing's going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3936.692s">I'll</a>  show up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3938.073s">We</a>  should all show up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3939.573s">Teachers</a>  should show up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3941.194s">Teachers</a>  need to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3943.094s">We're</a>  going to lose teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3944.215s">We're</a>  going to lose students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3946.336s">I</a>  have an eighth grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3947.196s">I</a>  don't think I'm sending him to Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3950.492s">Okay,</a>  that's a huge financial burden for my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3953.593s">I</a>  don't wanna have to make that decision, but it's pretty much looking that way right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3957.914s">So</a>  we have a lot of work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3960.294s">I'm</a>  here to listen to advice from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3962.895s">I</a>  don't know how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3964.795s">We</a>  need better communication, but this like constant fighting thing isn't gonna solve any problems at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3970.756s">Please,</a>  as a community, we need better communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3974.537s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3975.117s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3975.537s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3977.018s">Jessica,</a>  Jessica.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4122.072s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, Dr. Maurice, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4127.655s">First,</a>  I want to say, well first, I'm Steven South. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4131.237s">I</a>  live at 106 Damon Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4132.878s">I'm</a>  also the secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4137.901s">We</a>  represent all the school custodians, the security personnel, the assistant principals, directors, and school administrators, coordinators. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4150.1s">First,</a>  I want to talk about a couple of weeks ago, the school committee approved a $50,000 study to look into, I guess, all the violence going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4163.126s">But</a>  first, I wanna provide you all with some facts and some free advice that doesn't cost 50,000 because I'm there every week, my members are there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4171.957s">Well,</a>  let me talk about the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4174.961s">Fact</a>  number one is years ago there were more than a dozen security guards in the Medford public schools, the last of which retired in March of this year, Bill Mosaic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4186.948s">I</a>  was informed shortly after he retired that they were no longer going to have security guards at Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4193.873s">This</a>  was by the administration that they were no longer needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4197.736s">So</a>  my recommendation is that you use the 50,000 and hire another security guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4203.06s">And</a>  then I've also talked to city counselors who I believe there's several in the crowd that would be more than willing to provide extra funding for security guards. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4215.148s">So</a>  that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4216.724s">Number</a>  two, and we're talking about the decline in security. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4220.267s">This</a>  is all in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4223.93s">Previous</a>  to this school year, there was always a security monitor at the back door of Medford High School <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4232.093s">from</a>  2.15 when school ended until 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4235.556s">when</a>  the last school event ended at that back door. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4238.538s">And</a>  it's called door 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4240.04s">It's</a>  where the pool and the gyms are. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4242.422s">There</a>  was always a security person there every single day, seven days a week, signing people in, checking IDs, signing people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4251.449s">And</a>  I know it's expensive, you have to pay personnel, but that's to make sure that this, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4259.201s">School</a>  administration knows every single human being that's in that school after the school day ends and be able to monitor who's visiting the school's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4271.107s">Well,</a>  last year that was ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4273.589s">We</a>  were told it was too expensive and it was no longer needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4276.972s">Now</a>  at 2.15 every day, my members, your employees are instructed to unlock the back door and it's unlocked from 2.15 till 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4288.922s">every</a>  day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4289.903s">And</a>  by the way, I was here a few months ago reporting on the same thing and nothing was done about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4294.967s">I</a>  believe that was right before the summer began I was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4300.251s">spoke</a>  on this same exact thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4302.673s">So</a>  also on the weekends, we used to have someone there from 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4306.898s">to</a>  9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4308.099s">at</a>  the back door, signing people in, checking IDs, signing people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4313.004s">So</a>  this administration knew every single human being that was in Medford High School when it was not in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4319.93s">And</a>  I'm talking outside of the children that go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4324.013s">So</a>  that goes on no longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4326.054s">People</a>  can walk in, they can hide weapons or drugs or anything else they want to, they can have their run of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4333.399s">Okay,</a>  that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4335.501s">Someone</a>  earlier, I can't remember who said we have two school resource officers, that's not true unless that just started, that is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4343.026s">And</a>  as a matter of fact, in the last two years, there was about a year and three month period where there was zero school resource officers because the school resource officer was out injured <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4354.113s">And</a>  when the police asked the administration if they wanted to have someone fill in, the answer was no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4359.995s">So</a>  you went over a year without a school resource officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4363.617s">And</a>  I would challenge anyone here to try to refute that because again, I represent everybody at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4370.539s">That's</a>  another fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4371.5s">So</a>  I also recommend that you have school resource officers that are permanent and that when they're out injured or on vacation or sick, because everyone <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4380.763s">deserves</a>  time off, that they need to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4383.144s">There</a>  needs to be a police presence in Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4388.005s">Also,</a>  I met with the administration earlier this year with a list of security concerns and I gave it to them in writing, you have it, none of which was addressed, not one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4399.628s">And</a>  one of the things on my list was to have metal detectors because my union, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4407.441s">My</a>  union and my members are aware that there are knives and guns in Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4413.945s">And</a>  that is dismissed as hearsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4419.548s">It's</a>  a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4420.228s">Today,</a>  let everyone know it's a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4421.969s">I've</a>  been saying it for the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4424.711s">And</a>  there's been multiple other things that have happened that we all know that there's knives and guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4430.233s">There's</a>  also drugs within Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4432.894s">And</a>  I would ask all of you, and you probably can't name names or confirm, but I was also told by one of my members that there was an overdose at Medford High School today, the same day that there was a stabbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4444.178s">So</a>  I would also ask that you put <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4449.727s">metal</a>  detectors at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4451.948s">Other</a>  schools have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4453.829s">I've</a>  been told by administration officials that it's not appropriate, but it is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4459.712s">Now,</a>  the school security guards and the resource officers previously would monitor the hallways during class time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4469.096s">And</a>  as I heard a few speakers, I wanna confirm again, I'm here just to talk about facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4474.83s">that</a>  every single day, there's hundreds of kids throughout the hallways during class time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4480.654s">They're</a>  running rampant. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4481.715s">It's</a>  like the Wild West at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4484.697s">And</a>  I don't know who to blame, but there's no one to monitor them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4489.0s">There's</a>  someone at the front desk that's checking people in during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4494.545s">But</a>  they can't leave the desk uncovered to go walk the halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4499.269s">So</a>  there's no security guards. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4501.271s">And</a>  I'm told there's a resource officer, but how much ground can one person cover? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4507.676s">Now,</a>  when my members do see kids in bathrooms or in the hall and tell them to go back to class, they're often told, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4515.703s">to</a>  go F themselves or to F off. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4517.905s">And</a>  there's no discipline. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4519.126s">We</a>  all know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4520.167s">And</a>  this is a radical change in the last few years within the Medford school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4525.472s">This</a>  is radical. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4526.212s">I've</a>  watched it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4526.813s">I've</a>  represented the school system, represented the workers in the school system since 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4533.976s">So</a>  I've watched the decline of security here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4537.117s">So</a>  we need to have somebody monitoring the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4541.017s">And</a>  if somebody does something egregious, I'll tell you, every single week, my members have to paint the bathroom, paint the walls or the stalls in the bathroom, because there's graffiti written on the walls, including swastikas and other racial epithets that are on the walls, and they're just told paint over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4561.681s">That</a>  never hits the news, that never hits the school committee, that never hits, the parents are never told about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4568.366s">But</a>  all I'm saying is, and I'm not casting blame on any one person, I heard that earlier someone say we can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4576.832s">But</a>  that's, I don't believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4579.514s">We</a>  will do better because this community is not going to accept what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4585.459s">More</a>  funding needs to be put forth to security. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4588.441s">I</a>  can tell you right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4590.262s">Because</a>  of the low pay, a lot of the security monitors quit over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4596.364s">I</a>  believe there were four that quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4598.205s">So</a>  you hired all brand new people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4599.706s">So</a>  they've been there since September, September, October, November, December, four months, zero training. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4605.808s">The</a>  new security employees are provided with zero training, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4611.45s">Where</a>  other school systems that we represent <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4615.185s">receive</a>  extensive training. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4617.027s">Why</a>  is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4618.308s">So</a>  this is a perfect storm for a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4622.212s">I</a>  ask you all, do your part. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4625.796s">The</a>  city council is very well willing, from what I've talked to today, are very well willing to provide additional funding if requested to the school for security. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4638.993s">I'm</a>  not asking you that maybe it should happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4641.214s">It</a>  has to happen, because this is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4644.435s">The</a>  community won't accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4646.416s">I</a>  won't accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4647.357s">Your</a>  employees and my members won't accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4649.978s">I</a>  thank you all for your kind attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4651.859s">We</a>  will do better.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4652.939s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4658.142s">Mr.</a>  Murphy, Captain Covino, I don't know if you want to address anything before I call on our next speaker.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4668.592s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4671.214s">Just</a>  very, very brief response and very similar and consistent to what I responded with when Mr. South spoke at the previous meeting that he referred to in his presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4685.842s">It</a>  is very dangerous to get into the specifics of security protocols in a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4695.017s">I</a>  didn't do it the last time this conversation was broached, and we're not going to do it this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4702.079s">I</a>  want to say that the security monitor staff that Mr. South represents, as well as many other staff members, teachers, nurses, first and foremost, responded to today's situation <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4721.465s">with</a>  a tremendous amount of skill and responsiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4725.426s">And</a>  I know that the entire administration is grateful to those individuals for their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4732.867s">We</a>  as a school district have more security personnel than most comparable districts of our size. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4740.489s">It</a>  is true, as Mr. South said, that as the needs of the district have evolved over a decades-long period of time, there are <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4749.781s">individuals</a>  classified into different positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4752.542s">But</a>  there is one security monitor assigned to each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4756.222s">And</a>  for the high school, when fully staffed, we have over five. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4761.684s">There</a>  has been fluidity, as Mr. South alluded to, in those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4766.705s">And</a>  again, in a context in which we have more staff members than frankly any district I know of our size, holding positions of that nature, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4777.742s">um,</a>  to some extent that is inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4780.444s">Um,</a>  but they have at times been, uh, critical investment today certainly is that is at the top of that list and we're grateful to them for their service with respect to some of the specific protocols that Mr South referenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4794.733s">Um,</a>  some of that information is accurate but incomplete. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4798.916s">The</a>  school district prior to my tenure implemented a series of infrastructure upgrades <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4803.629s">that</a>  essentially cordon off a large section of the building that is primarily used for athletics and extracurricular activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4810.536s">And</a>  for that reason, there are different personnel needs that come with some of those infrastructure upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4815.841s">That</a>  being said, as I believe that Mr. South knows, but I'm certainly not <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4821.477s">I</a>  could be wrong about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4822.418s">So</a>  I'm not suggesting he's making any intentional misrepresentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4826.46s">When</a>  we hired over the summer for the specific security monitor position that he referenced, it was determined that in order to have a higher level of staffing during the day, the personnel initially retained to hold the afternoon position was moved to the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4842.89s">And</a>  we have continued to attempt to fill out the remainder of those positions so that even with the infrastructure updates that again, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4850.715s">cordoned</a>  off a section of the building so that no one can have access to the remainder of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4855.098s">We</a>  would like to have additional personnel and we're going to continue to try to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4859.221s">Finally,</a>  and then I'll see the photo captain Gabino. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4862.263s">Um,</a>  the suggestion that there is, it is a known fact that there are firearms in Medford High School is inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4870.868s">And</a>  just make that suggestion publicly is extraordinarily dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4876.472s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4877.95s">The</a>  comments tonight are very well taken and they're certainly heartfelt. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4883.734s">And</a>  as I think the mayor said earlier, and certainly members here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4888.517s">Every</a>  single one of us who do this for a living and work in a school environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4893.761s">We</a>  never want to be in a situation in which a single student <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4897.375s">or</a>  a single family member feels as though the school environment is anything other than safe and secure and conducive to learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4906.399s">And</a>  to the extent that that's not the case right now, we have a responsibility to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4911.141s">We</a>  have a responsibility to do that urgently. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4913.542s">But</a>  we're not going to get to that point if we are spreading misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4919.585s">and</a>  some of that information with respect to specific security threats is inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4925.528s">And</a>  the people of Medford need to understand both that it is inaccurate and that we are going to continue to prioritize the safety and security of Medford High School and every other school in the district captain.</p>

    <p>[Covino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4939.196s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4939.897s">Uh,</a>  in regards to firearms and any other type of weapons, we have not had a situation <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4946.15s">Um,</a>  that I can remember where we had to deal with firearms in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4949.932s">Our</a>  information doesn't always come just from the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4952.674s">Oftentimes</a>  we get calls from parents, uh, concerned, uh, family members of pictures of kids posing on social media with, with, uh, firearms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4962.26s">We've</a>  always investigated them 99.9% of the times they were toy guns and they were just trying to look cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4968.823s">The</a>  other, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4970.163s">small</a>  time, well actually it was once, it was a person who did pose, he was at a range actually in another country with a licensed firearms expert that he was shooting with to learn how to shoot and he was just taking a picture of him posing holding a rifle. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4986.953s">So</a>  there has not been a situation where we've been confirmed firearms in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4994.718s">There</a>  have been times when there were allegations <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=4996.792s">We</a>  took actions with ballistic dogs and we did have on some occasions portable metal detectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5005.696s">Metal</a>  detectors have not proven to be a great diversion to crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5010.358s">There</a>  are other things we can do from the bottom up with small things and small rules and keeping people in check that are probably more effective right now for what we're looking at than worrying about setting up metal detectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5025.166s">metal</a>  detectors are going to bring your kids an hour and a half early to get them into school because it's going to be a thorough search, not just of them walking through. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5033.673s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5035.015s">And</a>  they also carry bags and backpacks that have to be checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5038.237s">So</a>  there are other things that can be done amongst the school itself that would be more effective and keep it safe.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5045.643s">And</a>  the chief of police can maybe just reassure <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5049.225s">everybody</a>  in the audience, every listen from home, the school committee, that there is a safety plan that was updated and some actions that you've been taking with our administration, what you can share. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5058.928s">I</a>  know it's not all public, but.</p>

    <p>[Ivens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5061.728s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5062.769s">We</a>  often don't want to talk about a lot of the safety plans in general, but I can tell you that we have been working with the administration recently and want to develop a long-term safety plan with the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5071.871s">It's</a>  an ongoing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5073.431s">It's</a>  been, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5077.691s">fairly</a>  in depth at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5081.254s">So</a>  that will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5083.295s">And</a>  so will the support of the Metro Police Department to not only the administration, the school committee, but to the parents and the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5091.341s">One</a>  thing I am thoroughly impressed with this evening is the students who came out here and spoke on behalf of their emotions and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5100.407s">I</a>  will add this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5102.429s">Many</a>  of the students today we heard from and spoke to seem to have heard things and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5108.164s">We</a>  talk about isolated incidents, and that can be defined in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5113.308s">But</a>  there's some evidence that what we're looking at today was somewhat of a planned event, when two individuals decide that they want to fight or they want to get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5121.195s">Most</a>  of the time, that information is not isolated, and other kids know about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5125.438s">So</a>  we ask that if you want to help your schools, if you want to be safe, if you want to be part of a solution, to kind of let us know as a police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5135.58s">you</a>  know, we're restricted in a lot of ways what we could do as a police department, but we can certainly get involved in anything that involves the dangers of students and we will be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5143.53s">So</a>  we continue to offer that support and we'll continue to update on the security plans for the city.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5150.233s">Mayor,</a>  if I could just one very quick final comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5153.056s">Again,</a>  the messages that are being articulated tonight, and the genuine frustration and anger that is that is being expressed, is, is more than understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5165.727s">And</a>  there's no one within the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5167.229s">And</a>  I know no one on the school committee, who fails to recognize that and to understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5173.554s">But</a>  as <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5175.069s">This</a>  evening continues, and as additional comments are made, I implore those participating in public comment to refrain from discussing specific protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5185.972s">It</a>  may be understood as to why you want to do that, and certainly the anger that is being felt tonight is understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5192.533s">But</a>  getting into the specifics of our safety and security protocols will not make anyone safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5198.715s">And</a>  so I would just ask that to be kept in mind, and I would ask the mayor, you as chair, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5204.943s">Yep,</a>  make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5206.324s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5207.225s">Name</a>  and address the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5208.106s">Then</a>  we're going to go to Tony tanks.</p>

    <p>[Guion]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5212.19s">My</a>  name is Anthony Guion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5213.471s">I</a>  live at 45 Elm Hill Ave in Levenster, MA and I teach at Method High School in the C2 wing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5220.444s">I</a>  want to talk on two different levels today, and I want to start as a teacher in that C2 wing, and I want to stand up for my fellow educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5231.351s">I</a>  understand there are images today of teachers looking out the window seeming lackadaisical. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5238.087s">And</a>  as someone who was lucky enough not to currently be in charge of 30 students at the time of the lockdown, I had a prep, someone who was able to go around and check if people need to use the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5249.635s">I</a>  wanna say that every teacher who is watching between 15 and 30 students was trying to keep them from panicking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5258.401s">They</a>  were trying to keep them calm. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5259.862s">They</a>  were trying to find ways to get them to the facilities in an unknown situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5264.701s">We</a>  had very little understanding of what was happening, and we made the best of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5269.326s">So</a>  I would be reticent if I did not stand up for my fellow educators in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5273.83s">Those</a>  images do not tell what I saw my colleagues doing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5281.217s">The</a>  other way I have to speak is as a union representative of the MTA, and I get the <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5287.554s">privilege,</a>  I understand, to announce that we held a vote today for this contract negotiation that has been going on for two years in a very public way, and we are happy to say that it ratified today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5303.223s">But</a>  now I should be after two years and before that in the COVID reopening negotiations, I should be home right now celebrating my son and my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5312.107s">But</a>  I want to come here as union rep to say this, things need to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5317.189s">We</a>  know things need to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5318.77s">And</a>  we know things have been very, very tense between the teachers, the administration, the school committee, public displays have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5327.967s">When</a>  it comes to the safety of our students, we must treat this day one, year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5332.069s">The</a>  teachers need a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5333.009s">They</a>  are the feet on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5334.47s">They</a>  are the first to talk to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5336.691s">They</a>  know the ins and outs of that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5338.792s">And</a>  we need representation at any meeting where new protocols are spoken of. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5344.274s">That</a>  is what I'd like to say today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5345.735s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5346.475s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5346.755s">Thank</a>  you, Anthony. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5352.938s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5353.118s">Douglas,</a>  and then we're going to Tony Tanks.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6330.273s">Miss</a>  North, there is some misinformation and many people have said it already this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6337.735s">The</a>  previous incident that took place in October, the students were not in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6343.277s">That</a>  is completely false. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6346.538s">It</a>  is not a true statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6347.758s">They</a>  have not been in school since that event took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6351.699s">So</a>  when we made the comments that we're not talking about students in public, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6359.081s">or</a>  student information, those students are not in school, and they have not been in school since the date of the incident.</p>

    <p>[Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6390.025s">Okay,</a>  because there were four, so how I'm taking it is that there was a worry to have these people here for safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6396.37s">Let's</a>  use that same thought process, even if we weren't thinking it, for the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6400.794s">I</a>  have no children at Medford High anymore, but I think you owe it to everybody that's spoken, especially the girl that just spoke, to put more people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6409.681s">Just</a>  do it, and then worry about everything after. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6412.344s">Put</a>  more people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6413.464s">There's</a>  how many people in here? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6415.046s">There's</a>  four police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6417.623s">Do</a>  the same for the high school, like tomorrow, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6421.606s">Thank</a>  you, just do it.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6693.133s">We</a>  are disciplining, but we obviously- No, you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6695.995s">Yes,</a>  we are suspending students for fights. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6699.658s">We</a>  have work to do, but we are suspending students for fights. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6702.82s">Yes,</a>  we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6703.24s">Gail?</a> </p>

    <p>[Airasian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6713.191s">Yeah,</a>  hi, thanks for letting me just really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6716.412s">I</a>  just want to recognize that I know this is a really hard problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6719.353s">I</a>  think there are plenty of parents who are on this call who are parents of Medford kids somewhere in the district who recognize that there is not an easy solution to this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6731.836s">We</a>  want to be part of the solution and we want to help you find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6735.769s">We</a>  want to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6736.63s">We</a>  want to retain our teachers because this is going to be an issue with teacher retention. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6741.593s">But</a>  we're here and we want to help solve the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6743.914s">So</a>  let's communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6744.814s">Let's</a>  keep those lines of communication open, like Melanie mentioned, and let's work to find solutions that will help our kids get educated and our best teachers and really help improve our school district overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6758.022s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6759.823s">Thank</a>  you, Gail.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6763.726s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6765.538s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6767.098s">I</a>  just wanted to thank everyone who spoke tonight, especially the students who came up to tell us about their experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6776.581s">You</a>  know, a couple of things are clear to me from the comments and reinforce the conversations that we've been having. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6784.458s">as</a>  a community for quite a while now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6787.162s">So</a>  first is that there's a lot of really wonderful things happening in Medford and specifically in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6796.334s">We</a>  heard today lots of thanks for the teachers who <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6802.027s">had</a>  a really difficult job to do today as they were the adults in the room and they acted with professionalism and grit and fortitude at what was a very, very hard day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6819.6s">So</a>  my sincere thanks to all the teachers who are listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6825.484s">But</a>  I think the other thing that's really clear is that there are a number of things that we're getting very wrong as a system. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6835.39s">And</a>  what we're hearing from students that is perhaps the most concerning for me is that from their vantage point, nothing has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6846.976s">I</a>  know <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6848.191s">that</a>  there is a lot going on behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6852.313s">I</a>  know that there is a lot of activity in process and in progress to enact change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6861.496s">I</a>  know that change is sometimes painfully slow and hard, but I think what we have to really grapple with is striking some balance between <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6877.29s">improving</a>  our communications in a truly systemic way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6880.391s">Our</a>  parents feel unsupported, our students feel unsupported. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6889.055s">As</a>  a community, we've really never gotten crisis response right in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6898.9s">And</a>  I will never forget the night I sat in the auditorium for five hours, and at that time, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6906.056s">I</a>  sat there and I just kept wondering, where is our crisis response team? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6912.819s">Are</a>  they equipped to do this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6917.141s">And</a>  I have those same questions today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6918.642s">I</a>  would like to, so I think the technicalities of hearing all of you tonight, we all wanted to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6931.608s">We</a>  felt very unanimous about that, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6935.641s">Um,</a>  but I do think we also have a responsibility to make sure that we are upholding, um, our requirements under the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6943.447s">And</a>  so I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6945.309s">What</a>  you're probably not going to hear from us tonight is, um, a particular action that we're instructing anybody to take, because that is where we sort of like dip over that line, um, and, and cause, um, question cause anything we might do to come into question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6964.024s">But</a>  what I would like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6966.152s">is</a>  make a motion that before the return to school in January, we will hold a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6974.476s">We</a>  will hold an executive session where the school committee will be fully briefed on safety and security protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6981.679s">And</a>  then we will hold a public meeting that will describe for parents what the <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=6989.356s">student</a>  accountability processes, what the responsibility of the adults in the room is, how that has changed, and as well, what parents can look forward to as we continue, because I think there is a set of immediate actions that has to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7007.481s">But</a>  I also think that this is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7012.462s">It</a>  has existed <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7014.726s">for</a>  years, going back at least to those gun clip moments. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7020.429s">And</a>  probably further, we heard about race riots back many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7026.712s">So</a>  I would like to make a motion that we hold that meeting between now and the time students return to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7035.056s">So</a>  that's the end of my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7038.82s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7041.221s">What</a>  I would like to say, though, before my colleagues might weigh in on that is that, you know, this problem of the bathrooms is a problem I hear about from lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of different angles. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7057.848s">And</a>  there is a problem with supervision in the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7061.849s">That's</a>  true. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7063.81s">But</a>  what I would also say is that that is a symptom of <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7068.953s">deeper</a>  issues of consistency of how our rules are enforced by those responsible for doing it, whether those actions are carried out with consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7083.299s">I</a>  have questions about whether there is an appropriate systemic support to allow that decision making to be good, solid and consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7092.222s">And</a>  I would also, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7094.707s">you</a>  know, like to know in that meeting how we all can have a better understanding of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7106.219s">beyond</a>  the student handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7108.08s">I</a>  think this is something that warrants really clear professional communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7113.282s">And</a>  I know that is an area that we deeply struggle with at Medford public schools, but we need to find a way through this communications situation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7125.686s">And</a>  the last thing I will say to everybody who has been involved, I think we're all here to listen <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7135.327s">and</a>  hear what you need from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7139.069s">If</a>  you need us to support expenditures, if you need us to support you as you make hard decisions about staff, if you need us to support hard decisions about prioritization of which staff are needed, we're here to do all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7157.694s">We</a>  were elected to make hard decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7160.796s">I</a>  don't think I've ever gotten to make very easy decisions since I have been on this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7164.938s">And</a>  I think, you know, we want to hear from the people who we hire and pay to do this work in our schools every single day, what they need from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7176.865s">We</a>  want the teachers to be at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7178.646s">I</a>  do think we will get a better product when we talk and listen to students and teachers as we go through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7185.934s">Um,</a>  but I do think we have to have a comprehensive approach that is both, um, confidential where it is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7195.897s">And</a>  there will be wildly unsatisfying moments where things are necessarily confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7201.98s">Um,</a>  and the superintendent has my full support as she makes those hard decisions and, and upholds the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7208.302s">Um,</a>  but I think we also have to find a way for this community to understand what part <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7214.949s">they</a>  can play, how they can help, and what we are going to do differently in the immediate term, as well as, as we continue forward this year, into the summer, into next year, this is a hard problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7230.621s">We</a>  need to prioritize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7232.822s">We</a>  need to think about how our students feel safe and supported in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7237.826s">Every</a>  single person in this room wants that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7240.028s">We</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7240.688s">I</a>  think where we all have, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7243.946s">work</a>  to do is to figure out the how and that I think that's critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7248.869s">I</a>  think it's work we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7250.109s">And</a>  thank you, Member McLaughlin for supporting my motion that we have an in depth discussion that is compliant with the open meeting law before the start of school.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7260.874s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7261.315s">I</a>  just wanted to say it is a very complicated issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7263.436s">I</a>  appreciate Gail Reggie and saying that earlier, but also all the family members and especially like the <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7269.124s">Like</a>  member Graham was saying a moment ago, the students that came out tonight, it was exceptionally brave, particularly Jacqueline on her 16th birthday was exceptionally brave. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7277.886s">What</a>  no one should have to go through, what any of these children have gone through, both as people who have been there and seen what's happened and people who have been victims. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7287.908s">I</a>  think that we all recognize that bullying is not something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7294.13s">It's</a>  something that's been ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7295.43s">It</a>  escalates for sure during times of stress and tension, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7299.206s">This</a>  has been an extremely stressful couple of years for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7302.727s">Last</a>  year, we had a family and community engagement assessment come in from DESE to talk about family and community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7308.968s">And</a>  we weren't ready for that assessment because we were just really trying to recover from getting our kids back into school and COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7315.79s">But</a>  one of the things that they did say that these outside folks said was that we had a lot of work to do on family and community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7325.772s">And</a>  they offered to come back again <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7327.745s">and</a>  work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7328.505s">And</a>  we were not able to do that because we were so prioritizing so many other things and family engagement has to be critical for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7334.806s">It</a>  has to be something where it is a back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7337.187s">So</a>  we're not shouting at each other and trying to figure out who's blaming who and shame and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7342.087s">We</a>  have to work together to be able to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7343.568s">I</a>  know that I've been saying this earlier tonight and most especially, most especially we have to listen to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7349.529s">So</a>  we have to figure out a way that we're gonna listen to the students too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7353.269s">So</a>  I appreciate member Graham's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7355.31s">I</a>  second that and I'm sure we'll have <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7356.97s">deeper</a>  conversations about how we're going to do that, but we are going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7360.468s">We're</a>  going to find a forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7362.17s">and</a>  more than one for our students to be heard as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7364.591s">So</a>  I want folks that are out there listening to know that, but also I know that there are folks out there, you know who you are, who we've dealt with other stuff last year, maybe the year before related to bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7375.956s">This</a>  is not the first time of bullying in Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7378.497s">It's</a>  not the first time bullying in most public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7380.998s">It</a>  is an ongoing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7382.079s">We</a>  see this, especially, I sent a family member, I mean, a community member, an article from Ed Week this week that talked about the higher incidence and rate of violence in our public schools right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7391.696s">and</a>  bullying and what's happening in the mental health, major mental health crisis we have nationally in our country, both because of the pandemic, but also because we're all at each other's throats because we're exhausted and beat and tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7402.105s">And</a>  the kids are watching this too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7403.747s">And</a>  I just hope that we can figure out a way that we're going to be able to collaborate and work together to move forward because that's where I'm at. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7409.772s">That's</a>  what I want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7410.973s">And</a>  I really appreciate member Graham's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7413.135s">So</a>  I second that motion and thank you all for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7415.297s">I</a>  know it was painful and it's going to continue to be painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7418.075s">adaptive</a>  work, so technical work is the stuff that's the low-hanging fruit, the things you can do sort of easily, lock the doors, maybe get an SRO, things that are sort of technical. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7426.963s">The</a>  adaptive change, the changing our hearts and minds, really being able to think about what the root of the problem is, that's painful. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7432.587s">It</a>  takes longer, but we can do it if we're able to work together to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7436.451s">I</a>  know that we can, and I hope that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7438.192s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

that as a city counselor, you will see resolutions from this counselor that will ask you Madam Mayor, the resolution that if you came to our, our body for funding for licensed security guides to help our principals and assistant principals to make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7491.265s">That'll</a>  be a resolution, there'll be another resolution that the council would like to ask <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7496.109s">Members</a>  of the school committee, the police department, our teachers that we set up a team summit, so we can work with our children so they can tell us what they want, just like the brave young men and women that were here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7509.402s">So</a>  that will be the dialogue that needs to be started, there'll be a few others, but <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7514.887s">As</a>  Mr. Puccio said earlier, we allow our parents to monitor lunches. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7521.35s">We</a>  allow our parents to monitor different various programs throughout the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7527.713s">Maybe</a>  it's time that we ask those parents, and myself included, that we get more involved on a daily basis at Medford High School so the kids see our faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7537.118s">Not</a>  to be the policemen, not to be <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7546.104s">express</a>  this, the communication that I've gotten back from students and parents over the last 24 hours and before, is the understanding that we are very fortunate to have a headmaster like Paul DeLava. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7562.838s">Paul</a>  DeLava. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7566.581s">And</a>  I know Paul DeLava will be very upset because someone's talking kindly about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7571.653s">But</a>  Paul DeLava was part of that group that when I was a school committee member, he was a coach, he was a teacher, he loves Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7580.836s">So</a>  whatever was implemented after that, whatever stigma that's out there that people are portraying what that administration can do or can't do, let's try to find a way to correct it and make sure we don't lose people like Paul DeLava and his staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7597.201s">Because</a>  if we lost him right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7599.704s">we</a>  would be going back years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7601.945s">So</a>  thank you for your attention.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7603.826s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7609.729s">Thank</a>  you everybody for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7611.049s">We</a>  have a lot of work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7612.33s">We're</a>  committed to doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7613.811s">And</a>  again, thank you to the teachers and the nurses and the police department for supporting central administration, my team to get through today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7623.635s">And</a>  our prayers are with the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7629.386s">Mr.</a>  Murphy, do you wanna go on to the labor update? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7632.447s">I</a>  know we kind of already, the cat's out of the bag, so maybe something brief, labor relations update number two.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7642.389s">As</a>  the mayor announced at the beginning of the meeting, the school committee and executive session this evening approved the ratified memorandum of agreement with the Metro Teachers Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7653.372s">It</a>  is a two-part, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7655.677s">contract,</a>  what is referred to frequently as a three plus one, beginning in the 2122 school year retroactive and continuing through the 2425 school year, the substantive provisions are consistent, for the most part with <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7671.698s">What</a>  you have previously been briefed on specifically on October 17th when we had reached a previous tentative agreement that was not ratified by the teachers union. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7682.164s">The</a>  implementation of the full length Wednesdays at the elementary time, which is the committee knows was discussed a number of occasions and has been a topic on the bargaining table throughout the process of the 13 month negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7698.706s">That</a>  will the implementation for that will begin in the following school year so in the 2324 school year, the number of process steps that we will take in coordination with the teachers association to prepare for that implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7712.297s">As</a>  I brief the school committee on an executive session this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7716.7s">The</a>  budgetary impact over the four years is 11.35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7719.742s">That</a>  meets the school committee's goals of having a competitive but sustainable wage increase and continues our proud tradition of having educators who are compensated on the higher end of the continuum, with respect to comparable districts so as you've heard me say many times it's something that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7741.641s">is</a>  something that we're both proud of, and it was a priority throughout the course of these negotiations as members of the MTA referred to previously this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7751.488s">I</a>  think there's a mutual understanding that in order to maximize <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7759.06s">the</a>  impact in a positive way for students, there will need to be improved and more constructive discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7768.528s">And</a>  certainly that is the feeling of the school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7772.131s">We're</a>  looking forward to doing our part to try to set up a more positive and constructive tone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7778.256s">And</a>  I would imagine that the MTA representatives feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7782.859s">So</a>  I think there's certainly plenty else to discuss, but I think my recommendation <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7788.127s">would</a>  be that if the committee has additional questions, be happy to answer those, budgetary or otherwise, when we reconvene in January.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7796.931s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7797.552s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7798.232s">Thanks</a>  a lot, Sue.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7800.673s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7800.913s">Galussi,</a>  report on reading instruction curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7806.356s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7806.536s">Suzanne</a>  Galussi, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instructions.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7814.04s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7815.58s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7818.658s">So</a>  I'm here to report on seven questions were proposed that I'm just going to read through, if that's okay with the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7828.263s">So</a>  all have to do with current reading instruction at the elementary school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7833.466s">So</a>  the first question asked if Medford Public Schools have curricula from Fountas and Pinnell utilized by their teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7841.831s">We</a>  do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7842.711s">Previously,</a>  part of one of the assessment benchmarks <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7848.247s">under</a>  comprehension, we had utilized part of the Fountas and Pinnell, but since my transition into this position, we've phased that out, so we do no longer use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7861.752s">The</a>  second question was, does Meffitt Public Schools use any curricula from Lucy Calkins? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7866.274s">Currently,</a>  no, we do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7868.495s">Years</a>  back, we did have a writing program, never anything under reading instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7875.405s">Question</a>  three are we purchasing any reading curriculum using the three queuing system method public schools does not nor will not purchase any curriculum using the three queuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7887.894s">rules</a>  or system. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7889.936s">Question</a>  four, how many minutes per day do our K-3 elementary teachers spend on phonics instruction with the entire class? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7896.482s">So</a>  as I've presented several times to this body, currently in grades K through two, the phonics is spent for at least 45 minutes, somewhere from 20 to 45 minutes using ECRI, Enhanced Core Reading Instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7915.037s">Teachers</a>  have <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7917.116s">That's</a>  for K through three. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7920.619s">The</a>  next question was what percent of our K through three teachers have received training in this phonics instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7926.403s">So</a>  as previously presented to this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7931.905s">For</a>  the past three years, we have had direct partnership with Hill for Literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7936.427s">They</a>  have been giving some professional development and training to our teachers since 2018, but for the past three years, they have been in doing sustained embedded training with all of our K-2 staff monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7949.372s">That</a>  includes observations of teachers engaged in enhanced core reading instruction, phonics instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7957.395s">It</a>  includes observations and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7959.776s">It</a>  also includes training. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7965.05s">I</a>  also have in the report for your information, all of the previous presentations to this body as well as all of the professional development that teachers have had or been exposed to that opportunity for the past four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7985.074s">Question</a>  six was, have our teachers been taught that using alternatives such as three key, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7993.073s">53</a>  queuing is harmful for students teachers have been provided with, as I just said, with multiple opportunities for the professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8003.22s">In</a>  speaking of that it is ongoing, but it has been a conversation, I can also make sure that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8011.826s">a</a>  more direct conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8014.327s">Part</a>  of what I have done in trying to keep communication aligned and consistent across the district with four different schools is I've done an elementary update, like a memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8026.229s">Last</a>  year, I sent out 18 of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8028.429s">So</a>  I could share those with you if you'd like, but in those memos, I am specifically talking about curriculum <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8036.391s">I'm</a>  specifically talking about instruction, I'm specifically talking about expectations, and I'm aligning our assessments that teachers are using across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8044.898s">So</a>  it has been messaged, but it will continue to be so. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8050.682s">And</a>  then the last question was, what's our plan for ensuring that elementary school teachers current are aware of the science of reading and the use of the three queuing system that's harmful. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8064.962s">I'm</a>  sure some of you, some of this may have come from this wonderful podcast that a lot of us have maybe listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8076.99s">Part</a>  of this messaging, so for the science of reading, that is the pedagogical shift that we've been on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8087.317s">It's</a>  really difficult to sometimes explain what the science of reading is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8093.801s">to</a>  parents or to the community, even sometimes for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8097.403s">But</a>  this is what we've been doing and been messaging for the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8102.626s">With</a>  the enhanced core reading instruction shift that all of K-2 teachers are doing, this year we have a lot going on in terms of literacy instruction, as I've presented before. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8115.354s">we</a>  are going to be looking at a new program that is part of what we're working on this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8120.418s">All</a>  elementary reading staff and the two middle school reading interventionists have been engaging in the science of reading course that we have offered in partnership with Hill for Literacy this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8133.869s">It</a>  is a 10-month course. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8135.571s">We</a>  meet every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8136.291s">Actually,</a>  tomorrow is this month's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8140.751s">That</a>  will be, with everything going on this year, we started with the reading teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8147.657s">In</a>  the absence of instructional coaching, I really need the reading staff to be well trained and vetted and knowledgeable about this, so that the plan is next year, the science of reading course, there is a pre-K to two course, and there's also a grades three through five course. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8164.43s">Both</a>  of those courses will be offered for staff next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8168.274s">but</a>  this year we really wanted to focus on the elementary staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8174.098s">I</a>  hope that that answers your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8177.24s">I'm</a>  here if you have any questions pertaining to either my responses, what was written in the report or any of the several attachments regarding our professional development plan or my presentations here to this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8194.653s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8195.033s">Member</a>  Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8196.374s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8196.894s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8197.814s">I</a>  was very happy with the answers as my confidence in you is boundless. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8203.776s">So</a>  I wasn't surprised by many of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8206.877s">There's</a>  one word that I'm sure you know what word it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8210.698s">I'm</a>  going to talk about opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8214.4s">Our</a>  contract and the amount of professional development time this district has, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8219.082s">is</a>  essentially the legal minimum in my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8222.884s">Other</a>  districts, they have 189 days that they pay their staff and we do 183 or 184, 183, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8231.447s">And</a>  if you think about six days of professional development for your staff year after year after year, it is unreasonable to conclude that those six days of professional development do not make a dramatic difference in your staff's <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8248.063s">professional</a>  development. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8250.305s">So,</a>  I'm not asking you how to solve that because that's a financial problem and something we'll have to discuss perhaps the next contract to try and get maybe one more day of professional development, which would be a 25% increase, which would is a real substantial change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8266.338s">When</a>  I see the word opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8269.32s">I</a>  read that to mean the staff may decide to participate in the professional development or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8274.864s">And</a>  that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8276.466s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8278.246s">It</a>  all depends on how it's formatted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8280.028s">So</a>  I would say in response to that, in light of tonight's wonderful news, that was part of the superintendent and my goal in the Wednesday schedule, because those Wednesday half days will be for district professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8296.341s">And</a>  so how we utilize that is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8299.484s">And</a>  so I think that for now, the report, yes, the word opportunity was used carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8307.608s">and</a>  purposefully, but it is, I'm really excited and very hopeful for this new schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8315.77s">I</a>  do think it's an alignment for families that makes sense, but I also think it's, I'm just so happy to be able to offer, well, not offer, well, I'm really happy to be able to have teachers engaged in professional development that's needed and that they have the time to do so.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8333.833s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8334.514s">So,</a>  I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8336.604s">I</a>  feel like this is really a question for next year, which is I believe when we start the next contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8342.211s">Actually,</a>  no, we got a plus one so we have a little bit more time but I do think as a district and as a city we need to talk about funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8350.481s">Well,</a>  we always have to talk about funding but <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8353.063s">You</a>  know if we can get one more professional development day which is, I believe, around $100,000 if I remember some big number to pay the staff for one more day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8362.066s">I</a>  may be misremembering that but it's it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8366.248s">It's</a>  not $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8366.928s">So,</a>  you know, we. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8374.272s">in</a>  five minutes flat and certainly you and your role as a leader could come up with a year of professional development if the staff did nothing but do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8384.999s">So,</a>  I think we should have a real hard conversation about how to expand that available time because when I look at other districts that are doing 189 days, I mean, I'm assuming they're doing something interesting with their professional development and it just feels like we are <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8403.43s">missing</a>  a lot of opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8406.972s">Again,</a>  there's opportunity to really move our staff forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8412.154s">I'm</a>  not expecting staff to do this on their own free time in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8415.876s">This</a>  is part of their job that they should be paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8418.257s">But</a>  if we're not gonna pay them, we certainly can't demand them to sit on professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8424.18s">So</a>  I hope when we get, it's probably 2024 when we should really be talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8432.245s">a</a>  good sense of like, do we want to go for one more day? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8435.108s">Do</a>  we want to go for two or three? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8437.67s">I</a>  mean, I'm assuming you would agree that we could fill up two or three more days of professional development a year in a heartbeat.</p>

    <p>[North]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8443.755s">We</a>  always could.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8444.736s">We</a>  always could. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8445.276s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8445.816s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8446.697s">Thank</a>  you for the report.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8451.221s">Member</a>  Hayes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8452.842s">I</a>  guess I'd want to add to that, I think another piece that you mentioned, and I don't think you deliberately mentioned it quickly, but <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8458.871s">the</a>  having instructional support coaches as much as the professional development is important, that ongoing support to teachers where they can troubleshoot when they're trying it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8471.261s">You</a>  know, you can't do that in a one day professional or even a five day professional development because things happen as you're teaching something and you need to understand how to tweak it or change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8481.289s">So</a>  I think balancing out, if we're talking about how we're going to spend money, you know, instructional support coaches versus <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8489.133s">professional</a>  development or do we have the money for it all? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8491.775s">But</a>  I just don't want to, I don't want to go over that lightly because you did mention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8496.138s">And</a>  I think that that is incredibly important and something not to be overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8500.38s">I</a>  agree.</p>

    <p>[North]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8504.203s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8505.604s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8505.764s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8506.844s">I</a>  mean, member Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8507.665s">Stone.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8510.322s">Yeah,</a>  thank you for what. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8513.045s">So,</a>  personally, Declan's in fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8516.788s">And</a>  I feel like his writing is not what his older siblings were doing in fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8523.034s">Is</a>  there a writing curriculum that goes along with what's happening now? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8527.219s">Or</a>  is that something that you're also looking into?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8531.795s">So</a>  I think it's a if for every know that the enhanced core reading instruction there could be a small written portion but what you're talking about for at the fifth grade level is slightly different. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8543.202s">I</a>  think if we track back the three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8546.785s">That</a>  was a skill that was definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8551.94s">definitely</a>  lost a little bit of that skill during the pandemic, especially it's really hard to teach writing virtually. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8559.066s">And</a>  so that is kind of a problem across the board, not just in Medford, but that is a skill that was really kind of impeded during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8567.693s">So</a>  I think part of the process that we're gonna start going through, and I'll have more communication on this, to select a new ELA program <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8578.504s">is</a>  going to be looking at the components of all of those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8582.208s">And</a>  part of that will be looking at the writing component, just to see which program would best fit our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8590.136s">So</a>  I think part of the core review process that all the schools are going to do, I'm working on it right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8598.738s">I</a>  was kind of hoping to have the Wednesday schedule this year, so I have to do a little tweaking to how we're going to roll this out with staff but. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8605.265s">In</a>  essence, it's an all hands on deck kind of model that we're doing this is the model that Jesse it's the curate model that it's best practice when selecting an la program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8615.856s">And</a>  so we're going to have teachers looking at every strand, every English language arts strand within each program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8624.438s">And</a>  that way we'll be able to best see what fits Medford's needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8628.439s">And</a>  in that is the writing program.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8631.0s">My</a>  college roommate is a teacher in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8633.76s">She</a>  sent me the podcast.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8635.841s">Something</a>  sold, sold a story.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8637.861s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8638.781s">So</a>  we had a conversation not too long ago about it, but also the whole science of reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8644.383s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8645.888s">Would</a>  you say, because the hybrid year of COVID are going out March of 2020, has the science of reading not been part of professional development?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8653.813s">Oh,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8654.633s">That's</a>  all we've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8656.694s">So</a>  the science of reading is about how we're teaching students to learn to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8661.197s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8661.357s">Going</a>  back to phonics. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8662.678s">Oh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8663.338s">And</a>  direct explicit instruction.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8671.162s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8671.583s">It</a>  was a great podcast, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8673.224s">I</a>  highly recommend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8674.768s">Um,</a>  but it's also sort of going back to, so that's the other thing is that the science of reading is not new. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8680.49s">It,</a>  you know, it was one thing and then people tried something else for awhile and then they're going back to sort of what has been known to be the fundamental of phonics and really looking at the science of it, as opposed to just sort of the practice and trying new things and what's actually worked.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8695.074s">So</a>  I'm just thinking of my own having kids from 2002 to 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8698.716s">So</a>  Quinn never did phonics. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8703.55s">So</a>  she's the 20-year-old. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8705.511s">So</a>  I guess my concern is the teachers who went to school and learned the science of reading, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8712.714s">I'm</a>  getting the, not the phonics part.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8716.095s">I</a>  think it's probably better if you think of it as an umbrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8720.097s">So</a>  Medford Public Schools teachers started to be exposed to this in 2018 through professional development days. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8727.06s">And</a>  that's K-5. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8727.66s">That's</a>  the brain-based instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8730.962s">That</a>  they started in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8733.404s">When</a>  I came on board in this position for the 2020-2021 school year, that was just coming back from the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8743.173s">So</a>  we had ECRI. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8745.675s">That</a>  is when I started to bring in health literacy regularly to be meeting with staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8752.23s">but</a>  because we had students learning at completely different models, we were covering it all, but it wasn't until the 2021 school year in which that was the absolute mandate that this is what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8770.901s">No</a>  more of your DRA kits or your Fountas and Pinnell kits. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8776.124s">Have</a>  I gone into the school buildings and confiscated them? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8780.542s">No,</a>  but it's been very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8783.804s">It's</a>  been very clear that we're no longer using those programs as district assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8790.128s">We</a>  have now transitioned to utilizing ECRI, we utilize MAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8795.252s">The</a>  reading teachers are being trained this year in dibbles. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8799.094s">So</a>  we are on the right path, but member McLaughlin is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8805.959s">I</a>  mean, this brain based, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8809.344s">way</a>  of teaching students how to read has been around for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8815.389s">Yes,</a>  yes, there's actual proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8818.951s">Students</a>  have been tested, brainwaves, it's been documented proof, and a lot of this, so just so we know, Hillful Literacy has always been, if you want to vet them out, they're a very reputable program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8832.862s">They</a>  started as a non-profit through the <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8835.923s">Massachusetts</a>  General Hospital program, which is where a lot of this began. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8839.485s">And</a>  it's through the University of Oregon, and now Boston University has gotten in on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8844.788s">So</a>  it's all best practice, very well vetted, very aligned. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8850.392s">Is</a>  DIBLS phonics? <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8851.753s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8852.673s">Okay,</a>  so now DIBLS is all- But it's an assessment, it's a progress monitoring assessment tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8858.076s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8860.878s">I</a>  guess- Similar to a map. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8863.737s">similar</a>  to what we're doing with NWEA map. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8867.778s">But</a>  DIBLS, no, it is not computerized. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8872.38s">It</a>  can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8879.881s">We</a>  could talk hours on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8881.922s">I</a>  better listen to the podcast first. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8884.783s">The</a>  podcast is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8889.306s">It's</a>  six episodes, but it's well worth it.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8891.807s">Do</a>  you think our teachers, because they were teaching the non-phonics version for so long, it's hard to break into now going back to phonics?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8902.512s">I</a>  think our K-2 staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8905.214s">In</a>  all of the embedded training that they've had with helpful literacy in my conversations with staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8912.761s">They</a>  have seen the positive effects of this teaching, and so I think the shift right now is is like our three to five staff just this year i'm bringing grade three teachers in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8926.55s">with</a>  the Hill for Literacy training once a month, so that they're really getting exposed to what the K-2 teachers have been exposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8935.158s">So</a>  I think, yes, change takes a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8938.261s">And</a>  I do think that the podcast, which is really well done, it's going to elicit some feelings for some teachers too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8948.43s">And</a>  I was in the classroom for 15 years and I taught <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8951.69s">I</a>  never taught K to two, but I taught grades three through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8954.491s">And</a>  as a third grade teacher, that's where I spent most of my time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8956.952s">I</a>  mean, I listened to that podcast and kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8960.014s">Had</a>  a little bit of that, that gut feeling, because I think it will elicit some of those feelings for teachers that, um, they, you know, they could have done differently.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8972.66s">You</a>  said you bring it in grade three, you bring it in grade four and five and different cycles or.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8978.311s">Yes,</a>  I'm trying to fit it all in because K to two is still being trained.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8981.773s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8982.794s">Um,</a>  the other thing we're doing this year is part of the training. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8985.876s">So</a>  when, when the teachers are getting the science reading training tomorrow at the end of the day, um, the elementary principals and assistant principals come in and they're being trained, um, because I need school leaders, uh, to be able to be a resource and to be able to understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9004.969s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9008.587s">I</a>  know it's not a great answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9010.088s">I'd</a>  love to be able to be doing all of the grades simultaneously, but I'm just trying to build in a prioritized fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9019.456s">And</a>  I do want to just say that Dr. Chiesa and Dr. Riccadeli are at home and on the call listening and have really, you know, partnered with me in this as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9031.075s">elementary</a>  reading department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9033.156s">They</a>  are just fabulous in what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9035.736s">They're</a>  so energized and excited about this journey that we're all on together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9039.978s">And</a>  they're just a really talented group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9043.459s">And</a>  so I just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9045.619s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9046.7s">Thank</a>  you, miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9047.14s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9047.44s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9047.8s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9048.86s">Number</a>  four, we have report on desi comprehensive district review. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9051.981s">Dr.</a>  Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of enrichment and innovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9056.823s">Dr.</a>  Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9058.268s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9060.129s">Thank</a>  you very much for this opportunity to speak with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9062.09s">And</a>  let me just share the slide deck I prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9067.312s">There's</a>  also a report in your folders. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9070.534s">Just</a>  one second, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9075.098s">So</a>  we were notified in September that we will be partaking in a Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education comprehensive review. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9085.643s">This</a>  is a process that is required by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9089.886s">And</a>  generally speaking, what DESE does is 75% are deemed underperforming by DESE standards, and 25% of districts are performing in accordance with DESE standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9102.172s">Just</a>  a quick, loose interpretation of a very long law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9105.554s">but</a>  Medford is part of the second cohort of 25% schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9111.797s">State</a>  regulations define effective practice through several standards, and there are two overarching categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9119.48s">First</a>  is governance and administrative systems, which then looks at leadership and governance, human resources and professional development, financial and asset management, and then student-centered systems for student support, assessment, and curriculum instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9135.478s">All</a>  these are technical, each one has three or four more subcategories built out underneath them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9142.849s">And</a>  will be reviewed on site in December of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9149.414s">This</a>  will be conducted by the American Institutes of Research, AIR, that has a partnership with DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9155.437s">This</a>  on-site review will encompass quite possibly hundreds of classroom observations that they would use using the class tool to observe classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9167.523s">There'll</a>  be a lot of pre-work done by district leadership and school leaders as well as others. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9174.407s">A</a>  comprehensive list of documents <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9177.947s">comprehensive</a>  that I'll get into a little bit moving forward here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9181.229s">And</a>  district personnel, students, constituents, families will be asked to be part of focus groups or interview sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9189.594s">Again,</a>  I said AIR, they're gonna visit schools, conduct classroom observations, they'll meet with staff, school committee members, students, and families, caregivers, conduct the document reviews and analyze data. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9200.54s">We'll</a>  start uploading those after the first of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9203.242s">Review</a>  will generate a final report <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9206.01s">inclusive</a>  of findings and recommendations to improve student outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9210.194s">This</a>  report will come through probably in three months after the report, the visit is finalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9218.601s">This</a>  was shared with you in the report, but this is the makeup of the groups that will happen across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9227.068s">So</a>  superintendent, district leaders, school leaders, instructional staff, school committee members, teacher association leadership, family members, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9234.867s">and</a>  students, just so you're aware, and the reviewers will be needing to look through documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9244.49s">Now,</a>  so when we say strategic plan, we mean the one for the district, building maps, each school, improvement plans, each school, master schedules, each school, school committee minutes, agendas for a host of meetings, any meeting you can imagine, they'll be looking for various agendas, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9262.383s">budgets,</a>  capital plan, some units of study, and many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9265.925s">I</a>  will share this with you and this will be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9268.946s">And</a>  you can click on that link and it will take you to the full list of a pageless document of many documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9277.97s">And</a>  that is our upcoming district review. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9282.952s">If</a>  you have any questions, I'm happy to attempt to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9286.174s">Or</a>  if you would like further information, I'm happy to speak further later.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9295.528s">Have</a>  a good night.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9296.269s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9298.41s">We</a>  do not have any other presentations in the public or continued business. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9301.651s">We</a>  do have one item. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9303.432s">Under</a>  new business, 2022-54 offered by members Rousseau, Graham, and Mastone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9309.315s">Whereas</a>  on February 3, 2020, the Medford School Committee voted unanimously in favor of a proclamation to make Medford hunger free. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9316.223s">Whereas</a>  in the ensuing 35 months, our world has been devastated by a pandemic that has taken more than 1 million lives in our nation alone, and at least 6.6 million lives worldwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9328.589s">Whereas</a>  the pandemic can be measured in many ways, nearly all of which involve significant loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9335.893s">One</a>  of those bright spots, childhood hunger in the United States is reduced through pandemic food relief programs through federal and state governments. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9343.456s">Whereas</a>  the Memphis School Committee has no funding authority, cannot raise taxes or have any effect on the revenues we are allocated from city, state, and federal access to execute on the authority we do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9354.302s">Whereas</a>  our mission is to provide a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community in pursuit of providing the very best education our children deserve for them and for the future of our world. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9364.208s">Whereas</a>  the Memphis School Committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9368.697s">democratically</a>  elected body with exclusive local control. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9372.138s">Public</a>  schools must press on the city, state, and federal governments to supply us with the revenues we need to meet our obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9377.8s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved, the Memphis School Committee join the Feed Kids Coalition as a sponsor in urging the Massachusetts State Legislature to make free school meals permanent, directs the superintendent to transmit official copies of this resolution to the following governor-elect, Mara Healy, Senator Elizabeth Warren, <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9397.27s">Senator</a>  Edward Markey, Congresswoman Catherine Clark, Senator Patricia Jalen, State Representative Paul Donato, Sean Garbley, and Christine Barber, directs the superintendent to transmit an official copy of this resolution to the Medford City Council in accordance with Medford School Committee Rule 77, directs the superintendent to transmit an official copy of the resolution to the Mayor of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9418.947s">Member</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9420.829s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9422.23s">I</a>  was contacted by <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9425.481s">I'm</a>  slightly embarrassed, I can't remember who contacted me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9429.463s">Somebody</a>  I didn't know yet on Facebook about the coalition, the Feed Kids Coalition, which is working to press on the state legislature to make free school meals permanent as Maine just did a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9443.352s">And</a>  the importance of it is not just really about <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9449.124s">free</a>  school meals which is sort of the obvious part, the, the challenges we face as a district, when we do our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9457.709s">Prior</a>  to the state doing their budget means we have a choice to include the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9464.173s">And</a>  then perhaps that money turns out to have not been needed, because the state decides in the last minute to include in their budget, or we don't include it, and then the state doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9475.711s">decide</a>  to make it free and then we're stuck where we are not providing free meals to our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9481.035s">It's</a>  just an awful position for all school committees to be in because I don't think any school committee's budget is done at the right time to deal with the uncertainty that the state budget has. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9492.583s">Last</a>  year, the state did extend the free school meal in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9500.489s">But</a>  again, they did it, I think their budget wasn't even done before June. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9504.031s">30th</a>  I think it was actually after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9506.175s">So</a>  we had already as a body decided that we all we have a policy that we will provide free school meals but then we did not include it in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9515.743s">So</a>  we got, frankly, very lucky that we have a policy that we were not going to fund, and then the state came through. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9524.806s">So</a>  this coalition is just trying to press on our state legislators to make it permanent, take this uncertainty out of the entire process for school committees and for students and families, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9538.09s">So</a>  I wanna thank everybody for hopefully supporting it.</p>
