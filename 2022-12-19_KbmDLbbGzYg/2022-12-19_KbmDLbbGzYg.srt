00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:11,167

00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:24,596

[SPEAKER_05]: I too would like to open by just saying that I'm very pleased that our teachers contract was ratified this evening, and there will be further labor update later on today's agenda.

23
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:56,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to just start with saying once again that during this month of December, we want to first recognize those that started celebrating Hanukkah last evening, and that Hanukkah will be celebrated for eight days, and again, we wish all of our Jewish friends a happy Hanukkah as they celebrate the Festival of Lights.

[SPEAKER_05]: And in some cultures, the winter solstice signifies renewal and fresh beginnings.

[SPEAKER_05]: Following that, Christmas Day this year falls on Sunday, December 25th, and Kwanzaa begins on the 26th and lasts until January 1st.

27
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:35,279
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter your celebration, all of the holidays mentioned celebrate with the lighting of candles.

28
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Maya Angelou once said that we are more alike my friends than we are unalike.

29

[SPEAKER_05]: So in the spirit of the holiday season, I would like to extend thanks to the following who have helped to make sure all of our families within Medford have had a happy holiday season.

35
00:03:52,737 --> 00:04:13,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Working in collaboration with the Medford Family Network, as well as all of our K to 12 families, they reached out to our teachers, administrators, parents, administrative assistants, and others in the school community to help provide them over 15 families with wonderful holiday gifts.

36
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,111
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for your work in that area.

37
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,372

43
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:28,571
[SPEAKER_05]: We are so lucky to reside in a diverse and historic community that remembers to take care of those in need.

44
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:34,198
[SPEAKER_05]: The goodness in Medford reminds me of a quote from the movie, It's a Wonderful Life.

45
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, no man is a failure who has friends.

46
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,602
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a huge village of friends who take care of each other in our school community.

47
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:48,083
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not called the mighty Mustangs for nothing.

48
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:49,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job, everyone.

49
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,845
[SPEAKER_05]: You make me very proud to be your superintendent.

00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:24,409
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few reminders.

60
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:32,793
[SPEAKER_05]: This coming Wednesday, December 21st is the last opportunity for our seniors to take their class portraits.

61
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:37,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do not miss out on this opportunity so that you can be included in the yearbook.

62

65
00:07:54,588 --> 00:08:04,732
[SPEAKER_05]: My final remarks that I would like to share are about a very serious incident that took place today at Medford High School.

66
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:15,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Earlier today at the high school, we had a student, one of our students was involved in an altercation and that student was stabbed.

67
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:23,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I have spoken with the student's mother and she has shared with me that her child is stable.

68
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:37,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to share that the defendant in this situation has been identified and is in police custody at this time.

69
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:51,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say a special thank you to our teachers, our staff, who supported all of their students while we were conducting the stay in place at Medford High School.

70
00:08:53,191 --> 00:09:14,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to also extend special thanks to our nursing staff for their immediate response to the Medford Police Department for their support, Medford Fire Department, the mayor's office that was with us today, and EMS for all of their support during today's situation.

71
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:23,483
[SPEAKER_05]: We will continue to work collaboratively with the police department, as this investigation is still ongoing.

72
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:25,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

73
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:35,568
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you from the chair if I may, I want to thank the superintendent for comments.

74
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:48,402
[SPEAKER_33]: First and foremost, our teachers who navigated the almost two hours in the shelter in place while the police were able to do their work at the high school.

75
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:58,486
[SPEAKER_33]: We thank the teachers, staff, the nurses, thank the police department for being there and obviously going to be a presence throughout the week.

76
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:00,607
[SPEAKER_33]: We do have chief of police here.

77
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:07,950
[SPEAKER_33]: also Captain Covino, who will be able to answer questions if we do have any questions, and maybe give us an update right off the bat.

78
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,071
[SPEAKER_33]: But please know we are taking this extremely seriously.

79
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,793
[SPEAKER_33]: Safety of our students is our utmost priority.

80
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:27,076
[SPEAKER_33]: I think you've heard from this committee that we recognize there's a systemic issue, and there's a culture and climate study that needs to be done, and that's just one thing that needs to be done.

81
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:29,797
[SPEAKER_33]: I know many of you have said it on the floor,

82
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:37,861
[SPEAKER_33]: I say what I need to say quite often behind the scenes, especially out of respect and pushing for that change.

83
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:46,908
[SPEAKER_33]: Everybody knows I'm making the changes on the city side, and we do want to see positive changes for our students on the school side too.

84
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:48,470
[SPEAKER_33]: We do recognize that.

85
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,173
[SPEAKER_33]: We have asked for a culture and climate study a year ago, and I know that's out in procurement now.

86
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:55,435
[SPEAKER_33]: Dr. Cushing told us today.

87
00:10:56,892 --> 00:11:07,297
[SPEAKER_33]: Just also please know, as soon as I heard about this, I was at the high school with our communications team, also our board of health director, who is our emergency management coordinator for the city.

88
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:24,266
[SPEAKER_33]: We went to the high school just to make sure we could lend a hand any way possible, work with central administration to get communications out, to make sure we were crossing all our T's and dotting all our I's, and the students are our utmost priority in their safety.

89
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:27,234
[SPEAKER_33]: There is no imminent threat.

90
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:31,236
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll ask Captain Covino to maybe come up and give a little more detail.

91
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:32,676
[SPEAKER_33]: There's no imminent threat.

92
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:40,100
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a plan for tomorrow between the bathroom plan, extra staffing in the hallways and the cafeterias.

93
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,741
[SPEAKER_33]: We're asking our teachers for support.

94
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,402
[SPEAKER_33]: We do have a plan.

95
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:49,444
[SPEAKER_33]: We're gonna implement that tomorrow and any other details you can give Captain Covino.

96
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:51,705
[SPEAKER_33]: I know you're actively working the situation.

97
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:52,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

98
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:01,286
[SPEAKER_03]: We have already planned to have some added personnel at the high school to be visible in the hallways and around the building.

99
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:04,232
[SPEAKER_03]: support.

100
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:05,673
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not doing an investigation.

101
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:14,777
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just there for support for the school, the students, the faculty, and everybody else that may need to talk to them or pass on any information.

102
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:18,599
[SPEAKER_03]: They will be there for the week until school break.

103
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:23,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, we can reassess the needs of the school and the properties and so forth.

104
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:25,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have any questions for me?

105
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:27,003
[SPEAKER_33]: You could tell us a little bit.

106
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:29,244
[SPEAKER_33]: I know everybody's been watching the news and

107
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:40,020
[SPEAKER_33]: Schools have sent out a number of communications to parents and faculty and staff, but is there anything else you can share about the incident that we don't know about in the last hour that we've been in executive session?

108
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's changed since the news has been on since late this afternoon.

109
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:46,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's been already spoken about.

110
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,844
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything you've seen in the news today is where we are.

111
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:58,367
[SPEAKER_03]: The investigation is still ongoing and pretty much status quo right now.

112
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:06,842
[SPEAKER_33]: And we'll have additional professionals and counselors in the high school to deal, along with the police presence.

113
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:12,484
[SPEAKER_33]: We'll have additional supports in place for our faculty and staff tomorrow.

114
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:18,347
[SPEAKER_33]: We've called in outside agencies as well as additional counselors from the other schools to come help.

115
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:20,988
[SPEAKER_33]: Any?

116
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:22,389
[SPEAKER_03]: No, very welcome.

117
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

118
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,591
[SPEAKER_33]: I know that people may be here to talk,

119
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:32,903
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, ask questions, voice your concerns.

120
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:33,684
[SPEAKER_33]: Please feel free.

121
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,265
[SPEAKER_33]: We're going to open it up to the floor.

122
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:38,506
[SPEAKER_33]: We ask people for their name and address for the record.

123
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:43,428
[SPEAKER_33]: And if we could limit it, we have a number of people online as well.

124
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:44,769
[SPEAKER_33]: So two minutes or so.

125
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:46,610
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

126
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,071
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, George Scott Pele.

127
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:50,552
[SPEAKER_36]: 27 Butler Street, Matthew, Massachusetts.

128
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:57,755
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, what I'm hearing on what we've seen today was horrific.

129
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,971
[SPEAKER_36]: What I hear and see from this committee is just as bad.

130
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,593
[SPEAKER_36]: This isn't something that we're looking at systemic.

131
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:10,894
[SPEAKER_36]: This is something right now that's happening right now.

132
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:12,195
[SPEAKER_36]: Our kids are afraid.

133
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:13,995
[SPEAKER_36]: My daughter doesn't want to go back to school.

134
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
[SPEAKER_36]: Where is the urgency?

135
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:21,098
[SPEAKER_36]: Where is your urgency?

136
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:28,101
[SPEAKER_36]: A few weeks ago, we had parents up here talking about the fear they had about their daughter being beaten up.

137
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:35,456
[SPEAKER_36]: And we had a consultant and I've asked teachers, I've asked students, have you seen the change?

138
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:40,419
[SPEAKER_36]: Nothing, nothing, nothing has been done.

139
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:50,944
[SPEAKER_36]: And to sit back, I'm gonna speak and then I'm gonna leave because I don't want it back and forth, Madam Mayor.

140
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:54,266
[SPEAKER_36]: This is what we're seeing with my daughter, her friends.

141
00:14:55,734 --> 00:15:00,177
[SPEAKER_36]: I ran up to the high school just so I could be present for her, just so I could tell her her dad's outside.

142
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:10,985
[SPEAKER_36]: I see over and over again, I saw Madam Superintendent, this is not an isolated incident.

143
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:17,189
[SPEAKER_36]: To write that this is an isolated incident and to say publicly this is an isolating incident is false.

144
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,611
[SPEAKER_36]: This is not.

145
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:21,693
[SPEAKER_36]: This is not.

146
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:28,155
[SPEAKER_36]: And I'm scared, and I'm disgusted, and I feel bad for my daughter and her friends.

147
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:39,801
[SPEAKER_36]: And this might be not the best thing a city council should do, coming up in front of a body and expressing themselves with this motion, but I don't care.

148
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:48,366
[SPEAKER_36]: You have principals and assistant principals that are running around that school with no support.

149
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:53,988
[SPEAKER_36]: for rules that have been implemented by this body.

150
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:02,917
[SPEAKER_36]: Give him back the tools, give them back the tools so they can run the school system the way they see fit to keep our kids safe, period.

151
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,384
[SPEAKER_36]: And then look at your studies and then look at your consultants and see what they said.

152
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:14,965
[SPEAKER_20]: you're not willing to listen.

153
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:16,206
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll be honest with tomorrow.

154
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:21,908
[SPEAKER_36]: We've asked for an emergency meeting didn't didn't go through only three members voted for an emergency meeting.

155
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:30,091
[SPEAKER_36]: We have a forum for people don't feel like they've been heard today to be up for the city council tomorrow and express their concerns and I will be honest with you.

156
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:34,393
[SPEAKER_36]: My daughter will not be going to school and her friends are not going to school.

157
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,966
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McLaughlin.

158
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,950
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's unfortunate when a city counselor won't have a back and forth with constituents as well.

159
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,533
[SPEAKER_20]: And I am a constituent and I would like to have a conversation.

160
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:52,396
[SPEAKER_20]: I would say that it is inaccurate to say that nothing has been done.

161
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:53,357
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not accurate.

162
00:16:53,657 --> 00:16:55,419
[SPEAKER_20]: Number one, our police have been involved.

163
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Our school counselors have been involved.

164
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:06,208
[SPEAKER_20]: And particularly from someone who served on the other side of this table, and you know what the restrictions are, to sit here and politicize in front of cameras is completely egregious.

165
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:08,625
[SPEAKER_20]: and unacceptable, I'm sorry, Mr. Scarpelli.

166
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:13,047
[SPEAKER_20]: And my children go to school as well, and I worry about all of our children.

167
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:16,208
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not here because it's enjoyable, I'm here because I care as well.

168
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:21,750
[SPEAKER_33]: And if I may, just about the tools, Councilor Scarpelli, about the tools.

169
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:30,254
[SPEAKER_33]: I know it's out there that we got rid of suspensions and detentions, that is absolutely not true.

170
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:30,654
[SPEAKER_36]: Sure.

171
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:35,596
[SPEAKER_36]: So I will tell you, as a parent, you're asking me to have a back and forth?

172
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,881
[SPEAKER_36]: As a colleague, I haven't heard one word from you.

173
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,983
[SPEAKER_36]: I haven't had one word from anybody.

174
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:46,446
[SPEAKER_36]: I've publicly put this out there because we haven't heard one word from any of you.

175
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:48,660
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, one word, yeah.

176
00:17:49,520 --> 00:18:01,368
[SPEAKER_36]: So I will tell you, as a former member of this body, I worked diligently to make sure that we implemented a plan to keep our children safe from bullies, not the opposite, because that's what we're feeling.

177
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:02,849
[SPEAKER_36]: That's what our kids are feeling.

178
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:10,493
[SPEAKER_36]: Whether you want to see it or not, our children are telling us that they feel that you're protecting the bullies.

179
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,455
[SPEAKER_36]: You're allowing them to run the show.

180
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:19,903
[SPEAKER_36]: If you ask any kid, any child up there, they're telling me that they feel unsafe.

181
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:23,886
[SPEAKER_36]: They're telling me that they don't have the structure that they felt in the past.

182
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:28,749
[SPEAKER_36]: So to tell me that the tensions, suspensions, well guess what?

183
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,050
[SPEAKER_36]: If you're saying that,

184
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:37,222
[SPEAKER_36]: And that's not happening, it's not getting to the ones that it's happening to, because the kids are saying that.

185
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:42,789
[SPEAKER_36]: The kids are telling me that there's no suspensions, that they're not gonna get detention.

186
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,213
[SPEAKER_36]: The kids are saying it.

187
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:48,576
[SPEAKER_36]: Maybe so, but let me ask you one question.

188
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,832
[SPEAKER_36]: We've had assemblies for everything.

189
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:56,236
[SPEAKER_36]: After that incident with that young lady, did you bring that student body in?

190
00:18:56,276 --> 00:19:00,779
[SPEAKER_36]: Did you bring that student body in and give them security to let them feel that they would be safe?

191
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:10,927
[SPEAKER_36]: Have any of you, other than Go Mustangs or emails to people that if they get to them or not, did you sit in front of the student body yourselves?

192
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:21,171
[SPEAKER_36]: After that incident, look them in the eye in the gymnasium, like you did when you were all there cheering them on for the football game, and look them in the eye and say, you're safe because of this.

193
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:23,472
[SPEAKER_36]: You're safe because we're going to do this.

194
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:24,733
[SPEAKER_36]: You did not.

195
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:27,494
[SPEAKER_36]: Correct?

196
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:29,595
[SPEAKER_36]: Correct.

197
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:30,716
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

198
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:34,718
[SPEAKER_36]: That doesn't have to be a law.

199
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:39,520
[SPEAKER_20]: There are laws that we have to follow, and I know that you understand that because you were on their side.

200
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:41,470
[SPEAKER_20]: But you're not explaining that.

201
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,737
[SPEAKER_33]: Every child has rights, we have to make sure.

202
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:57,981
[SPEAKER_36]: We understand that, but that doesn't mean the tact and the professionalism that you have from your teachers and administrators up there to bring the rest of the student body in and to let them know that they're in a safe environment.

203
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:03,863
[SPEAKER_36]: You don't have to disclose anything, any other news about what's legally can be said and what can't be said.

204
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:11,246
[SPEAKER_36]: You're all educated, very bright people to sit our student body down and look them in the eye and say, you're okay and this is why it's gonna happen.

205
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:19,669
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not asking you to disclose any information about the perpetrator, the person who was injured.

206
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:20,790
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not saying that.

207
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,632
[SPEAKER_36]: Let the kids know that they're safe, because you haven't done that.

208
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:25,612
[SPEAKER_36]: You haven't.

209
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:30,014
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, counselor.

210
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:47,445
[SPEAKER_37]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, school committee people, superintendent, Richard Caraviello, Medford City Council, 74 Prescott Street, Medford.

211
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:56,913
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, I know the fear that Mrs. Branley felt when I got that call from my granddaughter this morning saying, Pa, I'm afraid, come and get me.

212
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:02,898
[SPEAKER_37]: The school is supposed to be their safe place, not where they should be afraid to come to.

213
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:05,901
[SPEAKER_37]: And for far too long, it's not a safe place for them.

214
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,255
[SPEAKER_37]: And listen, I know you're trying to do the best you can, but obviously it's not enough.

215
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:15,542
[SPEAKER_37]: And to say that today was an isolated incident was a little shocking to me when I heard that.

216
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,201
[SPEAKER_37]: It's not the way it should be.

217
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,603
[SPEAKER_37]: Our kids should be protected up there all the time.

218
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:27,767
[SPEAKER_37]: Whether it has to be more public safety up there or whatever, more needs to be done than what's going on.

219
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:33,011
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I hear stories about kids eating in bathrooms because they're afraid to go in cafeterias.

220
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,253
[SPEAKER_37]: They fight all the time.

221
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,134
[SPEAKER_37]: This cannot continue to go on.

222
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:39,015
[SPEAKER_37]: I know you said it's systemic.

223
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:39,716
[SPEAKER_37]: It is systemic.

224
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:41,016
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's got to stop.

225
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:44,859
[SPEAKER_37]: And it has to stop now before somebody gets hurt and gets hurt bad.

226
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:45,740
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

227
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,200
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

228
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,350
[SPEAKER_33]: Mayor.

229
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:53,295
[SPEAKER_33]: Member McLaughlin, then you're next.

230
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:54,296
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

231
00:21:54,396 --> 00:22:03,444
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wanted to add in terms of the isolated incident, I believe that, you know, if there are officers here and or the superintendent that wants to speak to what that actually means, it means that

232
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,403
[SPEAKER_20]: It was an isolated incident in the bathroom in that instance.

233
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:10,844
[SPEAKER_20]: It does not mean that there's not a systemic issue that has been ongoing and that we understand that.

234
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:17,146
[SPEAKER_20]: This was an isolated incident today in terms of what happened to this individual student in the school today at this time.

235
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:18,467
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the isolated incident.

236
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,527
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not that any of these are isolated incidents.

237
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:22,528
[SPEAKER_20]: We know there's a systemic issue.

238
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,829
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why we're here to try to help change that.

239
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:28,390
[SPEAKER_20]: But it takes more than seven people to change a school district.

240
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,370
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes a community.

241
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,271
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes a community working together

242
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,512
[SPEAKER_20]: to change a school district.

243
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:39,465
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes a city council that is willing to work with their school committee and not get up here and yell at them in front of TV cameras.

244
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:43,392
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes working together as a community, all of us.

245
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:50,109
[SPEAKER_20]: and being good examples for our children, not bullying each other, not yelling at each other, not fighting with each other.

246
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:51,410
[SPEAKER_37]: First of all, I wasn't yelling at anybody.

247
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,571
[SPEAKER_37]: No, that wasn't directed at you.

248
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:53,652
[SPEAKER_37]: I wasn't yelling at anybody.

249
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:56,134
[SPEAKER_37]: But again, this is not isolated.

250
00:22:56,554 --> 00:23:01,218
[SPEAKER_37]: Whether getting a beating or getting stabbed, they're both like threatening injuries.

251
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,019
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's not isolated.

252
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,020
[SPEAKER_37]: That's all one and the same.

253
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:10,005
[SPEAKER_37]: And just don't say that the city council isn't willing to work with the school committee.

254
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:10,845
[SPEAKER_37]: We are.

255
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:20,004
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, anytime, anytime, the school committee needs us, we've been there to support the school committee.

256
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:35,531
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, well, I say, anytime, anytime this group wants to be collaborative, we'll do it tomorrow, we'll do it Wednesday, you do it any day, any day they want to meet, I'll be there to meet, and I guarantee all my other people will meet also with you.

257
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,052
[SPEAKER_37]: So, again, this is again, not isolated.

258
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:38,952
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. Kelly.

259
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:41,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor, there's also someone online.

260
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:46,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Danny Kelly 41 Myrtle Street.

261
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,570
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually teach at the high school as well.

262
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,731
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is actually my last week at the high school.

263
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:58,033
[SPEAKER_12]: I just took a new position with the Laborers Union so I feel like it's a good time to talk, not on really the negatives of today of course it's a bad issue.

264
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:07,136
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did want to say I think one of the most important things before I leave just to say, I think this culture in the school can be strong because of Mr. Paul DeLeva and Chad Fallon.

265
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:12,838
[SPEAKER_12]: They're two unbelievable leaders, but what needs to happen a little bit there needs to be a little bit more fun with the kids to be honest.

266
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,300
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked to them, I've coached baseball and football in the city for 10 years.

267
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to Medford high school, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute working here.

268
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:26,967
[SPEAKER_12]: But to be honest, the things I worked in another school district after MCAS testing, we had events we had rock climbing walls come in.

269
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:28,948
[SPEAKER_12]: We had people coming that was a little bit more fun.

270
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:35,252
[SPEAKER_12]: I think to be honest, I think one of the things that needs to change, in my personal opinion, and leaving and teaching for a long time here.

271
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:38,213
[SPEAKER_12]: is this needs to be a little bit more fun and events throughout the year.

272
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:43,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Even in assembly about anything, when we do have assemblies and the superintendent holds them, they're good and they help improve the culture.

273
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:46,175
[SPEAKER_12]: The pep rally once a year helps improve the culture.

274
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:54,837
[SPEAKER_12]: If we can do that multiple times a year, after an MCAS testing, when finals happen, when I was here in high school, after finals, they used to let us go home.

275
00:24:55,237 --> 00:24:59,979
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's kind of like little stuff you can look forward to after MCAS, if they could bring in a type of event, something like that.

276
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,619
[SPEAKER_12]: That stuff helps improve culture.

277
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:04,720
[SPEAKER_12]: I think even more pep rallies throughout the year, not just one in the fall,

278
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:12,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe one the spring anything to help improve that just school morale, me looking as an outsider now loving every minute of being here working here.

279
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:18,851
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the culture stuff just what we sit and talk to the kids in the construction shop all the time so just something you guys consider and thank you.

280
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:19,371
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

281
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:20,012
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

282
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:20,532
[SPEAKER_33]: Very helpful.

283
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:29,479
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, my name is Deborah camera, I live at 52 mom with app here in Medford, I'm a grandmother.

284
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:38,748
[SPEAKER_27]: And I got a phone call from my daughter today that my grandson wanted to come home that there's been a stabbing at the school, I ran out of the house working from home in my pajama pants.

285
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:46,491
[SPEAKER_27]: What I learned from being around the parents today was that this is not an isolated incident.

286
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:51,312
[SPEAKER_27]: There were several other attacks, people being bullied for just being different.

287
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:55,113
[SPEAKER_27]: A boy who is being bullied every single day because he has autism.

288
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:57,314
[SPEAKER_27]: And it just saddened me.

289
00:25:57,934 --> 00:26:07,337
[SPEAKER_27]: What can I do as a member of this community to help these kids, not just my grandson, but the children that are being, that are bullied, being bullied,

290
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:11,200
[SPEAKER_27]: and bullying because something's going on.

291
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,321
[SPEAKER_27]: And you're right, we do have to work as a community.

292
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:19,367
[SPEAKER_27]: And I read about the girl who was beaten up a few weeks ago, and I don't know her personally.

293
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:20,428
[SPEAKER_27]: I met her mom today.

294
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:28,575
[SPEAKER_27]: But there were three or four other parents there who told me that they have restraining orders against students.

295
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,957
[SPEAKER_27]: That's frightening.

296
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,920
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't know what is it going to take.

297
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:36,976
[SPEAKER_27]: Did the bullies that have been identified?

298
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,078
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know their names.

299
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:39,300
[SPEAKER_27]: They're not the same.

300
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,145
[SPEAKER_27]: So there's several, it's going on.

301
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:43,286
[SPEAKER_27]: I saw that video.

302
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:44,068
[SPEAKER_27]: It was horrific.

303
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:44,909
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

304
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:46,392
[SPEAKER_27]: I saw the beating of that girl.

305
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:47,554
[SPEAKER_27]: It was horrific.

306
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,024
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't want your daughter or son, and not only that, they can't go into school and be feared.

307
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:58,567
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want my grandson going back to school until something can be resolved.

308
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:09,916
[SPEAKER_27]: Does that mean somebody who's been identified as a bully or somebody that has a restraining order on them has somebody that is walking them to and from their classrooms to protect everybody else?

309
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:13,719
[SPEAKER_27]: I get it, they're minors.

310
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:18,162
[SPEAKER_27]: I get they have rights too, but you know,

311
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,241
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm open to dialogue.

312
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:23,245
[SPEAKER_27]: I like to know what I can do to help.

313
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:25,068
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you resolve this.

314
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:25,969
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

315
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:26,350
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

316
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:40,394
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi, my name is Jana Mongello I go to Medford high school and I just want to share my experience that I have today at the school.

317
00:27:40,414 --> 00:27:51,645
[SPEAKER_39]: We got it was this actually the second shelter in place that we had, and it was a scary experience, and this is one of the third things that has happened.

318
00:27:52,165 --> 00:28:16,212
[SPEAKER_39]: throughout the whole entire year and I feel like there's no difference at all and I feel like throughout the whole day today I was scared and I want to go home and it's like scary going to school seeing all these kids fighting seeing again no change whatsoever that has happened and I just call my grandfather because I wanted to go home and it was so scary and I just feel like again no change.

319
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:21,294
[SPEAKER_09]: My experience was I'm a senior I'm at Fred High School so

320
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:26,594
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I wanna have like a good last experience with like Medford High School, like I'm graduating.

321
00:28:27,674 --> 00:28:35,356
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're getting locked down in a classroom for three hours in like fear for the whole day.

322
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:41,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I texted my dad and he came to the school to make me feel safe and stayed so me and my friends felt safe.

323
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:47,479
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't feel safe anymore at my school, which is very disappointing.

324
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,820
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you for speaking out.

325
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:57,826
[SPEAKER_38]: Hi, how's it going?

326
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:06,302
[SPEAKER_38]: My name is Jake Nocella and I'd like to start by saying like I like my school because the teachers like Mr. DeLava and other officials that help like

327
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:08,454
[SPEAKER_38]: lead us in the best direction.

328
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:13,138
[SPEAKER_38]: But the incident that happened today could have happened to me a couple of weeks ago.

329
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:17,281
[SPEAKER_38]: A couple of weeks ago, that same group of kids threatened to stab me.

330
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,323
[SPEAKER_38]: My AP was aware of it.

331
00:29:19,543 --> 00:29:20,764
[SPEAKER_38]: My guidance counselor was aware of it.

332
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:23,326
[SPEAKER_38]: Those kids got no disciplinary action.

333
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:25,007
[SPEAKER_38]: We're back in school the next day.

334
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:27,509
[SPEAKER_38]: And now I'm like thinking, what if that was me?

335
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,950
[SPEAKER_38]: What if that happened to me?

336
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,873
[SPEAKER_38]: And so it's like, it's scary because like,

337
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:38,237
[SPEAKER_38]: just like I shouldn't be in fear, like going to the bathroom at school, just like kids like that hang out in there.

338
00:29:39,037 --> 00:29:49,543
[SPEAKER_38]: And like, I know like we have teachers that like make it a better place for us and try to like spread, I don't know, like spread goodness and happiness, but it's still like terrifying.

339
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:50,403
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

340
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:51,184
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you for speaking out.

341
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:53,825
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm Derek Marino.

342
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:55,106
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm a junior at Method High School.

343
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:59,788
[SPEAKER_23]: And the incident today, I feel like,

344
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,495
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a lot that could have been done to prevent it.

345
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:08,442
[SPEAKER_23]: There are people like that, you know people hang in the bathroom all day.

346
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:16,492
[SPEAKER_23]: They sit in there, and they threaten people it's relatively a lot of the same groups of people as well.

347
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:17,493
[SPEAKER_23]: And they.

348
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,977
[SPEAKER_23]: They go in there, they sit in there all day.

349
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:23,579
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no disciplinary action.

350
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,264
[SPEAKER_23]: Like Jake just said, he was threatened not too long ago and nothing was done about it.

351
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:34,708
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the whole incident today was, I could see everything that was going on outside the school.

352
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:42,374
[SPEAKER_23]: And you could see the groups of even parents trying to get the kids out of the school and people are crying.

353
00:30:42,414 --> 00:30:43,735
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a scary event.

354
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,577
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, we could see everything that was going on.

355
00:30:47,257 --> 00:30:49,778
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just feel like a lot of it is preventable.

356
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:54,040
[SPEAKER_23]: And there are a lot of people that are trying to help and prevent situations like this.

357
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,281
[SPEAKER_23]: But I just feel like a lot more should be done about it and can be done about it.

358
00:30:58,401 --> 00:30:59,502
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

359
00:30:59,522 --> 00:30:59,782
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

360
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:07,265
[SPEAKER_20]: I just I just remember my girlfriend.

361
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:07,605
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

362
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:26,435
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to thank the students for their bravery and coming up and speaking I think it's really important and I think it's really important that the students know that you can reach out to us an email phone call phone number everything's published on the website, you can reach out to us anytime to we don't know some of the circumstances that you're sharing because we're not necessarily allowed to know I'm not asking that you're sharing

363
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:28,236
[SPEAKER_20]: private information about other folks.

364
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:33,360
[SPEAKER_20]: But I am saying in your own experience, if you wanted to share your own experience, we're here to listen to you as well.

365
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:39,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Because some of the things I think I knew that before I was on school committee, I assumed school committee knew everything that was going on.

366
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:40,865
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not accurate.

367
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:48,550
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know everything that's going on, because there are personnel issue, there are FERPA, there's lots of laws that don't allow us to know specifics of what's going on.

368
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,891
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know people think, keep thinking,

369
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:51,352
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, they keep saying laws and laws.

370
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:52,332
[SPEAKER_20]: No, there really is.

371
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:53,692
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not even, I don't know.

372
00:31:53,772 --> 00:32:05,657
[SPEAKER_20]: There's other people from the community come to me and tell me things that they understand from their children, telling them that in high school, I don't know the circumstances because central administration is not allowed to tell us certain things because of laws.

373
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:09,659
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's really important that you guys know that we are, you're our constituents as well.

374
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:11,299
[SPEAKER_20]: You can reach out anytime.

375
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,020
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's really brave that you're willing to get up tonight and speak.

376
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,581
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

377
00:32:15,061 --> 00:32:15,321
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

378
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Lisa Kerber, 47A Sheridan Ave.

379
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:25,725
[SPEAKER_18]: I am the first of now the third generation in this school system.

380
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:27,986
[SPEAKER_18]: I have grandchildren in middle school.

381
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:33,270
[SPEAKER_18]: What I've witnessed in the first three months of this year in the high school is horrific.

382
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:40,656
[SPEAKER_18]: I went through this, my children went through this high school, never, never had situations like this.

383
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:45,700
[SPEAKER_18]: We had bathroom monitors and we had officers in the school.

384
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:50,705
[SPEAKER_18]: for the very reason of what these kids are dealing with now.

385
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,387
[SPEAKER_18]: That needs to be put back in place.

386
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:55,228
[SPEAKER_33]: We do have two school resource officers.

387
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:58,410
[SPEAKER_18]: Two resource officers in that entire high school is not enough.

388
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,553
[SPEAKER_18]: We need bathroom monitors, monitoring the hallways, period, the end.

389
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody gets to hang out in the bathrooms anymore.

390
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:10,897
[SPEAKER_18]: And the second part of this, it doesn't start at the high school level.

391
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:13,719
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a granddaughter in elementary school.

392
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:26,220
[SPEAKER_18]: six years old, who is terrified every day to go to school because of a bully in her classroom, that her teacher has to put her body in between him and another student.

393
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:28,122
[SPEAKER_18]: That's unacceptable.

394
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:31,545
[SPEAKER_18]: So we need to start from the bottom up.

395
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:34,087
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have alternative schools.

396
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:36,849
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what they're there for.

397
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:40,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Those teachers there are equipped to work with these children.

398
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:45,039
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying toss these kids aside, but these children need work.

399
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,884
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to give them the tools in order for them to work appropriately.

400
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:55,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Our teachers in the schools need to educate.

401
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:57,830
[SPEAKER_18]: They are not there to be bodyguards.

402
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:00,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

403
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:07,405
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be very quick.

404
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:08,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

405
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,527
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Kathleen Reynolds, Lambert Street.

406
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:17,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to read you a couple of text messages that I got from my daughter today while she was at school.

407
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:19,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Mom, I'm scared.

408
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very scared.

409
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:27,756
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had to go look and find out why, like, why are you scared?

410
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:30,417
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said somebody got stabbed at the school.

411
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:41,497
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was horrifying to know that just not two months ago, another girl was assaulted at the school.

412
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,119
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can't get to her.

413
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:49,319
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot get to her.

414
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's scared, and I'm scared for her.

415
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:59,882
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't feel like these kids feel safe anymore.

416
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:03,574
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's starting to become a problem.

417
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:15,739
[SPEAKER_14]: And instead of protecting the kids that are doing well, we're protecting the kids that need help, and they do need help.

418
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,302
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's give them help, but let's also look at the kids that are doing things that are well.

419
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:29,805
[SPEAKER_14]: She lost four hours of education today because she was stuck in a room

420
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:35,207
[SPEAKER_14]: and couldn't go anywhere because somebody stabbed somebody.

421
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:38,309
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not our community.

422
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:40,950
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to do better.

423
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, but I'm upset.

424
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:49,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very upset.

425
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:52,677
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to do better.

426
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:03,322
[SPEAKER_29]: Jackie Flynn, live on Rockwell Ave.

427
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,364
[SPEAKER_29]: My child was in that school today.

428
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:07,385
[SPEAKER_29]: She didn't even know why she was locked down.

429
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:14,551
[SPEAKER_29]: I couldn't get my TV to work, couldn't find out, ran out the door in my pajamas to find out that everyone was there, there was a stabbing.

430
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:23,237
[SPEAKER_29]: You could see staff sitting there through the windows and one particular teacher with her hand like this, like we were inconveniencing her.

431
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:26,260
[SPEAKER_29]: Why don't we know things?

432
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,001
[SPEAKER_29]: Understood things evolve.

433
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,983
[SPEAKER_29]: We got emails later, nothing,

434
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:34,386
[SPEAKER_29]: What about, hey, if you haven't heard from us, this is not your child.

435
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,868
[SPEAKER_29]: Many of us didn't know if it was our kid that was hurt.

436
00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:38,609
[SPEAKER_29]: All of you have kids.

437
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,732
[SPEAKER_29]: Imagine sitting out there just wondering, is that your child?

438
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,433
[SPEAKER_29]: Just hoping for a glimpse of them.

439
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,576
[SPEAKER_29]: The school has terrible cell phone service.

440
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:49,939
[SPEAKER_29]: Luckily, half of us were able to hear from our kids, but that's how we found out.

441
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:56,204
[SPEAKER_29]: Bullying is allowed in our school because our school allows it, and I blame all of you.

442
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:59,605
[SPEAKER_29]: Laws aside, everything aside, we all know it's here.

443
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,427
[SPEAKER_29]: We have children, we have social media, you see it every day.

444
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:09,949
[SPEAKER_29]: Between the stupid things on TikTok and everyone filming it on Snapchat, it's seen, we know it's here.

445
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:14,671
[SPEAKER_29]: My daughter has been bullied in the Medford public school system for years.

446
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:19,613
[SPEAKER_29]: I have personally reached out to everyone and forever have been told it is her fault.

447
00:37:20,373 --> 00:37:20,573
[SPEAKER_29]: Why?

448
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:21,494
[SPEAKER_29]: Because she's different?

449
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:23,756
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not fair.

450
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,858
[SPEAKER_29]: She got hit in the face with a 2x4 last year.

451
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:30,862
[SPEAKER_29]: She got sent home with a bloody mouth and she was told she shouldn't ask the student for help.

452
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:33,645
[SPEAKER_29]: She missed days of school.

453
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:35,727
[SPEAKER_29]: She had her braces removed.

454
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,989
[SPEAKER_29]: And that kid went on like it was nothing.

455
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:39,790
[SPEAKER_29]: He was fine.

456
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:46,156
[SPEAKER_29]: My child missed the first two weeks of Medford High because I was terrified to send her for this reason.

457
00:37:47,543 --> 00:37:52,206
[SPEAKER_29]: She had a hard time learning remote and wanted a chance to go make friends.

458
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:53,947
[SPEAKER_29]: I won't send her back.

459
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:58,550
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't want that phone call that something happened to her just because she's different.

460
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,132
[SPEAKER_29]: She's not going to be beat up in the school just because of that.

461
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,114
[SPEAKER_29]: I've talked to people, and you know what I get told?

462
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:06,355
[SPEAKER_29]: It doesn't sound like it's a serious threat.

463
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:08,157
[SPEAKER_29]: Really?

464
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:10,218
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not serious until it happens?

465
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:17,919
[SPEAKER_29]: Nothing's done, so we take the step after a child's been stabbed, after a child's been beat.

466
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,821
[SPEAKER_29]: We all come here, we're all mad, and we tell you how we feel.

467
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:30,365
[SPEAKER_29]: A week and a half later, you guys will pretend to do your studies, we'll see a bunch of it, half of us won't even see it or understand it, because you know, it's just how it goes.

468
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:33,026
[SPEAKER_29]: And everyone goes on their merry way like nothing happened.

469
00:38:36,307 --> 00:38:40,069
[SPEAKER_29]: The other superintendent, that was at your school, you were there.

470
00:38:41,243 --> 00:38:43,464
[SPEAKER_29]: How come another teacher came out instead of you to address us?

471
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:52,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I was supporting and working with the police earlier in the day during the ongoing investigation.

472
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:55,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I did go out later in the afternoon.

473
00:38:55,531 --> 00:39:00,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So we knew that staff had gone out earlier to speak with parents.

474
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:03,655
[SPEAKER_29]: How come an email could have gone out saying, hey, we can't release names?

475
00:39:03,735 --> 00:39:04,355
[SPEAKER_29]: Understandable.

476
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:05,236
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a child.

477
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:05,896
[SPEAKER_29]: I get that.

478
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:09,318
[SPEAKER_29]: If you haven't heard from us, your child was uninvolved.

479
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:11,425
[SPEAKER_29]: What's wrong with an email like that?

480
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:19,727
[SPEAKER_29]: For parents to know, like, okay, I haven't heard, at least I know my child's not on his way to a hospital or on her way to a hospital or just lying somewhere in the school.

481
00:39:20,627 --> 00:39:22,067
[SPEAKER_29]: And there's another school.

482
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:22,907
[SPEAKER_29]: There's another school.

483
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:24,368
[SPEAKER_29]: The Brooks isn't that far from there.

484
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:25,408
[SPEAKER_29]: And that kid got out.

485
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:27,148
[SPEAKER_29]: What if he happened to go over there?

486
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:29,068
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, this world's going crazy.

487
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:31,769
[SPEAKER_29]: Look at the other elementary school.

488
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:34,709
[SPEAKER_29]: How are we going to keep all of our kids safe?

489
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,291
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to say thank you.

490
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:43,774
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's, I'm really sorry about what happened to your daughter, and what continues to happen to your daughter.

491
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:49,198
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think coming up and offering solutions like an example of that is a really great

492
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:58,097
[SPEAKER_20]: example of things that we can do and that we can put into place I think you're right you know we should be able to send out a letter and say if your child is not involved in email or something on our website.

493
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:07,988
[SPEAKER_20]: If your child if you weren't contacted your child was not involved, I think that's completely reasonable and I think being able to have back and forth with folks like you who have had real experience on the ground is really important.

494
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:09,142
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wanna hear from you.

495
00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:09,802
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't heard from you.

496
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:14,264
[SPEAKER_20]: I would really like to hear from you, especially when you say your daughter's different and she's being bullied because she's different.

497
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:17,665
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody should be bullied and especially nobody should be bullied because they're different.

498
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:22,946
[SPEAKER_20]: So however we can help, I do wanna talk and think about positive solutions that we can come up with together.

499
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:27,227
[SPEAKER_20]: So please reach out or leave me your, I'll take your phone, whatever, leave your number whenever.

500
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,748
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm really, really sorry about your daughter.

501
00:40:30,348 --> 00:40:34,169
[SPEAKER_20]: And if there's anything I can do to help improve that, please really reach out.

502
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:35,950
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know my colleagues feel similarly.

503
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:38,974
[SPEAKER_29]: I have reached out.

504
00:40:39,294 --> 00:40:40,555
[SPEAKER_29]: I reached out to you, Madam Mayor.

505
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:45,356
[SPEAKER_29]: Many times, my child's not only bullied at the school.

506
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,076
[SPEAKER_29]: I have the emails.

507
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:49,777
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not going to expose you all here, but I have reached out to you personally.

508
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,198
[SPEAKER_29]: My kids, not even only in school, they're bullied.

509
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:53,218
[SPEAKER_29]: They're bullied going up the street.

510
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,159
[SPEAKER_29]: They're not allowed to leave the house because of it.

511
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,200
[SPEAKER_29]: You told me to find a lawyer.

512
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,880
[SPEAKER_29]: I went to Medford Police.

513
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,541
[SPEAKER_29]: Medford Police sent me to several courts.

514
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:01,821
[SPEAKER_29]: Some of them sent me to Cambridge.

515
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:05,002
[SPEAKER_29]: So as we say, we're going to do stuff that prevents it.

516
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:09,538
[SPEAKER_29]: All you do is send parents on a wild goose chase and walk kids in their room, so.

517
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:11,218
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.

518
00:41:11,398 --> 00:41:11,818
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

519
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Maria Gonzalez, graduating class of 1996.

520
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:28,522
[SPEAKER_22]: And I state that because in 1991, there was a racial riot on December 10th.

521
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:31,022
[SPEAKER_22]: I was two months into my freshman year.

522
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:34,843
[SPEAKER_22]: A boy was stabbed by another boy at lunch.

523
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:41,738
[SPEAKER_22]: And to think after 30 years that this is still happening at Medford High School is really sad.

524
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:43,139
[SPEAKER_22]: 30 years.

525
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,821
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all I can say.

526
00:41:48,303 --> 00:41:52,387
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, my name's Tiffany Bear.

527
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:53,527
[SPEAKER_31]: I live on Usher Road.

528
00:41:54,688 --> 00:42:02,595
[SPEAKER_31]: My daughter has expressed several times that she's scared to go into the restrooms because of these people being allowed to be in the restrooms.

529
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,938
[SPEAKER_31]: The hall monitors that you mentioned, their hands are tied.

530
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:11,840
[SPEAKER_31]: They're not allowed to get the people out of those restrooms and even escort them to their classrooms.

531
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,522
[SPEAKER_31]: They're told to F off.

532
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,264
[SPEAKER_31]: These guys have no power whatsoever.

533
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:22,806
[SPEAKER_31]: We need police officers, someone that they're scared of.

534
00:42:23,526 --> 00:42:30,350
[SPEAKER_31]: These bullies and hoodlums and whoever they are need to be in class or they need to be out of the school, period.

535
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,351
[SPEAKER_31]: Back in the day when I was in high school,

536
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:38,481
[SPEAKER_31]: You fight, you stab someone, you go to juvie.

537
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:42,083
[SPEAKER_31]: If you can't handle them in this school district, get them the hell out.

538
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:45,385
[SPEAKER_31]: Our kids that are the good kids need to be supported.

539
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:47,866
[SPEAKER_31]: They need to be able to get an education.

540
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:57,912
[SPEAKER_31]: They don't need to be sitting in a classroom for two plus hours losing their school time because you guys don't have a handle on what's happening in the bathrooms at the school.

541
00:42:58,999 --> 00:42:59,980
[SPEAKER_31]: It's insanity.

542
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,782
[SPEAKER_31]: My daughter probably doesn't drink water in the day.

543
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:07,725
[SPEAKER_31]: I forced her to bring water, but it's never drank because she probably just wanted to go in the freaking toilets.

544
00:43:08,846 --> 00:43:09,806
[SPEAKER_31]: Come on, people.

545
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:19,252
[SPEAKER_31]: And at one time, Paul said basically that bringing a pocket knife to school isn't a suspension offense.

546
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:19,953
[SPEAKER_31]: Is it now?

547
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:24,276
[SPEAKER_31]: Having a knife at school, is it now a suspending, you know, offense?

548
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:27,458
[SPEAKER_31]: You should be out of the school.

549
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:30,233
[SPEAKER_31]: There's been an arrest.

550
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:31,573
[SPEAKER_31]: There's been an arrest.

551
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:37,917
[SPEAKER_31]: And after that last one, when the girl got hurt, the crap beat out of her by those two sisters that were allowed to stay in school after threatening her life.

552
00:43:38,558 --> 00:43:39,238
[SPEAKER_31]: They beat her up.

553
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:41,079
[SPEAKER_31]: You guys, oh, we're going to get a study.

554
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:42,980
[SPEAKER_31]: What the hell is a study going to do?

555
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,941
[SPEAKER_31]: We need to shit now.

556
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,582
[SPEAKER_31]: Follow what's in the handbook.

557
00:43:45,842 --> 00:43:48,324
[SPEAKER_31]: These people need to be expelled, suspended.

558
00:43:48,644 --> 00:43:49,024
[SPEAKER_31]: Period.

559
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:52,166
[SPEAKER_31]: Not suspension in school, because that's woke and wonderful.

560
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:52,746
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

561
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:53,907
[SPEAKER_31]: They need to get out.

562
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:54,988
[SPEAKER_31]: Out.

563
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,055
[SPEAKER_26]: Diana Santiago, Paris Street.

564
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,101
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very concerning everything that's been going on.

565
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:15,425
[SPEAKER_26]: And I hear a lot of the law, the law, the law.

566
00:44:17,017 --> 00:44:23,199
[SPEAKER_26]: And yes, there is a law, but sometimes laws have changed and evolved, and they've gone too far in one way.

567
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:25,780
[SPEAKER_26]: And you're saying your back is against the wall.

568
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, this can be the element of change.

569
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:34,522
[SPEAKER_26]: The laws need to change so that your back is not against the wall saying, I'm sorry, I can't do anything.

570
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,463
[SPEAKER_26]: Kids are getting beaten.

571
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:39,043
[SPEAKER_26]: Are we going to be here three months from now when someone's kid is dead?

572
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:40,544
[SPEAKER_26]: Then will the law change?

573
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:48,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's instead of being the legacy of Medford of violence for the last 30 years let's be Medford leading the country.

574
00:44:49,177 --> 00:44:51,279
[SPEAKER_26]: My sister is a fourth grade teacher in New York.

575
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,781
[SPEAKER_26]: I have friends who are teaching in California.

576
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:58,445
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the same systemic problem everywhere that's adopted this policy.

577
00:44:59,105 --> 00:45:08,497
[SPEAKER_26]: My teacher, friends and my sister have been told, if a child is beating up another child, no matter how severely you can not touch them, or you will be fired.

578
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:14,104
[SPEAKER_26]: That is the message that is getting delivered to the children, and the teachers in other school systems.

579
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:15,486
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not saying it's Medford.

580
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:17,809
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm talking about the systemic problem.

581
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:24,778
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to make sure that is not where our country is going and that's not where our town is going.

582
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:27,139
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm asking you guys to do better, be better.

583
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:38,141
[SPEAKER_26]: If law doesn't work, then get in Desi, get in whoever we need to, the governor, and change it for our town and for everybody else.

584
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:42,122
[SPEAKER_26]: Because we have hundreds of victims at the school.

585
00:45:42,162 --> 00:45:48,044
[SPEAKER_26]: There's the one that got beat, but there's all the other kids who are suffering the anguish of, am I next?

586
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:57,452
[SPEAKER_26]: No one should have to move here and send their kids to school being like, oh, well, which one is gonna get pummeled next or seriously hurt?

587
00:45:58,773 --> 00:46:00,094
[SPEAKER_26]: This should be happening now.

588
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:03,496
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's do better, be better together.

589
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:09,600
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't just sit there and tell me I can't do anything because the law, then let's change it to make it better.

590
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,583
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's find who is succeeding in this country in having better programs for everybody.

591
00:46:15,924 --> 00:46:16,324
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

592
00:46:16,505 --> 00:46:16,765
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

593
00:46:26,237 --> 00:46:28,999
[SPEAKER_42]: Good evening, Sean Began, Lawrence Road, Medford.

594
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:36,725
[SPEAKER_42]: I wanted to talk a little bit about messaging and perceptions.

595
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:44,151
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think there's a problem with both the messaging and it's become a problem of perception.

596
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:55,921
[SPEAKER_42]: Right now, there seems to be a perception amongst some of the students at the high school that the high school is an acceptable and maybe even the preferred place

597
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:58,421
[SPEAKER_42]: to settle your differences by having a fight.

598
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:01,063
[SPEAKER_42]: And those fights are becoming more serious.

599
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:01,963
[SPEAKER_42]: There's no doubt about it.

600
00:47:03,044 --> 00:47:05,927
[SPEAKER_42]: Uh, so how did we get to this point?

601
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:13,493
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think that also goes to the messaging that's been coming in from adults.

602
00:47:13,773 --> 00:47:16,375
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'm not blaming teachers.

603
00:47:16,515 --> 00:47:17,916
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm not blaming administrators.

604
00:47:17,976 --> 00:47:19,678
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm not blaming politicians.

605
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:24,375
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm speaking in regards to adults in general, and that includes me as a parent.

606
00:47:24,495 --> 00:47:39,106
[SPEAKER_42]: It includes everyone who has a child in the school system, the messaging to these kids over the past two years, when they were dealing with COVID in regards to their education has been horrible and we've allowed it.

607
00:47:39,947 --> 00:47:41,848
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think we're reaping what we sowed.

608
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:49,814
[SPEAKER_42]: This is some of the messaging that I've heard and that I've experienced and that I've been told about over the past couple of years.

609
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:53,543
[SPEAKER_42]: Come to class or don't, it doesn't matter.

610
00:47:53,783 --> 00:47:55,644
[SPEAKER_42]: If you don't show up to class, there's no consequence.

611
00:47:56,644 --> 00:47:59,146
[SPEAKER_42]: Cheat your way through the school year, doesn't matter.

612
00:48:00,246 --> 00:48:02,207
[SPEAKER_42]: We know you're doing it, we're not gonna do anything about it.

613
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:05,889
[SPEAKER_42]: Talk back to your teacher, it doesn't matter.

614
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,451
[SPEAKER_42]: In general, do whatever makes you feel good.

615
00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:20,796
[SPEAKER_42]: And it's little wonder to me that when we reinforce bad behavior, it then becomes criminal behavior sooner or later.

616
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:23,729
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's what we're dealing with today is criminal behavior.

617
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:40,121
[SPEAKER_42]: And if there's a perception, and I think it's a misperception, but there seems to be a perception amongst some students and some parents that there's no consequences for students that misbehave.

618
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:45,745
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think this perception needs to be corrected immediately.

619
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:50,048
[SPEAKER_42]: If this perception is not corrected,

620
00:48:51,064 --> 00:49:01,329
[SPEAKER_42]: rather this misperception, then the perception becomes the reality, the fighting will continue, and it will continue to escalate.

621
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:10,254
[SPEAKER_42]: The school handbook, and I'm surprised, maybe I missed it, but I haven't heard this tonight from anyone.

622
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:15,897
[SPEAKER_42]: The school handbook very clearly states that fighting is a suspendable offense.

623
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:18,018
[SPEAKER_42]: It states it right there, it's in black and white.

624
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:35,715
[SPEAKER_42]: There's Massachusetts general laws that very clearly state that if a student brings a weapon onto campus, nevermind using the weapon, just brings the weapon, that's an expellable offense.

625
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:37,556
[SPEAKER_42]: That's state law.

626
00:49:38,716 --> 00:49:44,719
[SPEAKER_42]: Now, these are also guidelines and state laws that Medford has adopted.

627
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,141
[SPEAKER_42]: These are things that apply to Medford students.

628
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:51,783
[SPEAKER_42]: So we shouldn't have the misperception that they don't apply.

629
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:55,578
[SPEAKER_42]: But I think we have a misperception that they're not enforced.

630
00:49:56,718 --> 00:50:01,259
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think that also, again, is a misperception.

631
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:14,263
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to assume, and I don't think it's a big assumption, I'm going to assume that the student that brought a knife onto campus today and used that knife in a fight is being expelled.

632
00:50:15,124 --> 00:50:20,105
[SPEAKER_42]: And if I'm wrong, I'd like someone to correct me now because that

633
00:50:21,007 --> 00:50:23,649
[SPEAKER_42]: I think is a misperception that's going into this community.

634
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:25,870
[SPEAKER_42]: That student should be expelled.

635
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,871
[SPEAKER_42]: I expect that student will be expelled.

636
00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:32,474
[SPEAKER_42]: Everyone in the community needs to know that that student is being expelled.

637
00:50:33,055 --> 00:50:35,396
[SPEAKER_42]: And we don't need to know the student's name.

638
00:50:36,157 --> 00:50:46,103
[SPEAKER_42]: But when we get an email like we did today from the high school that says that the procedures in the student handbook will be followed, all right,

639
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:47,819
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't want to hear that.

640
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,880
[SPEAKER_42]: Don't make me go hunt for the student.

641
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,121
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, I'm an attorney.

642
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:52,241
[SPEAKER_42]: I love to look up laws.

643
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:53,342
[SPEAKER_42]: I research, whatever.

644
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:55,162
[SPEAKER_42]: Most people don't want to do that.

645
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:57,203
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, I spent an hour today doing it.

646
00:50:58,804 --> 00:50:59,684
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, that's me.

647
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:01,885
[SPEAKER_42]: Most people don't have the time to do that.

648
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:04,306
[SPEAKER_42]: Don't make them go look for this.

649
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:05,627
[SPEAKER_42]: Let them know.

650
00:51:06,954 --> 00:51:11,837
[SPEAKER_42]: If something like what happened today is going to happen, that child will no longer be in school.

651
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:13,418
[SPEAKER_42]: End of story.

652
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:17,981
[SPEAKER_42]: You don't have to worry about that child coming back to school because that's the worry.

653
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:31,268
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's the worry of the kids too, that these, that the children that are misbehaving, that have been allowed to get this, be emboldened to, to the extent that they think nothing is going to happen to them.

654
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:34,030
[SPEAKER_42]: That has to change very quickly.

655
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:38,449
[SPEAKER_42]: If it requires expelling 10 kids, expel 10 kids.

656
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:41,992
[SPEAKER_42]: If it requires expelling 50 kids, expel 50 kids.

657
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:43,312
[SPEAKER_42]: Do it quickly.

658
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:44,853
[SPEAKER_42]: Make the change now.

659
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:52,178
[SPEAKER_42]: And please, please, I would love to see a little emotion.

660
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,159
[SPEAKER_42]: Get angry about this.

661
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,582
[SPEAKER_42]: Someone on this committee, get angry about what's happened today.

662
00:51:57,662 --> 00:52:01,624
[SPEAKER_42]: Let us hear that you're pissed off.

663
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:04,306
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, don't sit on your hands tonight.

664
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:09,719
[SPEAKER_42]: I know everyone's worried about public meeting law and whatever it might be.

665
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,381
[SPEAKER_42]: Don't worry about it.

666
00:52:11,581 --> 00:52:12,381
[SPEAKER_42]: No one's reporting.

667
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:13,822
[SPEAKER_42]: You get a little angry.

668
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:17,946
[SPEAKER_42]: Let us hear what's going to happen and don't be so coy in the future.

669
00:52:18,106 --> 00:52:18,466
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

670
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:29,714
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Rousseau and then miss miss Puccio from online.

671
00:52:29,915 --> 00:52:30,375
[SPEAKER_33]: So members

672
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:31,552
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

673
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:44,682
[SPEAKER_41]: I, this is a question I don't know if our attorney can answer the question or the superintendent knows the answer but I do not believe we can legally tell anybody what the consequences of a disciplinary action were, even if we are not talking about a student by name.

674
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,485
[SPEAKER_41]: Nobody in Medford knows who the student is.

675
00:52:48,505 --> 00:52:50,446
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm assuming somebody knows who the student is.

676
00:52:50,527 --> 00:52:52,628
[SPEAKER_41]: I also assume somebody knows who the victim was.

677
00:52:53,089 --> 00:53:00,175
[SPEAKER_41]: So, you know, it'd be like talking about, well, the president, we won't mention his name, is in trouble and this is the consequence.

678
00:53:00,355 --> 00:53:08,021
[SPEAKER_41]: So the school committee also does not receive any notification and cannot have access to information about the consequences.

679
00:53:08,622 --> 00:53:08,702
[SPEAKER_41]: And

680
00:53:10,345 --> 00:53:15,288
[SPEAKER_41]: That's just a fact, whether or not the superintendent can tell the community that expulsion will happen.

681
00:53:15,308 --> 00:53:22,451
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't know the answer to that question but I do know that we cannot receive notification that a student will be expelled.

682
00:53:23,352 --> 00:53:24,532
[SPEAKER_41]: I can read the law as well.

683
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:30,495
[SPEAKER_41]: If there was a murder, I think it's fairly safe to say that most of us would conclude an expulsion was on its way.

684
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:38,640
[SPEAKER_41]: You know, but, but we will not receive that notification, ever.

685
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:49,872
[SPEAKER_41]: And so I just think it's important when asking these questions to, to be clear who you're asking, because you won't get the answer from the seven school committee members, what the answer is, ever.

686
00:53:54,318 --> 00:54:00,885
[SPEAKER_41]: We do not write the law, you all get to change the law by going to your state reps, we write resolutions all the time.

687
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:05,931
[SPEAKER_41]: We are always calling our state reps and state senators and saying, we don't like this law.

688
00:54:06,231 --> 00:54:07,653
[SPEAKER_41]: We want this law change.

689
00:54:07,933 --> 00:54:13,379
[SPEAKER_41]: We have one on the thing tonight, exactly that I have the floor, so you can wait Mr beacon.

690
00:54:13,899 --> 00:54:14,160
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

691
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,290
[SPEAKER_42]: I'll wait patiently.

692
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:16,791
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

693
00:54:16,931 --> 00:54:17,971
[SPEAKER_42]: But I want to be heard.

694
00:54:18,231 --> 00:54:20,152
[SPEAKER_41]: I've heard people say they want to change the law.

695
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:22,473
[SPEAKER_41]: There are so many laws I want to change.

696
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:28,336
[SPEAKER_41]: And I think many of us have very specific laws in common with all of you that we want to change.

697
00:54:28,676 --> 00:54:30,157
[SPEAKER_41]: But we don't write those laws.

698
00:54:30,537 --> 00:54:37,960
[SPEAKER_41]: We call our state reps most many of us know our state reps and state senators, and we give them our opinion very often.

699
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,859
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, but we don't like the laws.

700
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:46,748
[SPEAKER_41]: So, you have a choice, we can break the laws, which I know that some people are quite comfortable with.

701
00:54:48,408 --> 00:55:01,563
[SPEAKER_41]: And therefore, if we break the laws, if we break the laws, then the people that we broke the laws, you know if we just sit up here and we somehow know the information about somebody who's accused of something, and we disclose it.

702
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:08,872
[SPEAKER_41]: Well, that make make us all feel good until we have to write the check as a city for violating the law, so we are not.

703
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,290
[SPEAKER_41]: None of us are afraid.

704
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:15,692
[SPEAKER_41]: We are also not going to get that information to share it with you because we're not going to get it.

705
00:55:15,752 --> 00:55:15,932
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

706
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:17,512
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. Beacon is going to tell me how I'm wrong now.

707
00:55:17,753 --> 00:55:18,033
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

708
00:55:18,053 --> 00:55:18,573
[SPEAKER_33]: No, no.

709
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:25,855
[SPEAKER_42]: Madam chair.

710
00:55:29,797 --> 00:55:38,019
[SPEAKER_42]: I can't believe that I just asked this body to not be coy and be more direct.

711
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,380
[SPEAKER_42]: And what I got.

712
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:44,684
[SPEAKER_42]: And what I heard was five minutes of being coy and not being direct.

713
00:55:45,784 --> 00:55:47,365
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a very simple matter.

714
00:55:47,825 --> 00:55:49,406
[SPEAKER_42]: It's a simple matter of messaging.

715
00:55:50,286 --> 00:55:55,209
[SPEAKER_42]: Let's not get into the weeds about what the law is or isn't.

716
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:57,210
[SPEAKER_42]: It's a simple matter of messaging.

717
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:02,232
[SPEAKER_42]: A kid brought a knife to school today and stabbed someone.

718
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:03,833
[SPEAKER_42]: That's what happened.

719
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:07,335
[SPEAKER_42]: That person is going to be expelled.

720
00:56:08,507 --> 00:56:16,969
[SPEAKER_42]: If that person is not expelled from school, we have a serious problem because the law allows and calls for an expulsion.

721
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:18,829
[SPEAKER_42]: End of story.

722
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,390
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't need to know who the kid is.

723
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:35,253
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't need to know what the ultimate punishment was because in my mind, if it's not an expulsion and I find out that kid is back in school, I'm going to be back here and I'm going to be livid.

724
00:56:36,277 --> 00:56:36,517
[SPEAKER_42]: Right?

725
00:56:36,737 --> 00:56:38,638
[SPEAKER_42]: And everyone behind me is going to be livid.

726
00:56:39,098 --> 00:56:41,899
[SPEAKER_42]: And this is what I'm talking about when I'm talking about messaging.

727
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:45,240
[SPEAKER_42]: Be straight with the people in this city.

728
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,940
[SPEAKER_42]: It's very simple.

729
00:56:47,901 --> 00:56:49,461
[SPEAKER_42]: Just be straight with them.

730
00:56:50,121 --> 00:56:51,242
[SPEAKER_42]: This is what happened.

731
00:56:51,982 --> 00:56:54,523
[SPEAKER_42]: If X happens, Y will be the result.

732
00:56:54,983 --> 00:56:56,003
[SPEAKER_42]: It's very simple.

733
00:56:56,583 --> 00:57:02,345
[SPEAKER_42]: Let's stop, please, with the coyness, the smugness, the lectures.

734
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:02,985
[SPEAKER_42]: Enough.

735
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:18,337
[SPEAKER_41]: I appreciate that an attorney, I'm assuming who is a member of the bar doesn't think that the law matters.

736
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:28,081
[SPEAKER_41]: The law actually, if I could speak, the law does not actually include the school committee and discipline.

737
00:57:28,462 --> 00:57:31,623
[SPEAKER_41]: The principals have all authority on suspensions.

738
00:57:31,683 --> 00:57:37,366
[SPEAKER_41]: In fact, students can't even appeal it to the superintendent unless it's more than 10 days.

739
00:57:38,426 --> 00:57:44,509
[SPEAKER_41]: So, you know, if you wanna come and ask us to do stuff we can't do, and that makes you feel good, then you should do that.

740
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:49,291
[SPEAKER_41]: But if you want something to happen, then we do have to pay attention to the law.

741
00:57:52,432 --> 00:57:57,573
[SPEAKER_41]: You know, my daughter was also in that school texting me and I was very upset too.

742
00:57:57,813 --> 00:57:59,614
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm not just like some rando.

743
00:58:00,734 --> 00:58:02,735
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, I know how you felt.

744
00:58:03,155 --> 00:58:04,235
[SPEAKER_41]: I know how you felt.

745
00:58:04,595 --> 00:58:05,856
[SPEAKER_41]: My daughter was texting.

746
00:58:06,556 --> 00:58:07,876
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of order.

747
00:58:08,096 --> 00:58:11,017
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, my name is Ashley.

748
00:58:11,037 --> 00:58:13,198
[SPEAKER_33]: Point of order, member McLaughlin.

749
00:58:13,678 --> 00:58:16,219
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to ask if I might speak in order.

750
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:17,259
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

751
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:18,059
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

752
00:58:19,399 --> 00:58:21,100
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, thank you, Mr. Began.

753
00:58:22,073 --> 00:58:22,874
[SPEAKER_20]: for your comments.

754
00:58:23,054 --> 00:58:26,957
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that there's a little bit of misinformation in that as well.

755
00:58:26,997 --> 00:58:32,441
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sorry that people feel that we're being corny, but I do have to say that there are very strict laws.

756
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:38,987
[SPEAKER_20]: However, that said, in terms of FERPA and other things, I know people don't wanna hear it, but it is the fact, like it really is, number one.

757
00:58:39,427 --> 00:58:42,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Number two, we should care about all of our kids, right?

758
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:45,291
[SPEAKER_20]: We really should care about all of our kids and we really should.

759
00:58:45,432 --> 00:58:47,033
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't know the circumstances of today.

760
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:48,474
[SPEAKER_20]: I know what I'm hearing from other people.

761
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:49,795
[SPEAKER_20]: I know what the bit that I've heard

762
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:53,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, from, from administration or what have you, but I don't know the details.

763
00:58:53,859 --> 00:59:00,944
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even entirely know the details from the previous event because of some of the things that I am not literally allowed to know because of the law.

764
00:59:01,264 --> 00:59:04,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you guys do because, or I assume many do.

765
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,670
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have children in the high school, your children can come home and tell you who that child was.

766
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:12,112
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe if you have kids in elementary school that you don't, it gets to the grapevine.

767
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:13,433
[SPEAKER_20]: People start talking in the community.

768
00:59:13,473 --> 00:59:13,994
[SPEAKER_20]: It was this kid.

769
00:59:14,034 --> 00:59:14,534
[SPEAKER_20]: It was that kid.

770
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:16,035
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how people know who that is.

771
00:59:16,075 --> 00:59:16,476
[SPEAKER_20]: Number one.

772
00:59:16,816 --> 00:59:16,936
[SPEAKER_20]: But

773
00:59:17,574 --> 00:59:27,619
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, as a, as an individual, we can't say that, but I do want to say like going back to the bullying law, when we're talking about laws being changed, laws being changed, like the bullying law in Massachusetts, do people know how that law was created?

774
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:28,379
[SPEAKER_20]: Right?

775
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:32,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Phoebe, right from Western Massachusetts, the girl that was bullied to death, right?

776
00:59:33,382 --> 00:59:34,583
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the law that happened here.

777
00:59:35,043 --> 00:59:37,524
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't, none of us want to see this happen with our kids.

778
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:39,285
[SPEAKER_20]: None of us want to see a Parkland.

779
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:42,068
[SPEAKER_20]: or Newtown or any of those things.

780
00:59:42,108 --> 00:59:42,909
[SPEAKER_20]: This is horrible.

781
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:44,070
[SPEAKER_20]: We know this is horrible.

782
00:59:44,431 --> 00:59:45,532
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm losing sleep over it.

783
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:47,134
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure you guys are losing sleep over it.

784
00:59:47,474 --> 00:59:48,255
[SPEAKER_20]: It's my kids too.

785
00:59:48,315 --> 00:59:49,136
[SPEAKER_20]: It's your kids too.

786
00:59:49,476 --> 00:59:50,377
[SPEAKER_20]: We all really care.

787
00:59:50,438 --> 00:59:52,880
[SPEAKER_20]: I know people are groaning because it's like drone on, drone on.

788
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,221
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

789
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:53,962
[SPEAKER_20]: I care too.

790
00:59:54,402 --> 00:59:55,343
[SPEAKER_20]: I really, really do.

791
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,045
[SPEAKER_20]: And what are we going to do about it?

792
00:59:59,505 --> 01:00:01,066
[SPEAKER_20]: People are coming up here saying change the law.

793
01:00:01,486 --> 01:00:02,767
[SPEAKER_20]: How do you change the law?

794
01:00:02,787 --> 01:00:03,967
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you guys know how you do that?

795
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:08,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Same thing, I've been advocating for years for laws to be changed.

796
01:00:08,569 --> 01:00:13,010
[SPEAKER_20]: I go to the State House, I protest, I do hearings, I give my story, I do all kinds of stuff.

797
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:13,851
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't just get to go.

798
01:00:14,591 --> 01:00:15,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Change the law.

799
01:00:15,391 --> 01:00:16,111
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish I did.

800
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:17,332
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't.

801
01:00:17,932 --> 01:00:22,433
[SPEAKER_20]: But we can, as a community, get together and make a friggin' difference and change our schools.

802
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:24,054
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, we can do that.

803
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:25,594
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have to work together.

804
01:00:25,614 --> 01:00:27,015
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't fight with each other.

805
01:00:28,075 --> 01:00:28,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Follow the handbook.

806
01:00:28,895 --> 01:00:31,356
[SPEAKER_20]: If it says, okay, if it says, if the handbook says.

807
01:00:32,216 --> 01:01:01,537
[SPEAKER_20]: okay if a handbook says there's a weapon and if the handbook says there's a weapon and weapons result in expulsion if that's what the handbook says then that I assume is going to be what is going to be happening because that is what the handbook says but if there's a legal issue that we don't know about because maybe there's some presumption of innocence for something not this case I don't know I'm talking about any cases we don't know all the details nor do you so we can't just automatically and arbitrarily say this is what should happen with that kid and that's what should happen with this kid that's not how it works

808
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:02,737
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know what?

809
01:01:03,158 --> 01:01:04,838
[SPEAKER_20]: I can sit here and argue with you guys all day long.

810
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:06,979
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't want to hear it because you're angry, and I don't blame you.

811
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,860
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

812
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:09,440
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

813
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,221
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't blame you.

814
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:14,763
[SPEAKER_20]: When your kid is in danger, you feel your kid is threatened, I would be the exact same way.

815
01:01:14,863 --> 01:01:16,243
[SPEAKER_20]: I have been the exact same way.

816
01:01:16,704 --> 01:01:17,284
[SPEAKER_20]: We should be.

817
01:01:17,564 --> 01:01:21,846
[SPEAKER_20]: But how do we turn this negativity into community and frigging collaborate?

818
01:01:22,106 --> 01:01:23,046
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, just follow the handbook.

819
01:01:23,387 --> 01:01:24,347
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all we have to do?

820
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:25,988
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's not all we have to do.

821
01:01:26,008 --> 01:01:27,248
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not going to change at all.

822
01:01:27,649 --> 01:01:28,209
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's not.

823
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:32,653
[SPEAKER_20]: I disagree, but I'm happy to work with anybody that does want to make positive change.

824
01:01:32,673 --> 01:01:33,054
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

825
01:01:33,154 --> 01:01:33,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

826
01:01:34,075 --> 01:01:34,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

827
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:35,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

828
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:38,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Puccio, then we'll take our resident at the floor.

829
01:01:44,345 --> 01:01:45,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, can you hear me?

830
01:01:46,147 --> 01:01:46,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, thank you.

831
01:01:47,428 --> 01:01:49,751
[SPEAKER_25]: Gabrielle Puccio, I live on 11 Painter Street.

832
01:01:50,672 --> 01:01:50,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

833
01:01:51,866 --> 01:01:56,375
[SPEAKER_25]: I spoke about a year ago voicing the same concerns I'm going to talk about tonight.

834
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:02,527
[SPEAKER_25]: I was one of the first students appointed to student advisory board and I'm senior class president.

835
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:16,938
[SPEAKER_25]: And I've understood the patterns in the city and I know that most of my concerns will either be ignored, swept under a rug or misunderstood, but I'm gonna try and get through to you for the sake of my classmates and for those who aren't lucky enough to graduate this year with me.

836
01:02:17,978 --> 01:02:31,226
[SPEAKER_25]: The only things I want to be worrying about during my senior year are upcoming deadlines and tests, but the reoccurring violence at my school is not only horrifying, but leaves me left to wonder what's to happen to me each day as I walk through the doors.

837
01:02:31,966 --> 01:02:37,788
[SPEAKER_25]: Will I be body slammed into cold floor tiles, or will I be repeatedly stabbed with a knife?

838
01:02:38,408 --> 01:02:41,809
[SPEAKER_25]: Will I be sent to the hospital with life-threatening injuries?

839
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:48,430
[SPEAKER_25]: If the student safety is so important to this entire committee, then why are we only hearing from two members?

840
01:02:49,151 --> 01:02:50,311
[SPEAKER_25]: Jobs are not being done.

841
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:53,432
[SPEAKER_25]: Just because it's not your child does not mean it's any less important.

842
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,161
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm tired of my parents worrying about me each morning when I say goodbye to them.

843
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:02,362
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm tired of being educated in an environment where I have to fear for my life.

844
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:04,982
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm tired of these incidents not having solutions.

845
01:03:05,123 --> 01:03:09,764
[SPEAKER_25]: And most of all, I'm tired of having to share my concerns to a group who does not implement change.

846
01:03:10,604 --> 01:03:14,085
[SPEAKER_25]: Political agendas and fall promises do not save student lives.

847
01:03:14,585 --> 01:03:17,786
[SPEAKER_25]: Ignoring the issue is one step closer to a student losing their life.

848
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:23,327
[SPEAKER_25]: And at this rate, none of us would honestly be surprised, please, for the sake of the students in this city.

849
01:03:24,744 --> 01:03:28,867
[SPEAKER_25]: Please find a way to ease our anxiety and propose ideas to improve this broken system.

850
01:03:29,487 --> 01:03:30,928
[SPEAKER_25]: This is what you were elected to do.

851
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:33,350
[SPEAKER_25]: And right now it's unfortunate that you're failing us.

852
01:03:34,371 --> 01:03:37,233
[SPEAKER_25]: I think you'd all rather listen to our concerns than attend our funeral.

853
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:40,335
[SPEAKER_25]: Please expel all the students involved in the incident today.

854
01:03:40,856 --> 01:03:41,196
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

855
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:52,014
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, my name is Ashlyn Barr, 50 Brooks Street.

856
01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:58,359
[SPEAKER_30]: I was gonna say something about changing the laws, and I understand that it's not just snap your fingers, change the laws.

857
01:03:58,379 --> 01:03:59,620
[SPEAKER_30]: There's a lot that goes into it.

858
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,123
[SPEAKER_30]: I think what's really important is to have a better communication.

859
01:04:03,443 --> 01:04:08,667
[SPEAKER_30]: The communication, just for a small piece for today's incident, was terrible, okay?

860
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:10,829
[SPEAKER_30]: It was on three different platforms.

861
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:12,890
[SPEAKER_30]: It wasn't good.

862
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:18,635
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, the communication at the high school is to the point where if I even try to call my kid out sick,

863
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:23,238
[SPEAKER_30]: The phone system doesn't even work so we're starting from the but we need to start from the bottom up with that.

864
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:32,086
[SPEAKER_30]: But aside from all of that, and communication from your representatives you were voted to be our representatives you work for us, we need communication from you.

865
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:35,088
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know how to change laws, I'm an average citizen.

866
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:41,133
[SPEAKER_30]: This is the first time I've ever come to a school committee meeting, because I'm enraged with what's going on in my kids high school.

867
01:04:42,034 --> 01:04:45,158
[SPEAKER_30]: Our children feel like we're not going to do anything.

868
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:46,960
[SPEAKER_30]: We heard it from four students today.

869
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,885
[SPEAKER_30]: We heard it from the president of the class and I heard it from my sophomore and his best friend today.

870
01:04:51,926 --> 01:04:53,287
[SPEAKER_30]: Shame on us.

871
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:59,715
[SPEAKER_30]: Our children should not feel like we're not going to do anything and that none of this is going to elicit change.

872
01:05:00,489 --> 01:05:02,011
[SPEAKER_30]: They should be going to school to learn.

873
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:04,814
[SPEAKER_30]: Teachers should not be using bathroom monitors.

874
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:06,455
[SPEAKER_30]: Teachers went to school to teach.

875
01:05:06,555 --> 01:05:09,959
[SPEAKER_30]: They didn't teach to go to school to be security officers and break up fights.

876
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,241
[SPEAKER_30]: It shouldn't come with the territory.

877
01:05:13,191 --> 01:05:16,454
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe I'm thinking in La La Land, but it's not the way it's supposed to be.

878
01:05:16,895 --> 01:05:20,378
[SPEAKER_30]: Our kids need to be able to feel safe in school and learn.

879
01:05:20,758 --> 01:05:22,000
[SPEAKER_30]: You heard it from the students.

880
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:27,885
[SPEAKER_30]: I want you to do a forum with leadership for our students.

881
01:05:28,286 --> 01:05:33,190
[SPEAKER_30]: And so you can hear them talk and hear directly from them that they don't feel supported.

882
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:36,132
[SPEAKER_30]: and that they feel that nothing's going to change.

883
01:05:36,692 --> 01:05:37,652
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll show up to that.

884
01:05:38,073 --> 01:05:39,153
[SPEAKER_30]: We should all show up to that.

885
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:40,834
[SPEAKER_30]: Teachers should show up to that.

886
01:05:41,194 --> 01:05:42,274
[SPEAKER_30]: Teachers need to be heard.

887
01:05:43,094 --> 01:05:44,195
[SPEAKER_30]: We're going to lose teachers.

888
01:05:44,215 --> 01:05:45,575
[SPEAKER_30]: We're going to lose students.

889
01:05:46,336 --> 01:05:47,176
[SPEAKER_30]: I have an eighth grader.

890
01:05:47,196 --> 01:05:49,617
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think I'm sending him to Medford High.

891
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:53,273
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, that's a huge financial burden for my family.

892
01:05:53,593 --> 01:05:57,333
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't wanna have to make that decision, but it's pretty much looking that way right now.

893
01:05:57,914 --> 01:05:59,794
[SPEAKER_30]: So we have a lot of work to do.

894
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:02,875
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm here to listen to advice from you.

895
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:04,475
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know how to do it.

896
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:10,036
[SPEAKER_30]: We need better communication, but this like constant fighting thing isn't gonna solve any problems at all.

897
01:06:10,756 --> 01:06:14,517
[SPEAKER_30]: Please, as a community, we need better communication.

898
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:15,097
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

899
01:06:15,117 --> 01:06:15,477
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

900
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:15,837
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

901
01:06:17,018 --> 01:06:19,058
[SPEAKER_30]: Jessica, Jessica.

902
01:06:20,046 --> 01:06:21,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna go one-on-one, Jessica.

903
01:06:31,538 --> 01:06:33,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Cushing, did you unmute her?

904
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:34,161
[SPEAKER_33]: Thanks.

905
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:36,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

906
01:06:37,565 --> 01:06:39,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Jessica Healy, Full Lock Road.

907
01:06:42,409 --> 01:06:49,804
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say that I'm noticing one of the biggest issues that we've had in this city for the past.

908
01:06:51,698 --> 01:07:02,241
[SPEAKER_15]: A few years now, I don't know what it's been, four, maybe five years, is we've had elected officials now that are with the revolution.

909
01:07:02,961 --> 01:07:04,661
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't care what anyone has to say.

910
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:06,762
[SPEAKER_15]: They are just too political.

911
01:07:07,122 --> 01:07:13,803
[SPEAKER_15]: They're too worried about what everything looks like, if everything is, you know, politically the right way.

912
01:07:14,424 --> 01:07:16,224
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't want police in our school.

913
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:19,285
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't think that's safe for people of color.

914
01:07:20,385 --> 01:07:22,167
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just it's gotten out of control.

915
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:41,605
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't want kids to be suspended or expelled Because that's not fair to people of color and it's Not good for kids of color because they get suspended or expelled more So now the kids know That they can run the school

916
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:49,581
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is what's going on the kids have run medford high now The teachers can't do it.

917
01:07:50,141 --> 01:07:59,505
[SPEAKER_15]: The principal can't keep up And we don't have the resources there To help control the kids anymore.

918
01:07:59,866 --> 01:08:07,309
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no fear at all So the kids know that they can do whatever they want in that school

919
01:08:08,294 --> 01:08:09,255
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what they're doing.

920
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:18,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what we're waiting for for a child not to show up at home one day Because they're going in the hospital.

921
01:08:19,022 --> 01:08:22,525
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not going to make it home And that's when you're going to say.

922
01:08:22,545 --> 01:08:34,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we really should do this That's all I gotta say is we have to get resource offices I always said in every one of our schools and definitely more in the high school because it's gotten out of control up there.

923
01:08:35,435 --> 01:08:35,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you

924
01:08:42,072 --> 01:08:46,675
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Dr. Maurice, members of the school committee.

925
01:08:47,655 --> 01:08:50,957
[SPEAKER_34]: First, I want to say, well first, I'm Steven South.

926
01:08:51,237 --> 01:08:52,858
[SPEAKER_34]: I live at 106 Damon Road.

927
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:57,301
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm also the secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 25.

928
01:08:57,901 --> 01:09:07,847
[SPEAKER_34]: We represent all the school custodians, the security personnel, the assistant principals, directors, and school administrators, coordinators.

929
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:22,265
[SPEAKER_34]: First, I want to talk about a couple of weeks ago, the school committee approved a $50,000 study to look into, I guess, all the violence going on.

930
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:30,869
[SPEAKER_34]: But first, I wanna provide you all with some facts and some free advice that doesn't cost 50,000 because I'm there every week, my members are there every day.

931
01:09:31,957 --> 01:09:34,080
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, let me talk about the facts.

932
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:45,497
[SPEAKER_34]: Fact number one is years ago there were more than a dozen security guards in the Medford public schools, the last of which retired in March of this year, Bill Mosaic.

933
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:53,813
[SPEAKER_34]: I was informed shortly after he retired that they were no longer going to have security guards at Medford public schools.

934
01:09:53,873 --> 01:09:56,915
[SPEAKER_34]: This was by the administration that they were no longer needed.

935
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:02,479
[SPEAKER_34]: So my recommendation is that you use the 50,000 and hire another security guard.

936
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:14,788
[SPEAKER_34]: And then I've also talked to city counselors who I believe there's several in the crowd that would be more than willing to provide extra funding for security guards.

937
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:15,789
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's one.

938
01:10:16,724 --> 01:10:20,227
[SPEAKER_34]: Number two, and we're talking about the decline in security.

939
01:10:20,267 --> 01:10:21,828
[SPEAKER_34]: This is all in the last few years.

940
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:31,437
[SPEAKER_34]: Previous to this school year, there was always a security monitor at the back door of Medford High School

941
01:10:32,093 --> 01:10:35,196
[SPEAKER_34]: from 2.15 when school ended until 9 p.m.

942
01:10:35,556 --> 01:10:38,518
[SPEAKER_34]: when the last school event ended at that back door.

943
01:10:38,538 --> 01:10:39,759
[SPEAKER_34]: And it's called door 31.

944
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,821
[SPEAKER_34]: It's where the pool and the gyms are.

945
01:10:42,422 --> 01:10:51,429
[SPEAKER_34]: There was always a security person there every single day, seven days a week, signing people in, checking IDs, signing people out.

946
01:10:51,449 --> 01:10:58,034
[SPEAKER_34]: And I know it's expensive, you have to pay personnel, but that's to make sure that this,

947
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:10,281
[SPEAKER_34]: School administration knows every single human being that's in that school after the school day ends and be able to monitor who's visiting the school's property.

948
01:11:11,107 --> 01:11:13,209
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, last year that was ended.

949
01:11:13,589 --> 01:11:16,892
[SPEAKER_34]: We were told it was too expensive and it was no longer needed.

950
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:28,842
[SPEAKER_34]: Now at 2.15 every day, my members, your employees are instructed to unlock the back door and it's unlocked from 2.15 till 9 p.m.

951
01:11:28,922 --> 01:11:29,342
[SPEAKER_34]: every day.

952
01:11:29,903 --> 01:11:34,907
[SPEAKER_34]: And by the way, I was here a few months ago reporting on the same thing and nothing was done about it.

953
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:39,350
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe that was right before the summer began I was here.

954
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:41,973
[SPEAKER_34]: spoke on this same exact thing.

955
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:46,838
[SPEAKER_34]: So also on the weekends, we used to have someone there from 7 a.m.

956
01:11:46,898 --> 01:11:47,658
[SPEAKER_34]: to 9 p.m.

957
01:11:48,099 --> 01:11:52,023
[SPEAKER_34]: at the back door, signing people in, checking IDs, signing people out.

958
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:59,810
[SPEAKER_34]: So this administration knew every single human being that was in Medford High School when it was not in session.

959
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:03,273
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm talking outside of the children that go there.

960
01:12:04,013 --> 01:12:05,834
[SPEAKER_34]: So that goes on no longer.

961
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:12,519
[SPEAKER_34]: People can walk in, they can hide weapons or drugs or anything else they want to, they can have their run of the school.

962
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:14,720
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, that's going on.

963
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:22,665
[SPEAKER_34]: Someone earlier, I can't remember who said we have two school resource officers, that's not true unless that just started, that is not true.

964
01:12:23,026 --> 01:12:33,413
[SPEAKER_34]: And as a matter of fact, in the last two years, there was about a year and three month period where there was zero school resource officers because the school resource officer was out injured

965
01:12:34,113 --> 01:12:39,895
[SPEAKER_34]: And when the police asked the administration if they wanted to have someone fill in, the answer was no.

966
01:12:39,995 --> 01:12:43,216
[SPEAKER_34]: So you went over a year without a school resource officer.

967
01:12:43,617 --> 01:12:50,119
[SPEAKER_34]: And I would challenge anyone here to try to refute that because again, I represent everybody at the schools.

968
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:51,420
[SPEAKER_34]: That's another fact.

969
01:12:51,500 --> 01:13:00,343
[SPEAKER_34]: So I also recommend that you have school resource officers that are permanent and that when they're out injured or on vacation or sick, because everyone

970
01:13:00,763 --> 01:13:03,084
[SPEAKER_34]: deserves time off, that they need to be replaced.

971
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:07,105
[SPEAKER_34]: There needs to be a police presence in Medford High School.

972
01:13:08,005 --> 01:13:19,568
[SPEAKER_34]: Also, I met with the administration earlier this year with a list of security concerns and I gave it to them in writing, you have it, none of which was addressed, not one thing.

973
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:24,630
[SPEAKER_34]: And one of the things on my list was to have metal detectors because my union,

974
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:33,344
[SPEAKER_34]: My union and my members are aware that there are knives and guns in Medford High School.

975
01:13:33,945 --> 01:13:38,888
[SPEAKER_34]: And that is dismissed as hearsay.

976
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:40,108
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a fact.

977
01:13:40,228 --> 01:13:41,909
[SPEAKER_34]: Today, let everyone know it's a fact.

978
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:43,630
[SPEAKER_34]: I've been saying it for the last two years.

979
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:49,514
[SPEAKER_34]: And there's been multiple other things that have happened that we all know that there's knives and guns.

980
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:52,734
[SPEAKER_34]: There's also drugs within Medford High School.

981
01:13:52,894 --> 01:14:03,698
[SPEAKER_34]: And I would ask all of you, and you probably can't name names or confirm, but I was also told by one of my members that there was an overdose at Medford High School today, the same day that there was a stabbing.

982
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:08,300
[SPEAKER_34]: So I would also ask that you put

983
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:11,648
[SPEAKER_34]: metal detectors at Medford High School.

984
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:12,969
[SPEAKER_34]: Other schools have them.

985
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:19,011
[SPEAKER_34]: I've been told by administration officials that it's not appropriate, but it is appropriate.

986
01:14:19,712 --> 01:14:28,456
[SPEAKER_34]: Now, the school security guards and the resource officers previously would monitor the hallways during class time.

987
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:33,859
[SPEAKER_34]: And as I heard a few speakers, I wanna confirm again, I'm here just to talk about facts.

988
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:40,574
[SPEAKER_34]: that every single day, there's hundreds of kids throughout the hallways during class time.

989
01:14:40,654 --> 01:14:41,615
[SPEAKER_34]: They're running rampant.

990
01:14:41,715 --> 01:14:44,597
[SPEAKER_34]: It's like the Wild West at Medford High School.

991
01:14:44,697 --> 01:14:48,940
[SPEAKER_34]: And I don't know who to blame, but there's no one to monitor them.

992
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,083
[SPEAKER_34]: There's someone at the front desk that's checking people in during the day.

993
01:14:54,545 --> 01:14:58,749
[SPEAKER_34]: But they can't leave the desk uncovered to go walk the halls.

994
01:14:59,269 --> 01:15:00,631
[SPEAKER_34]: So there's no security guards.

995
01:15:01,271 --> 01:15:07,156
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm told there's a resource officer, but how much ground can one person cover?

996
01:15:07,676 --> 01:15:14,982
[SPEAKER_34]: Now, when my members do see kids in bathrooms or in the hall and tell them to go back to class, they're often told,

997
01:15:15,703 --> 01:15:17,605
[SPEAKER_34]: to go F themselves or to F off.

998
01:15:17,905 --> 01:15:18,966
[SPEAKER_34]: And there's no discipline.

999
01:15:19,126 --> 01:15:19,747
[SPEAKER_34]: We all know it.

1000
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:25,171
[SPEAKER_34]: And this is a radical change in the last few years within the Medford school system.

1001
01:15:25,472 --> 01:15:26,192
[SPEAKER_34]: This is radical.

1002
01:15:26,212 --> 01:15:26,793
[SPEAKER_34]: I've watched it.

1003
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:31,537
[SPEAKER_34]: I've represented the school system, represented the workers in the school system since 2007.

1004
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:36,396
[SPEAKER_34]: So I've watched the decline of security here.

1005
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:40,497
[SPEAKER_34]: So we need to have somebody monitoring the children.

1006
01:15:41,017 --> 01:16:01,341
[SPEAKER_34]: And if somebody does something egregious, I'll tell you, every single week, my members have to paint the bathroom, paint the walls or the stalls in the bathroom, because there's graffiti written on the walls, including swastikas and other racial epithets that are on the walls, and they're just told paint over them.

1007
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:07,746
[SPEAKER_34]: That never hits the news, that never hits the school committee, that never hits, the parents are never told about that.

1008
01:16:08,366 --> 01:16:16,532
[SPEAKER_34]: But all I'm saying is, and I'm not casting blame on any one person, I heard that earlier someone say we can do better.

1009
01:16:16,832 --> 01:16:18,974
[SPEAKER_34]: But that's, I don't believe that.

1010
01:16:19,514 --> 01:16:24,678
[SPEAKER_34]: We will do better because this community is not going to accept what's going on here.

1011
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:28,040
[SPEAKER_34]: More funding needs to be put forth to security.

1012
01:16:28,441 --> 01:16:29,461
[SPEAKER_34]: I can tell you right now,

1013
01:16:30,262 --> 01:16:36,324
[SPEAKER_34]: Because of the low pay, a lot of the security monitors quit over the summer.

1014
01:16:36,364 --> 01:16:37,765
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe there were four that quit.

1015
01:16:38,205 --> 01:16:39,646
[SPEAKER_34]: So you hired all brand new people.

1016
01:16:39,706 --> 01:16:45,468
[SPEAKER_34]: So they've been there since September, September, October, November, December, four months, zero training.

1017
01:16:45,808 --> 01:16:50,870
[SPEAKER_34]: The new security employees are provided with zero training, nothing.

1018
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,671
[SPEAKER_34]: Where other school systems that we represent

1019
01:16:55,185 --> 01:16:56,446
[SPEAKER_34]: receive extensive training.

1020
01:16:57,027 --> 01:16:57,748
[SPEAKER_34]: Why is that?

1021
01:16:58,308 --> 01:17:01,392
[SPEAKER_34]: So this is a perfect storm for a disaster.

1022
01:17:02,212 --> 01:17:04,895
[SPEAKER_34]: I ask you all, do your part.

1023
01:17:05,796 --> 01:17:17,528
[SPEAKER_34]: The city council is very well willing, from what I've talked to today, are very well willing to provide additional funding if requested to the school for security.

1024
01:17:18,993 --> 01:17:21,174
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm not asking you that maybe it should happen.

1025
01:17:21,214 --> 01:17:24,055
[SPEAKER_34]: It has to happen, because this is unacceptable.

1026
01:17:24,435 --> 01:17:25,876
[SPEAKER_34]: The community won't accept it.

1027
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:27,297
[SPEAKER_34]: I won't accept it.

1028
01:17:27,357 --> 01:17:29,438
[SPEAKER_34]: Your employees and my members won't accept it.

1029
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,759
[SPEAKER_34]: I thank you all for your kind attention.

1030
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:32,619
[SPEAKER_34]: We will do better.

1031
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:38,042
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1032
01:17:38,142 --> 01:17:43,404
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. Murphy, Captain Covino, I don't know if you want to address anything before I call on our next speaker.

1033
01:17:48,592 --> 01:17:49,653
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Mayor.

1034
01:17:51,214 --> 01:18:03,261
[SPEAKER_40]: Just very, very brief response and very similar and consistent to what I responded with when Mr. South spoke at the previous meeting that he referred to in his presentation.

1035
01:18:05,842 --> 01:18:13,967
[SPEAKER_40]: It is very dangerous to get into the specifics of security protocols in a public meeting.

1036
01:18:15,017 --> 01:18:20,339
[SPEAKER_40]: I didn't do it the last time this conversation was broached, and we're not going to do it this time.

1037
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:39,665
[SPEAKER_40]: I want to say that the security monitor staff that Mr. South represents, as well as many other staff members, teachers, nurses, first and foremost, responded to today's situation

1038
01:18:41,465 --> 01:18:45,006
[SPEAKER_40]: with a tremendous amount of skill and responsiveness.

1039
01:18:45,426 --> 01:18:50,047
[SPEAKER_40]: And I know that the entire administration is grateful to those individuals for their work.

1040
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:59,609
[SPEAKER_40]: We as a school district have more security personnel than most comparable districts of our size.

1041
01:19:00,489 --> 01:19:08,891
[SPEAKER_40]: It is true, as Mr. South said, that as the needs of the district have evolved over a decades-long period of time, there are

1042
01:19:09,781 --> 01:19:12,462
[SPEAKER_40]: individuals classified into different positions.

1043
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:15,562
[SPEAKER_40]: But there is one security monitor assigned to each school.

1044
01:19:16,222 --> 01:19:21,284
[SPEAKER_40]: And for the high school, when fully staffed, we have over five.

1045
01:19:21,684 --> 01:19:26,005
[SPEAKER_40]: There has been fluidity, as Mr. South alluded to, in those positions.

1046
01:19:26,705 --> 01:19:37,007
[SPEAKER_40]: And again, in a context in which we have more staff members than frankly any district I know of our size, holding positions of that nature,

1047
01:19:37,742 --> 01:19:39,723
[SPEAKER_40]: um, to some extent that is inevitable.

1048
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:54,033
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, but they have at times been, uh, critical investment today certainly is that is at the top of that list and we're grateful to them for their service with respect to some of the specific protocols that Mr South referenced.

1049
01:19:54,733 --> 01:19:58,316
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, some of that information is accurate but incomplete.

1050
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:03,119
[SPEAKER_40]: The school district prior to my tenure implemented a series of infrastructure upgrades

1051
01:20:03,629 --> 01:20:10,015
[SPEAKER_40]: that essentially cordon off a large section of the building that is primarily used for athletics and extracurricular activities.

1052
01:20:10,536 --> 01:20:15,301
[SPEAKER_40]: And for that reason, there are different personnel needs that come with some of those infrastructure upgrades.

1053
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:19,865
[SPEAKER_40]: That being said, as I believe that Mr. South knows, but I'm certainly not

1054
01:20:21,477 --> 01:20:22,398
[SPEAKER_40]: I could be wrong about that.

1055
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:25,139
[SPEAKER_40]: So I'm not suggesting he's making any intentional misrepresentations.

1056
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:42,810
[SPEAKER_40]: When we hired over the summer for the specific security monitor position that he referenced, it was determined that in order to have a higher level of staffing during the day, the personnel initially retained to hold the afternoon position was moved to the day.

1057
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:50,235
[SPEAKER_40]: And we have continued to attempt to fill out the remainder of those positions so that even with the infrastructure updates that again,

1058
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:54,438
[SPEAKER_40]: cordoned off a section of the building so that no one can have access to the remainder of the school.

1059
01:20:55,098 --> 01:20:58,620
[SPEAKER_40]: We would like to have additional personnel and we're going to continue to try to do that.

1060
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:02,243
[SPEAKER_40]: Finally, and then I'll see the photo captain Gabino.

1061
01:21:02,263 --> 01:21:10,208
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, the suggestion that there is, it is a known fact that there are firearms in Medford High School is inaccurate.

1062
01:21:10,868 --> 01:21:15,511
[SPEAKER_40]: And just make that suggestion publicly is extraordinarily dangerous.

1063
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:16,572
[SPEAKER_40]: And

1064
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:23,154
[SPEAKER_40]: The comments tonight are very well taken and they're certainly heartfelt.

1065
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:27,997
[SPEAKER_40]: And as I think the mayor said earlier, and certainly members here as well.

1066
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:33,240
[SPEAKER_40]: Every single one of us who do this for a living and work in a school environment.

1067
01:21:33,761 --> 01:21:36,823
[SPEAKER_40]: We never want to be in a situation in which a single student

1068
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:45,939
[SPEAKER_40]: or a single family member feels as though the school environment is anything other than safe and secure and conducive to learning.

1069
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:50,721
[SPEAKER_40]: And to the extent that that's not the case right now, we have a responsibility to change that.

1070
01:21:51,141 --> 01:21:53,082
[SPEAKER_40]: We have a responsibility to do that urgently.

1071
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:58,865
[SPEAKER_40]: But we're not going to get to that point if we are spreading misinformation.

1072
01:21:59,585 --> 01:22:04,988
[SPEAKER_40]: and some of that information with respect to specific security threats is inaccurate.

1073
01:22:05,528 --> 01:22:16,655
[SPEAKER_40]: And the people of Medford need to understand both that it is inaccurate and that we are going to continue to prioritize the safety and security of Medford High School and every other school in the district captain.

1074
01:22:19,196 --> 01:22:19,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

1075
01:22:19,897 --> 01:22:25,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, in regards to firearms and any other type of weapons, we have not had a situation

1076
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:29,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that I can remember where we had to deal with firearms in the school.

1077
01:22:29,932 --> 01:22:32,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Our information doesn't always come just from the school.

1078
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:41,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes we get calls from parents, uh, concerned, uh, family members of pictures of kids posing on social media with, with, uh, firearms.

1079
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:48,323
[SPEAKER_03]: We've always investigated them 99.9% of the times they were toy guns and they were just trying to look cool.

1080
01:22:48,823 --> 01:22:49,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The other, um,

1081
01:22:50,163 --> 01:23:05,692
[SPEAKER_03]: small time, well actually it was once, it was a person who did pose, he was at a range actually in another country with a licensed firearms expert that he was shooting with to learn how to shoot and he was just taking a picture of him posing holding a rifle.

1082
01:23:06,953 --> 01:23:14,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So there has not been a situation where we've been confirmed firearms in the high school.

1083
01:23:14,718 --> 01:23:16,359
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been times when there were allegations

1084
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:25,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We took actions with ballistic dogs and we did have on some occasions portable metal detectors.

1085
01:23:25,696 --> 01:23:29,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal detectors have not proven to be a great diversion to crime.

1086
01:23:30,358 --> 01:23:43,825
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other things we can do from the bottom up with small things and small rules and keeping people in check that are probably more effective right now for what we're looking at than worrying about setting up metal detectors.

1087
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:52,412
[SPEAKER_03]: metal detectors are going to bring your kids an hour and a half early to get them into school because it's going to be a thorough search, not just of them walking through.

1088
01:23:53,673 --> 01:23:53,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1089
01:23:55,015 --> 01:23:58,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also carry bags and backpacks that have to be checked.

1090
01:23:58,237 --> 01:24:05,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are other things that can be done amongst the school itself that would be more effective and keep it safe.

1091
01:24:05,643 --> 01:24:08,506
[SPEAKER_33]: And the chief of police can maybe just reassure

1092
01:24:09,225 --> 01:24:18,888
[SPEAKER_33]: everybody in the audience, every listen from home, the school committee, that there is a safety plan that was updated and some actions that you've been taking with our administration, what you can share.

1093
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,908
[SPEAKER_33]: I know it's not all public, but.

1094
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:22,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1095
01:24:22,769 --> 01:24:31,571
[SPEAKER_01]: We often don't want to talk about a lot of the safety plans in general, but I can tell you that we have been working with the administration recently and want to develop a long-term safety plan with the school.

1096
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:33,071
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an ongoing process.

1097
01:24:33,431 --> 01:24:35,812
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, you know,

1098
01:24:37,691 --> 01:24:41,194
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly in depth at this point in time.

1099
01:24:41,254 --> 01:24:42,935
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will continue.

1100
01:24:43,295 --> 01:24:50,921
[SPEAKER_01]: And so will the support of the Metro Police Department to not only the administration, the school committee, but to the parents and the students.

1101
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:58,946
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I am thoroughly impressed with this evening is the students who came out here and spoke on behalf of their emotions and their families.

1102
01:25:00,407 --> 01:25:01,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I will add this.

1103
01:25:02,429 --> 01:25:06,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the students today we heard from and spoke to seem to have heard things and, you know,

1104
01:25:08,164 --> 01:25:13,228
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about isolated incidents, and that can be defined in different ways.

1105
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:20,374
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some evidence that what we're looking at today was somewhat of a planned event, when two individuals decide that they want to fight or they want to get together.

1106
01:25:21,195 --> 01:25:24,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, that information is not isolated, and other kids know about this.

1107
01:25:25,438 --> 01:25:33,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ask that if you want to help your schools, if you want to be safe, if you want to be part of a solution, to kind of let us know as a police department.

1108
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:43,510
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're restricted in a lot of ways what we could do as a police department, but we can certainly get involved in anything that involves the dangers of students and we will be there.

1109
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:48,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So we continue to offer that support and we'll continue to update on the security plans for the city.

1110
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:52,435
[SPEAKER_40]: Mayor, if I could just one very quick final comment.

1111
01:25:53,056 --> 01:26:05,107
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, the messages that are being articulated tonight, and the genuine frustration and anger that is that is being expressed, is, is more than understandable.

1112
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,189
[SPEAKER_40]: And there's no one within the administration.

1113
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:12,874
[SPEAKER_40]: And I know no one on the school committee, who fails to recognize that and to understand that.

1114
01:26:13,554 --> 01:26:13,975
[SPEAKER_40]: But as

1115
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:25,111
[SPEAKER_40]: This evening continues, and as additional comments are made, I implore those participating in public comment to refrain from discussing specific protocols.

1116
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:31,973
[SPEAKER_40]: It may be understood as to why you want to do that, and certainly the anger that is being felt tonight is understood.

1117
01:26:32,533 --> 01:26:37,895
[SPEAKER_40]: But getting into the specifics of our safety and security protocols will not make anyone safer.

1118
01:26:38,715 --> 01:26:42,856
[SPEAKER_40]: And so I would just ask that to be kept in mind, and I would ask the mayor, you as chair,

1119
01:26:44,943 --> 01:26:46,124
[SPEAKER_40]: Yep, make that happen.

1120
01:26:46,324 --> 01:26:46,585
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1121
01:26:47,225 --> 01:26:48,086
[SPEAKER_33]: Name and address the record.

1122
01:26:48,106 --> 01:26:52,170
[SPEAKER_33]: Then we're going to go to Tony tanks.

1123
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:53,071
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Anthony Guion.

1124
01:26:53,471 --> 01:26:59,197
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 45 Elm Hill Ave in Levenster, MA and I teach at Method High School in the C2 wing.

1125
01:27:00,444 --> 01:27:09,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk on two different levels today, and I want to start as a teacher in that C2 wing, and I want to stand up for my fellow educators.

1126
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:16,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand there are images today of teachers looking out the window seeming lackadaisical.

1127
01:27:18,087 --> 01:27:28,895
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who was lucky enough not to currently be in charge of 30 students at the time of the lockdown, I had a prep, someone who was able to go around and check if people need to use the bathroom.

1128
01:27:29,635 --> 01:27:37,541
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna say that every teacher who is watching between 15 and 30 students was trying to keep them from panicking.

1129
01:27:38,401 --> 01:27:39,702
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to keep them calm.

1130
01:27:39,862 --> 01:27:43,585
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to find ways to get them to the facilities in an unknown situation.

1131
01:27:44,701 --> 01:27:49,266
[SPEAKER_00]: We had very little understanding of what was happening, and we made the best of it.

1132
01:27:49,326 --> 01:27:52,869
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would be reticent if I did not stand up for my fellow educators in that.

1133
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:58,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Those images do not tell what I saw my colleagues doing today.

1134
01:28:01,217 --> 01:28:06,743
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way I have to speak is as a union representative of the MTA, and I get the

1135
01:28:07,554 --> 01:28:22,151
[SPEAKER_00]: privilege, I understand, to announce that we held a vote today for this contract negotiation that has been going on for two years in a very public way, and we are happy to say that it ratified today.

1136
01:28:23,223 --> 01:28:32,007
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I should be after two years and before that in the COVID reopening negotiations, I should be home right now celebrating my son and my wife.

1137
01:28:32,107 --> 01:28:36,349
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to come here as union rep to say this, things need to change.

1138
01:28:37,189 --> 01:28:38,309
[SPEAKER_00]: We know things need to change.

1139
01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:46,273
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know things have been very, very tense between the teachers, the administration, the school committee, public displays have been made.

1140
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:51,469
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the safety of our students, we must treat this day one, year one.

1141
01:28:52,069 --> 01:28:52,969
[SPEAKER_00]: The teachers need a voice.

1142
01:28:53,009 --> 01:28:54,030
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the feet on the ground.

1143
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:56,211
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the first to talk to the students.

1144
01:28:56,691 --> 01:28:58,192
[SPEAKER_00]: They know the ins and outs of that building.

1145
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:02,874
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need representation at any meeting where new protocols are spoken of.

1146
01:29:04,274 --> 01:29:05,475
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I'd like to say today.

1147
01:29:05,735 --> 01:29:06,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1148
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:06,735
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1149
01:29:06,755 --> 01:29:12,918
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Anthony.

1150
01:29:12,938 --> 01:29:13,098
[SPEAKER_33]: Ms.

1151
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:14,739
[SPEAKER_33]: Douglas, and then we're going to Tony Tanks.

1152
01:29:17,546 --> 01:29:20,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlene Douglas, president of MTA 414 High Street Method Mask.

1153
01:29:21,307 --> 01:29:38,070
[SPEAKER_04]: All I want to say is that we're proud that the contract passed today and that membership, the membership of the MTA will be immediately turning its energy to supporting substantial, fully funded solutions to the safety issues in our schools.

1154
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:39,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is going to be our focus.

1155
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:43,271
[SPEAKER_04]: We want our teachers to be safe, we want our students to be safe.

1156
01:29:43,651 --> 01:29:44,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is our focus.

1157
01:29:44,772 --> 01:29:46,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And we look forward to working with you,

1158
01:29:46,977 --> 01:29:48,498
[SPEAKER_04]: to make sure that this happens.

1159
01:29:49,178 --> 01:29:50,538
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to be out at darts.

1160
01:29:50,738 --> 01:29:51,639
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to work together.

1161
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:52,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1162
01:29:59,501 --> 01:30:00,062
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. Tanks.

1163
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:01,462
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Brianna.

1164
01:30:01,502 --> 01:30:03,903
[SPEAKER_35]: This is Tony Puccio, 1110 Street, Medford, Mass.

1165
01:30:04,754 --> 01:30:11,636
[SPEAKER_35]: I appreciate you all going out of your normal pattern to hear us this evening.

1166
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:12,777
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for that.

1167
01:30:13,137 --> 01:30:15,698
[SPEAKER_35]: I understand this has been an ongoing issue for over a year now.

1168
01:30:15,758 --> 01:30:17,878
[SPEAKER_35]: I understand there are studies to be done.

1169
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:25,581
[SPEAKER_35]: I understand you have been aware of the issues plaguing our school system because this body was present last year when the students came before you to ask for help.

1170
01:30:26,281 --> 01:30:31,103
[SPEAKER_35]: Recently, a parent of a student who was violently attacked asked how she could help.

1171
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:33,926
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm now asking the same question.

1172
01:30:34,206 --> 01:30:34,846
[SPEAKER_35]: What can I do?

1173
01:30:35,386 --> 01:30:39,827
[SPEAKER_35]: What can the parents do to alleviate the now justifiable concerns that we all share?

1174
01:30:40,808 --> 01:30:46,089
[SPEAKER_35]: I know, as I have heard, there may not be a perfect solution, but we have to do something.

1175
01:30:46,749 --> 01:30:47,870
[SPEAKER_35]: This is an emergency.

1176
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,811
[SPEAKER_35]: We can no longer wait for a perfect solution.

1177
01:30:51,291 --> 01:30:55,212
[SPEAKER_35]: There needs to be interim emergency rules set in place until we figure this out.

1178
01:30:55,891 --> 01:30:58,754
[SPEAKER_35]: We can't let the hole in the dam keep leaking.

1179
01:30:58,814 --> 01:31:00,195
[SPEAKER_35]: We need to stick our finger in it.

1180
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:04,218
[SPEAKER_35]: We need to stop the bleeding until the solution is found.

1181
01:31:04,979 --> 01:31:09,623
[SPEAKER_35]: Please let me know how I or several other parents who want to can help.

1182
01:31:10,624 --> 01:31:11,565
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm a certified coach.

1183
01:31:11,825 --> 01:31:15,448
[SPEAKER_35]: I will volunteer to walk the halls one day a week along with other parents.

1184
01:31:16,128 --> 01:31:17,189
[SPEAKER_35]: There are others who will help.

1185
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:23,535
[SPEAKER_35]: Please, for the health and safety of our children, find a way to do something to ease the worries of parents

1186
01:31:24,113 --> 01:31:27,014
[SPEAKER_35]: teachers and students right now.

1187
01:31:27,594 --> 01:31:35,655
[SPEAKER_35]: We can tweak it until we get it right, but do not wait for study results because this trend seems to be escalating.

1188
01:31:36,396 --> 01:31:47,518
[SPEAKER_35]: With full respect to the Medford police officers who just spoke, they haven't had to deal with firearms in school, but they've neglected to say yet.

1189
01:31:48,098 --> 01:31:51,339
[SPEAKER_35]: Unfortunately, this is a reality that we may have to face.

1190
01:31:51,959 --> 01:31:53,199
[SPEAKER_35]: We need to let that sink in.

1191
01:31:53,911 --> 01:31:55,212
[SPEAKER_35]: Please do not let it come to this.

1192
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:57,953
[SPEAKER_35]: There are parents willing to work with you.

1193
01:31:58,613 --> 01:31:59,413
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's get together.

1194
01:31:59,573 --> 01:32:05,875
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's resolve this issue because our safety, our children's safety needs to be the first thing that comes to order here.

1195
01:32:06,716 --> 01:32:07,556
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for your time.

1196
01:32:07,576 --> 01:32:09,157
[SPEAKER_35]: I appreciate you listening.

1197
01:32:09,937 --> 01:32:10,857
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. Buccio.

1198
01:32:10,877 --> 01:32:10,917
[SPEAKER_33]: Ms.

1199
01:32:11,217 --> 01:32:11,598
[SPEAKER_33]: Branley.

1200
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:20,881
[SPEAKER_32]: So again, my name is Nicole Branley.

1201
01:32:22,315 --> 01:32:23,635
[SPEAKER_32]: and I can't give you my address.

1202
01:32:27,836 --> 01:32:34,317
[SPEAKER_32]: I've tried to really keep our daughter out of the spotlight as much as I've been vocal for our safety concerns.

1203
01:32:35,037 --> 01:32:39,118
[SPEAKER_32]: But I want you all to know here tonight that today is her 16th birthday.

1204
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:46,679
[SPEAKER_32]: Today is her birthday.

1205
01:32:47,019 --> 01:32:50,140
[SPEAKER_32]: And as we sat at dinner, she said, mom, I can't sit here.

1206
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,320
[SPEAKER_32]: We need to go there.

1207
01:32:52,512 --> 01:32:53,832
[SPEAKER_32]: They need to hear my voice.

1208
01:32:54,192 --> 01:32:58,293
[SPEAKER_32]: For anybody that's spoken about what happened to the other student, here we are.

1209
01:32:59,013 --> 01:32:59,574
[SPEAKER_32]: This is us.

1210
01:33:00,014 --> 01:33:00,934
[SPEAKER_32]: This is our face.

1211
01:33:01,954 --> 01:33:02,834
[SPEAKER_32]: This is my baby.

1212
01:33:02,854 --> 01:33:06,455
[SPEAKER_32]: And this is her high school experience.

1213
01:33:08,496 --> 01:33:14,857
[SPEAKER_32]: This is how she spent her birthday, texting me repeatedly, saying, Mom, you need to pick me up.

1214
01:33:16,004 --> 01:33:17,045
[SPEAKER_32]: You need to pick me up.

1215
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:25,272
[SPEAKER_32]: I have been standing in front of every single one of you for two months saying, I'm sounding the alarm.

1216
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:30,236
[SPEAKER_32]: Every parent that's here tonight, you need to come every single meeting.

1217
01:33:30,336 --> 01:33:33,799
[SPEAKER_32]: If you're on this meeting and you hear my voice, you need to be here.

1218
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:35,180
[SPEAKER_32]: This is for your child.

1219
01:33:40,771 --> 01:33:42,492
[SPEAKER_32]: Mayor, I was on zoom.

1220
01:33:42,672 --> 01:33:53,659
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you say that we have to school resource officers to who said that we have to because because officer Conway has been a godsend to our family.

1221
01:33:53,979 --> 01:33:55,620
[SPEAKER_32]: And you should thank him every day.

1222
01:33:56,181 --> 01:34:00,784
[SPEAKER_32]: You should all thank him every day because he's been a godsend to our school to our family.

1223
01:34:01,044 --> 01:34:03,345
[SPEAKER_32]: He has supported us more than anyone.

1224
01:34:03,826 --> 01:34:05,627
[SPEAKER_32]: But I've only known about officer Conway.

1225
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:21,347
[SPEAKER_32]: So who's, who's the second officer officers the overall, he is at the middle schools and also will go up to the high school so we do have a lot more for the district, that makes a lot more sense because I would love to meet him and chat with him too.

1226
01:34:22,677 --> 01:34:26,760
[SPEAKER_32]: Melanie, did I just hear you say that you didn't know much about the previous incident?

1227
01:34:26,881 --> 01:34:30,504
[SPEAKER_32]: Is this meaning what happened today or what happened with my situation?

1228
01:34:30,524 --> 01:34:31,645
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to make it clear.

1229
01:34:31,825 --> 01:34:38,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the specifics about who the other students were with regard to your daughter's situation, I still don't know their names.

1230
01:34:39,031 --> 01:34:39,611
[SPEAKER_32]: Swear to God.

1231
01:34:39,691 --> 01:34:41,173
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, can I just say something?

1232
01:34:43,095 --> 01:34:47,138
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that this has really been important for me.

1233
01:34:47,638 --> 01:34:49,940
[SPEAKER_32]: People have asked, who stabbed today?

1234
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,361
[SPEAKER_32]: Who hurt your daughter?

1235
01:34:51,481 --> 01:34:52,282
[SPEAKER_32]: I want their name.

1236
01:34:53,102 --> 01:34:53,543
[SPEAKER_32]: Guess what?

1237
01:34:53,863 --> 01:35:03,710
[SPEAKER_32]: It doesn't make a difference who, when it comes down to it, because they're juveniles who need to be led by adults.

1238
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:07,090
[SPEAKER_32]: and our adults are failing our students.

1239
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:09,391
[SPEAKER_32]: That goes, parents need to step up.

1240
01:35:10,091 --> 01:35:14,433
[SPEAKER_32]: Superintendent, there's blood on your hands today, my friend, I'm sorry.

1241
01:35:14,453 --> 01:35:18,155
[SPEAKER_32]: But I told you, I told you.

1242
01:35:18,175 --> 01:35:23,737
[SPEAKER_32]: Kiana, Kiana, I told you.

1243
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,818
[SPEAKER_32]: I understand, but I've told you all.

1244
01:35:25,918 --> 01:35:27,698
[SPEAKER_32]: I've talked to each and every one of you.

1245
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:29,199
[SPEAKER_32]: I've met with you privately.

1246
01:35:29,219 --> 01:35:31,020
[SPEAKER_32]: I've met with you privately.

1247
01:35:34,025 --> 01:35:34,165
[SPEAKER_33]: Ms.

1248
01:35:34,185 --> 01:35:37,788
[SPEAKER_33]: Brandly, we are devastated by what is going on.

1249
01:35:37,988 --> 01:35:38,509
[SPEAKER_32]: Devastated.

1250
01:35:38,529 --> 01:35:41,251
[SPEAKER_33]: But look, this is my child's 16th birthday.

1251
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:44,053
[SPEAKER_33]: And it was my child's months ago.

1252
01:35:44,073 --> 01:35:46,675
[SPEAKER_33]: It was.

1253
01:35:46,735 --> 01:35:47,275
[SPEAKER_33]: You're right.

1254
01:35:47,395 --> 01:35:48,796
[SPEAKER_33]: It was your child months ago.

1255
01:35:48,816 --> 01:35:50,037
[SPEAKER_33]: So we need to step up.

1256
01:35:50,117 --> 01:35:51,218
[SPEAKER_33]: I feel your pain.

1257
01:35:51,338 --> 01:35:51,879
[SPEAKER_33]: I feel you.

1258
01:35:52,599 --> 01:35:55,702
[SPEAKER_33]: The chief of police gave us a safety plan, gave us a checklist.

1259
01:35:55,982 --> 01:35:57,683
[SPEAKER_33]: I have a safety plan for my daughter.

1260
01:35:57,703 --> 01:35:57,763
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

1261
01:35:59,643 --> 01:36:01,826
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a piece of paper when it comes down to it, I would like.

1262
01:36:02,466 --> 01:36:06,150
[SPEAKER_32]: She would like to speak, and if she can speak I would really be grateful.

1263
01:36:06,671 --> 01:36:10,575
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, this, this is not how any child should have to spend their birthday.

1264
01:36:10,935 --> 01:36:11,196
[SPEAKER_32]: Correct.

1265
01:36:12,037 --> 01:36:15,781
[SPEAKER_32]: This is such a shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame.

1266
01:36:18,052 --> 01:36:19,593
[SPEAKER_19]: Today is my 16th birthday.

1267
01:36:20,014 --> 01:36:28,841
[SPEAKER_19]: It is my 16th birthday and I spent it in a lockdown for three and a half hours in my history class because someone got stabbed in school.

1268
01:36:29,702 --> 01:36:30,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone got stabbed.

1269
01:36:30,762 --> 01:36:32,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Does that not matter to anybody?

1270
01:36:32,304 --> 01:36:35,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Does the safety of all of us at Medford High School not matter?

1271
01:36:35,927 --> 01:36:37,308
[SPEAKER_19]: I am the name.

1272
01:36:37,428 --> 01:36:42,052
[SPEAKER_19]: I am the face behind the story of the girl who got assaulted on October 17th.

1273
01:36:42,072 --> 01:36:42,712
[SPEAKER_19]: That was me.

1274
01:36:42,952 --> 01:36:45,575
[SPEAKER_19]: I was in the hospital for eight and a half hours that day.

1275
01:36:46,395 --> 01:36:48,936
[SPEAKER_19]: No one checked in until the next day.

1276
01:36:49,276 --> 01:36:51,097
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you think that that makes me feel?

1277
01:36:51,117 --> 01:36:57,560
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you think that these students feel going to school every single day, knowing that these things happen?

1278
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:04,403
[SPEAKER_19]: There has been some type of physical altercation every single day for the past seven days, including today.

1279
01:37:04,423 --> 01:37:06,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it was just a fight.

1280
01:37:06,323 --> 01:37:07,464
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it wasn't documented.

1281
01:37:07,764 --> 01:37:08,244
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

1282
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:09,665
[SPEAKER_19]: It does not matter.

1283
01:37:10,545 --> 01:37:11,566
[SPEAKER_19]: It does not matter.

1284
01:37:11,586 --> 01:37:14,930
[SPEAKER_19]: This is everyone's safety that is at risk.

1285
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:15,971
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone's safety.

1286
01:37:16,272 --> 01:37:18,554
[SPEAKER_19]: You said it yourself, it was your own daughter months ago.

1287
01:37:18,814 --> 01:37:19,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it's her daughter.

1288
01:37:19,655 --> 01:37:20,436
[SPEAKER_19]: Whose daughter's next?

1289
01:37:20,516 --> 01:37:21,297
[SPEAKER_19]: Whose son's next?

1290
01:37:21,317 --> 01:37:23,199
[SPEAKER_19]: How did it make you feel when that was your daughter?

1291
01:37:23,419 --> 01:37:25,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I know that I felt bad when it was your daughter.

1292
01:37:26,002 --> 01:37:26,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1293
01:37:28,345 --> 01:37:29,266
[SPEAKER_19]: And now it's me.

1294
01:37:29,947 --> 01:37:30,968
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's affected

1295
01:37:32,213 --> 01:37:33,514
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a story to all of you.

1296
01:37:33,574 --> 01:37:37,096
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a story that's affected, it's your job, whatever.

1297
01:37:37,116 --> 01:37:38,717
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not true, we care deeply.

1298
01:37:39,237 --> 01:37:43,339
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a story to you, it's affected me every single day of my life.

1299
01:37:43,799 --> 01:37:52,664
[SPEAKER_19]: The stares that I get in the hallway, the whispers, the pointing fingers, the, oh, that's the girl, the stories, the rumors.

1300
01:37:53,444 --> 01:37:55,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you know how hard- The videos.

1301
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:59,948
[SPEAKER_19]: The edits people make, the video that's constantly recirculating.

1302
01:38:01,248 --> 01:38:02,709
[SPEAKER_19]: of me just on the floor.

1303
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:06,351
[SPEAKER_19]: Do something.

1304
01:38:06,431 --> 01:38:07,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Do your job.

1305
01:38:07,352 --> 01:38:10,333
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you can't do your job, step down and let someone else do it for you.

1306
01:38:31,044 --> 01:38:41,395
[SPEAKER_19]: If it weren't for my amazing teachers that I have, the amazing teachers that I have, the vocational program that I am in, I would transfer and I would make the school pay for it.

1307
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:44,599
[SPEAKER_19]: I would make the city pay for it and I would leave and I would leave it at that.

1308
01:38:45,399 --> 01:38:48,823
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't want to do that because then I lose and I walk away.

1309
01:38:49,824 --> 01:38:50,664
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the end of it.

1310
01:38:50,844 --> 01:38:57,466
[SPEAKER_19]: And then my attackers get to come back because I'm not there because, oh, well, we don't like to do anything.

1311
01:38:57,826 --> 01:39:00,086
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys sweep it under the rug.

1312
01:39:00,746 --> 01:39:02,907
[SPEAKER_19]: There has been no update.

1313
01:39:02,947 --> 01:39:05,528
[SPEAKER_19]: There has been no communication.

1314
01:39:05,548 --> 01:39:06,948
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my life.

1315
01:39:06,988 --> 01:39:08,248
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my safety.

1316
01:39:08,588 --> 01:39:11,709
[SPEAKER_19]: This is something that I'm going to have to deal with for the rest of my life.

1317
01:39:13,709 --> 01:39:15,610
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're saying that you don't even know the

1318
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:22,117
[SPEAKER_33]: We're only, we're not privy to that.

1319
01:39:22,477 --> 01:39:23,237
[SPEAKER_33]: We're not privy to that.

1320
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:24,277
[SPEAKER_32]: You don't need to know their names.

1321
01:39:24,297 --> 01:39:26,338
[SPEAKER_32]: You just need, you need to be.

1322
01:39:27,358 --> 01:39:27,578
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

1323
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:32,539
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, she is.

1324
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:33,499
[SPEAKER_19]: I know I am.

1325
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:35,960
[SPEAKER_19]: This is how I chose to spend my 16th birthday.

1326
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:42,081
[SPEAKER_19]: Here in front of all of you crying because this happened to me and someone was stabbed at school today.

1327
01:39:43,994 --> 01:39:49,137
[SPEAKER_19]: Somebody was stabbed in the bathroom of school.

1328
01:39:49,177 --> 01:39:50,238
[SPEAKER_19]: We were in lockdown.

1329
01:39:50,278 --> 01:39:51,218
[SPEAKER_19]: There were helicopters.

1330
01:39:51,238 --> 01:39:52,779
[SPEAKER_19]: The kid fled the school.

1331
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:55,461
[SPEAKER_19]: We need a safety protocol.

1332
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:56,742
[SPEAKER_19]: We need more help.

1333
01:39:57,162 --> 01:39:58,623
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care what it takes.

1334
01:39:58,983 --> 01:40:00,244
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to do something.

1335
01:40:00,264 --> 01:40:01,925
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to step up or step down.

1336
01:40:16,057 --> 01:40:19,518
[SPEAKER_33]: Dr. Cushing, two more people online would like to speak.

1337
01:40:20,258 --> 01:40:21,759
[SPEAKER_33]: Melanie North and June Falco.

1338
01:40:22,119 --> 01:40:25,800
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, then we have... Okay, June Falco.

1339
01:40:28,821 --> 01:40:29,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, can you hear me?

1340
01:40:31,842 --> 01:40:32,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1341
01:40:32,062 --> 01:40:32,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

1342
01:40:33,242 --> 01:40:34,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we can hear you.

1343
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:38,744
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the... June Falco, Medford, Massachusetts.

1344
01:40:42,145 --> 01:40:44,866
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been listening to this meeting the entire night.

1345
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:51,724
[SPEAKER_24]: And much of what I want to say has already been said by parents that are in attendance tonight.

1346
01:40:52,585 --> 01:41:04,113
[SPEAKER_24]: I would like to make a reflection on tonight's meeting in regards to the actions by the people of the school committee and by the elected officials in general.

1347
01:41:04,873 --> 01:41:14,260
[SPEAKER_24]: I am appalled at the actions and the statements that have been made tonight towards the public who have come down so bravely to express their concerns.

1348
01:41:15,347 --> 01:41:16,687
[SPEAKER_24]: I hear a lot of double speak.

1349
01:41:17,188 --> 01:41:18,468
[SPEAKER_24]: I hear a lot of blaming.

1350
01:41:18,488 --> 01:41:20,469
[SPEAKER_24]: I hear a lot of finger pointing.

1351
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:26,571
[SPEAKER_24]: I've heard accusations of statements being made by parents being made simply because it is on camera.

1352
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:31,452
[SPEAKER_24]: And God forbid we say something negative on camera where we can be held accountable.

1353
01:41:32,072 --> 01:41:38,614
[SPEAKER_24]: I've heard other statements saying that the public is quite comfortable breaking the law.

1354
01:41:39,355 --> 01:41:42,035
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, pointing the blame towards the public.

1355
01:41:42,976 --> 01:41:43,836
[SPEAKER_24]: I've also heard

1356
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:53,202
[SPEAKER_24]: you Madam Mayor, stating that it was your child's birthday, trying to take away from a brave 16 year old student that came there tonight to tell her story.

1357
01:41:53,923 --> 01:41:55,723
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight is not about you.

1358
01:41:56,423 --> 01:42:02,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight is not, I will reiterate, tonight is not about you.

1359
01:42:03,085 --> 01:42:05,566
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight is about what happened at the school.

1360
01:42:06,226 --> 01:42:10,767
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight is about what our students are feeling and the safety of our children.

1361
01:42:11,707 --> 01:42:14,708
[SPEAKER_24]: So I am appalled at what I've heard today from you guys.

1362
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:26,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Today's actions at that high school are a direct result of weak policies and no consequences for the students in public school in Medford, Massachusetts.

1363
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:30,715
[SPEAKER_24]: A lawyer said tonight that he doesn't wanna cast stones or place blame.

1364
01:42:31,575 --> 01:42:34,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I will say this, I do.

1365
01:42:34,897 --> 01:42:35,957
[SPEAKER_24]: I blame all of you.

1366
01:42:36,657 --> 01:42:40,119
[SPEAKER_24]: I blame all of you for being weak and not having serious

1367
01:42:40,973 --> 01:42:45,614
[SPEAKER_24]: consequences in place for these students for tying our teachers hands.

1368
01:42:46,495 --> 01:42:57,838
[SPEAKER_24]: It took a 16 year old tonight, who I am so proud of I don't know her, but she came up there and I will tell you, I am so proud of her, because she said exactly what I have been thinking all night.

1369
01:42:58,763 --> 01:43:05,329
[SPEAKER_24]: that it is time for you to do your job or step down because you have all failed this community.

1370
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:06,991
[SPEAKER_24]: Shame on you.

1371
01:43:07,571 --> 01:43:10,814
[SPEAKER_24]: What will it take for you to make a change?

1372
01:43:12,456 --> 01:43:13,056
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is it.

1373
01:43:14,097 --> 01:43:14,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1374
01:43:15,779 --> 01:43:16,380
[SPEAKER_17]: Melanie North.

1375
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:28,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Melanie North, 45 Cross Street, Medford, Mass.

1376
01:43:30,363 --> 01:43:39,710
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been a couple of comments this evening stating the law and how we're not privy as parents to know certain things.

1377
01:43:40,391 --> 01:43:44,914
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I'm going to cite Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 370.

1378
01:43:45,055 --> 01:43:48,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's stating that school bullying is prohibited.

1379
01:43:52,543 --> 01:44:01,691
[SPEAKER_08]: watching and reading that and noting that if school bullying is prohibited, how is this still going on?

1380
01:44:02,071 --> 01:44:10,399
[SPEAKER_08]: The incident that happened with the woman that just spoke and her daughter, those girls were back in school a week later.

1381
01:44:10,419 --> 01:44:14,743
[SPEAKER_08]: They were also attending activities that they shouldn't have been.

1382
01:44:15,563 --> 01:44:19,026
[SPEAKER_08]: So if school bullying is prohibited and we're quoting the law,

1383
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:39,187
[SPEAKER_08]: In chap in section 370, it states that for the purpose of section and cyber bullying and anything else isn't allowed, and the superintendent and or principal has the ability to take these kids out of school.

1384
01:44:39,908 --> 01:44:41,469
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not being done and why.

1385
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:58,430
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also another section that states of what a felony complaint or conviction of a student chapter 71 section 37 h one and a half that states that the superintendent and

1386
01:44:59,051 --> 01:45:06,153
[SPEAKER_08]: the principal of the school actually have all the say when it comes to students wanting to come back into the school.

1387
01:45:06,573 --> 01:45:12,055
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to file, they have to write a written letter, and the superintendent has three days to respond.

1388
01:45:12,755 --> 01:45:25,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking at that, I wanna know the reasons behind why these people are allowed to be bullied, why they're allowed in the school, if mass general laws state that things can be done.

1389
01:45:30,273 --> 01:45:37,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Miss North, there is some misinformation and many people have said it already this evening.

1390
01:45:37,735 --> 01:45:42,997
[SPEAKER_05]: The previous incident that took place in October, the students were not in school.

1391
01:45:43,277 --> 01:45:45,937
[SPEAKER_05]: That is completely false.

1392
01:45:46,538 --> 01:45:47,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not a true statement.

1393
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:51,059
[SPEAKER_05]: They have not been in school since that event took place.

1394
01:45:51,699 --> 01:45:57,921
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we made the comments that we're not talking about students in public,

1395
01:45:59,081 --> 01:46:06,345
[SPEAKER_05]: or student information, those students are not in school, and they have not been in school since the date of the incident.

1396
01:46:07,706 --> 01:46:08,006
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1397
01:46:09,567 --> 01:46:14,029
[SPEAKER_21]: Nadine Moretti Berg it out.

1398
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:22,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I just ask a question who hired the four police officers here tonight to be here or one of them here is what I'm trying to ask.

1399
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:26,876
[SPEAKER_33]: It's the chief of police and the press captain, who

1400
01:46:27,423 --> 01:46:29,965
[SPEAKER_33]: wanted to be here to help answer questions for the community.

1401
01:46:30,025 --> 01:46:35,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, because there were four, so how I'm taking it is that there was a worry to have these people here for safety.

1402
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:40,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's use that same thought process, even if we weren't thinking it, for the school.

1403
01:46:40,794 --> 01:46:49,641
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no children at Medford High anymore, but I think you owe it to everybody that's spoken, especially the girl that just spoke, to put more people there.

1404
01:46:49,681 --> 01:46:51,923
[SPEAKER_21]: Just do it, and then worry about everything after.

1405
01:46:52,344 --> 01:46:53,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Put more people there.

1406
01:46:53,464 --> 01:46:54,625
[SPEAKER_21]: There's how many people in here?

1407
01:46:55,046 --> 01:46:56,407
[SPEAKER_21]: There's four police officers.

1408
01:46:57,623 --> 01:47:01,226
[SPEAKER_21]: Do the same for the high school, like tomorrow, please.

1409
01:47:01,606 --> 01:47:02,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, just do it.

1410
01:47:07,231 --> 01:47:08,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1411
01:47:08,412 --> 01:47:09,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Cushing, Michael, please.

1412
01:47:09,953 --> 01:47:10,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1413
01:47:10,694 --> 01:47:11,595
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll go to Chloe.

1414
01:47:15,478 --> 01:47:17,580
[SPEAKER_43]: Stephanie Powers, 7th Street.

1415
01:47:19,041 --> 01:47:21,643
[SPEAKER_43]: My child does not attend Medford Public Schools.

1416
01:47:22,564 --> 01:47:24,526
[SPEAKER_43]: However, many of my friend's children do.

1417
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:30,328
[SPEAKER_43]: And Medford public schools are in crises and have been for quite some time.

1418
01:47:31,431 --> 01:47:34,178
[SPEAKER_43]: There's barely any homework at the elementary and middle schools.

1419
01:47:35,077 --> 01:47:40,003
[SPEAKER_43]: There have been no midterm exams or final exams at the high school since prior to COVID.

1420
01:47:40,623 --> 01:47:48,051
[SPEAKER_43]: There are constant violent fights at the middle schools and high school with no impactful consequences for the perpetrators.

1421
01:47:48,892 --> 01:47:56,281
[SPEAKER_43]: The school committee is more concerned with renaming schools than addressing the deficiencies that run rampant throughout the school system.

1422
01:47:57,352 --> 01:48:09,178
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, it's too bad the community cannot recall the current school committee members because I'd be the first to sign the petition to do so without any real rigor and discipline.

1423
01:48:09,539 --> 01:48:19,004
[SPEAKER_43]: The quality of this school system, unfortunately will continue to decline and the safety of its student body will become increasingly compromised.

1424
01:48:19,847 --> 01:48:21,728
[SPEAKER_43]: So please do something.

1425
01:48:22,148 --> 01:48:29,673
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, the very least, re-institute some rigor in your high school with final exams and midterm exams.

1426
01:48:30,053 --> 01:48:36,617
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, I understand during COVID, but COVID's over and these kids need to go back to a regular schedule.

1427
01:48:37,258 --> 01:48:37,718
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1428
01:48:42,381 --> 01:48:43,181
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address, Rick.

1429
01:48:46,143 --> 01:48:48,644
[SPEAKER_07]: John Petrella, 61 Locust Street, Method Mass.

1430
01:48:49,938 --> 01:48:53,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know what else, everything I wanted to say has been said tonight.

1431
01:48:53,419 --> 01:48:58,641
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I can add is I just don't understand discipline.

1432
01:49:00,842 --> 01:49:07,424
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to school, there was 4,000 kids at Meffitt High School, 4,000, okay?

1433
01:49:07,844 --> 01:49:14,427
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I went to school in the morning and I got into a fight at 10 o'clock, I knew I was suspended, that's it.

1434
01:49:16,616 --> 01:49:23,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I used to go, well, I shouldn't say that, but I did go to the office and it was suspended pending expulsion.

1435
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:25,082
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't understand.

1436
01:49:25,102 --> 01:49:31,127
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is there's no discipline and I don't understand what nobody gets.

1437
01:49:32,975 --> 01:49:34,316
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no discipline.

1438
01:49:35,317 --> 01:49:38,180
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a few bad apples, okay?

1439
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:42,744
[SPEAKER_07]: If I stabbed someone tonight, I assume I'm going to jail, I'm getting arrested.

1440
01:49:43,244 --> 01:49:45,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what happened today, none of my business, okay?

1441
01:49:46,247 --> 01:49:49,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I know someone got stabbed and it turns my stomach.

1442
01:49:50,371 --> 01:49:55,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've spoken with Nicole and to hear her story, it turns my stomach.

1443
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:59,179
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to stop, that's what you're here for.

1444
01:50:00,458 --> 01:50:01,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what are we doing?

1445
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:07,423
[SPEAKER_07]: We keep hearing talk, and we keep hearing law, and we keep hearing it's garbage.

1446
01:50:08,123 --> 01:50:13,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Discipline, why can't we have discipline at the high school?

1447
01:50:13,727 --> 01:50:16,469
[SPEAKER_07]: 4,000 kids when I went, we used to have like 1,000 in class.

1448
01:50:17,329 --> 01:50:18,830
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew what the rules were.

1449
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:26,816
[SPEAKER_07]: They sat us down before we started school, put us in the auditorium, and they read us a riot act.

1450
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:29,631
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do this, you're out.

1451
01:50:29,671 --> 01:50:31,191
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do this, you're out.

1452
01:50:31,271 --> 01:50:32,272
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we doing today?

1453
01:50:32,312 --> 01:50:33,272
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't do nothing.

1454
01:50:35,613 --> 01:50:37,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's the problem.

1455
01:50:38,094 --> 01:50:39,535
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, that's the problem.

1456
01:50:39,635 --> 01:50:40,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Discipline.

1457
01:50:40,776 --> 01:50:41,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Discipline the kids.

1458
01:50:42,036 --> 01:50:43,177
[SPEAKER_07]: What is wrong with that?

1459
01:50:44,317 --> 01:50:46,298
[SPEAKER_07]: You all seem to have a problem with this.

1460
01:50:47,459 --> 01:50:48,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know.

1461
01:50:48,179 --> 01:50:48,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a parent.

1462
01:50:48,999 --> 01:50:49,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I had two kids.

1463
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:51,821
[SPEAKER_07]: They went to Method Eye School.

1464
01:50:53,531 --> 01:50:56,332
[SPEAKER_07]: As a parent, you gotta discipline your kids once in a while.

1465
01:50:57,793 --> 01:51:05,637
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, it's like you lost the revolution, whatever, their revolution, it's certainly not mine.

1466
01:51:06,797 --> 01:51:09,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But that seems to be a big problem in this city.

1467
01:51:10,279 --> 01:51:11,700
[SPEAKER_07]: You all got voted in.

1468
01:51:13,303 --> 01:51:18,693
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a council being controlled by the council, and the city's a mess.

1469
01:51:19,014 --> 01:51:20,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Everywhere you look, it's a mess.

1470
01:51:20,937 --> 01:51:24,284
[SPEAKER_07]: The school system, I mean, it's craziness.

1471
01:51:24,464 --> 01:51:25,205
[SPEAKER_07]: It's craziness.

1472
01:51:26,249 --> 01:51:28,030
[SPEAKER_07]: What is wrong with discipline?

1473
01:51:28,531 --> 01:51:29,031
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

1474
01:51:29,431 --> 01:51:32,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're not gonna answer me, but I'd like someone to tell me.

1475
01:51:33,133 --> 01:51:35,955
[SPEAKER_33]: We are disciplining, but we obviously- No, you're not.

1476
01:51:35,995 --> 01:51:39,297
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, we are suspending students for fights.

1477
01:51:39,658 --> 01:51:42,499
[SPEAKER_33]: We have work to do, but we are suspending students for fights.

1478
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:43,220
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, we are.

1479
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:43,320
[SPEAKER_33]: Gail?

1480
01:51:53,191 --> 01:51:56,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, hi, thanks for letting me just really quickly.

1481
01:51:56,412 --> 01:51:59,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to recognize that I know this is a really hard problem.

1482
01:51:59,353 --> 01:52:11,336
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there are plenty of parents who are on this call who are parents of Medford kids somewhere in the district who recognize that there is not an easy solution to this problem.

1483
01:52:11,836 --> 01:52:14,917
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to be part of the solution and we want to help you find it.

1484
01:52:15,769 --> 01:52:16,610
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to work together.

1485
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:20,672
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to retain our teachers because this is going to be an issue with teacher retention.

1486
01:52:21,593 --> 01:52:23,854
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're here and we want to help solve the problem.

1487
01:52:23,914 --> 01:52:24,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's communicate.

1488
01:52:24,814 --> 01:52:37,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's keep those lines of communication open, like Melanie mentioned, and let's work to find solutions that will help our kids get educated and our best teachers and really help improve our school district overall.

1489
01:52:38,022 --> 01:52:38,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

1490
01:52:39,823 --> 01:52:40,344
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Gail.

1491
01:52:43,726 --> 01:52:44,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

1492
01:52:45,538 --> 01:52:45,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1493
01:52:47,098 --> 01:52:54,540
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank everyone who spoke tonight, especially the students who came up to tell us about their experiences.

1494
01:52:56,581 --> 01:53:03,463
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, a couple of things are clear to me from the comments and reinforce the conversations that we've been having.

1495
01:53:04,458 --> 01:53:07,062
[SPEAKER_13]: as a community for quite a while now.

1496
01:53:07,162 --> 01:53:14,992
[SPEAKER_13]: So first is that there's a lot of really wonderful things happening in Medford and specifically in Medford Public Schools.

1497
01:53:16,334 --> 01:53:20,259
[SPEAKER_13]: We heard today lots of thanks for the teachers who

1498
01:53:22,027 --> 01:53:39,100
[SPEAKER_13]: had a really difficult job to do today as they were the adults in the room and they acted with professionalism and grit and fortitude at what was a very, very hard day.

1499
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:43,903
[SPEAKER_13]: So my sincere thanks to all the teachers who are listening.

1500
01:53:45,484 --> 01:53:54,529
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think the other thing that's really clear is that there are a number of things that we're getting very wrong as a system.

1501
01:53:55,390 --> 01:54:05,335
[SPEAKER_13]: And what we're hearing from students that is perhaps the most concerning for me is that from their vantage point, nothing has changed.

1502
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:07,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I know

1503
01:54:08,191 --> 01:54:11,932
[SPEAKER_13]: that there is a lot going on behind the scenes.

1504
01:54:12,313 --> 01:54:21,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that there is a lot of activity in process and in progress to enact change.

1505
01:54:21,496 --> 01:54:32,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that change is sometimes painfully slow and hard, but I think what we have to really grapple with is striking some balance between

1506
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:40,371
[SPEAKER_13]: improving our communications in a truly systemic way.

1507
01:54:40,391 --> 01:54:47,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Our parents feel unsupported, our students feel unsupported.

1508
01:54:49,055 --> 01:54:56,339
[SPEAKER_13]: As a community, we've really never gotten crisis response right in Medford Public Schools.

1509
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:05,343
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will never forget the night I sat in the auditorium for five hours, and at that time,

1510
01:55:06,056 --> 01:55:11,258
[SPEAKER_13]: I sat there and I just kept wondering, where is our crisis response team?

1511
01:55:12,819 --> 01:55:16,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they equipped to do this work?

1512
01:55:17,141 --> 01:55:18,622
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have those same questions today.

1513
01:55:18,642 --> 01:55:31,527
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to, so I think the technicalities of hearing all of you tonight, we all wanted to do it.

1514
01:55:31,608 --> 01:55:34,709
[SPEAKER_13]: We felt very unanimous about that, I think.

1515
01:55:35,641 --> 01:55:42,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but I do think we also have a responsibility to make sure that we are upholding, um, our requirements under the open meeting law.

1516
01:55:43,447 --> 01:55:44,688
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think that.

1517
01:55:45,309 --> 01:56:03,003
[SPEAKER_13]: What you're probably not going to hear from us tonight is, um, a particular action that we're instructing anybody to take, because that is where we sort of like dip over that line, um, and, and cause, um, question cause anything we might do to come into question.

1518
01:56:04,024 --> 01:56:05,025
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I would like to do.

1519
01:56:06,152 --> 01:56:13,155
[SPEAKER_13]: is make a motion that before the return to school in January, we will hold a meeting.

1520
01:56:14,476 --> 01:56:20,599
[SPEAKER_13]: We will hold an executive session where the school committee will be fully briefed on safety and security protocols.

1521
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:28,142
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we will hold a public meeting that will describe for parents what the

1522
01:56:29,356 --> 01:56:46,420
[SPEAKER_13]: student accountability processes, what the responsibility of the adults in the room is, how that has changed, and as well, what parents can look forward to as we continue, because I think there is a set of immediate actions that has to take place.

1523
01:56:47,481 --> 01:56:52,302
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also think that this is a problem.

1524
01:56:52,462 --> 01:56:53,222
[SPEAKER_13]: It has existed

1525
01:56:54,726 --> 01:56:58,728
[SPEAKER_13]: for years, going back at least to those gun clip moments.

1526
01:57:00,429 --> 01:57:06,032
[SPEAKER_13]: And probably further, we heard about race riots back many, many years ago.

1527
01:57:06,712 --> 01:57:14,556
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would like to make a motion that we hold that meeting between now and the time students return to school.

1528
01:57:15,056 --> 01:57:16,497
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the end of my motion.

1529
01:57:18,820 --> 01:57:19,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1530
01:57:21,221 --> 01:57:36,167
[SPEAKER_13]: What I would like to say, though, before my colleagues might weigh in on that is that, you know, this problem of the bathrooms is a problem I hear about from lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of different angles.

1531
01:57:37,848 --> 01:57:41,309
[SPEAKER_13]: And there is a problem with supervision in the bathrooms.

1532
01:57:41,849 --> 01:57:42,630
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

1533
01:57:43,810 --> 01:57:48,532
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I would also say is that that is a symptom of

1534
01:57:48,953 --> 01:58:02,598
[SPEAKER_13]: deeper issues of consistency of how our rules are enforced by those responsible for doing it, whether those actions are carried out with consistency.

1535
01:58:03,299 --> 01:58:11,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I have questions about whether there is an appropriate systemic support to allow that decision making to be good, solid and consistent.

1536
01:58:12,222 --> 01:58:13,183
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would also,

1537
01:58:14,707 --> 01:58:25,062
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, like to know in that meeting how we all can have a better understanding of the process.

1538
01:58:26,219 --> 01:58:27,760
[SPEAKER_13]: beyond the student handbook.

1539
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:33,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is something that warrants really clear professional communications.

1540
01:58:33,282 --> 01:58:44,966
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that is an area that we deeply struggle with at Medford public schools, but we need to find a way through this communications situation as well.

1541
01:58:45,686 --> 01:58:54,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And the last thing I will say to everybody who has been involved, I think we're all here to listen

1542
01:58:55,327 --> 01:58:57,308
[SPEAKER_13]: and hear what you need from us.

1543
01:58:59,069 --> 01:59:17,201
[SPEAKER_13]: If you need us to support expenditures, if you need us to support you as you make hard decisions about staff, if you need us to support hard decisions about prioritization of which staff are needed, we're here to do all of those things.

1544
01:59:17,694 --> 01:59:19,815
[SPEAKER_13]: We were elected to make hard decisions.

1545
01:59:20,796 --> 01:59:24,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think I've ever gotten to make very easy decisions since I have been on this body.

1546
01:59:24,938 --> 01:59:35,845
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, you know, we want to hear from the people who we hire and pay to do this work in our schools every single day, what they need from us.

1547
01:59:36,865 --> 01:59:38,626
[SPEAKER_13]: We want the teachers to be at the table.

1548
01:59:38,646 --> 01:59:45,170
[SPEAKER_13]: I do think we will get a better product when we talk and listen to students and teachers as we go through this process.

1549
01:59:45,934 --> 01:59:55,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but I do think we have to have a comprehensive approach that is both, um, confidential where it is necessary.

1550
01:59:55,897 --> 02:00:01,639
[SPEAKER_13]: And there will be wildly unsatisfying moments where things are necessarily confidential.

1551
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:08,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and the superintendent has my full support as she makes those hard decisions and, and upholds the law.

1552
02:00:08,302 --> 02:00:14,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but I think we also have to find a way for this community to understand what part

1553
02:00:14,949 --> 02:00:30,240
[SPEAKER_13]: they can play, how they can help, and what we are going to do differently in the immediate term, as well as, as we continue forward this year, into the summer, into next year, this is a hard problem.

1554
02:00:30,621 --> 02:00:32,722
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to prioritize it.

1555
02:00:32,822 --> 02:00:36,985
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to think about how our students feel safe and supported in school.

1556
02:00:37,826 --> 02:00:39,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Every single person in this room wants that.

1557
02:00:40,028 --> 02:00:40,668
[SPEAKER_13]: We agree.

1558
02:00:40,688 --> 02:00:43,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I think where we all have,

1559
02:00:43,946 --> 02:00:48,708
[SPEAKER_13]: work to do is to figure out the how and that I think that's critically important.

1560
02:00:48,869 --> 02:00:50,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's work we need to do.

1561
02:00:50,109 --> 02:00:58,333
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you, Member McLaughlin for supporting my motion that we have an in depth discussion that is compliant with the open meeting law before the start of school.

1562
02:00:59,334 --> 02:01:00,114
[SPEAKER_33]: Member McLaughlin.

1563
02:01:00,874 --> 02:01:01,214
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1564
02:01:01,315 --> 02:01:03,376
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to say it is a very complicated issue.

1565
02:01:03,436 --> 02:01:08,458
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate Gail Reggie and saying that earlier, but also all the family members and especially like the

1566
02:01:09,124 --> 02:01:17,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Like member Graham was saying a moment ago, the students that came out tonight, it was exceptionally brave, particularly Jacqueline on her 16th birthday was exceptionally brave.

1567
02:01:17,886 --> 02:01:27,728
[SPEAKER_20]: What no one should have to go through, what any of these children have gone through, both as people who have been there and seen what's happened and people who have been victims.

1568
02:01:27,908 --> 02:01:33,730
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we all recognize that bullying is not something new.

1569
02:01:34,130 --> 02:01:35,330
[SPEAKER_20]: It's something that's been ongoing.

1570
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:38,811
[SPEAKER_20]: It escalates for sure during times of stress and tension,

1571
02:01:39,206 --> 02:01:42,287
[SPEAKER_20]: This has been an extremely stressful couple of years for everybody.

1572
02:01:42,727 --> 02:01:48,528
[SPEAKER_20]: Last year, we had a family and community engagement assessment come in from DESE to talk about family and community engagement.

1573
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:55,770
[SPEAKER_20]: And we weren't ready for that assessment because we were just really trying to recover from getting our kids back into school and COVID.

1574
02:01:55,790 --> 02:02:05,572
[SPEAKER_20]: But one of the things that they did say that these outside folks said was that we had a lot of work to do on family and community engagement.

1575
02:02:05,772 --> 02:02:07,292
[SPEAKER_20]: And they offered to come back again

1576
02:02:07,745 --> 02:02:08,405
[SPEAKER_20]: and work with us.

1577
02:02:08,505 --> 02:02:14,726
[SPEAKER_20]: And we were not able to do that because we were so prioritizing so many other things and family engagement has to be critical for us.

1578
02:02:14,806 --> 02:02:17,167
[SPEAKER_20]: It has to be something where it is a back and forth.

1579
02:02:17,187 --> 02:02:22,007
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're not shouting at each other and trying to figure out who's blaming who and shame and everything.

1580
02:02:22,087 --> 02:02:23,528
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to work together to be able to do this.

1581
02:02:23,568 --> 02:02:29,189
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that I've been saying this earlier tonight and most especially, most especially we have to listen to the students.

1582
02:02:29,529 --> 02:02:32,929
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have to figure out a way that we're gonna listen to the students too.

1583
02:02:33,269 --> 02:02:35,250
[SPEAKER_20]: So I appreciate member Graham's motion.

1584
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:36,630
[SPEAKER_20]: I second that and I'm sure we'll have

1585
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:40,448
[SPEAKER_20]: deeper conversations about how we're going to do that, but we are going to do that.

1586
02:02:40,468 --> 02:02:41,372
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to find a forum.

1587
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:44,511
[SPEAKER_20]: and more than one for our students to be heard as well.

1588
02:02:44,591 --> 02:02:55,176
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want folks that are out there listening to know that, but also I know that there are folks out there, you know who you are, who we've dealt with other stuff last year, maybe the year before related to bullying.

1589
02:02:55,956 --> 02:02:58,377
[SPEAKER_20]: This is not the first time of bullying in Medford public schools.

1590
02:02:58,497 --> 02:03:00,638
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not the first time bullying in most public schools.

1591
02:03:00,998 --> 02:03:02,059
[SPEAKER_20]: It is an ongoing issue.

1592
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:11,263
[SPEAKER_20]: We see this, especially, I sent a family member, I mean, a community member, an article from Ed Week this week that talked about the higher incidence and rate of violence in our public schools right now.

1593
02:03:11,696 --> 02:03:22,085
[SPEAKER_20]: and bullying and what's happening in the mental health, major mental health crisis we have nationally in our country, both because of the pandemic, but also because we're all at each other's throats because we're exhausted and beat and tired.

1594
02:03:22,105 --> 02:03:23,707
[SPEAKER_20]: And the kids are watching this too.

1595
02:03:23,747 --> 02:03:29,632
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just hope that we can figure out a way that we're going to be able to collaborate and work together to move forward because that's where I'm at.

1596
02:03:29,772 --> 02:03:30,593
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I want to do.

1597
02:03:30,973 --> 02:03:33,115
[SPEAKER_20]: And I really appreciate member Graham's motion.

1598
02:03:33,135 --> 02:03:35,257
[SPEAKER_20]: So I second that motion and thank you all for tonight.

1599
02:03:35,297 --> 02:03:37,519
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it was painful and it's going to continue to be painful.

1600
02:03:38,075 --> 02:03:46,662
[SPEAKER_20]: adaptive work, so technical work is the stuff that's the low-hanging fruit, the things you can do sort of easily, lock the doors, maybe get an SRO, things that are sort of technical.

1601
02:03:46,963 --> 02:03:52,507
[SPEAKER_20]: The adaptive change, the changing our hearts and minds, really being able to think about what the root of the problem is, that's painful.

1602
02:03:52,587 --> 02:03:56,251
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes longer, but we can do it if we're able to work together to do it.

1603
02:03:56,451 --> 02:03:58,012
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that we can, and I hope that we can.

1604
02:03:58,192 --> 02:03:58,553
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1605
02:03:59,093 --> 02:04:02,216
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Rousseau, if you can call the roll, and then we'll let Council Member speak.

[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

02:04:19,326 --> 02:04:19,406

02:04:19,426 --> 02:04:19,506

02:04:20,086 --> 02:04:20,167

02:04:20,187 --> 02:04:20,247

1705
02:04:21,587 --> 02:04:21,827
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1706
02:04:21,847 --> 02:04:21,907
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1707
02:04:21,927 --> 02:04:22,047
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1708
02:04:22,067 --> 02:04:22,227
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1709
02:04:22,287 --> 02:04:22,487
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1710
02:04:22,507 --> 02:04:22,567
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1711
02:04:22,587 --> 02:04:22,647
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1712
02:04:22,667 --> 02:04:22,827
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1713
02:04:22,847 --> 02:04:22,927
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1714
02:04:22,947 --> 02:04:23,007
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1715
02:04:23,027 --> 02:04:23,128
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1716
02:04:23,148 --> 02:04:23,228
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1717
02:04:23,268 --> 02:04:23,368
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1718
02:04:23,388 --> 02:04:23,448
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1719
02:04:33,431 --> 02:04:50,864
[SPEAKER_36]: I just want to express that as a city counselor, you will see resolutions from this counselor that will ask you Madam Mayor, the resolution that if you came to our, our body for funding for licensed security guides to help our principals and assistant principals to make this happen.

1720
02:04:51,265 --> 02:04:55,388
[SPEAKER_36]: That'll be a resolution, there'll be another resolution that the council would like to ask

1721
02:04:56,109 --> 02:05:08,761
[SPEAKER_36]: Members of the school committee, the police department, our teachers that we set up a team summit, so we can work with our children so they can tell us what they want, just like the brave young men and women that were here tonight.

1722
02:05:09,402 --> 02:05:13,706
[SPEAKER_36]: So that will be the dialogue that needs to be started, there'll be a few others, but

1723
02:05:14,887 --> 02:05:21,270
[SPEAKER_36]: As Mr. Puccio said earlier, we allow our parents to monitor lunches.

1724
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:27,213
[SPEAKER_36]: We allow our parents to monitor different various programs throughout the schools.

1725
02:05:27,713 --> 02:05:36,478
[SPEAKER_36]: Maybe it's time that we ask those parents, and myself included, that we get more involved on a daily basis at Medford High School so the kids see our faces.

1726
02:05:37,118 --> 02:05:38,999
[SPEAKER_36]: Not to be the policemen, not to be

1727
02:05:46,104 --> 02:06:01,417
[SPEAKER_36]: express this, the communication that I've gotten back from students and parents over the last 24 hours and before, is the understanding that we are very fortunate to have a headmaster like Paul DeLava.

1728
02:06:02,838 --> 02:06:03,639
[SPEAKER_36]: Paul DeLava.

1729
02:06:06,581 --> 02:06:10,665
[SPEAKER_36]: And I know Paul DeLava will be very upset because someone's talking kindly about him.

1730
02:06:11,653 --> 02:06:19,596
[SPEAKER_36]: But Paul DeLava was part of that group that when I was a school committee member, he was a coach, he was a teacher, he loves Medford.

1731
02:06:20,836 --> 02:06:36,721
[SPEAKER_36]: So whatever was implemented after that, whatever stigma that's out there that people are portraying what that administration can do or can't do, let's try to find a way to correct it and make sure we don't lose people like Paul DeLava and his staff.

1732
02:06:37,201 --> 02:06:38,762
[SPEAKER_36]: Because if we lost him right now,

1733
02:06:39,704 --> 02:06:41,285
[SPEAKER_36]: we would be going back years.

1734
02:06:41,945 --> 02:06:43,166
[SPEAKER_36]: So thank you for your attention.

1735
02:06:43,826 --> 02:06:45,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1736
02:06:49,729 --> 02:06:51,029
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you everybody for being here.

1737
02:06:51,049 --> 02:06:52,090
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a lot of work to do.

1738
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:53,411
[SPEAKER_33]: We're committed to doing it.

1739
02:06:53,811 --> 02:07:03,375
[SPEAKER_33]: And again, thank you to the teachers and the nurses and the police department for supporting central administration, my team to get through today.

1740
02:07:03,635 --> 02:07:06,677
[SPEAKER_33]: And our prayers are with the family.

1741
02:07:09,386 --> 02:07:11,386
[SPEAKER_33]: Mr. Murphy, do you wanna go on to the labor update?

1742
02:07:12,447 --> 02:07:19,348
[SPEAKER_33]: I know we kind of already, the cat's out of the bag, so maybe something brief, labor relations update number two.

1743
02:07:22,389 --> 02:07:32,731
[SPEAKER_40]: As the mayor announced at the beginning of the meeting, the school committee and executive session this evening approved the ratified memorandum of agreement with the Metro Teachers Association.

1744
02:07:33,372 --> 02:07:35,292
[SPEAKER_40]: It is a two-part,

1745
02:07:35,677 --> 02:07:50,597
[SPEAKER_40]: contract, what is referred to frequently as a three plus one, beginning in the 2122 school year retroactive and continuing through the 2425 school year, the substantive provisions are consistent, for the most part with

1746
02:07:51,698 --> 02:08:00,803
[SPEAKER_40]: What you have previously been briefed on specifically on October 17th when we had reached a previous tentative agreement that was not ratified by the teachers union.

1747
02:08:02,164 --> 02:08:16,632
[SPEAKER_40]: The implementation of the full length Wednesdays at the elementary time, which is the committee knows was discussed a number of occasions and has been a topic on the bargaining table throughout the process of the 13 month negotiation.

1748
02:08:18,706 --> 02:08:32,277
[SPEAKER_40]: That will the implementation for that will begin in the following school year so in the 2324 school year, the number of process steps that we will take in coordination with the teachers association to prepare for that implementation.

1749
02:08:32,297 --> 02:08:36,140
[SPEAKER_40]: As I brief the school committee on an executive session this evening.

1750
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:39,182
[SPEAKER_40]: The budgetary impact over the four years is 11.35%.

1751
02:08:39,742 --> 02:09:00,093
[SPEAKER_40]: That meets the school committee's goals of having a competitive but sustainable wage increase and continues our proud tradition of having educators who are compensated on the higher end of the continuum, with respect to comparable districts so as you've heard me say many times it's something that.

1752
02:09:01,641 --> 02:09:11,188
[SPEAKER_40]: is something that we're both proud of, and it was a priority throughout the course of these negotiations as members of the MTA referred to previously this evening.

1753
02:09:11,488 --> 02:09:18,113
[SPEAKER_40]: I think there's a mutual understanding that in order to maximize

1754
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:27,767
[SPEAKER_40]: the impact in a positive way for students, there will need to be improved and more constructive discourse.

1755
02:09:28,528 --> 02:09:32,111
[SPEAKER_40]: And certainly that is the feeling of the school administration.

1756
02:09:32,131 --> 02:09:37,535
[SPEAKER_40]: We're looking forward to doing our part to try to set up a more positive and constructive tone.

1757
02:09:38,256 --> 02:09:41,738
[SPEAKER_40]: And I would imagine that the MTA representatives feel the same way.

1758
02:09:42,859 --> 02:09:47,383
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think there's certainly plenty else to discuss, but I think my recommendation

1759
02:09:48,127 --> 02:09:56,251
[SPEAKER_40]: would be that if the committee has additional questions, be happy to answer those, budgetary or otherwise, when we reconvene in January.

1760
02:09:56,931 --> 02:09:57,532
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1761
02:09:57,552 --> 02:09:58,192
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1762
02:09:58,232 --> 02:09:58,792
[SPEAKER_40]: Thanks a lot, Sue.

1763
02:10:00,673 --> 02:10:00,853
[SPEAKER_33]: Ms.

1764
02:10:00,913 --> 02:10:05,175
[SPEAKER_33]: Galussi, report on reading instruction curriculum.

1765
02:10:06,356 --> 02:10:06,516
[SPEAKER_33]: Ms.

1766
02:10:06,536 --> 02:10:09,377
[SPEAKER_33]: Suzanne Galussi, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instructions.

1767
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:14,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1768
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:16,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1769
02:10:18,658 --> 02:10:28,123
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm here to report on seven questions were proposed that I'm just going to read through, if that's okay with the body.

1770
02:10:28,263 --> 02:10:32,966
[SPEAKER_16]: So all have to do with current reading instruction at the elementary school level.

1771
02:10:33,466 --> 02:10:40,490
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first question asked if Medford Public Schools have curricula from Fountas and Pinnell utilized by their teachers.

1772
02:10:41,831 --> 02:10:42,531
[SPEAKER_16]: We do not.

1773
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:47,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Previously, part of one of the assessment benchmarks

1774
02:10:48,247 --> 02:11:00,652
[SPEAKER_16]: under comprehension, we had utilized part of the Fountas and Pinnell, but since my transition into this position, we've phased that out, so we do no longer use that.

1775
02:11:01,752 --> 02:11:05,554
[SPEAKER_16]: The second question was, does Meffitt Public Schools use any curricula from Lucy Calkins?

1776
02:11:06,274 --> 02:11:07,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Currently, no, we do not.

1777
02:11:08,495 --> 02:11:14,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Years back, we did have a writing program, never anything under reading instruction.

1778
02:11:15,405 --> 02:11:27,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Question three are we purchasing any reading curriculum using the three queuing system method public schools does not nor will not purchase any curriculum using the three queuing.

1779
02:11:27,894 --> 02:11:29,316
[SPEAKER_16]: rules or system.

1780
02:11:29,936 --> 02:11:36,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Question four, how many minutes per day do our K-3 elementary teachers spend on phonics instruction with the entire class?

1781
02:11:36,482 --> 02:11:54,297
[SPEAKER_16]: So as I've presented several times to this body, currently in grades K through two, the phonics is spent for at least 45 minutes, somewhere from 20 to 45 minutes using ECRI, Enhanced Core Reading Instruction.

1782
02:11:55,037 --> 02:11:55,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Teachers have

1783
02:11:57,116 --> 02:11:58,517
[SPEAKER_16]: That's for K through three.

1784
02:12:00,619 --> 02:12:05,883
[SPEAKER_16]: The next question was what percent of our K through three teachers have received training in this phonics instruction.

1785
02:12:06,403 --> 02:12:09,706
[SPEAKER_16]: So as previously presented to this body.

1786
02:12:11,905 --> 02:12:16,087
[SPEAKER_16]: For the past three years, we have had direct partnership with Hill for Literacy.

1787
02:12:16,427 --> 02:12:28,872
[SPEAKER_16]: They have been giving some professional development and training to our teachers since 2018, but for the past three years, they have been in doing sustained embedded training with all of our K-2 staff monthly.

1788
02:12:29,372 --> 02:12:36,655
[SPEAKER_16]: That includes observations of teachers engaged in enhanced core reading instruction, phonics instruction.

1789
02:12:37,395 --> 02:12:39,736
[SPEAKER_16]: It includes observations and feedback.

1790
02:12:39,776 --> 02:12:41,117
[SPEAKER_16]: It also includes training.

1791
02:12:45,050 --> 02:13:03,834
[SPEAKER_16]: I also have in the report for your information, all of the previous presentations to this body as well as all of the professional development that teachers have had or been exposed to that opportunity for the past four years.

1792
02:13:05,074 --> 02:13:11,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Question six was, have our teachers been taught that using alternatives such as three key,

1793
02:13:13,073 --> 02:13:22,139
[SPEAKER_16]: 53 queuing is harmful for students teachers have been provided with, as I just said, with multiple opportunities for the professional development.

1794
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:30,425
[SPEAKER_16]: In speaking of that it is ongoing, but it has been a conversation, I can also make sure that it is.

1795
02:13:31,826 --> 02:13:33,166
[SPEAKER_16]: a more direct conversation.

1796
02:13:34,327 --> 02:13:45,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Part of what I have done in trying to keep communication aligned and consistent across the district with four different schools is I've done an elementary update, like a memo.

1797
02:13:46,229 --> 02:13:47,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year, I sent out 18 of them.

1798
02:13:48,429 --> 02:13:56,011
[SPEAKER_16]: So I could share those with you if you'd like, but in those memos, I am specifically talking about curriculum

1799
02:13:56,391 --> 02:14:04,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm specifically talking about instruction, I'm specifically talking about expectations, and I'm aligning our assessments that teachers are using across the district.

1800
02:14:04,898 --> 02:14:08,381
[SPEAKER_16]: So it has been messaged, but it will continue to be so.

1801
02:14:10,682 --> 02:14:23,412
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the last question was, what's our plan for ensuring that elementary school teachers current are aware of the science of reading and the use of the three queuing system that's harmful.

1802
02:14:24,962 --> 02:14:34,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure some of you, some of this may have come from this wonderful podcast that a lot of us have maybe listened to.

1803
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:46,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Part of this messaging, so for the science of reading, that is the pedagogical shift that we've been on for years.

1804
02:14:47,317 --> 02:14:52,200
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really difficult to sometimes explain what the science of reading is.

1805
02:14:53,801 --> 02:14:57,183
[SPEAKER_16]: to parents or to the community, even sometimes for teachers.

1806
02:14:57,403 --> 02:15:01,446
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is what we've been doing and been messaging for the past few years.

1807
02:15:02,626 --> 02:15:14,754
[SPEAKER_16]: With the enhanced core reading instruction shift that all of K-2 teachers are doing, this year we have a lot going on in terms of literacy instruction, as I've presented before.

1808
02:15:15,354 --> 02:15:19,558
[SPEAKER_16]: we are going to be looking at a new program that is part of what we're working on this year.

1809
02:15:20,418 --> 02:15:33,809
[SPEAKER_16]: All elementary reading staff and the two middle school reading interventionists have been engaging in the science of reading course that we have offered in partnership with Hill for Literacy this school year.

1810
02:15:33,869 --> 02:15:35,030
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a 10-month course.

1811
02:15:35,571 --> 02:15:36,231
[SPEAKER_16]: We meet every month.

1812
02:15:36,291 --> 02:15:39,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, tomorrow is this month's meeting.

1813
02:15:40,751 --> 02:15:45,915
[SPEAKER_16]: That will be, with everything going on this year, we started with the reading teachers.

1814
02:15:47,657 --> 02:16:04,090
[SPEAKER_16]: In the absence of instructional coaching, I really need the reading staff to be well trained and vetted and knowledgeable about this, so that the plan is next year, the science of reading course, there is a pre-K to two course, and there's also a grades three through five course.

1815
02:16:04,430 --> 02:16:07,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Both of those courses will be offered for staff next year.

1816
02:16:08,274 --> 02:16:11,316
[SPEAKER_16]: but this year we really wanted to focus on the elementary staff.

1817
02:16:14,098 --> 02:16:17,180
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope that that answers your questions.

1818
02:16:17,240 --> 02:16:34,010
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here if you have any questions pertaining to either my responses, what was written in the report or any of the several attachments regarding our professional development plan or my presentations here to this body.

1819
02:16:34,653 --> 02:16:34,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1820
02:16:35,033 --> 02:16:35,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Rousseau.

1821
02:16:36,374 --> 02:16:36,774
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1822
02:16:36,894 --> 02:16:37,734
[SPEAKER_41]: I really appreciate it.

1823
02:16:37,814 --> 02:16:43,736
[SPEAKER_41]: I was very happy with the answers as my confidence in you is boundless.

1824
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:45,657
[SPEAKER_41]: So I wasn't surprised by many of these.

1825
02:16:46,877 --> 02:16:50,678
[SPEAKER_41]: There's one word that I'm sure you know what word it is.

1826
02:16:50,698 --> 02:16:53,019
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm going to talk about opportunity.

1827
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:57,781
[SPEAKER_41]: Our contract and the amount of professional development time this district has,

1828
02:16:59,082 --> 02:17:02,824
[SPEAKER_41]: is essentially the legal minimum in my understanding.

1829
02:17:02,884 --> 02:17:10,427
[SPEAKER_41]: Other districts, they have 189 days that they pay their staff and we do 183 or 184, 183, I think.

1830
02:17:11,447 --> 02:17:27,054
[SPEAKER_41]: And if you think about six days of professional development for your staff year after year after year, it is unreasonable to conclude that those six days of professional development do not make a dramatic difference in your staff's

1831
02:17:28,063 --> 02:17:29,864
[SPEAKER_41]: professional development.

1832
02:17:30,305 --> 02:17:45,637
[SPEAKER_41]: So, I'm not asking you how to solve that because that's a financial problem and something we'll have to discuss perhaps the next contract to try and get maybe one more day of professional development, which would be a 25% increase, which would is a real substantial change.

1833
02:17:46,338 --> 02:17:47,939
[SPEAKER_41]: When I see the word opportunity.

1834
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:54,224
[SPEAKER_41]: I read that to mean the staff may decide to participate in the professional development or not.

1835
02:17:54,864 --> 02:17:55,925
[SPEAKER_41]: And that is correct.

1836
02:17:56,466 --> 02:17:56,706
[SPEAKER_41]: Correct.

1837
02:17:58,246 --> 02:18:00,008
[SPEAKER_16]: It all depends on how it's formatted.

1838
02:18:00,028 --> 02:18:15,640
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would say in response to that, in light of tonight's wonderful news, that was part of the superintendent and my goal in the Wednesday schedule, because those Wednesday half days will be for district professional development.

1839
02:18:16,341 --> 02:18:18,903
[SPEAKER_16]: And so how we utilize that is key.

1840
02:18:19,484 --> 02:18:27,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I think that for now, the report, yes, the word opportunity was used carefully.

1841
02:18:27,608 --> 02:18:35,410
[SPEAKER_16]: and purposefully, but it is, I'm really excited and very hopeful for this new schedule.

1842
02:18:35,770 --> 02:18:53,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I do think it's an alignment for families that makes sense, but I also think it's, I'm just so happy to be able to offer, well, not offer, well, I'm really happy to be able to have teachers engaged in professional development that's needed and that they have the time to do so.

1843
02:18:53,833 --> 02:18:54,454
[SPEAKER_41]: Great, thank you.

1844
02:18:54,514 --> 02:18:55,774
[SPEAKER_41]: So, I mean,

1845
02:18:56,604 --> 02:19:01,530
[SPEAKER_41]: I feel like this is really a question for next year, which is I believe when we start the next contract.

1846
02:19:02,211 --> 02:19:09,960
[SPEAKER_41]: Actually, no, we got a plus one so we have a little bit more time but I do think as a district and as a city we need to talk about funding.

1847
02:19:10,481 --> 02:19:12,423
[SPEAKER_41]: Well, we always have to talk about funding but

1848
02:19:13,063 --> 02:19:22,046
[SPEAKER_41]: You know if we can get one more professional development day which is, I believe, around $100,000 if I remember some big number to pay the staff for one more day.

1849
02:19:22,066 --> 02:19:25,487
[SPEAKER_41]: I may be misremembering that but it's it's not.

1850
02:19:26,248 --> 02:19:26,568
[SPEAKER_41]: It's not $10,000.

1851
02:19:26,928 --> 02:19:27,368
[SPEAKER_41]: So, you know, we.

1852
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:43,818
[SPEAKER_41]: in five minutes flat and certainly you and your role as a leader could come up with a year of professional development if the staff did nothing but do that.

1853
02:19:44,999 --> 02:20:01,090
[SPEAKER_41]: So, I think we should have a real hard conversation about how to expand that available time because when I look at other districts that are doing 189 days, I mean, I'm assuming they're doing something interesting with their professional development and it just feels like we are

1854
02:20:03,430 --> 02:20:06,592
[SPEAKER_41]: missing a lot of opportunity.

1855
02:20:06,972 --> 02:20:12,074
[SPEAKER_41]: Again, there's opportunity to really move our staff forward.

1856
02:20:12,154 --> 02:20:15,176
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm not expecting staff to do this on their own free time in the summer.

1857
02:20:15,876 --> 02:20:18,237
[SPEAKER_41]: This is part of their job that they should be paid for.

1858
02:20:18,257 --> 02:20:23,519
[SPEAKER_41]: But if we're not gonna pay them, we certainly can't demand them to sit on professional development.

1859
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:30,463
[SPEAKER_41]: So I hope when we get, it's probably 2024 when we should really be talking about that.

1860
02:20:32,245 --> 02:20:35,088
[SPEAKER_41]: a good sense of like, do we want to go for one more day?

1861
02:20:35,108 --> 02:20:37,630
[SPEAKER_41]: Do we want to go for two or three?

1862
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:43,535
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, I'm assuming you would agree that we could fill up two or three more days of professional development a year in a heartbeat.

1863
02:20:43,755 --> 02:20:44,535
[SPEAKER_17]: We always could.

1864
02:20:44,736 --> 02:20:45,236
[SPEAKER_41]: We always could.

1865
02:20:45,276 --> 02:20:45,676
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, great.

1866
02:20:45,816 --> 02:20:46,137
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1867
02:20:46,697 --> 02:20:47,458
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you for the report.

1868
02:20:51,221 --> 02:20:51,781
[SPEAKER_28]: Member Hays.

1869
02:20:52,842 --> 02:20:58,427
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess I'd want to add to that, I think another piece that you mentioned, and I don't think you deliberately mentioned it quickly, but

1870
02:20:58,871 --> 02:21:11,101
[SPEAKER_28]: the having instructional support coaches as much as the professional development is important, that ongoing support to teachers where they can troubleshoot when they're trying it out.

1871
02:21:11,261 --> 02:21:20,769
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, you can't do that in a one day professional or even a five day professional development because things happen as you're teaching something and you need to understand how to tweak it or change it.

1872
02:21:21,289 --> 02:21:28,315
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think balancing out, if we're talking about how we're going to spend money, you know, instructional support coaches versus

1873
02:21:29,133 --> 02:21:31,715
[SPEAKER_28]: professional development or do we have the money for it all?

1874
02:21:31,775 --> 02:21:36,118
[SPEAKER_28]: But I just don't want to, I don't want to go over that lightly because you did mention that.

1875
02:21:36,138 --> 02:21:40,100
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think that that is incredibly important and something not to be overlooked.

1876
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:40,680
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree.

1877
02:21:44,203 --> 02:21:45,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1878
02:21:45,604 --> 02:21:45,744
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1879
02:21:45,764 --> 02:21:46,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

1880
02:21:46,844 --> 02:21:47,645
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, member Ms.

1881
02:21:47,665 --> 02:21:47,985
[SPEAKER_33]: Stone.

1882
02:21:50,322 --> 02:21:52,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you for what.

1883
02:21:53,045 --> 02:21:55,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So, personally, Declan's in fifth grade.

1884
02:21:56,788 --> 02:22:02,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like his writing is not what his older siblings were doing in fifth grade.

1885
02:22:03,034 --> 02:22:07,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a writing curriculum that goes along with what's happening now?

1886
02:22:07,219 --> 02:22:10,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is that something that you're also looking into?

1887
02:22:11,795 --> 02:22:22,702
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's a if for every know that the enhanced core reading instruction there could be a small written portion but what you're talking about for at the fifth grade level is slightly different.

1888
02:22:23,202 --> 02:22:25,744
[SPEAKER_16]: I think if we track back the three years.

1889
02:22:26,785 --> 02:22:29,106
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a skill that was definitely.

1890
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:38,525
[SPEAKER_16]: definitely lost a little bit of that skill during the pandemic, especially it's really hard to teach writing virtually.

1891
02:22:39,066 --> 02:22:47,253
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that is kind of a problem across the board, not just in Medford, but that is a skill that was really kind of impeded during the pandemic.

1892
02:22:47,693 --> 02:22:56,961
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think part of the process that we're gonna start going through, and I'll have more communication on this, to select a new ELA program

1893
02:22:58,504 --> 02:23:01,888
[SPEAKER_16]: is going to be looking at the components of all of those programs.

1894
02:23:02,208 --> 02:23:10,076
[SPEAKER_16]: And part of that will be looking at the writing component, just to see which program would best fit our needs.

1895
02:23:10,136 --> 02:23:18,125
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think part of the core review process that all the schools are going to do, I'm working on it right now,

1896
02:23:18,738 --> 02:23:24,384
[SPEAKER_16]: I was kind of hoping to have the Wednesday schedule this year, so I have to do a little tweaking to how we're going to roll this out with staff but.

1897
02:23:25,265 --> 02:23:35,176
[SPEAKER_16]: In essence, it's an all hands on deck kind of model that we're doing this is the model that Jesse it's the curate model that it's best practice when selecting an la program.

1898
02:23:35,856 --> 02:23:43,758
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we're going to have teachers looking at every strand, every English language arts strand within each program.

1899
02:23:44,438 --> 02:23:48,339
[SPEAKER_16]: And that way we'll be able to best see what fits Medford's needs.

1900
02:23:48,439 --> 02:23:50,119
[SPEAKER_16]: And in that is the writing program.

1901
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,680
[SPEAKER_10]: My college roommate is a teacher in Boston.

1902
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:55,061
[SPEAKER_10]: She sent me the podcast.

1903
02:23:55,841 --> 02:23:57,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Something sold, sold a story.

1904
02:23:57,861 --> 02:23:58,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1905
02:23:58,781 --> 02:24:04,363
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a conversation not too long ago about it, but also the whole science of reading.

1906
02:24:04,383 --> 02:24:04,423
[SPEAKER_10]: So

1907
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:13,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you say, because the hybrid year of COVID are going out March of 2020, has the science of reading not been part of professional development?

1908
02:24:13,813 --> 02:24:14,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no, no.

1909
02:24:14,633 --> 02:24:15,774
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all we've been doing.

1910
02:24:16,694 --> 02:24:21,117
[SPEAKER_16]: So the science of reading is about how we're teaching students to learn to read.

1911
02:24:21,197 --> 02:24:21,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1912
02:24:21,357 --> 02:24:22,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Going back to phonics.

1913
02:24:22,678 --> 02:24:22,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes.

1914
02:24:23,338 --> 02:24:25,579
[SPEAKER_16]: And direct explicit instruction.

1915
02:24:31,162 --> 02:24:31,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1916
02:24:31,583 --> 02:24:33,043
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a great podcast, by the way.

1917
02:24:33,224 --> 02:24:34,064
[SPEAKER_20]: I highly recommend it.

1918
02:24:34,768 --> 02:24:40,090
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, but it's also sort of going back to, so that's the other thing is that the science of reading is not new.

1919
02:24:40,490 --> 02:24:54,754
[SPEAKER_20]: It, you know, it was one thing and then people tried something else for awhile and then they're going back to sort of what has been known to be the fundamental of phonics and really looking at the science of it, as opposed to just sort of the practice and trying new things and what's actually worked.

1920
02:24:55,074 --> 02:24:58,676
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just thinking of my own having kids from 2002 to 2012.

1921
02:24:58,716 --> 02:24:59,836
[SPEAKER_10]: So Quinn never did phonics.

1922
02:25:03,550 --> 02:25:04,630
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's the 20-year-old.

1923
02:25:05,511 --> 02:25:12,094
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess my concern is the teachers who went to school and learned the science of reading, right?

1924
02:25:12,714 --> 02:25:15,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting the, not the phonics part.

1925
02:25:16,095 --> 02:25:19,597
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's probably better if you think of it as an umbrella.

1926
02:25:20,097 --> 02:25:26,019
[SPEAKER_16]: So Medford Public Schools teachers started to be exposed to this in 2018 through professional development days.

1927
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:27,640
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's K-5.

1928
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:29,861
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the brain-based instruction.

1929
02:25:30,962 --> 02:25:33,064
[SPEAKER_16]: That they started in 2018.

1930
02:25:33,404 --> 02:25:43,133
[SPEAKER_16]: When I came on board in this position for the 2020-2021 school year, that was just coming back from the pandemic.

1931
02:25:43,173 --> 02:25:45,195
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had ECRI.

1932
02:25:45,675 --> 02:25:51,200
[SPEAKER_16]: That is when I started to bring in health literacy regularly to be meeting with staff.

1933
02:25:52,230 --> 02:26:08,880
[SPEAKER_16]: but because we had students learning at completely different models, we were covering it all, but it wasn't until the 2021 school year in which that was the absolute mandate that this is what we're doing.

1934
02:26:10,901 --> 02:26:15,904
[SPEAKER_16]: No more of your DRA kits or your Fountas and Pinnell kits.

1935
02:26:16,124 --> 02:26:18,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Have I gone into the school buildings and confiscated them?

1936
02:26:20,542 --> 02:26:22,864
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but it's been very clear.

1937
02:26:23,804 --> 02:26:28,968
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been very clear that we're no longer using those programs as district assessments.

1938
02:26:30,128 --> 02:26:34,391
[SPEAKER_16]: We have now transitioned to utilizing ECRI, we utilize MAP.

1939
02:26:35,252 --> 02:26:38,494
[SPEAKER_16]: The reading teachers are being trained this year in dibbles.

1940
02:26:39,094 --> 02:26:45,879
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are on the right path, but member McLaughlin is correct.

1941
02:26:45,959 --> 02:26:47,960
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this brain based,

1942
02:26:49,344 --> 02:26:52,587
[SPEAKER_16]: way of teaching students how to read has been around for decades.

1943
02:26:55,389 --> 02:26:58,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes, there's actual proof.

1944
02:26:58,951 --> 02:27:12,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Students have been tested, brainwaves, it's been documented proof, and a lot of this, so just so we know, Hillful Literacy has always been, if you want to vet them out, they're a very reputable program.

1945
02:27:12,862 --> 02:27:15,064
[SPEAKER_16]: They started as a non-profit through the

1946
02:27:15,923 --> 02:27:19,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Massachusetts General Hospital program, which is where a lot of this began.

1947
02:27:19,485 --> 02:27:24,708
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's through the University of Oregon, and now Boston University has gotten in on this.

1948
02:27:24,788 --> 02:27:30,312
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's all best practice, very well vetted, very aligned.

1949
02:27:30,392 --> 02:27:31,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Is DIBLS phonics?

1950
02:27:31,753 --> 02:27:31,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1951
02:27:32,673 --> 02:27:36,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so now DIBLS is all- But it's an assessment, it's a progress monitoring assessment tool.

1952
02:27:38,076 --> 02:27:38,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1953
02:27:40,878 --> 02:27:42,439
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess- Similar to a map.

1954
02:27:43,737 --> 02:27:46,498
[SPEAKER_16]: similar to what we're doing with NWEA map.

1955
02:27:47,778 --> 02:27:52,020
[SPEAKER_16]: But DIBLS, no, it is not computerized.

1956
02:27:52,380 --> 02:27:52,740
[SPEAKER_16]: It can be.

1957
02:27:59,881 --> 02:28:01,822
[SPEAKER_16]: We could talk hours on this.

1958
02:28:01,922 --> 02:28:04,283
[SPEAKER_16]: I better listen to the podcast first.

1959
02:28:04,783 --> 02:28:07,865
[SPEAKER_16]: The podcast is wonderful.

1960
02:28:09,306 --> 02:28:11,787
[SPEAKER_16]: It's six episodes, but it's well worth it.

1961
02:28:11,807 --> 02:28:21,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think our teachers, because they were teaching the non-phonics version for so long, it's hard to break into now going back to phonics?

1962
02:28:22,512 --> 02:28:24,053
[SPEAKER_16]: I think our K-2 staff,

1963
02:28:25,214 --> 02:28:30,819
[SPEAKER_16]: In all of the embedded training that they've had with helpful literacy in my conversations with staff.

1964
02:28:32,761 --> 02:28:45,874
[SPEAKER_16]: They have seen the positive effects of this teaching, and so I think the shift right now is is like our three to five staff just this year i'm bringing grade three teachers in.

1965
02:28:46,550 --> 02:28:54,377
[SPEAKER_16]: with the Hill for Literacy training once a month, so that they're really getting exposed to what the K-2 teachers have been exposed to.

1966
02:28:55,158 --> 02:28:57,760
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think, yes, change takes a while.

1967
02:28:58,261 --> 02:29:08,090
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do think that the podcast, which is really well done, it's going to elicit some feelings for some teachers too.

1968
02:29:08,430 --> 02:29:11,033
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was in the classroom for 15 years and I taught

1969
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:14,431
[SPEAKER_16]: I never taught K to two, but I taught grades three through five.

1970
02:29:14,491 --> 02:29:16,692
[SPEAKER_16]: And as a third grade teacher, that's where I spent most of my time.

1971
02:29:16,952 --> 02:29:19,033
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I listened to that podcast and kind of.

1972
02:29:20,014 --> 02:29:32,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Had a little bit of that, that gut feeling, because I think it will elicit some of those feelings for teachers that, um, they, you know, they could have done differently.

1973
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:37,542
[SPEAKER_10]: You said you bring it in grade three, you bring it in grade four and five and different cycles or.

1974
02:29:38,311 --> 02:29:41,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I'm trying to fit it all in because K to two is still being trained.

1975
02:29:41,773 --> 02:29:42,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1976
02:29:42,794 --> 02:29:45,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, the other thing we're doing this year is part of the training.

1977
02:29:45,876 --> 02:30:04,689
[SPEAKER_16]: So when, when the teachers are getting the science reading training tomorrow at the end of the day, um, the elementary principals and assistant principals come in and they're being trained, um, because I need school leaders, uh, to be able to be a resource and to be able to understand this.

1978
02:30:04,969 --> 02:30:05,289
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um,

1979
02:30:08,587 --> 02:30:09,668
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's not a great answer.

1980
02:30:10,088 --> 02:30:17,955
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love to be able to be doing all of the grades simultaneously, but I'm just trying to build in a prioritized fashion.

1981
02:30:19,456 --> 02:30:30,625
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do want to just say that Dr. Chiesa and Dr. Riccadeli are at home and on the call listening and have really, you know, partnered with me in this as well as the

1982
02:30:31,075 --> 02:30:32,255
[SPEAKER_16]: elementary reading department.

1983
02:30:33,156 --> 02:30:35,396
[SPEAKER_16]: They are just fabulous in what they do.

1984
02:30:35,736 --> 02:30:39,818
[SPEAKER_16]: They're so energized and excited about this journey that we're all on together.

1985
02:30:39,978 --> 02:30:43,399
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're just a really talented group of people.

1986
02:30:43,459 --> 02:30:45,159
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I just want to make sure.

1987
02:30:45,619 --> 02:30:46,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1988
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:47,100
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, miss.

1989
02:30:47,140 --> 02:30:47,420
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1990
02:30:47,440 --> 02:30:47,760
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1991
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:48,660
[SPEAKER_33]: Appreciate it.

1992
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:51,901
[SPEAKER_33]: Number four, we have report on desi comprehensive district review.

1993
02:30:51,981 --> 02:30:56,023
[SPEAKER_33]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of enrichment and innovation.

1994
02:30:56,823 --> 02:30:57,323
[SPEAKER_33]: Dr. Cushing.

1995
02:30:58,268 --> 02:31:00,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

1996
02:31:00,129 --> 02:31:02,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for this opportunity to speak with you.

1997
02:31:02,090 --> 02:31:06,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me just share the slide deck I prepared.

1998
02:31:07,312 --> 02:31:08,973
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a report in your folders.

1999
02:31:10,534 --> 02:31:11,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one second, I apologize.

2000
02:31:15,098 --> 02:31:24,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were notified in September that we will be partaking in a Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education comprehensive review.

2001
02:31:25,643 --> 02:31:29,425
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a process that is required by state law.

2002
02:31:29,886 --> 02:31:41,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally speaking, what DESE does is 75% are deemed underperforming by DESE standards, and 25% of districts are performing in accordance with DESE standards.

2003
02:31:42,172 --> 02:31:44,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick, loose interpretation of a very long law.

2004
02:31:45,554 --> 02:31:50,696
[SPEAKER_02]: but Medford is part of the second cohort of 25% schools.

2005
02:31:51,797 --> 02:31:59,440
[SPEAKER_02]: State regulations define effective practice through several standards, and there are two overarching categories.

2006
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:14,986
[SPEAKER_02]: First is governance and administrative systems, which then looks at leadership and governance, human resources and professional development, financial and asset management, and then student-centered systems for student support, assessment, and curriculum instruction.

2007
02:32:15,478 --> 02:32:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: All these are technical, each one has three or four more subcategories built out underneath them as well.

2008
02:32:22,849 --> 02:32:28,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And will be reviewed on site in December of 2023.

2009
02:32:29,414 --> 02:32:34,937
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be conducted by the American Institutes of Research, AIR, that has a partnership with DESE.

2010
02:32:35,437 --> 02:32:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: This on-site review will encompass quite possibly hundreds of classroom observations that they would use using the class tool to observe classes.

2011
02:32:47,523 --> 02:32:53,286
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a lot of pre-work done by district leadership and school leaders as well as others.

2012
02:32:54,407 --> 02:32:56,128
[SPEAKER_02]: A comprehensive list of documents

2013
02:32:57,947 --> 02:33:00,468
[SPEAKER_02]: comprehensive that I'll get into a little bit moving forward here.

2014
02:33:01,229 --> 02:33:08,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And district personnel, students, constituents, families will be asked to be part of focus groups or interview sessions.

2015
02:33:09,594 --> 02:33:20,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I said AIR, they're gonna visit schools, conduct classroom observations, they'll meet with staff, school committee members, students, and families, caregivers, conduct the document reviews and analyze data.

2016
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:23,222
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start uploading those after the first of the year.

2017
02:33:23,242 --> 02:33:25,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Review will generate a final report

2018
02:33:26,010 --> 02:33:30,134
[SPEAKER_02]: inclusive of findings and recommendations to improve student outcomes.

2019
02:33:30,194 --> 02:33:37,580
[SPEAKER_02]: This report will come through probably in three months after the report, the visit is finalized.

2020
02:33:38,601 --> 02:33:46,227
[SPEAKER_02]: This was shared with you in the report, but this is the makeup of the groups that will happen across the district.

2021
02:33:47,068 --> 02:33:54,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So superintendent, district leaders, school leaders, instructional staff, school committee members, teacher association leadership, family members,

2022
02:33:54,867 --> 02:34:04,009
[SPEAKER_02]: and students, just so you're aware, and the reviewers will be needing to look through documents.

2023
02:34:04,490 --> 02:34:21,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, so when we say strategic plan, we mean the one for the district, building maps, each school, improvement plans, each school, master schedules, each school, school committee minutes, agendas for a host of meetings, any meeting you can imagine, they'll be looking for various agendas,

2024
02:34:22,383 --> 02:34:25,905
[SPEAKER_02]: budgets, capital plan, some units of study, and many more.

2025
02:34:25,925 --> 02:34:28,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I will share this with you and this will be posted.

2026
02:34:28,946 --> 02:34:36,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can click on that link and it will take you to the full list of a pageless document of many documents.

2027
02:34:37,970 --> 02:34:41,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is our upcoming district review.

2028
02:34:42,952 --> 02:34:45,914
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, I'm happy to attempt to answer them.

2029
02:34:46,174 --> 02:34:51,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you would like further information, I'm happy to speak further later.

2030
02:34:52,927 --> 02:34:53,827
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

2031
02:34:55,528 --> 02:34:55,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night.

2032
02:34:56,269 --> 02:34:56,569
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2033
02:34:58,410 --> 02:35:01,591
[SPEAKER_33]: We do not have any other presentations in the public or continued business.

2034
02:35:01,651 --> 02:35:02,932
[SPEAKER_33]: We do have one item.

2035
02:35:03,432 --> 02:35:08,254
[SPEAKER_33]: Under new business, 2022-54 offered by members Rousseau, Graham, and Mastone.

2036
02:35:09,315 --> 02:35:15,218
[SPEAKER_33]: Whereas on February 3, 2020, the Medford School Committee voted unanimously in favor of a proclamation to make Medford hunger free.

2037
02:35:16,223 --> 02:35:27,949
[SPEAKER_33]: Whereas in the ensuing 35 months, our world has been devastated by a pandemic that has taken more than 1 million lives in our nation alone, and at least 6.6 million lives worldwide.

2038
02:35:28,589 --> 02:35:33,192
[SPEAKER_33]: Whereas the pandemic can be measured in many ways, nearly all of which involve significant loss.

2039
02:35:35,893 --> 02:35:42,897
[SPEAKER_33]: One of those bright spots, childhood hunger in the United States is reduced through pandemic food relief programs through federal and state governments.

2040
02:35:43,456 --> 02:35:53,762
[SPEAKER_33]: Whereas the Medford School Committee has no funding authority, cannot raise taxes or have any effect on the revenues we are allocated from city, state, and federal access to execute on the authority we do have.

2041
02:35:54,302 --> 02:36:04,188
[SPEAKER_33]: Whereas our mission is to provide a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community in pursuit of providing the very best education our children deserve for them and for the future of our world.

2042
02:36:04,208 --> 02:36:05,769
[SPEAKER_33]: Whereas the Medford School Committee,

2043
02:36:08,697 --> 02:36:12,038
[SPEAKER_33]: democratically elected body with exclusive local control.

2044
02:36:12,138 --> 02:36:17,740
[SPEAKER_33]: Public schools must press on the city, state, and federal governments to supply us with the revenues we need to meet our obligations.

2045
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:36,646
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, therefore, be it resolved, the Medford School Committee join the Feed Kids Coalition as a sponsor in urging the Massachusetts State Legislature to make free school meals permanent, directs the superintendent to transmit official copies of this resolution to the following governor-elect, Mara Healy, Senator Elizabeth Warren,

2046
02:36:37,270 --> 02:36:58,007
[SPEAKER_33]: Senator Edward Markey, Congresswoman Catherine Clark, Senator Patricia Jalen, State Representative Paul Donato, Sean Garbley, and Christine Barber, directs the superintendent to transmit an official copy of this resolution to the Medford City Council in accordance with Medford School Committee Rule 77, directs the superintendent to transmit an official copy of the resolution to the Mayor of Medford.

2047
02:36:58,947 --> 02:36:59,448
[SPEAKER_33]: Member Ruseau.

2048
02:37:00,829 --> 02:37:01,870
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Mayor.

2049
02:37:02,230 --> 02:37:04,672
[SPEAKER_41]: I was contacted by

2050
02:37:05,481 --> 02:37:09,103
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm slightly embarrassed, I can't remember who contacted me.

2051
02:37:09,463 --> 02:37:23,332
[SPEAKER_41]: Somebody I didn't know yet on Facebook about the coalition, the Feed Kids Coalition, which is working to press on the state legislature to make free school meals permanent as Maine just did a few weeks ago.

2052
02:37:23,352 --> 02:37:28,495
[SPEAKER_41]: And the importance of it is not just really about

2053
02:37:29,124 --> 02:37:36,888
[SPEAKER_41]: free school meals which is sort of the obvious part, the, the challenges we face as a district, when we do our budget.

2054
02:37:37,709 --> 02:37:42,692
[SPEAKER_41]: Prior to the state doing their budget means we have a choice to include the money.

2055
02:37:44,173 --> 02:37:55,099
[SPEAKER_41]: And then perhaps that money turns out to have not been needed, because the state decides in the last minute to include in their budget, or we don't include it, and then the state doesn't

2056
02:37:55,711 --> 02:38:00,314
[SPEAKER_41]: decide to make it free and then we're stuck where we are not providing free meals to our kids.

2057
02:38:01,035 --> 02:38:12,523
[SPEAKER_41]: It's just an awful position for all school committees to be in because I don't think any school committee's budget is done at the right time to deal with the uncertainty that the state budget has.

2058
02:38:12,583 --> 02:38:19,548
[SPEAKER_41]: Last year, the state did extend the free school meal in the budget.

2059
02:38:20,489 --> 02:38:23,611
[SPEAKER_41]: But again, they did it, I think their budget wasn't even done before June.

2060
02:38:24,031 --> 02:38:25,794
[SPEAKER_41]: 30th I think it was actually after that.

2061
02:38:26,175 --> 02:38:34,889
[SPEAKER_41]: So we had already as a body decided that we all we have a policy that we will provide free school meals but then we did not include it in our budget.

2062
02:38:35,743 --> 02:38:43,666
[SPEAKER_41]: So we got, frankly, very lucky that we have a policy that we were not going to fund, and then the state came through.

2063
02:38:44,806 --> 02:38:57,870
[SPEAKER_41]: So this coalition is just trying to press on our state legislators to make it permanent, take this uncertainty out of the entire process for school committees and for students and families, of course.

2064
02:38:58,090 --> 02:39:02,412
[SPEAKER_41]: So I wanna thank everybody for hopefully supporting it.

2065
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:04,440
[SPEAKER_33]: Motion to approve.

2066

[SPEAKER_33]: If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

02:40:36,485 --> 02:40:38,847
[SPEAKER_33]: Our next meeting is January 9th, 2023.

[SPEAKER_33]: That's a regular school committee meeting here in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

2080
02:40:45,813 --> 02:40:48,415
