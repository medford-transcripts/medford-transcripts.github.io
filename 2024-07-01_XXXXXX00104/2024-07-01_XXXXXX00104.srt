1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
[SPEAKER_00]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining me today.

10
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:50,922
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself by saying your name and pronouns and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:54,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Vijaya Sundaram.

12
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:55,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm she, her, hers.

13
00:00:56,587 --> 00:01:01,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And I happen to be the Poet Laureate of Medford, the second Poet Laureate of Medford.

14
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,014
[SPEAKER_05]: And I live in Medford.

15
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:04,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

16
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we'll get into a little bit more about what that what it means to be the poet laureate.

17
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:16,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we do that, I'm wondering if you could answer the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

18
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:17,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you like to eat there?

19
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:28,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't go out that often to eat, but when we do order food or something, we usually get it from Chili Garden.

20
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:32,969
[SPEAKER_05]: We love Chili Garden in Medford Square, but we don't tend to go out much to eat.

21
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we go out occasionally to an Indian restaurant, but that's not in Medford.

22
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:41,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we really enjoy Chili Garden's food that we get almost every week.

23
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one comes up a lot for sure.

24
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:52,141
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lovely bakery on Salem Street at the intersection of Fellsway West and Salem Street.

25
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And I forget, it has a French Creole name.

26
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:58,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And they sell really nice things.

27
00:01:58,364 --> 00:01:59,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of new, right?

28
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:00,325
[SPEAKER_05]: It's new.

29
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:02,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are Haitian people running it.

30
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:05,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the stuff that they have there.

31
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I knew what it was.

32
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a two-word name.

33
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll come to me.

34
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: If we remember, we'll get back to it.

35
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

36
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:20,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what it means to be the Poet Laureate in Medford, what it means for Medford to have a Poet Laureate.

37
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:30,394
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, each person conceives of what a Poet Laureate does differently, I suppose.

38
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:48,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the end, what we're hoping to do is to bring the community together in the love of poetry, in the love of self-expression, binding ideas and hopes together, maybe be the voice of the community for some things when we're called on to write poems for occasions.

39
00:02:48,757 --> 00:02:51,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've never had to do that before.

40
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:53,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really interesting for me to do.

41
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more an introverted poet and I'm an introspective type of poet.

42
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:09,724
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorites are the romantic poets and the lyric poets of the 19th century and some modern American poets like Naomi Shihab Nye, who's a Palestinian American poet.

43
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:16,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It was interesting to be asked to write poems for occasion.

44
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wrote one for the inauguration of our mayor.

45
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:27,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote one for the CPA celebrations, for the Medford Arts Collaborative.

46
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I never quite remember what to call it.

47
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Arts Medford Collaborative, I think.

48
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:33,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford Arts Collaborative.

49
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:34,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to write for that, Gala.

50
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:54,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've written about eight poems, one for Black History Month, one for MLK Day, one for Pride Flag Day celebration, for Haitian Flag Raising Day, and one for the most recent one was for Juneteenth.

51
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:59,849
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a lovely challenge for me because I

52
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:11,355
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to marry my own voice and my own way of looking at the world with history and with the occasion, which means I had to do some research.

53
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:13,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like doing research.

54
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:14,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I like learning things.

55
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:20,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to use a word that's often reviled, but I am an intellectual at heart.

56
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a poet, romantic, and an intellectual.

57
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who I am.

58
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to know about things, think about things, ponder the meaning of things, and stuff.

59
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:32,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So I liked looking up more information about, say, Juneteenth.

60
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:36,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I already knew something about it.

61
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:37,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really interesting to go into detail.

62
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:49,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for me it means that I get to be the voice of a community as well as my own voice, which is an interesting thing for a poet whose basic

63
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:51,394
[SPEAKER_05]: tendencies to be introverted.

64
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was fascinating.

65
00:04:54,275 --> 00:05:08,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also loved learning about Haitian flag, how it came to be in Haitian celebrations and Haitian history, which again, I knew just the barest minimum because they don't really teach us this stuff in school.

66
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:17,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So I knew a little bit because I followed a little bit of the, you know, the regime of the dictatorship that was there and so on, but I didn't know all the details.

67
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:18,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was interesting to

68
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:22,406
[SPEAKER_05]: look up the liberation of Haiti and how that happened.

69
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just by the by.

70
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:35,380
[SPEAKER_05]: As a poet, to know these things and to convey these things without being pedantic, without being too overly lectury, and at the same time bring the

71
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:46,809
[SPEAKER_05]: the passion and the voice of the people whom one is representing and to do it honestly and with one's own voice, that was the challenge for me and I really enjoyed doing it.

72
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:53,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think a poet laureate needs to understand that they represent the community, not just themselves.

73
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:57,096
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a layer upon layer upon layer of things that we need to be.

74
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:00,519
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's how I conceive it to be.

75
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing I want to do, which I have not had much occasion or chance to do as much, but I'm planning to do this coming year.

76
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:12,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And frankly, as an aside, I think that the Poet Laureateship should be three years, not two.

77
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in two years, the first year, you're still figuring it out.

78
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:17,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You've never been a Poet Laureate.

79
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:18,593
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to figure out what to do.

80
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,815
[SPEAKER_05]: The second year, you probably get to see legs, so to speak.

81
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:24,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And the third year, you sail a bit.

82
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't realize I was making a metaphor.

83
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:33,927
[SPEAKER_05]: So I plan to collaborate.

84
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been sort of talking with Gary Roberts of the Medford Arts Collaborative.

85
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:45,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to talk some more with them about holding and hosting an open mic for poetry in Medford.

86
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:49,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, seeing if I can use it

87
00:06:49,802 --> 00:07:02,714
[SPEAKER_05]: to bring about some more awareness of things like climate change issues and environmental issues by talking to mothers out front who are in Medford and seeing if they can, you know, do something alongside with that.

88
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:07,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to broaden the scope of what it means to be a poet.

89
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,101
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like how Bob Dylan wrote his songs, you know.

90
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:13,865
[SPEAKER_05]: His songs were not just personal, they were about the world.

91
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:14,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think

92
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:22,796
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimately the weight falls on the shoulders of whomever is representing the community in the arts.

93
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:32,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So poetry or music or painting, we have a responsibility to our society, I think, which I didn't realize when I was younger.

94
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:34,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that too long an answer?

95
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,525
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think this is great.

96
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:38,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me a lot of follow-up questions as well.

97
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:44,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also held a poetry club at the Medford Public Library.

98
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:48,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I started it in the spring of this year, and I'll be continuing it in the fall.

99
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:53,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to open it up to more people, but most people don't seem to find Fridays conducive.

100
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:54,891
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when I held it.

101
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:58,632
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I work during the week, so Fridays are the day when I can hold it.

102
00:07:58,692 --> 00:07:59,972
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope more people come.

103
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:03,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tell me a little bit more about the poetry club.

104
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:09,587
[SPEAKER_05]: The Poetry Club is a space where we write for an hour or two at the Medford Public Library on Fridays.

105
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:13,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally, I had it separated for teens and for grown-ups.

106
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:21,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the fall, I'm hoping that I can meld the two, teens and grown-ups, hold it for two hours instead of one hour each.

107
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:26,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And the teens never showed up because it was school time for them, I guess, and they had to go home at three.

108
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,863
[SPEAKER_05]: But the grown-ups, there were occasionally four, occasionally five.

109
00:08:30,883 --> 00:08:34,284
[SPEAKER_05]: There are others who are interested, but the timing didn't work for them.

110
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping for more people.

111
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:39,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it required that you have any poetry experience?

112
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:40,668
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

113
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:54,935
[SPEAKER_05]: What I do is a little explication of what some forms of poetry are, what some of the formal aspects of writing are, and then say, give a prompt and then say to them, you can use this prompt or you can write about anything else.

114
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, you know, I found that if you give someone something to write about, they can choose to ignore it.

115
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:05,310
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you say write about anything, they don't know what to write about.

116
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,134
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of structure and then do what you want.

117
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:16,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way they can, you know, refuse to do it and then be their own, you know, voice or whatever.

118
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:16,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that.

119
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,020
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I would like if I were in a workshop.

120
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So I try to do for others what I would like have done for me.

121
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:31,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, and yeah, I like that sort of way of bringing your knowledge and art to the community in that way.

122
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:35,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I, there's like two things I'm thinking about from what you shared.

123
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:36,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And one is like,

124
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:42,872
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like there's like a bit of a reciprocal relationship with your role here.

125
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:57,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's something that you're bringing to our city and we get to hear your work at these public events and the city is kind of like sponsoring your role here, which I think is, it sounds really impactful and it sounds like a way of kind of using art to

126
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:13,464
[SPEAKER_02]: bring in like more of a like a change space or like kind of some of your ideas and maybe kind of like political thought a little bit, which I guess I, I don't know that I'd ever thought about poetry.

127
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,786
[SPEAKER_02]: being used in like the city in that way.

128
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:19,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also sounds like you're taking something away.

129
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:23,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, like you said, the research that you're doing for some of these events that you're writing for.

130
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:34,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I wonder like what your hopes are, both for how the city will use that what we can sort of how we can improve or what we can learn from you.

131
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:39,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also maybe that, like the personal growth, kind of what you hope for yourself in this role.

132
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:41,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

133
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:51,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a two part question what can the city, what can you rephrase the, you know, like what do you hope the city takes from like your role.

134
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:59,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hope that the city learns to appreciate the role of the poet as being.

135
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,667
[SPEAKER_05]: essential to the voice of a community, to the soul of a community.

136
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:13,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Because poets and artists, just poets, all artists, in some ways we're the canary in the coal mine, so to speak.

137
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,251
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the more dire way of looking at it.

138
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,432
[SPEAKER_05]: But we hold, as James Baldwin said, we hold the mirror up to society.

139
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:29,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And the role of the artist is the role of a lover holding the mirror up to the beloved and saying, you know, I see you for all that you are, the good and the bad.

140
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our history and this is maybe where we should be headed.

141
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:43,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can reduce some of the bad and hope to increase the good by having a more inclusive, loving, caring,

142
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:53,108
[SPEAKER_05]: global, a local slash global as a perspective on our role as humans in this society.

143
00:11:53,528 --> 00:12:00,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know, I take walks with my dog and I look around and I'm always thinking, I don't know who lives in these houses.

144
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:01,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder what

145
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:17,544
[SPEAKER_05]: what the stories and why don't they come out for these events and why do how can we make them feel more connected and how come people aren't connected with the simple answers that most people are too busy, I mean I wasn't connected with before this I was too busy we're always working.

146
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:26,767
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to make a living and we're dealing with family, I mean that is a given we can't avoid that because that's a first rule of his duty is to a family.

147
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:48,635
[SPEAKER_05]: and first to ourselves, to our family, to our neighborhood, to our city or town, to the country, to the world, and it's the circles of, you know, I forget what, there's a lovely term that, there's a Facing History in Ourselves organization in Brookline used, circles of something, of dependence, circles of interdependence, something.

148
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:53,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, you know, from ourselves to our family, to our local area, to the city,

149
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:55,577
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

150
00:12:55,637 --> 00:13:01,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if we can feel that way, I hope that poetry can help us feel that way.

151
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:15,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds rather lofty and it sounds very ambitious, but you know, I've always found that I've been lifted out of myself by poetry and poetry that speaks to the universal as well as the personal and the individual.

152
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:18,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like people to feel like they can do that.

153
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:20,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone needs to be a great poet.

154
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:27,205
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we need to feel is the sense of release from our own muteness.

155
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:29,226
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel mute in the face of the world.

156
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,226
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel unheard.

157
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,307
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel un...

158
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:55,030
[SPEAKER_05]: unsupported and if we speak those words first thing they're out of ourselves and they're out in the air and next someone else will hear them and maybe if we speak them with eloquence and with some passion and some some beauty and not just bluntness and boring words maybe we can affect some change affect some change in the world yeah

159
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's the more, that's what I hope for, for the community.

160
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:09,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And for myself, I think it's just, it's been a challenge to be a poet writing for occasions.

161
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:10,897
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my big takeaway.

162
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never done that.

163
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:19,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always waited for inspiration or I write as an exercise.

164
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm using this as both.

165
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been lovely.

166
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really

167
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:39,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I like figuring out how to shape my thoughts to the occasion, without lies, without obfuscation, with my own poetic visual

168
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,485
[SPEAKER_05]: imagery that I like to use.

169
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:43,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an imagistic writer.

170
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:46,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I use a lot of metaphors and similes.

171
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer metaphors to similes.

172
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:51,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And also just symbolism and so on.

173
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:59,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all poems need to be symbolic, but frequently they end up, even inadvertently, without one planning it, they become symbolic.

174
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the simplest poems are the most direct ones.

175
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are also lovely.

176
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:09,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a place for everyone in everything.

177
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:18,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to become a better poet through this, if one can use the word better.

178
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:26,940
[SPEAKER_05]: More facile, more willing to try new things, less resistant to being told what to do.

179
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:31,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I'm resistant, but it's not my nature.

180
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:34,526
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've learned how to do it and I'm enjoying it greatly.

181
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:36,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I love challenges, so this is great.

182
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:43,918
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem challenging to have like a to have that kind of like pressure to write something for a particular event.

183
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds stressful for me to think about.

184
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I was like on for Juneteenth I was.

185
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,911
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole week, I had not written a thing.

186
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:56,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought, oh, God, I am going to fail.

187
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:57,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot have this happen.

188
00:15:58,272 --> 00:16:01,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thrive on last minute tension.

189
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:02,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's my nature.

190
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:03,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always done it.

191
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:05,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a very bad aspect of me.

192
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:06,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not proud of it.

193
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:08,376
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's who I am.

194
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:09,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like pressure.

195
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:11,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was too much.

196
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:13,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought, I'm getting too anxious.

197
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:13,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like this.

198
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:15,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have done it earlier.

199
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,139
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I thinking?

200
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:17,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So I stayed up in the night.

201
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:25,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought, I need to find a hook on which to hang this picture of this poem that I'm trying to write metaphor.

202
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was the hook?

203
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:31,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up looking up quilts that were woven by black

204
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:47,127
[SPEAKER_05]: enslaved folk in the South into which they wove messages to tell each other when Moses or Harriet Tubman was going to come and help them escape from the plantations and head towards Canada.

205
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:49,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So they wove messages into the images.

206
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,828
[SPEAKER_05]: They were not allowed to read and write.

207
00:16:53,068 --> 00:17:07,978
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had to use images, pictures, so they would use wagon wheels and various things, it's just fascinating, rosary and all kinds of things into their quilts and then they use these to tell each other, send messages to each other.

208
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:09,519
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I look that up,

209
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, okay, I found my symbol, I found my metaphor.

210
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:21,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So I used a symbol from each of the quilts as a hook for each of my stanzas.

211
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:27,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And I talked about how, I can't explain it here, but I talked about how

212
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:42,038
[SPEAKER_05]: without using words like enslaved and slavery, how people sent messages to each other, and then came a time of bloodshed, and then came liberation, and Texas, and the proclamation, and then Juneteenth.

213
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:47,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I managed to weave it by using, for each stanza, one of the symbols of the quilt.

214
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:55,428
[SPEAKER_05]: as a sort of subheading and that was, it saved me and I was rather proud of the poem.

215
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wasn't, I was like, it wasn't a piece of rubbish.

216
00:17:58,752 --> 00:17:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really happy with it.

217
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:14,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounds too kind of like reflecting our conversation right now of how like, you know, those enslaved people were using a form of art to sort of help, you know, yeah, help express themselves, help communicate to each other, which sounds like what you were doing right now.

218
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:15,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

219
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:15,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

220
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:19,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you've you've given me something more to think about, right?

221
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:21,955
[SPEAKER_05]: The role of poet is to do that, I guess.

222
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:23,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

223
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:28,039
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm always interested, too, to like hear

224
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:37,533
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe like, I think everyone because Medford is becoming like an increasingly diverse place, I think we always have more we can do there.

225
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:46,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But like what people kind of feel like they bring to the table in terms of, you know, what's you know, what do you feel like is unique about your voice?

226
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:50,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what are you kind of proud to bring to this role as the poet laureate?

227
00:18:51,540 --> 00:19:03,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I love writing lyrically and imagistically and so that's my particular thing and I think I do a lot of it and I shouldn't sound boastful but I do it very well.

228
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:11,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I know because I'm my own worst critic so when I don't do it well I know it's horrible and I shelve it and you know so I work

229
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:16,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I work at it, but it comes easily, if you know what I mean.

230
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:19,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's because of years of writing, of years of reading.

231
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:23,727
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were a raw poet of 18, it would be different.

232
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I know my early poems are very raw.

233
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:31,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I look back on them and I smile, but there's something sweet about young people's poetry too.

234
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:38,835
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's nice when one becomes older and more seasoned, it has its own beauty.

235
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:41,977
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I like, I'm proud of,

236
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:54,883
[SPEAKER_05]: my particular slant on things for example for Juneteenth I had to take care not to write because you know I'm I'm not black but I know about oppression so I try to use that

237
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,235
[SPEAKER_05]: empathetic lens through which to write about something.

238
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:15,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I will never be able to say what it means to be black in this community and growing up with the weight of history and growing up with the sorrows and the heartbreaks and the anger and the, you know, all of the complicated feelings of being a black American.

239
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:17,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've read a lot.

240
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I've read a lot of black American literature.

241
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:22,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I teach black women in literature as well in my college.

242
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:30,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I know literature is the way for me to completely feel what someone else is feeling.

243
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,632
[SPEAKER_05]: to do that with my own poetry and I feel like I do convey that when I write.

244
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:44,296
[SPEAKER_05]: People have come up to me after these readings, black folk and white folk, they've come up to me and they told me specific things about what they like, which really touched me.

245
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:50,540
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought, wow, okay, so I did do this, you know, it wasn't just me spouting words.

246
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know I don't do that, but it was nice to be able to have it resonate with people.

247
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say it as a preface that I'm not trying to

248
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:02,265
[SPEAKER_05]: usurp anything.

249
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:05,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to be something I'm not.

250
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:11,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling this from my stance as an Indian American poet.

251
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:17,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if one is honest, others can hear it.

252
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

253
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sort of a long-winded answer to your question.

254
00:21:21,173 --> 00:21:25,215
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I hope to communicate as a poet?

255
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:30,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, you know, I think you answered it well, but sort of what's sort of your unique perspective here?

256
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:34,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that sort of, I think that it's not the perspective of a black American.

257
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:52,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also not this perspective of like maybe somebody who grew up in the sort of particular sort of racism we experience, you know, black people experience here, but having your own perspective from your life experience and then what it's like to observe that here and experience that here is.

258
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:55,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really unique and important.

259
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:56,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

260
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:07,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Likewise, you know, when I had to write for Pride, I'm pretty heterosexual, but my first hero was Oscar Wilde.

261
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:11,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know what gay meant.

262
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:19,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I was 10 years old, I read the complete works of Oscar Wilde and I wept over his story and I thought what they did to him was wrong.

263
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:22,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know what the word homosexual was.

264
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:27,213
[SPEAKER_05]: All I know is he had every right to love the man he loved and they shouldn't have put him in jail for it.

265
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was so angry when I read about it and I was 10, I couldn't talk about it with anybody.

266
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:36,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I just knew that he was a wonderful writer and no one should have done to him what they did.

267
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:44,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'd always understood at some level what it feels to be other, even when I was in my own country.

268
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:49,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And so while I am heterosexual, I think I'm very bi-romantic.

269
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:52,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got it.

270
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:53,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I understood.

271
00:22:54,527 --> 00:23:00,769
[SPEAKER_05]: what he must have felt and what others, various other writers whom I always ended up reading and they turned out to be gay writers.

272
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:01,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, what the heck?

273
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:10,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so I said, mom, other people, you know, I'd read all these people and I thought, okay, so I do have some kind of resonance with this.

274
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:17,813
[SPEAKER_05]: And so even though I didn't, I couldn't write as someone who was a gay person about pride, I could write about

275
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:22,394
[SPEAKER_05]: to use an often used, too worn out term, an ally.

276
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:26,195
[SPEAKER_05]: It's used a lot, but one needs allies.

277
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:28,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I wrote as an ally.

278
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:34,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I have people around me who are gay or bi or trans.

279
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:39,099
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole slew of young people that I know who are my students.

280
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:46,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's in the, I think the air has been cleared for a lot of people to be that way.

281
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:50,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it was there for a long time, but now they can, they're not afraid, and I'm really happy about that.

282
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I use all of these perspectives to think about what it means to write for Pride Flag Day.

283
00:23:56,652 --> 00:24:03,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And so again, using empathy and, I don't know, literature to help me.

284
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:12,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say empathy was like the word that kept coming up for me when you were describing that and sort of your process and researching and learning about these events.

285
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:27,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I think allyship, right, it can be kind of like a meaningless term, but when you're when it's backed up with empathy, right, when you're really trying to understand the experience of someone and, you know, understand their emotional experience, their experience in the world, like that feels really powerful, right?

286
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

287
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:34,440
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband and I are so happy about what's going on right now.

288
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:38,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Young people being unafraid to declare what they are.

289
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:39,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, what a relief.

290
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:46,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he grew up here, he went to Lincoln Mass and he said the number of unhappy people he knew and many of them were probably hiding

291
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:49,155
[SPEAKER_05]: who they really were.

292
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:50,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was hard for them.

293
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:55,681
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew just one person who came out as trans and gay and all of that.

294
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:59,404
[SPEAKER_05]: But that person had a lot of grief given to him.

295
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:01,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

296
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:01,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

297
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:08,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like what I've learned about Medford, mostly through doing this podcast is like how

298
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:23,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford, I think, does a really good job of using art and all different forms and mediums to support people's self-expression and to offer opportunities for communication and engagement with the city and throughout the city.

299
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something I ever would have expected.

300
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:29,517
[SPEAKER_05]: The Pride Flag Day was lovely.

301
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:31,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish more people came.

302
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,640
[SPEAKER_05]: It was already quite crowded, but I wish more people had come.

303
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think maybe we need more

304
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:41,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we have to do a sort of leaflet campaign to put it on people's doorsteps.

305
00:25:41,995 --> 00:25:42,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Come for this.

306
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:43,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Come for that.

307
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:44,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out your city.

308
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:46,099
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good city.

309
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't feel alone.

310
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,580
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here.

311
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:53,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Medford does have a lot of great community spaces and community events like that.

312
00:25:53,847 --> 00:26:03,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think my often the critique that I hear is like, there's not a great way of communicating about all of these things in a way that everybody is going to get right.

313
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:08,513
[SPEAKER_02]: We use social media, there's like the website, there's these different things that aren't always accessible to everyone.

314
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:10,554
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think we're coming a long way.

315
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:11,714
[SPEAKER_05]: We're coming along.

316
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:13,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need a leaflet campaign.

317
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:17,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it sounds old-fashioned, but no one's going to look at something.

318
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:20,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I barely look at stuff that keeps on showing up on my feed.

319
00:26:20,898 --> 00:26:22,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Too much.

320
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:25,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an overload of information sometimes.

321
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can understand if people don't see that.

322
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:34,204
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe if you pin something on someone's doorstep, send young people out to each street and say, OK, come for this.

323
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:35,004
[SPEAKER_05]: This is cool.

324
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:36,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be food.

325
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:36,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

326
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:41,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the young people actually I think are mostly responsible for the beginning of that pride.

327
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:45,272
[SPEAKER_02]: The GSA at the high school has had a lot of impact on the city.

328
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:47,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's great.

329
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:52,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm wondering if there's anything else that you were hoping to talk with us about today before we wrap up?

330
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a musician, but that has nothing to do with this, I guess, or something.

331
00:26:59,662 --> 00:27:00,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I use music as well.

332
00:27:02,263 --> 00:27:07,845
[SPEAKER_05]: For Juneteenth, I sang a song by Rhiannon Giddens, and I read my poem.

333
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:14,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to combine song and poetry, because I think people remember songs really well.

334
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:19,290
[SPEAKER_05]: They stay in another part of our brain, so I like to bring that into my music.

335
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, nothing more.

336
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:33,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want people to feel unafraid to express themselves, to read more, to not feel like, oh, you know, I see the look on some people's faces.

337
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:35,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've taught for many years.

338
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:41,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I taught in public school in Winchester, and I teach at Bunker Hill Community College as a full-time English professor there.

339
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:47,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had five different preps, black women in literature, immigrant experience in literature.

340
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:52,580
[SPEAKER_05]: College Writing II, American Culture, and Introduction to Poetry, five different preps.

341
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:02,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know when students come in, both in my school and college experience, when they come in and there's a curtain behind their eyes or in front of their eyes, I can see that curtain.

342
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:06,487
[SPEAKER_05]: The curtain has fallen and it says, I'm not going to be able to learn a thing.

343
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:11,710
[SPEAKER_05]: And then through the semester, I see the curtain rising and I see something behind.

344
00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:14,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish people wouldn't put the curtain down.

345
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:20,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish that they would not think of themselves as not intelligent or too stupid to get it.

346
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:23,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had the look, I've seen the look on people's faces.

347
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,836
[SPEAKER_05]: When they think they're stupid, I know that look.

348
00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:27,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it too often.

349
00:28:27,817 --> 00:28:28,637
[SPEAKER_05]: And it hurts me.

350
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:31,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want them to not think that.

351
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I want them to feel proud of what they can be.

352
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:39,662
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe they weren't there before, but maybe they can be now.

353
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think intelligence is a fluid thing.

354
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:45,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a fixed thing in space or time.

355
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:47,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And so intelligence changes.

356
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:52,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think poetry is an entryway into that.

357
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:57,770
[SPEAKER_05]: into expression, into language, into understanding, into perspective.

358
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I think poetry really helps.

359
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:03,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounds like it gives different ways of measuring intelligence, right?

360
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.

361
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:07,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any poetry that you want to share with us today?

362
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:16,499
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

363
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:17,900
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

364
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,802
[SPEAKER_05]: This is called Pasting, and this is a non-rhyming poem.

365
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:25,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything passes, even this feeling.

366
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:28,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything passes, and I mourn it all.

367
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,147
[SPEAKER_05]: In the impermanence there is imminence.

368
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:37,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they pass, all things, all loves, all lives, I mourn them all, and the godhead in them.

369
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:42,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I mourn backwards through time, all the things I remember and all I didn't.

370
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: The whistle lollipops on which I, a child, would suck with a relish I cannot recapture.

371
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,723
[SPEAKER_05]: The enormous trees up which I shinied, agile as a monkey,

372
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:54,565
[SPEAKER_05]: or an imp in childhood.

373
00:29:55,166 --> 00:30:08,922
[SPEAKER_05]: The green tamarinds I ate, sour and succulent, hanging off branches in Poona's woods, so mysterious, so alluring to a child who never wanted to read or write, just play and live and make believe all day long.

374
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:23,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I mourn backwards through time, the passing of my school days that I valued my life so little that I cannot remember much of it, only the sensory world in which I swam, and those things I do remember fill me with a spiky regret.

375
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:38,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharp winter air in Pune when I was seven, the slipping of sunlight and rain over polished mango leaves, the songs on All India Radio, the world of books into which I was plunged after my first reluctance and rejection of them,

376
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:47,698
[SPEAKER_05]: my mother's fragrant foods which were a fact of life, like love or joy or goats on the street or birdsong or jasmine flowers at my window.

377
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:57,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I mourned backwards through time, but these days I also mourn these, the stores that closed down, billboards which would stare down at me while I paid them no heed,

378
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:01,028
[SPEAKER_05]: now gone, given way to unbearable gloss.

379
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:07,889
[SPEAKER_05]: The decor and banks I used to visit, now so clinical and perfect, like mannequins with no skin pores.

380
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:15,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I mourn lost bookstores in Arlington, or Harvard Square, or Porter Square, or Davis Square, or Medford Square.

381
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:20,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I mourn the missing street performers, jugglers and puppeteers, storytellers and singers.

382
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:22,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all gone now.

383
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:34,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I mourn the minutes, hours, days, years of my life, the lives of those I love, the lives of those whom I have not yet met, the lives of all the creatures vanishing before I shall ever meet them.

384
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:48,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything passes through me and through you, and somewhere we'll meet, you and I, you with your memories, I with mine, and we will let them flow through us and beyond until all fades away.

385
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,723
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

386
00:31:54,284 --> 00:31:55,225
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

387
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:59,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me a little bit about what inspired that poem?

388
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:02,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I don't know, I have great nostalgia.

389
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember everything.

390
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:10,695
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't remember, you know, if you ask me specifics of someone's face or clothes, I might not remember.

391
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:17,320
[SPEAKER_05]: But I remember the feeling I got from things and the sensory details.

392
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:20,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty evocative, that poem.

393
00:32:20,086 --> 00:32:20,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed it.

394
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:22,888
[SPEAKER_02]: You felt it too?

395
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:23,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

396
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:29,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think the concept of mourning is close to me right now, but it's, yeah, it was beautiful.

397
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

398
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry.

399
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:32,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's okay.

400
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:39,031
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, this one's called My Body.

401
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:41,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll go to topical poems.

402
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:43,976
[SPEAKER_05]: A body is a curious thing to possess.

403
00:32:44,556 --> 00:33:01,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I am conscious of mine as a friend with her own blind needs, her own mute sorrows, her loud joys, her love of some fragrances and loathing of certain smells, her ears that welcome all music, her eyes that see beyond facades but forget to see the facade itself.

404
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:05,115
[SPEAKER_05]: She is the entity who shares my other consciousness.

405
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:09,739
[SPEAKER_05]: When she is out of sorts, when I am sanguine, we confuse each other.

406
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,921
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes it's the other way around.

407
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:14,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly we keep peace between us.

408
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:18,726
[SPEAKER_05]: She keeps track of time, so that even when I'm not near a clock, she lets me know.

409
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:23,751
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm hurt, she forces me to shut down my other self and attend to her.

410
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,432
[SPEAKER_05]: This is as it should be.

411
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:30,837
[SPEAKER_05]: She has given me space to live within her and I love her and thank her for giving me room.

412
00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:35,561
[SPEAKER_05]: She is a map of my journeys and the road on which the journeys took place.

413
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:39,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And her imperfections, so many, fill me with quiet affection.

414
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:52,088
[SPEAKER_05]: She has shed her skin so many times and donned new ones, and her hands, all veined, have held this earth and other hands with love and trust, ready to give, even when she lost sometimes.

415
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:56,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, she has failed me at times, but then I failed her even more.

416
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:58,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly, we are at peace.

417
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I shall miss her when she dies.

418
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not think she'll remember to miss me at the time of her passing.

419
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:07,492
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

420
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:09,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a poem that I wrote for Haiti.

421
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,009
[SPEAKER_05]: the Haiti flag day.

422
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:24,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked it up and I learned about what their slogan, what they say to their flag, L'Union fait la force, is their motto.

423
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:28,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And Haiti is called Haiti, so it's called the Rappo Haiti flag of Haiti.

424
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:37,414
[SPEAKER_05]: O Haiti, beloved land of Taino and African, land of hills so green and tall, of you I sing a song for all.

425
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:44,775
[SPEAKER_05]: O Haiti, O Haiti, O land of pain and sorrow, and joy and power and rage and blood and hopes for new tomorrows.

426
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:53,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I salute you and embrace your flag that emerged in triumph after war, the upward march to claim your fate, sing l'union fait la force.

427
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:59,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you and salute you for the land you wish to be, embrace you and I honor you and pray for harmony.

428
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:07,102
[SPEAKER_05]: O Haiti, O Haiti, O land of mountain stall, Land of struggle, land of beauty, I sing your rise and fall.

429
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:14,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you and salute you, and I sing the song of you, Of those who fought to take back that which belongs to you.

430
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:19,106
[SPEAKER_05]: In fateful 1791, O Haiti, you raised your head, And in the year 1804, you claimed your land and led.

431
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:29,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you, I salute you, and I sing about your own, Of Toussaint, the all-saintly, who led the way alone.

432
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:35,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you, and I sing about the man who led the way, L'ouverture, the opening, brought in the light of day.

433
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:42,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And Toussaint was betrayed by one who did not keep his word, He died in France and never saw the dream which had occurred.

434
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:50,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Your own flag flew, the white torn out, the red remained with blue, With the palm above the mountain, the year your story grew.

435
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:58,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You hold your head up, buoyed by the hopes of one another, to live, to work, to eat, to dream a land where none are other.

436
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:05,535
[SPEAKER_05]: O Haiti, O Haiti, O land of pain and sorrow, and joy and power and pride and blood and hopes for new tomorrows.

437
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:12,080
[SPEAKER_05]: O may you fly, both high and free, above the land that you adore, leave hurt behind and work for peace.

438
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,962
[SPEAKER_05]: United evermore.

439
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:20,730
[SPEAKER_05]: O Haiti, O Haiti, O land of pain and sorrow, and joy and power and pride and blood and hopes for new tomorrows.

440
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:24,755
[SPEAKER_05]: On this your day, to you I say, may you not be denied.

441
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Your sovereignty, your right to be, may peace be at your side.

442
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:32,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear the research in there.

443
00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:38,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, those are beautiful.

444
00:36:38,202 --> 00:36:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish we'd started with the poetry.

445
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:43,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing.

446
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:45,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else that you want people to know?

447
00:36:52,387 --> 00:37:08,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my husband is a climate activist and he stands at the corner of Roseville Circle on the exit from 93 South and he holds signs every day, every morning at 7 o'clock.

448
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:09,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen him there.

449
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was your husband.

450
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:12,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Warren.

451
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:20,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says he puts up with a lot of abused people giving him thumbs down and other people giving him thumbs up, of course.

452
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:23,546
[SPEAKER_05]: But people tell him, get a job.

453
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:25,107
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know he's working all the time.

454
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:35,055
[SPEAKER_05]: This is his way of being an activist, calming his mind about the anxiety about the future and doing his part to bear witness for what's going on.

455
00:37:35,715 --> 00:37:36,976
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he comes home and he works.

456
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:38,377
[SPEAKER_05]: He works, works, works, works, works.

457
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they don't know that.

458
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:43,702
[SPEAKER_05]: So all they know is that they must think he's some kind of homeless guy or something.

459
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:44,883
[SPEAKER_05]: He laughs at the thought.

460
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:46,484
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my husband.

461
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:49,987
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a musician and a scholar and an Indian classical vocalist.

462
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:55,171
[SPEAKER_05]: He grew up in America as a white American, but he's very well versed in Indian culture.

463
00:37:56,232 --> 00:38:11,461
[SPEAKER_05]: and my daughter is at UMass Amherst and she's a musician and she is an activist in her way as well and so we're pretty happy we have a dog and that's me that's my family and I haven't I've tried not to lose track of my own culture

464
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,922
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of things about my own background I deplore.

465
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:17,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care for Hindu... I shouldn't say that.

466
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:22,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care for Hindu casteism and Hindu nationalism.

467
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:31,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me really upset at what's going on right now because India was a very pluralistic society and that's what made us great.

468
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:36,186
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Hindu, Muslim, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists.

469
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:39,547
[SPEAKER_05]: We have them still, but many of them are feeling under attack now.

470
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:41,067
[SPEAKER_05]: That really hurts me.

471
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:51,415
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all the earlier movies in Indian Bollywood, they were all about, you know, Hindu-Muslim-Christian unity.

472
00:38:51,435 --> 00:38:53,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, many of the early movies were like that.

473
00:38:53,517 --> 00:38:57,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we have all these ultra-nationalist things going on, and that scares me.

474
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:04,987
[SPEAKER_05]: The world is tilting towards nationalism everywhere, and it forgets that to be human is to love the world.

475
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:10,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And people always cite the Bible, but they don't ever cite the Beatitudes.

476
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:15,735
[SPEAKER_05]: They always go to Moses and the commandments, but they forget what Jesus said.

477
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:19,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this stuff, I mean, in America, that bothers me.

478
00:39:19,077 --> 00:39:21,299
[SPEAKER_05]: In India, the Hindu stuff bothers me.

479
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:25,261
[SPEAKER_05]: In various countries, all the different religious factions trouble me.

480
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:31,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish people would just rise above and see humanity and just stop this nonsense.

481
00:39:31,946 --> 00:39:33,367
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we need a profit.

482
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,289
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a profit for peace and we don't have one.

483
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:37,910
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my other thought.

484
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:47,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think that's a also like very relevant and in sort of all of our environments, like even like the sort of micro environment of Medford, you know, you see the exact same thing.

485
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:50,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like what you said earlier about sort of holding the mirror up.

486
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:54,481
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot to appreciate about our community.

487
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:56,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot to be

488
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:57,623
[SPEAKER_02]: critical of, right?

489
00:39:57,683 --> 00:40:05,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And like to think about, I think like the term being a critical lover of Medford is something I think about is like, you can love this place and you can also help to improve it all the time.

490
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:08,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like that's what you're working hard to do.

491
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:09,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Danielle.

492
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:10,488
[SPEAKER_05]: That was lovely.

493
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:12,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

494
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:17,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, hopefully we can, like, you know, hear more of your work at some events.

495
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:19,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was lovely to talk to you.

496
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:20,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

497
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there, could I read one more poem that's not topical?

498
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:24,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

499
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:25,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have time?

500
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:35,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this one is, this is just a cute, this is about wanting to sing with a voice like Ruby's.

501
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:38,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, where's that?

502
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I should know my poetry book by heart, but I don't.

503
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:44,298
[SPEAKER_05]: A ruby song.

504
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:47,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I crave rubies in my throat so I can sing like a clarinet.

505
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:50,322
[SPEAKER_05]: The pomegranate in my fridge is tired.

506
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:53,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I regard it with fondness, my partner in enervation.

507
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Its redness is beyond the price of rubies.

508
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:01,271
[SPEAKER_05]: It calls to me coldly like a clarion, a question shaping its urgent need.

509
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:09,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhere else a beat sings of redness too, Far beyond my ken, I'm sure of it, But it sings a darker red, a sombre passion.

510
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:11,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I will seek it at some other point.

511
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:25,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I have need of clarity, coldness, red fire, And this other pressing matter at hand, My pomegranate, which has but one purpose, Since its other purpose was abrupted When it was cut down from the mother tree.

512
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:28,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I will answer its call, but not now.

513
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:34,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow I shall cut into it, inhale its weary fragrance, suck its tart juices.

514
00:41:34,843 --> 00:41:40,952
[SPEAKER_05]: The pomegranate will bleed in delight and die on my tongue, and I will sing with a voice like Ruby's.

515
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:43,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted something light.

516
00:41:43,054 --> 00:41:44,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

517
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:45,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it.

518
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:46,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

519
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:47,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Daniel.

520
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope to meet you in person.

521
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:50,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a pleasure to talk to you.

522
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:51,637
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

523
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And to see you here.

524
00:41:52,938 --> 00:42:00,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love your responses and your comments on what I said and your insights into some of the things I said.

525
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,302
[SPEAKER_05]: They made me think as well.

526
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:02,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

527
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:03,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.
