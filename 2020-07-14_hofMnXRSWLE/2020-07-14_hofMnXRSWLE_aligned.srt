1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,879
What is the biggest point that differentiates you, Ms.

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,522
Callahan, from your opponent?

3
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:10,004
Sure.

4
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:12,506
I think I probably already said it, but I'll say it again.

5
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:19,592
I think right now, the Massachusetts Democratic Party platform is very progressive.

6
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:24,495
It is essentially the Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren platform.

7
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,517
It is very popular in the district.

8
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:35,444
We have a veto proof super majority of Democrats in the House and Senate and we cannot pass.

9
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:50,523
Medicare for all we cannot pass real climate change legislation, we can't we can't pass any of the things that are in that document, and it's because there is a concentration of power in the hands of the speaker.

10
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:54,248
And that is the big difference between.

11
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:55,418
the two of us.

12
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,560
Representative Barber voted to end term limits for the speaker.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,441
I would vote to have term limits.

14
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:09,943
She voted to increase the pay for the speaker and the pay for all of the committee chairs and co-chairs that the speaker alone chooses.

15
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:12,524
I think that the speaker should not be choosing those.

16
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:17,226
I think they should be chosen by a secret vote for the entire house.

17
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:22,928
She voted against transparency, like making committee votes public.

18
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:29,953
making committee votes that are public putting them on the website, all of that stuff we need transparency everywhere.

19
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:42,423
In fact, we actually need for our legislature to no longer be exempt from public records law, we are one of only two states in the country where all three branches of government are exempt from public records law, and that is ridiculous.

20
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:53,071
The lack of transparency, the lack of time for legislators to look at bills, means that we can't organize as activists around those bills either.

21
00:01:53,571 --> 00:02:07,701
And this whole situation, the culture, the rules, the financial incentives, prevents us from passing progressive policies, prevents us from passing the Massachusetts Democratic Party platform, and I will work very hard to end that.
