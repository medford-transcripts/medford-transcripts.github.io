1
00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:06,632
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I believe Councilor Callaghan will be on with us in just a couple of minutes when she's able to get online.

2
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:10,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Since we have a quorum present, I'm going to call the meeting to order.

3
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:15,275
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee, May 22nd, 2024.

4
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,756
[SPEAKER_10]: This meeting will take place at 6pm via Zoom only.

00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Kirk, please call the roll.

7
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:32,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clark, I can't hear you.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I can.

9
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:41,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

10
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:42,584
[SPEAKER_03]: President Collins.

11
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:43,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

12
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Leming.

13
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:49,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,351
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears.

15
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:53,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

16
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:55,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan.

17
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:09,805
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, for president, I do not see I do not see counts account online.

18
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, I believe that she'll be joining online just a few minutes late.

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,012
[SPEAKER_10]: For present one absent, the meeting is called to order.

20
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:25,840
[SPEAKER_10]: The action and discussion item for tonight is again paper 24033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:38,750
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been meeting with the Innes Associates team together with other key stakeholders and supporters in the zoning overhaul process very frequently in this committee over the past few months.

22
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:43,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Our last meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee was also on this topic.

23
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:51,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just briefly recap what we talked about in that meeting, talk about our specific goals for this meeting, which we talked about on the 8th.

24
00:01:53,418 --> 00:02:03,966
[SPEAKER_10]: We have some items to report out and then hopefully at the end of the meeting, we can briefly tee up what else we plan to do in June to accomplish with this team by the end of the fiscal year.

25
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:14,194
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping that we can, since we had such a robust discussion on May 8th, I'm hoping that we can get everybody out of here by pretty close to 7, if not before 7.30.

26
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:17,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there is another committee

27
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:22,551
[SPEAKER_10]: meeting after this one tonight.

28
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:33,099
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 8th, we had a long and robust discussion about some of the definitions in the current code of ordinances that are to be updated.

29
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:53,009
[SPEAKER_10]: And that informs that kind of piggybacks and other conversations that we've had with this team about necessary updates to the table of uses and to site plan review, changes to the zoning ordinances that will make administrative work on the city side more streamlined before we get into the work of substantively changing the zoning.

30
00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:00,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So building off of those conversations tonight, I'm hoping that we can touch on the following topics.

31
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:05,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Going over the general plan for the review of Medford zoning ordinance.

32
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:09,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Reviewing the recommended updates to the definitions and use table.

33
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:14,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Reviewing the site plan review options.

34
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Discussing our plan for reviewing the climate action and adaptation plan.

35
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:36,178
[SPEAKER_10]: and then we'll touch on our plan for the schedule for meetings in June and what zoning update topics we will review when in June and further out.

36
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Just checking my notes to make sure I didn't leave anything off of that list.

37
00:03:44,930 --> 00:04:04,136
[SPEAKER_10]: overall the goal for tonight is to review recommendations for table of uses, definitions and use table, site plan review options, and make sure that we can report those out to local city council so that they can be referred to the CBP so that we can get those changes moving along efficiently by the end of the year.

38
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,017
[SPEAKER_10]: With that I want to, if there's no

39
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:17,129
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's no preliminary comments by my fellow councilors or by city staff, I'm happy to kick it over to Paola to introduce what is on tonight.

40
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Throw in, I think the GIS zoning map as well.

41
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:22,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

42
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't sure we landed on that.

43
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:24,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

44
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:29,258
[SPEAKER_10]: So the other item to review tonight and make sure it gets reported out is the GIS zoning map.

45
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mr. Clerk, I see that Councilor Callahan is present.

46
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,394
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, unless Director Hunt or other city staff have anything to add, Paola, please feel free to go ahead.

47
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, good afternoon.

48
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:50,699
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Paola.

49
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:59,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an urban designer and urban planner at Innes Associates, and I am more than happy to be here with you tonight.

50
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:06,930
[SPEAKER_01]: With me is my colleague, Jimmy Rocha, and the

51
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:18,204
[SPEAKER_01]: another consultant that we're working with, which is the attorney Jonathan Silverstein, which he will be presenting today, the Municipal Site Plan Review.

52
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:30,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having, there is a bit of traffic in the background, so if there is some problems, just let me know that you didn't hear me very well, and so I can repeat.

53
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bother, just interrupt, that's totally fine.

54
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:41,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to share my screen, if somebody can enable my screen sharing.

55
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it might probably cost.

56
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:44,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

57
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:17,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you will see my screen.

58
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:23,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that OK?

59
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:26,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So where we are is May 22.

60
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:38,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this process, the agenda for today, as Vice President Collins said, is to review and vote for the following

61
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:59,691
[SPEAKER_01]: out topics and those will be the updated table of uses, the existing zoning map in digital, the GIS format, discussed definitions to be sent to the city council and then the municipal site plan review and then we will see in the next round at the end to talk about the next topics.

62
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:05,096
[SPEAKER_01]: As we talked in the previous meeting

63
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:22,322
[SPEAKER_01]: We are showing this table of uses where we replace the necessity to go to different tables to check the parking code and loading code and implement it in the same table of uses and parking regulations.

64
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:32,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see them in this table in yellow color with the letters PC for parking code and LC for loading code.

65
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:36,979
[SPEAKER_01]: You also can see in a different color in the uses.

66
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the definitions that we are changing.

67
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:51,765
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very likely that this is only for you to see, but this color out and in the table of uses that we will send, you won't be able to see this.

68
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:55,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sorry.

69
00:07:55,567 --> 00:08:00,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.

70
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:03,245
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the other.

71
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:03,305
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

72
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:10,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I'm going to, is this OK if I do it like this?

73
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:15,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't know why it's not showing.

74
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's fine if that works for you.

75
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:21,259
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sorry.

76
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,402
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go with the definitions in the table of uses.

77
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:26,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this OK?

78
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:29,185
[SPEAKER_01]: We already checked it in the previous one and explained it.

79
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:31,487
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to add anything,

80
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:33,337
[SPEAKER_01]: to hear about it.

81
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:35,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paula.

82
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:40,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just jump in to paraphrase and summarize from our conversation about this on May 8th.

83
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:57,351
[SPEAKER_10]: The recommended change to this table of uses is that we're switching from... Can you just spell it out for folks who might not have been at our previous committee meeting, the flag changes in gold?

84
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:08,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so in gold, we have these parking code and loading code tables that in the current zoning are in separate tables.

85
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we are doing is unifying those.

86
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,013
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one table, you can see it all.

87
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:22,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this gold background, you see the PC that is the parking code, and the LC that is the loading code.

88
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:30,113
[SPEAKER_10]: this is to make sure that the relevant information is all on the same page for when city staff or developers are looking for this information.

89
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:30,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

90
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:36,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any other questions on this slide from councillors or city staff members of the public?

91
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:42,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Director Hunt, go ahead.

92
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:46,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that I realized as we were looking at this

93
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:59,406
[SPEAKER_04]: is that we have written into the text some exceptions to the detached signal or to the around the housing parking codes.

94
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:09,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't seem, I was looking in my tables, basically we need a footnote and the footnote needs to point to the parking codes.

95
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:11,729
[SPEAKER_04]: the exceptions.

96
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And the current ones just refer you to this table.

97
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And the table is back in the middle of the zoning.

98
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:29,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we also need to just add a footnote that I was trying to come up with the net says like affordable housing, right.

99
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So the development of affordable housing units are eligible

100
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:40,414
[SPEAKER_04]: that are eligible for inclusion on the subsidized housing inventory is actually 0.5 per dwelling unit.

101
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:47,617
[SPEAKER_04]: And then housing located within a half mile of high frequency transit is 0.8 per dwelling unit.

102
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:53,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can satisfy that by just putting it as like an asterisk and a footnote on the page.

103
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, this is not a change from anything that's required.

104
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:02,064
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just making it visible on this table.

105
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:10,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And if necessary, it could reference section 613, which is the table of parking requirements.

106
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:15,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now what happens is that the table of use is at the end of the zoning.

107
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:20,397
[SPEAKER_04]: This table that we're referencing is in section 613.

108
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:28,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we would need to, and then these two basically footnotes are over there by 613.

109
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they would need to be somehow represented here.

110
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:37,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that clear?

111
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,546
[SPEAKER_04]: That's perfectly clear.

112
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:39,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

113
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that.

114
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:44,228
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that again, this is a formatting change.

115
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:53,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I just, I wanted to call it out and I think it needs to be on the version that gets sent to the council for referral and voting.

116
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:55,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

117
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

118
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:56,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

119
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,693
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's make sure that, um, a footnote to this effect is incorporated in whatever version is reported out tonight.

120
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:04,675
[SPEAKER_10]: You can make all motions at the end.

121
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:16,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and there's right, there's also one non residential uses with 5000 square feet or less of gross leaseable floor area are exempt from any minimum requirements.

122
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:29,987
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just, I just don't want them to get lost because developers will look at this table and not know that they need to look at the text in the document as well.

123
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:30,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

124
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:32,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

125
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:33,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

126
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:40,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

127
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:46,186
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is no other comment in Table of Uses, then I could start with the definitions.

128
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:48,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

129
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:56,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in the definitions, the document structure is the same as we saw in the last meeting.

130
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,087
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some terms to be defined or clarified.

131
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:11,550
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some suggested definition that will be our proposal that contains the source from which the definition has been taken or that forms the base of the definition.

132
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, in some cases, if it's a term that has to be clarified, we add the current definition.

133
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:23,436
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's the one existing in the Metaverse, something in the ordinance document.

134
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:35,983
[SPEAKER_01]: The standards of use is that sometimes what we want in the definitions is only the definition and not any standard of use that should be

135
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:40,265
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ordinance document, but not on the definition section.

136
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:46,907
[SPEAKER_01]: So, sometimes there are some standards of use, and what we want is to get rid of them in the definition part.

137
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:51,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes it can be that there are some under review.

138
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:59,051
[SPEAKER_01]: In this document, there will be less of those, but it could be that we have some that requires additional research.

139
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:08,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the previous meeting, the planning permitting committee meeting that was held on the 8th of May,

140
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:17,068
[SPEAKER_01]: we had some definitions that were some kind of pre-approved, and I just want to go quickly over those.

141
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:34,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read all of them, and then if somebody has any questions or some extra comment that they didn't before, at the end of all these five definitions, feel completely free to say something, to share anything.

142
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So we established the doggie daycare.

143
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:47,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read them fast, but if you need anything, intervene, let me know.

144
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:54,188
[SPEAKER_01]: So doggie daycare, a facility providing care for dogs on a daily basis without overnight accommodation.

145
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:59,651
[SPEAKER_01]: The facility may include indoor and outdoor areas for the dogs where they will be under supervision.

146
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:03,653
[SPEAKER_01]: For clarity, this definition does not include animal boarding facilities.

147
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:22,063
[SPEAKER_01]: the institutional use, the use of land or structures for the non-profit charitable, benevolent, spiritual, instructional or custodial activities of government, education, religious, healthcare, social service, fraternal, sorority or similar organizations.

148
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:35,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixed-use development, development containing a mix of residential uses and non-residential uses, including without limitation commercial, institutional, industrial or other uses.

149
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:41,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Motor vehicles, class three, class three more vehicle sales.

150
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:49,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Principal business is one, buying used vehicles for purpose of remodeling, taking apart or rebuilding and selling the same.

151
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:55,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Or two, buying or selling parts from used vehicles or tires or the assembling of used vehicle parts.

152
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the ones that we pre-approved in the previous one.

153
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:08,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if you want me to repeat those, if you have any questions or any comments.

154
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:20,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Any comments or questions from counsellors on that first set of definitions?

155
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:29,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Paula, could you just quickly go through the slides again of the definitions that you just showed us?

156
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even just that title slide.

157
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's fine.

158
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:36,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Doggy daycare, institutional use, mixed use, motor vehicles, and accessory use.

159
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:43,698
[SPEAKER_10]: These were among the many that we discussed on the 8th, and I think these were the ones where it was most clear.

160
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:46,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that was the direction to go in.

161
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Not seeing any questions from fellow councillors, let's go along to the next set.

162
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:53,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

163
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:18,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we had some to review and these were maybe when we talked on the meeting on the 8th they were okay but we received some comments from or the building commissioner or our own consultant and so we wanted to clarify and address the changes.

164
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:31,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going, this one I will go one by one because especially this dwelling multiple, it's going to be a bit more discussion.

165
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:34,724
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will stop in after each of the definitions.

166
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this one,

167
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:57,627
[SPEAKER_01]: What we don't want is to, the current definition that we have, it has these standards of use and that will be this classification of class A and class B. And what we wanted to do is to take these two out and only leave the definition.

168
00:17:58,268 --> 00:18:08,954
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that it's very difficult to do that without compromising the table of uses and the table of dimension standards, because it's based on this.

169
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:17,759
[SPEAKER_01]: So, until we don't change the dimension standards, we cannot change or take out from the definition this part.

170
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:39,694
[SPEAKER_01]: There is something very interesting in the definition that it's currently on the zoning and it says that, I'm going to read it, a building or structure designed for or containing three or more dwelling units or a building or structure designed for or contain one or more dwelling units in addition to a non-residential use.

171
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:46,477
[SPEAKER_01]: This part of in addition to a non-residential use, it's kind of interfering with the mixed use definition

172
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:58,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to bring this up to really understand if this is interesting to change.

173
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:16,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we propose is a new definition leaving the class A and class B. And whenever we change the mentioned standards and the different tables to not break the zoning at the moment, we can take out from this new definition the standards.

174
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:31,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So we propose to have the definition as a building with three or more residential dwelling units or two or more buildings on the same lot with more than one residential dwelling unit in each building.

175
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:40,495
[SPEAKER_01]: This term shall include, but is not limited to, triplex, quadruplex and townhouse structures containing three or more dwelling units.

176
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And then leave the class A and class B in the definition.

177
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:54,115
[SPEAKER_01]: There was brought by, if I remember correctly, Commissioner Callaghan,

178
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:23,056
[SPEAKER_01]: that if there was an example of having one building in the same lot, one building with two units and another building with only one unit, and according to this, it's not a multiple dwelling, and it is not because that will be a duplex plus an ADU, an accessory dwelling unit.

179
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:25,977
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also to consider that

180
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:34,673
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 3A, the definition for multiple dwelling is the mass general law, so it's exactly this one.

181
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:45,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it's in the 3A has its own definition, it will be interesting to keep the same one for clarity.

182
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:48,379
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would love to hear your opinion.

183
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:52,621
[SPEAKER_01]: What we can do is also hold it and address everything later.

184
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:58,859
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a bit of a conflict with mix used in this definition, the current definition.

185
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I think personally, I think that if our goal is to report all of these out tonight, we should deal with the thorns as we encounter them.

186
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:19,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Questions or comments or suggestions from counsellors on the need for reconciliation that Paola just mentioned?

187
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:27,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

188
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:37,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine with the suggestion that we go with the suggestion definition until we're ready to also change the height standards.

189
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:43,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

190
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that for myself as well.

191
00:21:52,598 --> 00:22:00,783
[SPEAKER_10]: My priority is making sure that we don't, I think the phrase we were using last time is we don't want to break the zoning by implementing new terms before the rest of the zoning code is ready for them.

192
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:06,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the approach of making new terms available and then implementing them when we're ready.

193
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:14,851
[SPEAKER_10]: So Paola, if it's the professional opinion of Innes Associates that this is the definition that accomplishes that, then I think that's how we should go forward.

194
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:17,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, perfect.

195
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:22,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other comments from councillors or city staff on this one?

196
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:22,953
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

197
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:23,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

198
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:24,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go forward.

199
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:26,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

200
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:35,936
[SPEAKER_01]: We also looked into all the definitions that has this family definition attached and to change it.

201
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:45,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the dwelling unit, we just want to leave it as it is, but just change the word family that you see there.

202
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:58,377
[SPEAKER_01]: with the line in the middle, and for household, that you have a very easy definition of household, so it could fit perfectly.

203
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:11,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dwelling unit means a room or group of rooms forming a habitable unit for one household with facilities used or intended to be used for living, sleeping, cooking, sanitation, and eating.

204
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:16,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have dwelling single family attached,

205
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:20,099
[SPEAKER_01]: dwelling single family detached and dwelling two family.

206
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:31,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Our proposal is to change all of them to dwelling one unit attached or detached and dwelling two units.

207
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:41,580
[SPEAKER_01]: The dwelling one unit attached can also be named row house, or we can also introduce the name also known as row house.

208
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:49,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is made a bit easier for everyone, because it's more the traditional kind of name.

209
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:54,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same we can do with duality units and color, as well, duplex.

210
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:03,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Alicia?

211
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I recognize Alicia.

212
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to comment that I really like from our purposes, the idea of saying dwelling one unit attached, also known as row house, and then the other also known as duplex, because that is something that has come up for people a lot.

213
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:28,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it called that?

214
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,600
[SPEAKER_04]: What are one units that are attached to each other?

215
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make any sense to us.

216
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:40,125
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you put also known as row house, it's blindingly obvious to everybody what's going on here.

217
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the same for the duplex.

218
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:56,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we could do is also have a diagram with it, because mainly the attach or detach is about the party line.

219
00:24:56,255 --> 00:25:00,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sidelines that you share with the abutting

220
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:08,163
[SPEAKER_01]: lot, and so if you are attached to that, if you share that wall, in both sides you're attached, if you don't, you're detached.

221
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:16,848
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's maybe too technical, so too complemented with the row house or the duplex, it's maybe easier.

222
00:25:19,432 --> 00:25:40,830
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also one typo, at least I guess in the zoning that I have, is the zoning that there is in the dwelling 2 family that is instead of, or it says 2, so it says a detached residential building intended and designed to contain 2, containing 2 dwelling units, that should be to contain or containing 2 dwelling units.

223
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a typo.

224
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:45,554
[SPEAKER_01]: If we wanted to pass it now, it's easy fixable.

225
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:56,795
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the only thing that I realized is that, and maybe it's because you don't have this typology, you don't have a semi-detached.

226
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:02,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is when you share only one wall with the neighbor.

227
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:08,080
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a typology that it's in Somerville, for example.

228
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,802
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have detached, you're not attached to anyone.

229
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:16,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Attached is that you're attached by the two side, lot sides,

230
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:21,737
[SPEAKER_01]: and semi, it's only that you share one.

231
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:32,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something if we, and this is maybe for later, but if it's something that it's a building typology that you have at the moment, it's not represented.

232
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:37,265
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's in duplex, but it's not exactly the same.

233
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:46,270
[SPEAKER_01]: So just so you know, I'm not changing anything now, but just to clarify,

234
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:52,572
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe there is a typology that you have and it's not represented here.

235
00:26:52,592 --> 00:27:05,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan, go ahead.

236
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:06,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm a little confused.

237
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:09,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that dwelling two family would include that.

238
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:16,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, no, because the two dwelling is

239
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:22,308
[SPEAKER_01]: The two dwelling is in one lot and it's a detach.

240
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:28,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has no wall on a party line.

241
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:33,414
[SPEAKER_01]: So the party line is the line that you share with the neighbor, with the neighboring lot.

242
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:40,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are attached to there, to that side, you will have a semi-detached.

243
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:44,760
[SPEAKER_01]: The duplex is just, it's in one lot.

244
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:46,081
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sharing.

245
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:56,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has setbacks on the sides, so it's detached from any other structure around it.

246
00:27:57,483 --> 00:28:02,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be that it's a dwelling unit, so you have two units in one lot.

247
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,465
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you have a single house and a single house.

248
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:10,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be one next to the other or one above the other.

249
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:15,927
[SPEAKER_01]: But you always have it in one lot and you don't share any lot lines.

250
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:18,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what a duplex is.

251
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:20,403
[SPEAKER_08]: So the other one.

252
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:21,304
[SPEAKER_08]: That part I understood.

253
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:22,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'm not understanding the other one.

254
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:25,473
[SPEAKER_08]: It's two different lots, but they share one wall?

255
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:25,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

256
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:25,994
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

257
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:27,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we have that.

258
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:30,817
[SPEAKER_01]: In some places, they don't have it.

259
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:32,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's only duplex.

260
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:34,719
[SPEAKER_01]: In Somerville, they have.

261
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:40,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if maybe because it's the same zone area, maybe they share.

262
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:42,843
[SPEAKER_01]: You share also these things.

263
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:44,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do have this.

264
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:56,029
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a duplex, but mainly is that you have one dwelling unit in one plot and one dwelling unit in the other.

265
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:57,350
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's something that we can...

266
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,022
[SPEAKER_11]: The wall is also the lot line, is what you're saying?

267
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:02,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, yeah.

268
00:29:02,563 --> 00:29:02,763
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

269
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:07,607
[SPEAKER_01]: The wall is exactly on the lot line that is shared from both.

270
00:29:07,627 --> 00:29:10,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll recognize Pointer Evans.

271
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

272
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:18,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think this is when definite illustrations would help.

273
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:27,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know if we have this type in Medford, but yeah, there's definitely in Somerville and Arlington where it's basically

274
00:29:28,397 --> 00:29:39,520
[SPEAKER_05]: As Paolo was saying, it's on the lot line, so you have basically, it looks like a townhouse.

275
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,361
[SPEAKER_05]: The lot line's through the middle, so it's not like a condo situation.

276
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:46,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's sharing yards, like the lot lines.

277
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:49,303
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a rectangle with your townhouse and the other one has theirs.

278
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:56,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we have any of those, but I feel like that'd be a great way to do infill as well.

279
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:58,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeeze things in on small lots.

280
00:29:58,893 --> 00:29:59,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need setbacks.

281
00:30:00,954 --> 00:30:04,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it will make it a bit more dense in certain areas.

282
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:10,881
[SPEAKER_01]: You need maybe a little less frontage because you don't need to respect one of the setbacks.

283
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:28,131
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's something that I just wanted to mention, that I don't see it on these definitions, so maybe we need to see if there is to include it or if it's something that is interesting for the future to have mainly.

284
00:30:28,823 --> 00:30:29,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you.

285
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:30,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.

286
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:39,572
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, you know, this process is bringing to the fore certain present or future uses that we don't have definitions for yet.

287
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:46,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And since we know that this is a use that exists in neighboring communities, but less so in Medford, I think this is one that we should put on the list of things to revisit.

288
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:55,163
[SPEAKER_10]: in future packages of changes if that seems like an okay cadence to city staff and to your team.

289
00:30:56,563 --> 00:31:00,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I think that these proposals look good.

290
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:01,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I also think that, you know, the

291
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:12,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that there's a lot of good reasons to adopt the, you know, dwelling one unit attached aka row house or, you know, the aka duplex that seems useful.

292
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:17,110
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be, I would be happy to go forward with those tonight.

293
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:23,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other comments, questions from councillors, city staff on this one?

294
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:33,843
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, seeing none, I guess we can move on.

295
00:31:34,263 --> 00:31:36,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

296
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:42,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we go into the mobile home and manufacturer home.

297
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:48,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I didn't bring this correctly last time.

298
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:57,589
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea was to change the definition of mobile home and change it completely into manufacturer home.

299
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:58,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are

300
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:07,454
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, deleting the mobile home and bringing a manufacturer home and factory-built home.

301
00:32:07,614 --> 00:32:11,615
[SPEAKER_01]: And this came after the comments from the building commissioner.

302
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:29,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, manufacturer home is a factory-built structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

303
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:48,185
[SPEAKER_01]: and the factory built home and this mainly is to bring forward the possibility to have pre-fab houses and so that's why we need this

304
00:32:49,620 --> 00:33:00,087
[SPEAKER_01]: we are bringing this definition, which is a standardized units, primarily built inside of a factory, then assembled on site in accordance with local building codes.

305
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:16,519
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not about movable, but that it is about being fabricated inside a fabric built inside a factory, and then bring it and build it on site in the

306
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:30,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so these are the two that we are bringing, and the mobile home is disappearing.

307
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:35,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw, I think, Alicia Hunt that raised her hand.

308
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:36,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll recognize Director Hunt.

309
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:48,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, one of the so my understanding to manufacturing home this makes sense right I can see that there are uses.

310
00:33:49,217 --> 00:33:55,044
[SPEAKER_04]: One that has come up in from time to time is somebody has house has a major fire.

311
00:33:55,504 --> 00:34:02,809
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they put a manufactured home in the driveway and they live there while their house is being reconstructed.

312
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:09,092
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is not something that would necessarily be allowed regularly in any place in Medford at this time.

313
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:14,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm confused by why one would want a definition the next one.

314
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:21,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying we shouldn't put something in I don't fully understand, but the one after that.

315
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the next slide.

316
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get the word, factory built home.

317
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:31,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So my understanding is that when that is constructed, it doesn't look any different from any other kind of house.

318
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:44,047
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, when I got a tour of the new buildings that Tufts was building, the ones that are the new grad housing, I think, on Capon Street in Winthrop,

319
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:52,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were built in factories and transported to the site like pieces, large pieces of them were.

320
00:34:54,235 --> 00:35:00,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sort of a better way of getting more energy efficient buildings, because they can be more

321
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Rigorously tested and more rigorously constructed when they're done in the factories.

322
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:16,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm unclear why we would ever regulate that from a zoning perspective, because in theory, it looks this houses on your.

323
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:19,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if any of you know that better.

324
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:23,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to also ask the building commissioner.

325
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't object to having more definitions.

326
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:33,529
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better to have definitions that we don't always use than to not have the definition available as we need it.

327
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:44,178
[SPEAKER_01]: To my understanding, to include this one is so that we can regulate it in the sense that it's

328
00:35:46,835 --> 00:36:07,625
[SPEAKER_01]: it's possible to do this and to say it more clear on the zoning that this is a possibility and as you said it's even a lot it can it can bring a lot of being even better built and

329
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:15,231
[SPEAKER_01]: climate efficiency, better sustainability standards done this way.

330
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:34,340
[SPEAKER_01]: To my understanding is from the building commissioner is to also be able to permit these type of houses of building and that is very clear that they can do this so that there is no possible doubt.

331
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,922
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my understanding, but we can totally save it.

332
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:43,930
[SPEAKER_01]: and have a more broad dialogue on it.

333
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:45,391
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally possible.

334
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:50,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that he's, sorry, I just got a message from him that he's joining us in a minute.

335
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:54,597
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't actually object to including it.

336
00:36:54,637 --> 00:37:03,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just trying to understand if there was something to it that I wasn't understanding, since my understanding is that they do look like every other one.

337
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do look as any other.

338
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:32,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, as I said, maybe he can let us know later better, but my understanding was just to make sure that we include them so that it was clear that these houses could be there somewhere, so that the definition makes it more clear that this was a possibility.

339
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:33,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, yes.

340
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:35,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paola.

341
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:47,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I think some definitions are updated or so that it's more clear to people who do work and what uses are encouraged and allowed or permitted.

342
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:59,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that if the building commissioner feels that that's something that would be helped by including this definition for the first time, that sounds good to me.

343
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's keep it moving.

344
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:09,304
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had this tiny house movable and tiny house stationary.

345
00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:13,347
[SPEAKER_01]: These we already reviewed in the previous one.

346
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:21,674
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only because the stationary one we added from a comment from our consultant.

347
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:32,983
[SPEAKER_01]: To make it more the same, we added the second part of, which is this part, that I will read it now out loud.

348
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:36,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's here, otherwise it was mainly pre-approved.

349
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:58,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So tiny house movable or transportable dwelling unit built on a frame or a chassis with no more than 400 square feet, excluding lofts, protection from bay windows, open decks, porches, or exterior utility and storage compartments intended for residential use on an individual house lot where single family dwellings are allowed or as an accessory dwelling unit.

350
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:19,623
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the stationary, a dwelling that is 400 square feet or less in floor area excluding lofts, projection from bay windows, open decks, porches or exterior utility and storage compartments intended for the residential use and individual house lot where single family dwellings are allowed or as an accessory dwelling unit.

351
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:23,985
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are- Thank you, Paola, I appreciate that.

352
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:38,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Having reviewed these two, and I just want to, I think for these, oh, and thank you, Commissioner, we'll get to you in just a sec.

353
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:51,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for arranging these definitions, since we had such a substantial conversation about these in our previous committee meeting, I want to pivot and see if there are questions on these two that we just went over, and maybe even for the definitions.

354
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:53,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Rounding out this batch,

355
00:39:55,014 --> 00:39:57,376
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, let's gloss over all the headlines.

356
00:39:58,698 --> 00:40:01,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's, you know, you or I can read the definitions.

357
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:08,707
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I think, based on our substantive conversation last time, I think we could be at the point where we can raise red flags where there are.

358
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:12,191
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think we left this off in a really great place at our last meeting.

359
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner van der Waal, go ahead.

360
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, there, I'm unmuted.

361
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:30,034
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I ask is I see the source of the tiny homes in the ICC.

362
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:43,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that is the most current ICC reference, because I believe when a new building code comes out this year, it'll be based on the 2021 code and will include definitions of tiny homes in it.

363
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:47,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't read it, but I just want to see if those two sync up with each other at all.

364
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:51,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I will check.

365
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for...

366
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I will totally review that.

367
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:59,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, but thank you.

368
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:00,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Commissioner.

369
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:04,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we can make sure to check on that before these come before the council and report it to the CBB.

370
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Paola, for introducing these last two.

371
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any questions or comments from councillors or city staff before we proceed on to the next terms?

372
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:19,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Director Hunt.

373
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:35,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we just go back and ask the commissioner if the my understanding around factory built was correct and I just wanted to make sure that we weren't missing anything there.

374
00:41:36,883 --> 00:42:00,135
[SPEAKER_04]: that the my understanding with factory built is just that they they look like everything else they just happen to be built in a factory and then assembled on site rather than built on site and was there some reason why we want what was the reasoning for wanting the definition in our definitions because my impression my experience with them is they don't look any different from anything else

375
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,516
[SPEAKER_02]: They generally don't.

376
00:42:15,596 --> 00:42:19,279
[SPEAKER_02]: They are generally built into a factory to the same standards.

377
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:34,430
[SPEAKER_02]: The manufacturing state building department has a manufactured home section that authorizes what they call third party inspectors, whose job is to inspect these things constructed at the plant.

378
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:36,592
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're manufactured.

379
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:40,173
[SPEAKER_02]: The only challenge is there's a slight terminology issue.

380
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:41,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets confusing.

381
00:42:41,053 --> 00:42:52,197
[SPEAKER_02]: These are typically known as modular homes because the true definition of manufactured home belongs to a mobile home under HUD, although the state calls them manufactured homes.

382
00:42:52,257 --> 00:43:02,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish the state would update their language, but it's not a bad idea to point out a modular home because it is different than a manufactured home under other standards.

383
00:43:05,373 --> 00:43:05,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

384
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:07,794
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go to President Bears and then Planner Evans.

385
00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:09,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

386
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:11,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Just want to note, we do have kind of a time clock here.

387
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:17,039
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a bunch of other major stuff, and we've been spending a lot of time on things we've talked about already.

388
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to just echo what Vice President Collins suggested.

389
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:33,248
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could read through all the remaining definitions, if people could raise their flag on all of them, and then we can move on to the other items, that would be a preference of this councillor.

390
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:33,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

391
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:36,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Barras.

392
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:37,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Planner Evans?

393
00:43:39,095 --> 00:43:40,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I won't belabor this then.

394
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:41,258
[SPEAKER_05]: We can carry on.

395
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:42,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

396
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:49,451
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would say that we have another Council meeting, another CDB hearing, and another Council hearing once again to belabor anything we want.

397
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:52,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, many bites at the apple.

398
00:43:53,006 --> 00:44:14,920
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Paola, if we could proceed, and then we'll just, I think let's, in the interest of time and our full agenda for this meeting, let's read off, you know, this term will be defined, junkyards, take a beat, and if council or city staff have concerns or questions, we can stay on those.

399
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,201
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, we can proceed.

400
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:18,022
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that sound?

401
00:44:18,942 --> 00:44:19,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's perfect.

402
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:25,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one as well, it was pretty much no concerns.

403
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:28,428
[SPEAKER_01]: We just added the comments from the building commissioner.

404
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:47,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So junkyard, the use of any area or any lot, whether inside or outside of a building, for the storage, keeping or abandonment of junk, scrap or discarded materials, or the dismantling, demolition or abandonment of automobiles, other vehicles, machinery or parts thereof, including but not limited to.

405
00:44:47,714 --> 00:45:11,609
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is the part that we added, discarded, worn out, or junked plumbing, heating supplies, household appliances, and furniture, discarded or scrapped and junked lumber, old or scrapped copper brass ropes, rags, batteries, paper, trash, rubber, plastic debris, waste, and old ferrous material, discarded motor vehicle parts, or more than two unregistered motor vehicles.

406
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:17,512
[SPEAKER_10]: So, those are the questions or comments from counsellors on junkyards.

407
00:45:20,334 --> 00:45:24,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, okay.

408
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:28,398
[SPEAKER_01]: This one as well, we saw it, it just was a bit of struggling.

409
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,552
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to make sure that we understood this once.

410
00:45:35,614 --> 00:45:40,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So accessory structure, the current definition, we keep as it is.

411
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:44,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that we change is that we have

412
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:47,097
[SPEAKER_01]: on the current zoning only accessory.

413
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,661
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we change is the name accessory use.

414
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:55,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is to take out all of the standards of use.

415
00:45:56,426 --> 00:46:08,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it will be a use customarily incidental and subordinate to that is something that we add and subordinate to and on the same lot.

416
00:46:09,654 --> 00:46:12,255
[SPEAKER_01]: or adjacent lot under the same ownership.

417
00:46:12,596 --> 00:46:21,840
[SPEAKER_01]: This group of lots was flagged by the building commissioner, so we changed it into or adjacent lot under the same ownership as a conforming principle use.

418
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:27,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And we stopped there and the rest we just eliminated from the definition.

419
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

420
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:28,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paola.

421
00:46:28,804 --> 00:46:34,607
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we had a really, for me, a helpful conversation about this on the 8th, Commissioner Venable.

422
00:46:41,163 --> 00:46:51,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only asking, are we taking away accessory structure because we do have some dimensional criteria in other parts of zoning for what is a limit of a size for an accessory structure?

423
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:53,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to lose that.

424
00:46:54,173 --> 00:46:57,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's 15 feet tall and so many square foot.

425
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:02,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now it says accessory.

426
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,846
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just an accessory and accessory structure.

427
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:13,910
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is just changing accessory to accessory use because it's not changing anything about accessory structure.

428
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:14,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

429
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:17,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, a good flag.

430
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:17,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

431
00:47:18,272 --> 00:47:27,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions or flags other than that one on accessory use?

432
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:30,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's proceed.

433
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

434
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:42,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So now are the new definitions that we didn't bring last time because they were under review, and that is the eating establishment, cafe, coffee shop, and the yard and setbacks.

435
00:47:44,134 --> 00:48:00,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The eating establishment mainly was asked in order to have a new definition that was not so broad, that would be able to facilitate the use of small-scale café.

436
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:02,650
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the idea.

437
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we bring the definition of neighborhood café.

438
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:16,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And this means an establishment that serves a limited menu of food items and does not contain more than 2,000 square feet of gross floor area.

439
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:23,697
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from the House Bill 2252, State of Washington, blah, blah, blah.

440
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:25,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

441
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:27,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a concern

442
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:39,448
[SPEAKER_01]: about the square footage and if certain cafes in the area of Medford would be able to be part of it.

443
00:48:40,568 --> 00:48:47,672
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure those cafes, I don't remember the names at the moment, but I measure more or less the square footage and it was under 2000.

444
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:52,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And also because I don't want to

445
00:48:56,092 --> 00:49:01,534
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a neighbourhood cafe, it should be a scale that is manageable and that is small.

446
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:04,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the 2000 is perfect for this.

447
00:49:05,636 --> 00:49:08,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it will be an eating establishment.

448
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:13,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to be able to be here, it has to be under the 2000 square feet.

449
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

450
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for introducing this.

451
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:21,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that the clarification of when is it becoming an establishment is very clear.

452
00:49:22,144 --> 00:49:22,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callaghan.

453
00:49:28,234 --> 00:49:40,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that the same way that we don't want height things into the zoning definitions, we probably also don't want hours in the zoning definitions.

454
00:49:40,162 --> 00:49:48,127
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say that when I think of a neighborhood cafe and about zoning and having neighborhood cafes in more closer to residential neighborhoods,

455
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:58,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think of ours as part of the reason why a cafe is more acceptable than an eating establishment, than a dinner place.

456
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a dinner place is going to be open until 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night.

457
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:03,992
[SPEAKER_08]: A cafe, you know, big closed by 8.

458
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:08,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know where that belongs or if it just doesn't belong at all.

459
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:19,603
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just wanted to mention that in terms of, it does seem to me to be related to zoning in terms of where we might want to have places that are open late at night and where we might not want to have places that are open late at night.

460
00:50:20,504 --> 00:50:22,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

461
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:23,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a good point.

462
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:30,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure that that type of constraint would occur in the definition, but I think it's something for us to consider elsewhere in the zoning ordinance.

463
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:32,894
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears and then Planner Evans.

464
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:42,314
[SPEAKER_11]: just something that we've talked about is actually wanting to get hours out of zoning because having special permit requirements for hours is kind of just a strange way to go about it.

465
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:47,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we'd want to have a kind of holistic discussion about moving hours to a general ordinance.

466
00:50:47,637 --> 00:50:52,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And then maybe we could look at different hours for different uses along the lines of what Councilor Callahan just said.

467
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:55,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

468
00:50:58,002 --> 00:51:02,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I was just going to say something similar to Zach in that hours in

469
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:10,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the way that's regulated in zoning is not normal or is not the customary way of doing it.

470
00:51:10,397 --> 00:51:12,538
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be more of a licensing function.

471
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:15,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So you end up under a common BIC.

472
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:20,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully, we're moving in that direction.

473
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:23,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

474
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

475
00:51:25,403 --> 00:51:32,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or concerns with eating establishments cafe slash coffee shop neighborhood cafe?

476
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:38,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a new hand, present bearish, or an old one?

477
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:42,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

478
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:45,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go forward.

479
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:47,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last one.

480
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Terms to be clarified.

481
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:52,131
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the yard versus the setback.

482
00:51:52,631 --> 00:52:02,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the current one, there is a bit of confusing terms.

483
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we wanted to clarify those.

484
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:17,746
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the definitions that we'll highly recommend with illustration, because if you see any diagram, it's very easy to understand.

485
00:52:18,314 --> 00:52:21,797
[SPEAKER_01]: written, it's a bit more complex.

486
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:24,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some examples for that.

487
00:52:24,459 --> 00:52:30,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Our idea is to structure as we give the definition of yard.

488
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:36,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside of the yard, we give the definition of yard front, yard side, yard rear.

489
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:40,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have yard setback.

490
00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:45,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the yard setback can be setback line or yard setback.

491
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:55,429
[SPEAKER_01]: But because at the moment in the table of the dimensions, it's called yard, I don't want it to be very different.

492
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:02,556
[SPEAKER_01]: If we call it setback, then maybe they don't relate to the actual name on the table.

493
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:08,339
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the moment, it's confusing because a yard can never be a distance.

494
00:53:08,879 --> 00:53:10,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a yard is an area.

495
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:14,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the moment, it's yard, and then you have its feet.

496
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is confusing, and that should be addressed.

497
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:27,822
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the moment, I think that yard definitions and then yard setback could help to start the process of making it a bit more clarified.

498
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:33,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So the current definition basically is

499
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:37,352
[SPEAKER_01]: the yard and this is just the front, for example.

500
00:53:38,533 --> 00:53:46,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, Paula, if you could kind of summarize these as a unit, I think that would be the most comprehensible, at least to this counsellor, rather than going through the definitions individually.

501
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:57,172
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't want to do it individually, only to address that at the moment the second part, the minimum front yard is measured horizontally between the nearest point of the principal structure and the front line.

502
00:53:57,672 --> 00:54:04,939
[SPEAKER_01]: This is mainly the setback and that belongs to the different definition and that is what we try to do.

503
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,475
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the suggested definition.

504
00:54:08,555 --> 00:54:10,516
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just say what a yard is.

505
00:54:10,996 --> 00:54:13,197
[SPEAKER_01]: The current definition is a bit vague as well.

506
00:54:13,977 --> 00:54:16,018
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just try to complete it a bit more.

507
00:54:16,438 --> 00:54:24,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And we say an area and abstract from the ground up on the same lot with a principal building extending along a lot line and inward to the principal building.

508
00:54:25,123 --> 00:54:29,565
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, we specified what is the front, the side, and the rear.

509
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:43,822
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, a yard extending for the full width of the lot between the front line of the nearest building wall or building part, not specifically excluded, and the front lot line.

510
00:54:44,819 --> 00:55:10,691
[SPEAKER_01]: because this was a conversation if it was sometimes they say like the the main facade or the building wall and so it could be that a porch people don't know if it's in or out and it's in other sections but that maybe we can clearly say or maybe we can even add the section um in the zoning so that it's easily to check back what is included and whatnot

511
00:55:12,754 --> 00:55:15,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the same for side and rear.

512
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go a bit fast in here.

513
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:22,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have two.

514
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,561
[SPEAKER_01]: One is more simplified.

515
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:25,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, okay.

516
00:55:25,662 --> 00:55:37,649
[SPEAKER_01]: So in side yard and rear yard, sorry, there is something that I wanted to mention because sometimes there is an unoccupied area except for an accessory structure.

517
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And so

518
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:54,344
[SPEAKER_01]: it depends, sometimes you have a setback that is 20 feet for residential in the rear, and then the accessory dwelling unit on the same lot can actually have a rear setback of five feet.

519
00:55:54,964 --> 00:56:07,914
[SPEAKER_01]: And so depending on if that's the case for Medford, we can actually have the unoccupied accept or just simplify it and take that part out.

520
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:12,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

521
00:56:13,414 --> 00:56:13,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

522
00:56:13,754 --> 00:56:17,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this does an admirable job of putting verbal language to a very visual concept.

523
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:19,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner van der Waal.

524
00:56:25,524 --> 00:56:30,148
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different conditions that make this much more challenging.

525
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Corner lots.

526
00:56:33,228 --> 00:56:42,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots in which the house is not parallel to the front or back line, or the lot is irregularly shaped.

527
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:52,423
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that make these difficult, we talk about structures of front set of stairs or steps, where we met that's part of the structure.

528
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:58,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly people can say, just because I have six feet of steps stepping out, should that be my front yard?

529
00:56:58,288 --> 00:57:01,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I be allowed to go to my building facade or the full footprint of it?

530
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:10,210
[SPEAKER_02]: the challenge becomes, this is a perfect definition for a perfectly square lot with a perfectly square and aligned house on it.

531
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,792
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that, it gets fuzzy real quickly.

532
00:57:13,553 --> 00:57:17,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have questions about how to interpret all this.

533
00:57:20,138 --> 00:57:25,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some definitions that address all the different

534
00:57:28,587 --> 00:57:55,605
[SPEAKER_01]: situations that can happen and so what if it's triangular and I don't have a rear what is it so many different but I just thought that it was a bit complex and so the way to address if it's the port or the steps are in or out it should be to mention in the zoning or as a footnote or something that will

535
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,161
[SPEAKER_01]: address in the zoning, but not in the definition.

536
00:57:59,781 --> 00:58:12,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So to make it a bit more vague, because if that changes, in the zoning changes, whatever the setback or whatever the structure that can get in or out, then this has to change.

537
00:58:12,765 --> 00:58:16,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our idea is to simplify it as much as possible.

538
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:25,812
[SPEAKER_01]: And these will come with diagrams, so maybe in the diagrams we can be a bit more different situations and address those.

539
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:33,421
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that if I started to put all these different things, it started to be very complex.

540
00:58:34,272 --> 00:58:37,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of those things can be addressed through exceptions.

541
00:58:37,593 --> 00:58:49,396
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, an exception could be steps or, you know, egress stairs with a landing no bigger than five by five, you know, because that's a bare minimum requirement for building code.

542
00:58:49,436 --> 00:58:53,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything other bigger than that is a deck or a porch and that's treated in a very different way.

543
00:58:54,037 --> 00:58:55,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be treated.

544
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:58,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Exceptions could certainly pick up some of these.

545
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:05,142
[SPEAKER_02]: The front and the side yards get very confusing occasionally with the weird lots, the corner lots, so.

546
00:59:05,762 --> 00:59:07,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you Commissioner van der Waal.

547
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:10,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that my M.O.

548
00:59:10,686 --> 00:59:14,928
[SPEAKER_10]: for the definitions at this stage is to make sure that we're advancing the ones that T.S.

549
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:21,473
[SPEAKER_10]: up for future good decisions, even if those future good decisions are necessary to keep improving the zoning.

550
00:59:21,813 --> 00:59:25,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't want to advance a definition that further confuses the issue, but if an exception

551
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:31,197
[SPEAKER_10]: or kind of like a fringe case can be added on top of this foundational definition.

552
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:36,318
[SPEAKER_10]: If we feel that's the case with advancing these tonight, then I think that we should.

553
00:59:36,398 --> 00:59:44,700
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, again, before implementing these in the zoning code, figure out what other fringe cases or exemptions need to be added in so that we are covering all of our bases.

554
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:47,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we move on, Planner Evans?

555
00:59:49,253 --> 01:00:04,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, so in our current zoning, we do have like a whole section that's like, um, around dimensional requirements, special cases that kind of talk about what, um, what parts of a structure are allowed to project within, you know, required yards and stuff.

556
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:10,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that catch all, like not specifically excluded, um, is helpful.

557
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:16,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, perhaps like some kind of footnote to,

558
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:21,972
[SPEAKER_05]: So people know that there is a section to refer to.

559
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:22,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

560
01:00:23,113 --> 01:00:27,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one of the definitions that I saw was exactly that.

561
01:00:27,215 --> 01:00:32,277
[SPEAKER_01]: They were referring to a section as in section five, whatever it was for them.

562
01:00:32,937 --> 01:00:34,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we could add that.

563
01:00:34,278 --> 01:00:41,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's all the exemptions and all these things are in that section, then we can refer to that section.

564
01:00:42,523 --> 01:00:50,529
[SPEAKER_01]: from the definitions, but I don't want it to add all these standards on the definitions, because if then they change, the definition has to change.

565
01:00:53,432 --> 01:01:03,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there is a thing about the front edge, and that is something that I wanted to address, and maybe I can go... So let me just...

566
01:01:04,252 --> 01:01:19,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to also define the yard setback and with this one is the minimum horizontal distance between a specified lot line, measure along a straight line and at a right angle to such lot line and the nearest point of a building or structure.

567
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:27,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Danielle Evans was commenting if it's necessary to say all this at the right angle, it is.

568
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:29,950
[SPEAKER_01]: a perfect square.

569
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:35,812
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have angles, how you measure that with the different angles, you get different dimensions.

570
01:01:36,452 --> 01:01:39,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is why the right angle needs to be there.

571
01:01:41,454 --> 01:01:44,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And this to me, it's a good definition.

572
01:01:44,176 --> 01:01:47,037
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most clear that I've seen.

573
01:01:49,898 --> 01:01:56,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did like this one, but if it seems too much or too confusing, we can change it.

574
01:01:58,042 --> 01:02:00,043
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that the right angle is needed.

575
01:02:00,223 --> 01:02:09,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, if you use a different one, it's not perfect perpendicular, that it's never perfect and perpendicular, you get different measurements.

576
01:02:12,389 --> 01:02:12,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paola.

577
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:14,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.

578
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:20,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do recognize this is one of the ones that was a bit in a less formed state in our last community meeting about definitions.

579
01:02:20,933 --> 01:02:24,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to pause there for any questions from councillors.

580
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:42,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to have in mind, this is, for example, from Toronto, and they call it the basic Illustrator.

581
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:48,296
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have different situations, different of the definitions that they accompany with a diagram.

582
01:02:48,736 --> 01:02:51,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And they even make a PDF separate.

583
01:02:51,357 --> 01:02:58,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have the diagram and all the different definitions that go like in a package, so that you can see all this together.

584
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:11,776
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is very clear and it helps a lot with these types of definitions that for people that are not technical or used to this, they just hear a lot of lot line, lot line, and they're completely confused.

585
01:03:12,437 --> 01:03:17,060
[SPEAKER_01]: So this type of addressing the definitions in this way is very helpful.

586
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:22,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you have the ones with the setbacks and then the lot coverage, for example.

587
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:27,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the definitions will be accompanied by this.

588
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:29,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

589
01:03:29,029 --> 01:03:41,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know for myself as one councillor, I think that having more visual definitions to accompany the verbal ones will make these even more clear for everybody who's using them.

590
01:03:41,974 --> 01:03:46,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly knowing that these are in the queue makes me comfortable with advancing these tonight as well.

591
01:03:47,897 --> 01:03:53,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we get any last comments on these definitions from councillors and move on, Commissioner Redville.

592
01:04:00,572 --> 01:04:01,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think visual is really good.

593
01:04:02,453 --> 01:04:06,096
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of people, I see stuff like they're the front lot line and the edge of the sidewalk.

594
01:04:06,537 --> 01:04:12,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Be amazed at how many people assume that their front lot line is where the pavement stops or something else.

595
01:04:12,221 --> 01:04:13,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is hard to explain to them.

596
01:04:13,862 --> 01:04:18,546
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's really more of an imaginary space that we'd have to have a survey to figure out.

597
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:24,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would be excellent to have this sort of stuff within the zoning to clarify it for folks.

598
01:04:25,331 --> 01:04:26,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, thank you, Commissioner.

599
01:04:26,772 --> 01:04:28,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I can definitely see how that would be really useful.

600
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:30,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

601
01:04:30,939 --> 01:04:33,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Were these the last two definitions that we had to review, Paola?

602
01:04:34,302 --> 01:04:35,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a quick one.

603
01:04:35,363 --> 01:04:36,423
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also to comment.

604
01:04:36,443 --> 01:04:41,087
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about lot line, and it was especially the lot line front.

605
01:04:42,688 --> 01:04:55,339
[SPEAKER_01]: The current definition, there is a part in... So in Medford, the current definition says that one lot can only have one frontage, one front line.

606
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, when you are in a corner,

607
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:07,406
[SPEAKER_01]: to me sounded a bit weird because usually I would have a primary front line and a secondary front line.

608
01:05:08,086 --> 01:05:17,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I imagine that corner, I will have the main street where the building is facing, that format is a front line.

609
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:24,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you go across the corner, that housing is only having a side setback.

610
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:32,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next lot line to it, it's already the front line.

611
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:37,521
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a weird movement across the corner when having this definition.

612
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:45,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted just to bring it up to see if there is a reason or if this is something that you want to leave it like this.

613
01:05:46,403 --> 01:05:46,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine to me.

614
01:05:47,363 --> 01:05:50,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to bring that in the corner lots having

615
01:05:51,785 --> 01:06:01,593
[SPEAKER_01]: not two front lines and not two frontages, but one front, one sideline, even though it's for the other street is going to be the main street.

616
01:06:02,394 --> 01:06:03,675
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bit confusing.

617
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:13,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paula.

618
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:16,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, I think, yeah, my confusion with this is what

619
01:06:17,775 --> 01:06:21,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, hang on a second, Commissioner Van Der Waal.

620
01:06:22,238 --> 01:06:23,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I think my question here is right.

621
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:34,406
[SPEAKER_10]: What about those right angle situations where, how do you determine which one is the front where the property line divides the street against, oh, hang on, when there's two rights away that it's abutting?

622
01:06:35,627 --> 01:06:38,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll recognize you, Commissioner Van Der Waal and then Councilor Callahan.

623
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:50,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can say we do have some definitions that start to introduce a side, the other corner as a secondary frontage, whether it's our obstructed view issues or accessory structure.

624
01:06:50,532 --> 01:06:57,740
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do, in cases, become two frontages for corner lot.

625
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all over the map and it's a challenge sometimes.

626
01:07:03,107 --> 01:07:17,978
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there a reason why we can only have one or it's actually just because it wasn't the definition and it has no reason behind it further than that?

627
01:07:20,741 --> 01:07:21,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

628
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:22,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callaghan.

629
01:07:23,992 --> 01:07:25,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do, given what you said.

630
01:07:27,414 --> 01:07:41,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I think having two frontages and a primary and a secondary makes a lot more sense because of the sort of spacing that will happen between front lines and the house.

631
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would really help.

632
01:07:45,285 --> 01:07:47,666
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a definition to change right away.

633
01:07:47,846 --> 01:07:55,788
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so that it's in the definitions that we will need to study or have a little more research.

634
01:07:55,808 --> 01:07:57,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to talk about it.

635
01:07:58,009 --> 01:07:58,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

636
01:07:58,209 --> 01:07:59,009
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a preview.

637
01:07:59,049 --> 01:07:59,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

638
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I always appreciate that.

639
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:02,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

640
01:08:02,571 --> 01:08:02,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

641
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:06,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to refer out the definitions to the regular California.

642
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:17,597
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a motion from President Bears to refer up these definitions and we did have a flag to include that footnote around parking code exemptions into the use table.

643
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:21,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I report out the table of use and changes as well.

644
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:22,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

645
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:25,483
[SPEAKER_10]: To report out the table of use and changes, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

646
01:08:26,904 --> 01:08:29,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, can you repeat the motion, please?

647
01:08:29,846 --> 01:08:37,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion is to refer the table of use and parking regulations changes and the definitions changes to the regular meeting.

648
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,400
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't discussed it yet, but you can throw this.

649
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,122
[SPEAKER_03]: People have used some parking regulations changes.

650
01:08:46,482 --> 01:08:48,764
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the last one?

651
01:08:48,804 --> 01:08:52,166
[SPEAKER_11]: The changes to the definitions.

652
01:08:52,226 --> 01:08:56,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll add a third one, which is the GIS digital zoning map.

653
01:08:56,610 --> 01:09:02,474
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to vote on it all right now, but those I think were the three things.

654
01:09:04,276 --> 01:09:05,717
[SPEAKER_03]: To the next regular meeting?

655
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:06,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

656
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:08,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

657
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

658
01:09:15,881 --> 01:09:18,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Shall we vote on that now or save it all?

659
01:09:18,343 --> 01:09:19,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's save all the motions for the end.

660
01:09:21,644 --> 01:09:24,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there needs to be a second on that one, but I may have missed it.

661
01:09:24,085 --> 01:09:25,546
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a second from Councilor Callahan.

662
01:09:29,668 --> 01:09:37,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to recenter where we are on the agenda now, an hour and 15 minutes in, we've talked about the table of use and parking regulations and the definitions.

663
01:09:38,656 --> 01:09:46,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other 2 things we wanted to report out were the GIS zoning map and the municipal exemption from certain use and dimensional requirements.

664
01:09:48,322 --> 01:09:53,065
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if we could, if anyone could speak quickly to the zoning map, I think that's a 2 minute.

665
01:09:53,946 --> 01:09:56,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Explanation and then we could do the municipal.

666
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:06,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I just want to thank you, President Bears, and I just want to restate that the zoning map, there are zero substantive changes to the map.

667
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:10,464
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that we're, you know, officially codifying the GIS digital version.

668
01:10:10,484 --> 01:10:12,284
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no changes to the zoning map.

669
01:10:12,304 --> 01:10:15,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, you know, yeah, we can spend one or two minutes on that.

670
01:10:16,386 --> 01:10:17,327
[SPEAKER_10]: that's just procedural.

671
01:10:17,527 --> 01:10:27,396
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if we can try to go over municipal exemption, this is again a topic that we've talked about in previous meetings, that this is kind of the culmination of those conversations.

672
01:10:29,618 --> 01:10:33,662
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we, let's see if we can get through that by 7 30.

673
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,331
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Paola, if you want to.

674
01:10:36,351 --> 01:10:44,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, are you comfortable talking about the GIS zoning map, or is that something that a PBS staff member would like to just quickly go over?

675
01:10:44,738 --> 01:10:49,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, or Alicia, if she can maybe address it.

676
01:10:51,331 --> 01:11:01,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, so the zoning map is something that has been a physical Mylar, is a kind of paper, its entire existence.

677
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:12,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And the PDS staff worked with the former building commissioner and our GIS staff person to digitize it.

678
01:11:12,585 --> 01:11:22,909
[SPEAKER_04]: to put it into GIS and to ensure that every parcel is to the best of their ability in the correct zone and is tagged correctly with it.

679
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:27,030
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is our belief that it is exactly.

680
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:34,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just keep adding that little tiny caveat of our belief because it was a piece of paper with lines drawn on it.

681
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:37,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we are electronic.

682
01:11:37,774 --> 01:11:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: We've made it electronic.

683
01:11:40,595 --> 01:11:48,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been a lot of fine-tooth combing to make sure that every parcel is in the correct zone, as intended by the existing map.

684
01:11:48,503 --> 01:12:01,175
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no, we have, our belief is that we did not make any zoning changes here, but we would like to use this as the base map for future zoning uses, which would be much easier if it's electronic.

685
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

686
01:12:02,756 --> 01:12:03,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Director Hunt.

687
01:12:04,037 --> 01:12:05,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything to add, veterans?

688
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So your hand is up.

689
01:12:19,052 --> 01:12:19,592
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

690
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:20,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

691
01:12:20,574 --> 01:12:23,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I had muted myself, and then I wasn't able to unmute myself again.

692
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:26,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had a child that came into the room.

693
01:12:29,352 --> 01:12:53,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so basically what we had heard from Attorney Silverstein is that we don't actually have to do, again, adoption of this, but because there's potentially chances that something conceivably could change that passing this, or including the map through the process could bless it and cover us there.

694
01:12:54,488 --> 01:12:57,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we put that language in the legal ad that

695
01:12:58,522 --> 01:13:03,126
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't believe anything's changing, but maybe, tiny thing, potentially.

696
01:13:04,066 --> 01:13:04,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

697
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:13,793
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is essentially, this is something that we have to do procedurally, and this way covers our basis in case anything very, very minor has incidentally changed.

698
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:21,805
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's already a motion to report out the GIS digital zoning map to our next regular meeting.

699
01:13:21,825 --> 01:13:25,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for just bringing us up to date on how that's come to be.

700
01:13:27,607 --> 01:13:33,290
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's tackle our next and last item that has to be reported out tonight, municipal use.

701
01:13:34,111 --> 01:13:42,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, let's try to, let's see if we can recap that process by 7.30 and I'll quickly tee up our proposed agenda items for our next couple of meetings in June.

702
01:13:43,812 --> 01:13:45,934
[SPEAKER_10]: and let councillors get along to their next committee meeting.

703
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:55,322
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Paola or Tony Silverstein, if you'd like to just briefly summarize the conversations that we've had around municipal exemption.

704
01:13:56,343 --> 01:13:57,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, thank you, councillor.

705
01:13:58,045 --> 01:14:00,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Jonathan Silverstein for the record.

706
01:14:00,968 --> 01:14:09,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really quickly, the amendment, and I don't know if Paola can bring up the amendment,

707
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:15,993
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed amendment or if everyone has it, but essentially the amendment does two things.

708
01:14:17,115 --> 01:14:24,942
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds a paragraph in the applicability section, section 1.4.

709
01:14:27,498 --> 01:14:49,321
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's a new section 1.4.2 that basically says that municipal projects are exempt from the requirements of the zoning ordinance, except any municipal project that, if it were a private project, would trigger the thresholds for constituting a major

710
01:14:50,225 --> 01:14:56,528
[SPEAKER_00]: project that would require site plan approval, that municipal project also will require site plan approval.

711
01:14:56,588 --> 01:15:07,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially it's an exemption from everything except where applicable the requirement for site plan approval and the purpose of that was for the discussion at the last meeting that

712
01:15:09,513 --> 01:15:31,407
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea was to not require municipal projects to go and get zoning variances, but still require them to the extent possible or practicable to provide screening and meet the goals and performance standards under site plan review.

713
01:15:32,187 --> 01:15:35,729
[SPEAKER_00]: The CD board does have the ability to waive any of those standards.

714
01:15:37,092 --> 01:15:39,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, whichever department is proposing a project.

715
01:15:41,129 --> 01:15:45,570
[SPEAKER_00]: can present evidence that it's just not practicable to meet those standards.

716
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:54,112
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a safety valve for that as well, but it's not an automatic exemption from the site plan review performance standards.

717
01:15:55,132 --> 01:16:09,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the amendment is really just deleting language that either conflicts with or becomes moot based upon the addition of that new section 1.4.2.

718
01:16:13,373 --> 01:16:14,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Attorney Silverstein.

719
01:16:14,814 --> 01:16:28,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate the overview of the why of this, why this is meaningful on the city side and walking through the changes to put this into effect.

720
01:16:28,678 --> 01:16:37,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have any questions, concerns from our fellow Councilors or a motion to report this out to the next regular meeting?

721
01:16:38,282 --> 01:16:38,662
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears.

722
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:40,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

723
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Just 1 kind of thing.

724
01:16:41,622 --> 01:16:44,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, just a couple logistical things.

725
01:16:44,664 --> 01:16:47,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Paula, could you send these slides if you have already?

726
01:16:47,285 --> 01:16:48,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize for missing it.

727
01:16:48,366 --> 01:16:49,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to upload.

728
01:16:49,386 --> 01:16:50,246
[SPEAKER_11]: They get them uploaded.

729
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:54,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, to our meeting portal, just if anyone comes back and wants to see them.

730
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:58,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, in terms of logistics, I have.

731
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:14,802
[SPEAKER_11]: a draft is something to put on the agenda for our meeting on the 28th, basically just saying it would come from the committee talking about these four items and referring them out to Community Development Board.

732
01:17:14,822 --> 01:17:20,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And I used some of the language from the legal hearing notice that was drafted for the future meetings, but it's not a public hearing yet.

733
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:24,771
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just referring it out to CD for the public hearing.

734
01:17:26,528 --> 01:17:52,177
[SPEAKER_11]: but can we get the actual like word document changes of the definitions the table of use and parking regulations uh the and the uh this municipal type plan review um can we get those by tomorrow so we can attach them to the agenda we have a an advanced agenda deadline because of memorial day holiday um so we need the agenda to go out by 4 30 tomorrow

735
01:17:54,389 --> 01:17:58,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to have these attachments attached to it when it goes out if possible.

736
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:06,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I don't know, Alicia, if there's anything you feel like we need to attach for the GIS zoning map or any language that you'd want to use.

737
01:18:06,714 --> 01:18:13,736
[SPEAKER_11]: If you feel like the language in the legal hearing notice is sufficient for a referral out, then I think we'd be fine there.

738
01:18:13,816 --> 01:18:20,599
[SPEAKER_11]: But those are just some procedural things I want to make sure we have wrapped so that this all gets done tomorrow and gets on the agenda for Tuesday.

739
01:18:24,828 --> 01:18:26,649
[SPEAKER_01]: From our side, there is no problem.

740
01:18:26,889 --> 01:18:30,070
[SPEAKER_01]: We will do that tomorrow as soon as possible.

741
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,811
[SPEAKER_01]: We send it your way before 4.30.

742
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:32,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

743
01:18:33,331 --> 01:18:33,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

744
01:18:33,952 --> 01:18:39,414
[SPEAKER_11]: And feel free to use CC, Kit, Alicia, myself, the city clerk, and one of us will make sure it gets in the right place.

745
01:18:40,214 --> 01:18:40,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

746
01:18:40,954 --> 01:18:41,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

747
01:18:42,155 --> 01:18:42,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

748
01:18:42,575 --> 01:18:42,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Quirk?

749
01:18:46,713 --> 01:18:47,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

750
01:18:48,153 --> 01:18:52,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to clarify, the agenda has to go out no later than 4.30 to comply with the open meeting law.

751
01:18:52,754 --> 01:19:00,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would need these documents, you know, well before 4.30 so we can get them out of the agenda and get the agenda out the door.

752
01:19:00,476 --> 01:19:02,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

753
01:19:02,757 --> 01:19:03,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Understood.

754
01:19:04,017 --> 01:19:04,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

755
01:19:05,497 --> 01:19:07,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

756
01:19:07,758 --> 01:19:13,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further questions or comments from the fellow councillors on municipal site review?

757
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:21,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, do I have a motion to refer this out to the next meeting?

758
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:23,614
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved.

759
01:19:25,215 --> 01:19:26,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have a second on the motion?

760
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:27,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

761
01:19:28,695 --> 01:19:33,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you referring up the whole thing?

762
01:19:35,177 --> 01:19:41,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you referring up all the questions or just is there another specific motion beyond what President Bears has moved to do?

763
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:46,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we should just amend my motion to also include the municipal site plan review.

764
01:19:49,699 --> 01:19:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

765
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:53,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on.

766
01:20:07,092 --> 01:20:09,274
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I got that incorporated in there.

767
01:20:11,459 --> 01:20:20,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, Mr. Clerk, is it now two motions, one to refer out the table of use, definitions, municipal site plan review changes, and then to refer the GIS digital zoning map out?

768
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:23,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I put them all in one motion, I'll have to read it back.

769
01:20:23,288 --> 01:20:24,289
[SPEAKER_10]: All in one motion, perfect.

770
01:20:24,349 --> 01:20:25,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, that's great.

771
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:26,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

772
01:20:28,072 --> 01:20:34,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing no hands raised, you can take the vote on that motion.

773
01:20:34,677 --> 01:20:34,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

774
01:20:35,578 --> 01:20:37,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

775
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:40,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

776
01:20:41,357 --> 01:20:42,018
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears.

777
01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:42,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

778
01:20:43,799 --> 01:20:50,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan.

779
01:20:50,765 --> 01:20:51,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lehman.

780
01:20:52,086 --> 01:20:52,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

781
01:20:54,147 --> 01:20:54,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

782
01:20:55,569 --> 01:20:55,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

783
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:58,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Collins.

784
01:20:59,272 --> 01:20:59,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

785
01:21:00,412 --> 01:21:02,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Five in fair, zero opposed.

786
01:21:02,634 --> 01:21:07,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes and these four items are reported out to the city council regular meeting.

787
01:21:08,299 --> 01:21:10,421
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to recap,

788
01:21:11,445 --> 01:21:17,926
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just going to stop your screen share for the last five minutes of the meeting.

789
01:21:17,966 --> 01:21:18,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

790
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:29,849
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to recap these four items, the changes to the table of uses, the definitions that we discussed, the municipal site plan review and the GIS slash digital version of the zoning map.

791
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:33,770
[SPEAKER_10]: These will all appear on the city council agenda next Tuesday.

792
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:43,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Procedurally, they must then be referred to the CDB for their review, and then they will come back to the City Council for a final vote.

793
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:55,457
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's several more opportunities for discussion should any concerns or questions arise, or should, of course, the CDB have any recommendations or changes that they would like to flag for the Council.

794
01:21:58,117 --> 01:22:09,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we adjourn, I just wanted to preview our draft topics for our two committee meetings with Innes Associates in June.

795
01:22:10,847 --> 01:22:16,232
[SPEAKER_10]: We have been having conversations about site plan review other than municipal site plan review.

796
01:22:17,492 --> 01:22:19,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that Innes Associates has been working hard on that.

797
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:35,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we've also been talking about reviewing the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which Innes Associates has begun to do to mine that for those zoning policies that ought to be incorporated into our comprehensive look at the zoning code.

798
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:43,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I think our June 8th meeting would be a good time to touch on both of those topics and drill down a little deeper and make sure that

799
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:57,039
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having a comprehensive update on site plan review, and that we're making sure that everything from the climate action adaptation plan that ought to be incorporated into our work plan is inside of the work plan.

800
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:06,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on our June 22nd committee meeting, this will be our, I believe this will be our final meeting with the zoning team in this committee before the end of the fiscal year.

801
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:08,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we can

802
01:23:09,301 --> 01:23:30,193
[SPEAKER_10]: tie off that milestone by having a last meeting to make sure that any climate-related policies from the comprehensive plan or other ideas from councillors are tied up in a bow in our work plan for our kind of more theme-based approach to the zoning overhaul throughout the summer and into the fall.

803
01:23:31,393 --> 01:23:37,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be site plan review and the cap on the 8th, and then tying off any additional climate-related pieces

804
01:23:38,638 --> 01:23:43,864
[SPEAKER_10]: on the 22nd, and I'm sure that we'll have a couple other, perhaps more minor topics for the 22nd as well.

805
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:54,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Any additional comments, questions from fellow councillors or city staff or things that I neglected to mention?

806
01:23:55,777 --> 01:24:00,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are also bringing the review of the mapping analysis that we will do.

807
01:24:01,823 --> 01:24:12,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start already on the mapping analysis, first bring in the set of studies that we wanted to do, or we recommend to do, and then starting already in the analysis.

808
01:24:13,935 --> 01:24:14,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you so much.

809
01:24:14,996 --> 01:24:16,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we've spoken about that.

810
01:24:18,519 --> 01:24:20,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and Director Hunter.

811
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:27,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I was trying to just check my calendar against the dates you said, and I heard you say June 22nd, which is a Saturday.

812
01:24:27,617 --> 01:24:29,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we just confirm the dates?

813
01:24:30,578 --> 01:24:32,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize if it's all me, but.

814
01:24:33,339 --> 01:24:34,179
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not on you.

815
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:36,459
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually on me.

816
01:24:36,579 --> 01:24:36,959
[SPEAKER_11]: 12th and 26th.

817
01:24:37,799 --> 01:24:39,040
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the 19th.

818
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it previously in my calendar for the 12th.

819
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I may or may not be at a conference that evening.

820
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:49,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a conference in Cambridge.

821
01:24:51,952 --> 01:24:53,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I have 12 and 26 on the.

822
01:24:54,474 --> 01:24:58,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, the Community Development Board will be meeting on the 26th.

823
01:24:58,657 --> 01:25:05,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to move our meeting because the week before that is the 19th, which is Juneteenth, which.

824
01:25:07,683 --> 01:25:14,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if City Hall is closed because Medford schools are going to be, I think Scott's nodding like City Hall is closed.

825
01:25:16,302 --> 01:25:17,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

826
01:25:17,203 --> 01:25:23,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I could say this is the first time you've caught an egregious date error on my part, but it's not.

827
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:33,513
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be site plan review, the cap, a first view of the mapping analysis on June 12th, which is a Wednesday, and then that second committee meeting in June is on the 26th.

828
01:25:33,573 --> 01:25:41,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, just so you're aware that with the Community Development Board, you guys can meet.

829
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:46,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is on the 26th, so it will be a constant because of the 19th.

830
01:25:46,883 --> 01:25:47,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's good to know.

831
01:25:48,684 --> 01:25:49,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

832
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:56,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you so much, Paula and the NS Associates team for all of the prep work for this presentation tonight.

833
01:25:56,769 --> 01:26:04,234
[SPEAKER_10]: It's exciting to get our first batch of changes out to the council where they can be sent to the CBB and then back to us.

834
01:26:05,575 --> 01:26:06,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Our first package of many.

835
01:26:06,936 --> 01:26:12,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any additional comments by my fellow councillors, city staff, or members of the public?

836
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, do I hear a motion?

837
01:26:22,913 --> 01:26:23,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn.

838
01:26:25,035 --> 01:26:26,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Leming.

839
01:26:27,116 --> 01:26:27,437

[SPEAKER_10]: Second by President Bears.

841
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:31,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

842
01:26:39,025 --> 01:26:39,646
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears?

843
01:26:43,509 --> 01:26:44,069

[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Collins?

854
01:27:01,588 --> 01:27:01,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

855
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:03,069
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor?

856
01:27:03,129 --> 01:27:03,729
