Present.

Please rise and salute the flag.

18
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:39,151
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:57,405
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, general law chapter 38, section 18, and the governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place.

26
00:01:55,686 --> 00:02:00,269
All right.

27
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,752
Motion to authorize the resolutions.

28
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:06,714
21021 offered by Councilor Marks.

29
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:18,722
Be it resolved that the state legislator once again vote to allow local cities and towns the ability to waive interest and penalties on late tax payments due to the pandemic.

30
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:19,543
Councilor Marks.

31
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,553
Thank you, Mr. President.

32
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:28,275
I think this was an item that Councilor Knight mentioned a few weeks back during some of our discussion.

33
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:35,157
This is an issue, Mr. President, that deals with this pandemic, in my opinion.

34
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:43,919
This hits to the very heart of trying to assist people that are in tough times right now.

35
00:02:44,859 --> 00:03:00,312
And back, I believe it was almost a year ago that the state legislature voted to allow cities and towns to waive interest and penalties on late property tax payments due to the pandemic.

36
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:07,037
And that relief expired actually in June of last year.

37
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:23,324
And I am asking that we take a vote as a council to ask our state delegation to once again implement this program that allows people that may be a little late on their property tax.

38
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:32,430
to not garner the 15% interest on their property tax payment, Mr. President, and penalties.

39
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:48,400
So I would respectfully ask that we send this to our state delegation, asking that they renew the legislation that allowed cities and towns to waive the interest and penalties on late property tax payments, Mr. President.

40
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,441
Thank you, Councilor Locks.

41
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,758
We have another, Councilor Behrs.

42
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:56,439
Thank you, Mr. President.

43
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:07,482
I fully agree with Councilor Marks' motion, and I'd like to propose a B paper that we get an update from the City Treasurer on on-time and late payments for fiscal year 2021.

44
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:12,524
Treasurer on-time and late payments?

45
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:14,184
Thank you.

46
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:15,105
Yes, yep.

47
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,425
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

48
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:17,285
For 20 and 21?

49
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,881
Yes, 20 and 21 will be fine.

50
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:22,281
Yeah.

51
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:22,381
20 and 21.

52
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,982
Thank you, Councilor Baez.

53
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:25,942
Councilor Knight.

54
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:27,663
Mr. President, thank you very much.

55
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:30,484
I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this paper forward.

56
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:37,947
I believe it was two and a half years ago that this council voted to reduce

57
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:46,391
the interest rate on payments that were in arrears from, I think it was from 18 down to 14 or 15 as Councilor Marks noted.

58
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:56,604
And that was in an effort to assist with individuals that needed some relief, the individuals that weren't able to meet their obligations here underneath these certain times.

59
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:59,528
So with that being said, I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing the paper up.

60
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:08,553
Ultimately, there's a lot of discussion about housing in the community, and a lot's being asked of the residential property owner here in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

61
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:16,377
You know, the community only has so many ways that it can raise money, and residential property taxes shares the brunt of the burden.

62
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:22,260
So anything that we can do to help our residential property owners, I think, would make sense, Mr. President, and I support the matter wholeheartedly.

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,221
Look forward to hearing from our state delegation.

64
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:25,201
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

65
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:28,575
Mr. Navarro has his hand up.

66
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,876
Mr. Navarro, name and address of the record, please.

67
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,698
Thank you for recognizing me, Councilor, President Carabiello.

68
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:40,099
William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

69
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,360
I wanted to say that I strongly support Councilor Barks' resolution.

70
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,563
The tax on real property, of which our only direct tax on land is a component, is a very important tax in our community.

71
00:05:53,483 --> 00:06:02,919
going forward, the city will be asked to make difficult decisions about a Prop 2.5 override about the residential factor, and one can only hope land value taxation.

72
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:16,421
As we prepare to confront these policy decisions in the coming years and decades, the city needs to reaffirm to owners that property tax is not a gotcha that will ruin an owner's life when they are short on cash for a short time.

73
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:29,871
While taxes on lands are needed to fund our city services and to discourage the holding of follow land, there is no good reason that the city needs to rush to penalize owners who find themselves in a rough patch.

74
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:42,782
I would also suggest that once the emergency is over and maybe the Council has a chance to catch its breath, it also look at the tax deferment program available to seniors.

75
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:53,110
The 8% interest rate, I think, is really rather punitive, and I think it would benefit our seniors and our community if that could be reduced to something less insane.

76
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,233
Thankfully, it's not the 15% you mentioned, but I think it doesn't even need to be 8%.

77
00:06:58,114 --> 00:06:59,275
Could it be reduced to 4% or 5%?

78
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:05,843
Because they give people a chance to come up with the money, for example, by selling their house.

79
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,087
Thank you.

80
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,569
I very much support that.

81
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:11,572
Thank you for putting this on, Councilor Marks.

82
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:13,514
Thank you, Mr. Navarro.

83
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,157
Any further questions?

84
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:17,923
Okay, second the motion.

85
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,385
On the motion by Councilor Marks.

86
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:23,968
Seconded by- If I may, Vice President Caviello?

87
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:24,868
Councilor Felke, I'm sorry.

88
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:30,052
If I may, really quick, and I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and supporting it 100%.

89
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,296
On the B paper, are we asking for any specific information, Councilor Behrs?

90
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:35,416
It just says update.

91
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:39,139
Are we looking for a number of properties, total balance?

92
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,921
Is it just, do we want to define this more?

93
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:46,345
I was looking for percentage of payments or percentage of properties that were paying on time.

94
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,399
I'd be happy to entertain other metrics.

95
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,361
Total balance would be good too.

96
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:55,945
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind, if we could just be a little bit more specific.

97
00:07:55,985 --> 00:08:02,851
I just wanna make sure we get back the data that we want and not get something that is convenient for them to pull.

98
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:08,096
So yes, if we could get, let's see.

99
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:11,119
Yeah, if we could just find out the balance, how many properties are late.

100
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:21,481
How many people owe penalties, interest, as much data as possible, but those are some specific things that I could think about.

101
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,303
Are you amending Councilor Beers?

102
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:25,023
Yes, if I may.

103
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:27,565
If Councilor Beers is okay with that.

104
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:28,846
That's fine with me.

105
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:29,926
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

106
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,668
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

107
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:40,973
On the B paper, offered by Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Knight.

108
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:43,355
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

109

Yes.

115

Yes.

117
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:54,366
Councilor Marks.

118
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:55,026
Yes.

119
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:56,007
Councilor Morrell.

120
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:56,927
Yes.

121
00:08:57,448 --> 00:08:58,208
Councilor Scarpelli.

122
00:08:58,228 --> 00:08:58,488
Yes.

Yes.

137
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,840
Councilor Morrell?

138
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:25,660

143
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:32,722
7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

144
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:43,986
2-1-022 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that long-time Memphit police officers William Butz and Robert Kelly be congratulated for their three decades of tremendous service and commitment to the citizens of Memphis.

145
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:44,606
Councilor Marks?

146
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,761
Thank you, Mr. President.

147
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:49,804
What an honor and distinction, Mr. President.

148
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:58,933
These two offices have served this community, the residents of this community, for a combined 66 years.

149
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:05,657
Officer Butts, William Butts, as we know him as Buttsy, we refer to him as.

150
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:09,278
34 years, Mr. President, served this community.

151
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:19,141
You never met a nicer, kinder gentleman, always willing to help his fellow citizens, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

152
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:29,844
And then Officer Robert Kelly, the same thing, served with distinction for a number of years, was always the first to step up in line when something was needed in the community.

153
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:34,066
And he too will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

154
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:36,287
I hope someday we allow

155
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:43,514
our police officers to come back and do details like they do in other communities.

156
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:52,603
And allow them to be part of the community, Mr. President, and bring back the experience they have for a combined 66 years in this community.

157
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:55,927
So someday, I hope to see that come to fruition.

158
00:10:56,727 --> 00:11:14,576
And just one other point, Mr. President, I'd like to make while honoring these two officers, is just recently we all received a call, a reverse 911 call, very serious matter about a woman that was lost within our community on a very cold night, Mr. President.

159
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:25,402
A very dangerous situation, and the way it was handled by Meffitt Police, the number of cars, the number of officers that were on foot, the number of residents that had gone out in the community.

160
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:29,705
I know Councilor Scott Pelley is aware of some firsthand.

161
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:40,832
Honestly, our whole department needs to be congratulated on their fine work, Mr. President, in bringing this woman back to safety.

162
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:48,056
And I just want to personally thank, on behalf of this council, the entire police department, how they handled that situation.

163
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:48,557
Thank you.

164
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,108
Councilor Scott Beally.

165
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:50,889
Thank you.

166
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:53,470
And again, I thank Councilor Mox for bringing this forward.

167
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,691
Officer Kelly for all his dedication.

168
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:57,891
Thank you.

169
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:03,974
Officer Butts, I will tell you that he was a very special officer, I think, in our family.

170
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:10,676
Someone that the old time police officer that made sure he knew the families he was policing.

171
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,678
And getting to know them, getting involved in the church that

172
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:28,166
He worked in there in helping them move the city forward, making sure that everybody felt comfortable, where people aren't afraid of their policemen and feel comfortable going to him.

173
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:32,889
And I could tell you stories where I often remember Officer Butts,

174
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:49,379
being called in with family disturbances, not as a representative of the law, but as a friend that can reach out to a troubled kid and understanding the family dynamics and trying to be the mediator and making sure that everybody

175
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:55,148
handle the situation with cool hand and did the right thing.

176
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:59,996
So I really appreciate everything he's done for Medford and our residents.

177
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,060
And I thank Councilman Mox again.

178
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:03,783
Again, it's

179
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:16,277
When you talk about community, what happened the other evening with the reverse 911, social media, the police officers and fire department.

180
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:22,761
I mean, people just rallying around trying to find this person in need that was walking around.

181
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,923
And I'm going to toot my own daughter's horn that

182
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:34,305
My daughter called me while this was happening, she was out with her friends, and she called to ask permission that dad, they were in the area where they last saw this person.

183
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:40,486
Do I mind if her and her friends would walk the neighborhood to see if they can help?

184
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:48,408
And I think that just wasn't my daughter, but people in general really came out of their homes and instead of walking a daily walk one way, people walked.

185
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:55,671
toward where the missing person was, and I think that, and thank God it turned out to be a happy ending.

186
00:13:55,731 --> 00:14:05,214
So, I thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this forward, and I wish our retiring police officers the best as they move forward, and hopefully our young officers can fill their roles.

187
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:05,815
So, thank you.

188
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,135
Thank you, Councilor Escapoli.

189
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:07,615
Councilor Knight.

190
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:10,637
Mr. President, thank you very much.

191
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:21,106
Building on what Counselor Scott Pelley said, those are two pair of very big shoes to fill if young officers want to fill these shoes.

192
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:27,229
Officer Kelly and Officer Butts have been long time fixtures in our police department for a number of years.

193
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:33,732
Individuals that earn the respect of the community because of their efforts and actions, Mr. President.

194
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:38,314
Not because they wore a badge and a uniform, but because of what they did while wearing that badge and uniform.

195
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,176
I've met Officer Kelly a number of times.

196
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,952
Had the opportunity to develop a decent friendship with Officer Butts over the years.

197
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:53,118
And he's someone that really has quite a great outlook on the way things work, great outlook on life.

198
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,482
And I know that his compatriot, Officer Kelly, shares that same outlook, Mr. President.

199
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:06,548
To have the opportunity to have a professional career in law enforcement and be able to work for over three decades.

200
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:11,309
And at the end of that career, have the opportunity to stand in front of your colleagues and retire.

201
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,291
And safely go home to your family for that last call is something that really deserves to be recognized.

202
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,392
These two officers have put

203
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:31,579
their life on the line for the residents in this community, and that should be recognized.

204
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:37,263
I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this matter forward, and I wish them both the best of luck in their golden years, Mr. President.

205
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:44,028
It's been well deserved, and I hope that they are able to pursue all their dreams and wishes in retirement.

206
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:48,472
Because it's all too often that we hear the statistics of individuals in police and

207
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:52,834
that when they retire, they usually don't retire in good health.

208
00:15:52,914 --> 00:16:02,640
And I understand that both Mr. Kelly and Mr. Butts have a lot of good life left in them and they're going to be able to collect that pension money for a long time and enjoy it and spend it.

209
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,744
So with that being said, Mr. President, I echo my council colleague's sentiments and congratulate them both.

210
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:09,824
Thank you, Councilor.

211
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:10,385
Councilor Falco.

212
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,158
Thank you, President Cavioli.

213
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:19,562
I also want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues and congratulate Officer Botts and Officer Kelly on their retirement.

214
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:24,724
Wish them well in their retirement and good luck and thank them for their service.

215
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:32,048
I mean, when you think about it, three decades in one job is really amazing, especially a job as dangerous as this.

216
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:35,970
And we thank them for their service, their commitment to our community.

217
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:44,217
throughout the years and thank you to our first responders for finding the woman who was missing last week.

218
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:51,564
So thank you to our first responders and congratulations to Officer Butts and Officer Kelly on their retirement.

219
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:52,025
Thank you.

220
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:53,166
Thank you, Council Member.

221
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:54,007
Council Members?

222
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,641
Anything, Councilor Morrell, no?

223
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:06,452
Personally, myself, I want to thank Officer Butts and Officer Kelly, Officer Butts and myself.

224
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:16,602
long time friends, we go back to the early 1970s, and Billy's been a tremendous, a good friend, and a good policeman along with Officer Kelly.

225
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:25,944
They've done, let's see, three decades of work is a lot of time for anybody, and I want to wish them both well in their time there.

226
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:33,626
And I, just on something Councilor Mox said about, you know, the woman going missing the other night,

227
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,631
I know where they're coming from.

228
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:41,516
I had an incident with my mother-in-law on election night last year.

229
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:48,803
She went missing for three hours and the police were standing, combing the streets and looking for her.

230
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:56,991
And at the end of the day, it was Counselor Marks' daughter and a friend who ended up finding my mother-in-law walking the streets.

231
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:57,952
So again,

232
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,674
When a call goes out, the community, we respond.

233
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,216
So again, I want to thank the police and everybody who helped out there.

234
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:07,277
So thank you.

235
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:14,600
Mr. President, if we could send two council accommodations to these very fine offices.

236
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:14,980
Yes.

237
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,460
Thank you.

238
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,321
Okay.

239
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:22,563
On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by second by Councilor Scott Pelley.

240
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:24,524
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

241
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:25,945
Councilor Behrs.

242
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:27,005
Yes.

243
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:28,286
Councilor Falco.

244
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:28,606
Yes.

245
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:29,719
Vice President Knight.

246
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:30,680
Yes.

247
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,220
Councilor Marks.

248
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:31,840
Yes.

249
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:32,801
Councilor Morrell.

250
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:33,681
Yes.

251
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:34,942
Councilor Scarpelli.

252
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:35,322
Yes.

253
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,463
President Caravaglio.

254
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:36,743
Yes.

255
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:37,483
7 in the affirmative.

256
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:38,163
Motion passes.

257
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:44,347
21023 offered by Councilor Marks be it resolved that the deadline discount program be discussed.

258
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:45,027
Councilor Marks.

259
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:47,386
Thank you, Mr. President.

260
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:54,914
This issue was brought up last week by former councilor Bob Penter, who appeared before the council.

261
00:18:56,656 --> 00:19:00,680
He asked that we put it on the agenda, so I sponsored it, Mr. President.

262
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,543
This is a little different than my first resolution.

263
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,765
which would give people the ability to waive interest and penalties if they're late on their property tax.

264
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:19,407
This would actually allow people to get a discount if they pay their property tax ahead of time.

265
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:31,851
I would respectfully ask, Mr. President, that this be laid on the table until our February 2nd meeting, because I am waiting on additional information regarding how this program

266
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:35,333
could potentially work, and some additional information.

267
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,895
So I would ask respectfully that it be laid on the table for two weeks.

268
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:44,059
On the motion by Councilor Marks, it would just be tabled to the 2-2 meeting, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

269
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:45,820
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

270
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:49,302
To table until February 2nd.

271
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,284
The table to the February 2nd meeting.

272
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:53,025
Councilor Behrs?

273
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:54,046
Yes.

274
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:55,487
Councilor Falco?

275
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:55,607
Yes.

276
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,028
Vice President Knight?

277
00:19:57,468 --> 00:19:57,628
Yes.

278
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:58,509
Councilor Marks?

279
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:59,109
Yes.

280
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:00,070
Councilor Morrell?

281
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:00,933
Yes.

282
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:01,954
Councilor Scarpelli?

283
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:02,054
Yes.

284
00:20:02,594 --> 00:20:03,595
President Caravaglio?

285
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:03,935
Yes.

286
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,276
And the affirmative motion passes.

287
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:08,459
2-1-0-2 fair offered by Councilor Falco.

288
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:22,969
Be it resolved that President Caravaglio schedule a committee of the whole pre-budget meetings with the various City of Medford department heads to discuss the current budget in the fiscal year 2022 budget and answer any questions, answer any

289
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,391
If the department has related questions, Councilor Falco.

290
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:27,552
Thank you, Mr. President.

291
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:34,901
One of the most important responsibilities we have each year is to review and either pass or reject the city budget.

292
00:20:35,773 --> 00:20:42,218
You know, tonight I offer this resolution to shed light on a process that I think is somewhat flawed.

293
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:53,067
You know, every year we meet in June with the city of Medford department heads to discuss their budget and discuss the proposed budget for the upcoming year.

294
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:58,952
More often than not, it's our only formal meeting that we have with department heads throughout the year.

295
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:02,575
And I think more often than not,

296
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:08,745
Those meetings become more, we're asking questions probably that are more than just budget related questions.

297
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,726
Sometimes they're policy questions and whatnot.

298
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:31,274
So this here tonight is basically a proactive approach that I'm asking President Carbiello if in the upcoming months of February, March, April, and May, if you could schedule pre-budget hearings with each of our department heads to go over their current budget,

299
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,203
To take a look at the goals and objectives to see if they're accomplishing

300
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:46,654
what they've said that their goals and objectives are for this current year.

301
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:56,299
So basically, it's a proactive approach, and it gives us an opportunity to ask department heads questions that sometimes aren't even budget related.

302
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,802
So it's to hopefully streamline the budget process when we discuss the budget in June.

303
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:08,706
So I think that we have to pass this budget, or actually pass or reject this budget each year.

304
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:20,325
This is really large, and we need to make sure that we have all the information that we need to make that decision.

305
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:26,130
And I think meeting with department heads more than once a year is something that we should be doing.

306
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,422
Me meeting them once a year to have a quick budget meeting in June, to me, doesn't cut it.

307
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:39,886
So I think that what we need to do is budget meetings so we can actually have a nice conversation that is full of information.

308
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:44,328
And if there's items that we need to follow up on or they need to follow up on, that's fine.

309
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:46,949
We're not doing it last minute in June.

310
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:53,772
So therefore, I would ask if you could please schedule budget meetings, maybe two or three a month.

311
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:58,693
Starting in February would be ideal.

312
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:06,255
So I would respectfully ask for my colleagues to support this and I move approval.

313
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:06,995
Thank you.

314
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:07,595
Thank you.

315
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:08,675
Councilor Scott Pele.

316
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,316
Thank you Councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

317
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:16,377
I think that one thing we saw as school committee members was the difficulty during budget time and that's one thing.

318
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:37,203
is one thing that we changed in the city school committee is having the pre-budget meetings where department heads came to us and it was so informative that each department or at the time principal came in from each school and gave us their wish list to understand what their greatest needs were.

319
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,404
And what we realized

320
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:45,957
We were lacking legally in some positions, making sure that we fulfilled our legal requirements as school committee members.

321
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:58,583
And I think that what this does, I think that it's time consuming, but at the same time, it eliminates the fluff that goes on during the regular budget meeting to get right to the point and understand where we are.

322
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:29,198
If Councilor Falco will let me amend this paper, I'd like to amend this paper and asking that when we do the pre-budget meetings, as long as we're out of the red, I'm hoping that the department heads themselves, being that the chamber alone can hold 200 people, that if we call two or three departments, that there's enough room and space that these department heads can come in person and stand at the podium.

323
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:38,225
And without any interruption and go through these very important items that are going to be in front of us.

324
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:42,228
So if we could, I'd like to get that approval.

325
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:52,937
And that is a council wish that that be mandated, that that happens as long as we are out of the red.

326
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:54,778
So thank you, Councilor Falco.

327
00:24:54,838 --> 00:24:56,440
I appreciate the time.

328
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,500
Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

329
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:57,981
Councilor Mox.

330
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:11,137
Thank you, Mr. President, and like Councilor Falco mentioned, I remember those days where we used to get the budget 24 hours before we were asked to vote on it.

331
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:24,247
And as you know, it's a couple hundred page document that's very involved, and there's no way you can do your due diligence on behalf of the taxpayers of the community without having these pre-budgeted meetings.

332
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,550
It was last year that Councilor Falco

333
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,172
I think for the first time in a long time, asked that we meet in, I think it was February or March.

334
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:42,094
And then we had COVID hit in March, and naturally that put a kind of a damper on the pre-budget meetings and pushed them down the line a little bit.

335
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:46,476
But that is a magnificent idea, getting ahead of time.

336
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:53,458
This way we can discuss, as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, about using other tools in our tool belt.

337
00:25:54,358 --> 00:26:10,477
So if we do have a new system that we got an email today regarding C-Click Fix that the administration's been working on, use C-Click Fix to find out what the needs are in the community and base your budget on facts that are coming from C-Click Fix.

338
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:21,007
So these are the things that we can use during the budget process, which have never, to be quite frank, have never been used in the past to make an informed decision.

339
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:34,160
And by starting early, it'll give us the ability to sit down, not under a time clock that's ticking, ticking, ticking, but be able to sit down and methodically go through the budget and ask the questions on behalf of the communities.

340
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:42,482
the community so we can provide the services that they've come accustomed to, Mr. President, and enhance our services at the same time.

341
00:26:42,522 --> 00:26:46,282
So I want to thank Councilor Falco for his leadership on this.

342
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,563
We've made several changes to the budget.

343
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:55,884
I think, again, one of them was Councilor Falco's request to add the year over year and the projection and so forth.

344
00:26:56,204 --> 00:26:58,885
And that way you're not just looking at a budget line item.

345
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:06,052
We can compare it to previous years and what's budgeted, and that's been a very helpful tool as one member of the council.

346
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,796
And I want to thank Councilor Falco for his input on this.

347
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:10,777
Thank you.

348
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:11,698
Councilor Bez.

349
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,681
Thank you, Mister President.

350
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:17,383
And thank you, Councilor Falco, for proposing this.

351
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:22,327
I wholeheartedly agree with having these pre-budget meetings.

352
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:29,953
And I think hopefully, similar to what Councilor March just said, we can really use these to start setting goals of what

353
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:42,240
services and the level of staffing are needed for our various city departments and our school department and how each budget is helping us get there and what the gaps are.

354
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,704
That's really something I've been talking about since day one on the council for myself is we need to assess need and understand

355
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:52,497
what the community actually needs with services.

356
00:27:53,537 --> 00:28:14,265
One of the major issues with city finance and municipal finance in Massachusetts, as everyone knows, is that Proposition 2.5 limits revenue growth to 2.5% a year, while our costs and our fixed costs are going up much more than 2.5% a year, which means that the amount of money we have to provide city services goes down or is crowded out by these fixed costs.

357
00:28:15,305 --> 00:28:34,614
So figuring out how we can stop having departments that are trying to do too much with too few staff, setting goals for what that department staffing should look like, and then seeing every year how each fiscal year's budget can help us achieve that goal, I think is very important undertaking that we as a council can do.

358
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,655
And I would also ask just

359
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,401
to councilor Scott Kelly's amendment.

360
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:49,247
You know, if there are department heads who may not want to attend in person, as long as you know, just that they have the discretion to make that decision, if that's all right, councilor Scott Kelly.

361
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:52,949
Isn't everyone going to be vaccinated by then?

362
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:57,752
The option?

363
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:05,756
Yeah, just if, you know, if there may be a department head who might, an option to come in person, but if they want to come by digital means.

364
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:13,920
Again, I think that it's under their privy, but I'd welcome them in person.

365
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,162
I know that if people have some underlying issues that they're afraid of, I can understand that.

366
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:23,043
But truly, I'd like to see everybody here that can make it here in person.

367
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,004
I think it'd be important.

368
00:29:24,384 --> 00:29:29,626
This is a big budget, and really having that personal touch and the personal involvement.

369
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:35,428
And again, I said, if it's making sure that we're out of the red, that's when I would support that.

370
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:36,328
So I appreciate it.

371
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:38,827
Thank you, Councilor Fevella.

372
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:39,567
Councilor Knight.

373
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:41,328
Mr. President, thank you very much.

374
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:46,652
I was saying, I think that this was something that we asked Councilor Falco to do last term.

375
00:29:47,673 --> 00:30:00,142
But then with the pandemic and everybody wanting to work from home continuously still to this day, makes it a little bit difficult sometimes to get everybody in the same room, Mr. President.

376
00:30:01,063 --> 00:30:03,885
But I really think it's important that we look at this.

377
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:07,047
And for the last several years, this has been a discussion and a topic at this council.

378
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:18,616
The format and presentation of the budget, what's required by the administration per law versus what's requested of the administration by the council so that we can make informed decisions.

379
00:30:19,437 --> 00:30:22,099
And I think one of the most important things that we need to do.

380
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,481
is to make data-driven decisions, Mr. President.

381
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:37,085
And that goes right into what Councilor March was saying about utilizing the 311 of the see, click, fix information that we have at hand to see where our needs are and doing this needs assessment and looking at service delivery.

382
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:45,289
We could talk all day about why the diversity director shouldn't be merged with the HR director and eliminated.

383
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:48,911
But at the end of the day, the services that the people in this community want to see is their streets paved.

384
00:30:49,686 --> 00:30:54,629
They want to be able to pick up the phone and call the DPW and get a tree taken down and not have a stump there for the next 11 years.

385
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,391
And then when the stump comes down, they want to make sure the sidewalk gets fixed.

386
00:30:57,411 --> 00:31:00,133
They don't have to wait another five years for that, so it's not a 25 year plan.

387
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,615
That's what the people want to see in this community, Mr. President.

388
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:06,937
They want to see services delivered and they want to see a return on their investment of their tax dollars.

389
00:31:07,838 --> 00:31:10,059
So I think it's very important that we start talking about this.

390
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:18,405
And I personally feel as though the most vital department that we need to start this conversation with is with our public works department.

391
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,846
Everybody wants to pick up the phone and be able to call the DPW and get a result.

392
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,166
And right now, you can't get that.

393
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:26,687
You get put on a list and it takes a year or two or three years.

394
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:30,347
For 11, 12 months now, we've heard about a pavement management plan.

395
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:32,028
I'm still dying to see what that looks like.

396
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:37,669
I'm very excited to see what this pavement management plan looks like because we have about $7.5 million in 2016 money worth of emergency arteries.

397
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:48,156
that could be replaced tomorrow, because the condition of our roadways is subpar, Mr. President.

398
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:52,040
So there's a lot of work that needs to be done, but it all comes down to the mighty buck, the mighty dollar.

399
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:58,107
And unless we're all sitting in the same room, working together towards a common goal, we're never going to get there.

400
00:31:58,846 --> 00:31:59,567
We're never going to get there.

401
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:02,289
So with that being said, I think council marks bringing this matter forward.

402
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:02,830
I support them.

403
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,932
I mean, I constantly Falco for bringing the matter forward.

404
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:13,079
I support this resolution wholeheartedly and I look forward to working with you, Mr. President, to put a schedule together for us to conduct these pre-budget hearings.

405
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:14,120
Thank you.

406
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,861
Councilor Morrell.

407
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:16,442
Thank you, Mr. President.

408
00:32:16,462 --> 00:32:20,285
I have to say what hasn't already been said, but I want to thank councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

409
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:20,766
I think

410
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,582
this approach and starting as soon as possible, we'll really address some of the issues that came up in our committee of the whole prior to this.

411
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:42,846
Rather than asking these questions seven months after a budget has been passed, we can ask them many months before and be able to make much more educated decisions when it comes to budget time so that we're not having these conversations after the fact and wondering

412
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:47,088
to make a decision.

413
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:50,349
And I was also going to say what councilor bears brought forth.

414
00:32:50,389 --> 00:33:04,015
Just making and I think councilor Scarpelli for noting, you know, making sure we're out of the red, but just, you know, that the language is clear that if department heads do not feel comfortable attending in person, that they know that it's not something that is mandatory.

415
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:05,655
It's encouraged, but it's not mandatory.

416
00:33:05,675 --> 00:33:08,217
So I just want to make sure that that is clear.

417
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:08,857
So thank you.

418
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,093
Thank you, Counselor.

419
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,534
On that point, Mr. President, I disagree.

420
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:12,575
I really disagree.

421
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:13,575
It should be mandatory.

422
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:14,076
Counselor Knight.

423
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:14,916
I disagree.

424
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:19,399
It should be mandatory that they come and appear before this body if they're going to be talking about how we're spending taxpayer dollars.

425
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:25,383
As long as we can do it safely and within the guidelines that have been put out by the CDC and the Board of Health, we should have our department heads in here.

426
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,305
It's going to be seven city councils, the city clerk, and one other individual.

427
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:31,206
We could find a room big enough to fit all those people in here if need be.

428
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:33,848
We have the personal protective equipment available.

429
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:34,408
We put up these

430
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,031
Sneeze gods, I guess you want to call them, Mr. President.

431
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:40,592
But I disagree, you know what I mean?

432
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:43,954
I think that we can do this, and we can do it safely, and we can do it in one place.

433
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,715
The department heads are coming to work every day.

434
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:47,736
This is part of their job.

435
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,596
This is part of their work.

436
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:51,538
And they should be willing to meet with us as a body.

437
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:56,102
So with that being said, it's neither here nor there.

438
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,283
I want to get the meeting started.

439
00:33:57,343 --> 00:33:59,285
It's not going to be something that's going to affect my vote this evening.

440
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:01,167
But I disagree.

441
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,489
I think that we've got to roll our sleeves up.

442
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:10,175
When we're talking about something as serious as the finances in this community, how we're spending taxpayer dollars, we should all be in the same room doing it.

443
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:12,777
Thank you, Councilor.

444
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,478
Mr. President, if I could.

445
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:15,159
Councilor Morrell.

446
00:34:16,745 --> 00:34:22,949
I don't want to go down this road once more, but taxpayer dollars also go to community health, which is a decision based on that.

447
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,891
And that's where I stand.

448
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:25,251
Thank you.

449
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:26,692
Thank you, Council Member Rowe.

450
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:28,828
Any further discussion on this?

451
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:29,328
Move approval.

452
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:33,612
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Night.

453
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:38,275
I'm sorry, by Councilor Mox, as amended by Councilor Scott Paoli.

454
00:34:38,555 --> 00:34:39,976
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

455
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:40,617
Mr. President.

456
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:42,779
I amend it as well, Mr. President.

457
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:46,702
Okay, as amended by Councilor Scott Paoli and Councilor Baird.

458
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:48,416
Mr. President.

459
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:49,656
Councilor Marks.

460
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:51,498
Thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:54,680
Just if I can add, the pre-budget meetings are great.

462
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:59,604
I would also add that we have our council priority list again.

463
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:07,230
I know we did one last year, in the previous year, but times have changed, things have changed, administrations have changed.

464
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:19,522
And I think it's important, Mr. President, that prior to going to a pre-budget meeting, that the council get together and deliberate on what we feel are council priorities, Mr. President.

465
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,984
And I would ask that you include that.

466
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:26,226
prior to the pre-budget meeting so we can have those discussions.

467
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:32,769
And maybe members can start jotting their issues of priorities right now so we can get together.

468
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:45,393
And I think it's healthy to have the discussion, healthy to have the maybe disagreements, and move forward what we feel is a council priority on behalf of the community, Mr. President.

469
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:49,135
So I would ask that that be part of the pre-budget deliberations as well.

470
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:49,595
Thank you.

471
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,878
Councilor Baez, could you please repeat your amendment for the clerk, he didn't get it?

472
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:53,919
Yes.

473
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:58,243
My amendment was just that in-person attendance would be at the discretion of the individual employee.

474
00:35:59,044 --> 00:36:00,065
Thank you, Councilor Baez.

475
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:08,233
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Mox, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, and amended by Councilor Baez.

476
00:36:08,273 --> 00:36:09,435
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

477
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:20,561
And I amended Mr. President for the Council priority.

478
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:21,541
Council priority.

479
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:22,402
Who seconded the motion?

480
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:24,303
Council Marks seconded the motion.

481
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:24,683
Okay.

482
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:31,546
As for approval as amended.

483
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:32,707
Council Bears?

484
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:33,887
Yes.

485
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:35,168
Councilor Falco?

486
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:35,648
Yes.

487
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:37,389
Vice President Knight?

488
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:37,889
Yes.

489
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,190
Councilor Marks?

490
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:39,910
Yes.

491
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:41,011
Councilor Morrell?

492
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:42,011
Yes.

493
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:43,132
Councilor Scarpelli?

494
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:43,252
Yes.

495
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:46,424
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

496
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:49,266
2-1-0-2-5, offered by Councilor Falco.

497
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:57,454
Be it resolved that the City Administration provide an update to the Memphis City Council with regards to the C-Click fix system.

498
00:36:57,594 --> 00:36:58,475
Councilor Falco.

499
00:37:00,393 --> 00:37:01,413
Thank you, President Caviello.

500
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:06,556
Recently, I received calls from residents regarding the C-Click Fix program.

501
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:23,964
For many people that might not know, that's a program that we use to basically, the residents can enter into any type of issues that they're having, and then they're assigned to the appropriate department head where hopefully they can be resolved in a timely fashion.

502
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:26,565
Recently, I was notified that

503
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:35,193
The issues that were logged by a number of residents were basically cleared out and deleted.

504
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:40,715
So they no longer appear on the list of outstanding issues.

505
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:44,218
And from what I'm hearing, this is the second time that this has happened.

506
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:50,222
I think when the previous administration crossed over to the current administration, they cleared out C-Click Fix.

507
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:57,507
And then when recently, I think they may have an upgrade or something, and they did the same thing, they cleared out issues again.

508
00:37:58,248 --> 00:38:04,333
So what they're doing is basically they're clearing out issues that have never been resolved.

509
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:09,217
And I think one of the reasons why it was closed was because it was a seasonal issue.

510
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:12,600
It may be an issue that couldn't be dealt with because the weather was getting cold.

511
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:17,724
But from my opinion, that doesn't mean that the issue's gone away.

512
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:25,231
And I think that's what's happening now is we're losing, there's really no transparency when something like this happens.

513
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:29,195
Because if you're just deleting issues because maybe you can't

514
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,012
take care of them in the wintertime, that doesn't mean that the issue's gone away.

515
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:37,213
That means the issue still exists, it should still be in the list.

516
00:38:38,594 --> 00:38:48,158
And then what happens is they get this email back saying that it's a seasonal issue, and then they ask the person, I believe, if it's been resolved.

517
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:56,922
As far as I'm concerned, that's the city's responsibility, is whether or not an issue's been resolved, because the ticket's been assigned to someone in the city.

518
00:38:58,926 --> 00:39:04,927
So if we could please get an update from the city administration as to what's going on with CClickFix.

519
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:08,208
If issues are being deleted, why?

520
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:13,989
I think as chief of staff, Roderick is still on the call here?

521
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,530
Dave, you still on the call?

522
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:26,071
I know we got something from the mayor late this afternoon and I didn't have a chance to read it myself.

523
00:39:26,512 --> 00:39:28,272
I don't know if Dave is still on the call here.

524
00:39:30,178 --> 00:39:31,099
Mr. Rodriguez, are you here?

525
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:33,461
Obviously he's not.

526
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:37,205
On the motion by Councilor Falco.

527
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:39,948
Mr. President, I think I might have it here in front of me if you want me to read it.

528
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:41,709
Councilor Knight has it in front of him.

529
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,091
I think, I'm looking for it.

530
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,072
See, click, fix.

531
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,855
Councilor Knight, if you wouldn't mind, what time did that email come in at?

532
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:50,238
I believe it came in at 10 past 1 today, January 19th.

533
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:50,778
And what it says is,

534
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:59,633
Dear President Caviello and Councillors, I wanted to reach out and give you an update on C-Click Fix.

535
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:08,938
Over the last several months, Lisa and Daria have been getting trained on the system we had in place and have been working to update our system by meeting with department heads and City Hall staff.

536
00:40:10,038 --> 00:40:13,340
They have customized it to fit Medford and our needs.

537
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,782
Trainings have started and we will continue throughout the next 30 days.

538
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:25,643
I actually received a training today and then a pothole email request came in and I was able to log it through C-Click Fix quite easily.

539
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:30,384
We plan to publicly launch the newly updated system in February.

540
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:36,365
Our hope is that all city-related requests can be logged in through C-Click Fix and we ask that you use it as well.

541
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:40,026
Daria and Lisa can meet with you anytime to train you.

542
00:40:40,426 --> 00:40:43,467
I have CC'd them both so you can easily set up an appointment.

543
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:43,987
Brianna.

544
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,141
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

545
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:56,788
If I may, if I could also amend my resolution to find out what it means when they say fit method and our needs.

546
00:40:58,229 --> 00:41:01,772
So I guess C-Click Fix needs to work differently in Medford than it does anywhere else.

547
00:41:02,072 --> 00:41:04,935
So I would like to know if they could please specify what that means.

548
00:41:07,397 --> 00:41:14,223
Because I think there's a lot of uncertainty right now as to C-Click Fix, how it's managed,

549
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:22,398
how it operates, when you're deleting issues that haven't been resolved, I have a problem with that.

550
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,360
Basically, you're saying the issue doesn't exist anymore when it does.

551
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:26,761
Thank you.

552
00:41:28,624 --> 00:41:29,926
Councilor Layton, would you like to speak again?

553
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:32,388
Mr. President, I just want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up.

554
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:37,855
C-Click fix has been a, I guess we'll call it a bee in my bonnet for quite a bit of time.

555
00:41:38,155 --> 00:41:46,485
Ever since it's been rolled out, I've requested a lot of data because I'd like to make those data driven decisions when it comes down to what our needs are.

556
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:55,842
And for some reason, the information that gets put into see click fix always seem to be, you know, the fruit from the poisonous tree that no one was ever allowed to touch.

557
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:57,343
And if we ever saw it, you know what I mean?

558
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:59,424
We'd have to sign on old, the secrecy or something.

559
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:12,174
So I thank councilor Falco for bringing this up and I welcome the opportunity to sit down and see where we are with the open requests, the requests that remain outstanding and the requests that have also been addressed.

560
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:12,815
Mr. President.

561
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:13,295
I know,

562
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:22,185
Some of the concerns that have been raised over time, like Councillor Marks would always say, that's not a city road, so it's not our problem.

563
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:23,245
Call your state delegation.

564
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:26,227
Well, that's not giving a taxpayer a service.

565
00:42:26,988 --> 00:42:33,411
So, you know, I think Councillor Falco hit the nail on the head when we talked about the see, click, fix system and ways that we can improve it.

566
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,492
It's something that we all want to see be successful here.

567
00:42:35,773 --> 00:42:38,074
And I think we all have opinions on how it could work.

568
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:41,556
So I welcome the opportunity to meet with the administration and talk with them a little bit about

569
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:43,799
our vision for how this all works.

570
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:50,671
It wasn't too long ago that Mayor Lungo sat right here and she expressed some of the same concerns that we're expressing right now.

571
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:51,712
So I look forward to this meeting.

572
00:42:52,534 --> 00:42:52,894
Thank you.

573
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:53,836
Councilor Marks.

574
00:42:54,912 --> 00:42:59,233
Thank you, Mr. President, and I am thankful for Councilor Falco putting this on.

575
00:43:00,073 --> 00:43:14,976
But I also want to be mindful, Mr. President, that the intent of C-Click Fix was to supposedly have one-stop shopping, where you would go online and fill out a form and immediately someone would get back to you addressing your concern.

576
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:18,237
And that has failed over the last two years.

577
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:31,009
And I can personally account for that because the number of calls I receive on basic city services has gone up dramatically because of the fact that people don't have any confidence in see, click, fix.

578
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:37,816
I would just state also, Mr. President, and I look forward to being trained on whatever system I have to be trained.

579
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:41,699
But until I find out that this system is properly working,

580
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:49,007
I'm not going to use it as a form or a method of communication with the department heads or the city administration.

581
00:43:49,408 --> 00:44:00,619
When someone reaches out to me, Mr. President, I can't tell them, I got to wait four weeks to get an answer, or the answer is I passed it off to another department head and then it was closed out.

582
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:06,689
So in order for me to use the system, Mr. President, I have to make sure it gets results.

583
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:12,277
And I'm going to wait until it's results based before I start using it, Mr. President.

584
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:16,344
But I am thankful that the city administration saw fit to

585
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:20,826
I'd like to know what updates were changed.

586
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:23,648
That system is pretty basic to me.

587
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:24,548
I've been on it.

588
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:35,875
I'm not sure how you can change it other than behind the scenes to make sure the people that should be getting back to people get back in a timely fashion and close out items and follow through on items.

589
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,917
So for that aspect, I hope that is being done.

590
00:44:40,298 --> 00:44:43,904
in addition to just updating the system itself, Mr. President.

591
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:45,467
The system doesn't do the work.

592
00:44:45,888 --> 00:44:50,837
It's the actual people behind the system that do the work and make sure residents get results.

593
00:44:51,118 --> 00:44:51,419
Thank you.

594
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:53,992
Thank you, Councilor.

595
00:44:54,012 --> 00:44:54,693
Councilor Scarpelli.

596
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:56,794
Thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing this forward.

597
00:44:56,834 --> 00:45:12,242
And to echo what Councilor Marks was saying, I was probably the only elected official at the time that actually lived as an employee of a municipality, the 311 C-Click-Fix background.

598
00:45:12,262 --> 00:45:22,068
And one thing we talked about at the time, it was very clear during my election process that how difficult this will be because we don't have the infrastructure in place

599
00:45:22,808 --> 00:45:25,849
to handle the volume that was going to come in.

600
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:26,830
And this is what we're seeing.

601
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,071
And we still see it.

602
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:34,474
And until we fix that, I don't think it's going to be possible to have a successful system in place.

603
00:45:34,974 --> 00:45:47,760
Now, to share with the community and say that this is a data-driven program so we can make educated decisions when it comes to our fiscal responsibility, when it comes to adding DPW workers,

604
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:53,768
To add more policemen, to add fire, to add teachers, to look at what we need, where we have the most concerns.

605
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:56,532
That was a viable understanding of it.

606
00:45:57,113 --> 00:46:03,822
But to think that C-Clicks fixes what other communities use the 311, it's very difficult to come to fruition in this community.

607
00:46:04,563 --> 00:46:05,424
It's very difficult.

608
00:46:05,464 --> 00:46:23,639
When you're asking for an issue that goes for C-Click fix, and then goes to a person that's in charge of that, then goes to the department head, but then the department head gives it to their employees to make sure that project gets done.

609
00:46:24,379 --> 00:46:25,640
It's virtually impossible.

610
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:26,801
Look at the parks department.

611
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:30,785
Issue comes in at three C-Clicks fix for a certain park.

612
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:39,205
Mike Nestor and his two employees, it's in the middle of the summer, is getting all six fields ready for baseball.

613
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:44,430
Four fields ready for baseball, but then they have to answer to a C-Clicks fix call.

614
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:55,858
It's very difficult to do, not to say that it can't be done, but this is something when we get to budget time, we also have to look at making sure that if we understand what we want for our C-Click fix.

615
00:46:56,768 --> 00:47:05,392
It could be run in a proper and transparent way that you're going to get the answer back.

616
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:15,776
Listen, like Councilor Falco said, I'd rather, instead of just closing those and putting them aside, having someone from the administration contact them, contact citizens and say, this is the concern.

617
00:47:16,636 --> 00:47:21,019
We are, unfortunately, we can't get to it, but at least that's the communication people are looking for.

618
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,601
So I thank you for bringing this forward.

619
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:33,909
I actually thought that Council Marks was everybody's C-Clicks fix, because as many resolutions you put on this year with sidewalks and street repairs.

620
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:39,093
And again, I too, as a city councilor and a resident,

621
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:58,518
I'm going to do my due diligence to go right to the department heads to make sure that they can help us because we need to get some issues that especially safety concerns taken care of and going through the process might not be the quickest way right now because it is in such flux.

622
00:47:58,578 --> 00:48:00,860
So thank you for bringing this forward, Councilor Falcone.

623
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:01,561
Thank you.

624
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:02,302
Thank you.

625
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:07,674
On the motion by Councilor Falco.

626
00:48:07,934 --> 00:48:08,914
Thank you, President Caviello.

627
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:12,595
I just want to thank all my colleagues for their support on this here.

628
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:19,976
And Councilor Knight mentioned, I think, an important part about data-driven decision-making.

629
00:48:20,256 --> 00:48:29,558
And if you don't have the systems in place to give you that data, the decisions aren't going to be, you're really not going to be able to use it as a tool.

630
00:48:29,938 --> 00:48:32,520
And you're right, Councilor Mox mentioned it before about using it as a tool.

631
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:34,903
It's important to have that tool available.

632
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:37,085
And Councilor Scarpelli, you hit it on the head.

633
00:48:37,645 --> 00:48:42,790
With regard to resources, if it's not managed properly, it's not going to help anyone.

634
00:48:44,461 --> 00:48:53,190
So if you wouldn't mind, if we could also schedule committee the whole with the administration to actually, if it's training fine, but to learn more about the new system, that would be great.

635
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,812
And to find out what we can get out of it.

636
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:58,696
It would be nice to know if there's any type of reporting that we can get out of this system.

637
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:02,139
I know when we first went to see quick fix, I asked about that.

638
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:05,323
They said there was nothing, which I find hard to believe, but I would hope.

639
00:49:06,052 --> 00:49:18,480
Well, I would think that there should be some sort of reporting that we can access to see what's being done, what's not being done, what's being resolved, what we can use, how we can look at the data, what type of calls are coming in.

640
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:28,026
And it'll really help with the budget process at the end of the year when we take a look at that and see all the work that's been done.

641
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:29,868
I know there's work that's getting done.

642
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:39,795
But I also know that it needs to be managed correctly and if we're just closing tickets for the sake of closing tickets, it's not very transparent and it doesn't mean that the issue goes away.

643
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:44,312
Thank you everyone for your support, and I move approval.

644
00:49:44,612 --> 00:49:44,932
Thank you.

645
00:49:45,212 --> 00:49:46,733
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

646
00:49:46,833 --> 00:50:00,000
So Councilor Falco, on top of your amendment for the mayor to explain her memo of today, you also want to schedule a Council of the Whole meeting to discuss the C-Click fix in general, correct?

647
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:00,480
Yes, please.

648
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:02,041
Thank you.

649
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:05,723
Okay, excuse me.

650
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:10,366
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Inouye, any further discussion?

651
00:50:11,682 --> 00:50:14,224
Okay, Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

652
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:16,906
Councilor Behrs?

653
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:18,067
Yes.

654
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,328
Councilor Falco?

655
00:50:19,888 --> 00:50:20,089
Yes.

656
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:21,590
Vice President Hite?

657
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:22,470
Yes.

658
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:23,471
Councilor Marks?

659
00:50:23,932 --> 00:50:24,292
Yes.

660
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:25,513
Councilor Morrell?

661
00:50:26,903 --> 00:50:27,563
Councilor Scarpelli?

662
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:27,643
Yes.

663
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:29,164
President Caravaglio?

664
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:30,926
Yes, I move the affirmative motion passes.

665
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:42,133
21026, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council meet in the Committee of the Whole with Republic Parking to receive a financial update and to answer any parking related questions.

666
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:43,354
Councilor Falco?

667
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:45,935
Thank you, President Caravaglio.

668
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:47,797
This is a pretty simple resolution.

669
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:55,302
It's basically to have Committee of the Whole meeting to receive an update from Republic Parking with regard to the parking program.

670
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,451
and have them answer.

671
00:50:58,651 --> 00:51:06,675
any questions that we have, but also to provide a financial update with regard to the program to basically see what kind of money's coming in.

672
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:20,183
And I think it might be best, um, you know, basically maybe if people, maybe if the counselors could send you questions and maybe you could forward them to, uh, before you schedule the meeting so they can come prepared to the meeting.

673
00:51:20,263 --> 00:51:25,506
But it'd be nice to get a nice, uh, receive a financial update from Republic parking.

674
00:51:25,606 --> 00:51:27,367
I think we usually have one once a year with them.

675
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:27,807
So I think,

676
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:30,171
I think we have one last chance.

677
00:51:30,732 --> 00:51:31,393
Councilor Morrell.

678
00:51:32,115 --> 00:51:32,836
Thank you, Mr. President.

679
00:51:33,237 --> 00:51:34,059
Thanks to Councilor

680
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:52,068
If I could amend the paper to also invite the reps from the Parking and Policy Enforcement Commission that's been working these past few months, doing a lot of research on parking in Medford, and I think would have some intel and also questions just from their meetings over the many months, if they could be invited as well.

681
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,729
And who's that, Council Member?

682
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:58,971
The chairs from the Parking Policy Enforcement Commission.

683
00:51:59,251 --> 00:52:00,812
One information, Mr. President.

684
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:01,632
Who's the chairman of that?

685
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,080
Jim Silva.

686
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:05,722
Yes, Jim Silva.

687
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:06,903
Point of information, Mr. President.

688
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,364
Point of information, Councilor Scott Pelli.

689
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:17,930
Correct me if I'm wrong, I thought that the commission, when given that question about where we stood with Park-Method, they told us that

690
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,634
It didn't fall within the privy with Park Medford there.

691
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:27,579
Their discussions led to that area.

692
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:28,359
Was I mistaken?

693
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,003
Or if any of my counselors can remember that.

694
00:52:32,764 --> 00:52:34,365
I do believe that the chair

695
00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:44,952
The co-chairs expressed that the purview of their analysis did not extend to paid for park.

696
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:45,713
Okay.

697
00:52:45,953 --> 00:52:49,835
So it was not extending to the business districts or to the parking meter situation.

698
00:52:50,035 --> 00:52:50,235
Okay.

699
00:52:50,255 --> 00:52:50,576
Thank you.

700
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:53,517
Thank you.

701
00:52:54,298 --> 00:52:56,859
It's Jim Silva and Laurel Ruma.

702
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:04,223
It's up to them if they want to attend or not, but just because they have, they've been receiving a lot of questions from residents over the past few months as well.

703
00:53:04,243 --> 00:53:05,084
So they may just have,

704
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,144
information that is helpful at a meeting like this as far as questions.

705
00:53:14,386 --> 00:53:20,550
President, I'm not opposed to people attending meetings, but I think what the council is asking for is a financial update.

706
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:31,176
And I'm not sure how this established working group is going to be able to add any insight into a financial update from another entity.

707
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:38,500
And they have enough meetings, as Councilor Morrell would probably attest to, already and enough on their plate.

708
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,302
I'm not sure what good it would be to have them at the meeting.

709
00:53:43,062 --> 00:53:45,184
Again, I'm not opposed to people coming to the meeting.

710
00:53:46,505 --> 00:53:49,367
They're two completely different entities.

711
00:53:49,507 --> 00:53:53,190
So I'm not quite sure.

712
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:58,974
I'm just responding to how this resolution is worded and to answer any parking related questions.

713
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:01,476
I'm happy to, I can withdraw the amendment.

714
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:04,238
I can just reach out to Jim and Laura myself and give them the heads up.

715
00:54:08,986 --> 00:54:11,168
If you want to keep the amendment on there, we'll keep the amendment on there.

716
00:54:12,288 --> 00:54:13,029
Makes no difference to me.

717
00:54:14,229 --> 00:54:25,716
Point of information, they can be ready to come, but I think the parking related questions that they're going to be ready to answer is why aren't you focusing on this when this sounds like a bigger need in the community than what you're looking at?

718
00:54:26,036 --> 00:54:30,059
That's my concern, but I just don't want to lose focus of the meeting.

719
00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:34,922
My intention was, as Councilor Falcone referenced and as of this reference,

720
00:54:36,695 --> 00:54:39,097
They worked on a survey to hear from residents.

721
00:54:39,137 --> 00:54:40,458
They have questions from residents.

722
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:48,283
I'm just saying they may have a number of questions from residents that they can share as opposed to sourcing more, but I'm not trying to get into the weeds on this.

723
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:51,070
Thank you.

724
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:51,811
Councilor Falco.

725
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:54,632
My goal is to make it, you know, financial update.

726
00:54:54,652 --> 00:54:54,933
Yes.

727
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:57,594
And I put answer any parking related questions.

728
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:08,641
So it's, you know, if the counselors do have questions, because sometimes there's questions about parking policies when they ticket, uh, sometimes there's questions about who they hire, what's their turnover rate.

729
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:11,783
Um, so these, these are questions that I want to make sure that they are,

730
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:18,446
able to answer, so that's why I opened it up to the financial update and the parking-related questions.

731
00:55:18,486 --> 00:55:24,629
I want to make sure that councilors have the opportunity to ask any questions that they want regarding the parking program.

732
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:26,370
Thank you, Councilor Falcone.

733
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:26,850
Thank you.

734
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:27,691
Okay.

735
00:55:28,151 --> 00:55:28,771
Mr. President.

736
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:30,032
Councilor Best.

737
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:31,901
Thank you, Mr. President.

738
00:55:32,221 --> 00:55:44,307
Yeah, Republic Parking and Park Medford are also, you know, do have some responsibility around ticketing in areas with permits and addressing vehicles that are left, you know, over the 48 hour limit.

739
00:55:44,387 --> 00:55:46,808
So I do think there'll be some questions there.

740
00:55:46,828 --> 00:55:54,851
And I have some questions myself for Park Medford around that as I've been fielding, you know, people will call me and then I will call Park Medford and then they'll go deal with something.

741
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:57,252
And, you know, it'd be nice if they were,

742
00:55:57,992 --> 00:56:02,935
a little more strict about enforcement, and I think that would also affect the financial update as well.

743
00:56:02,995 --> 00:56:09,159
So, you know, there are probably some good questions and information from that commission that could help us in that meeting.

744
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:11,641
So, I would support the amendment.

745
00:56:13,862 --> 00:56:14,142
Okay.

746
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:22,908
On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Morrell, seconded by... Second.

747
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:24,729
Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

748
00:56:24,769 --> 00:56:26,190
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

749
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:29,186
Councilor Bears?

750
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:30,928
Yes.

751
00:56:31,549 --> 00:56:32,209
Councilor Falco?

752
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,050
Yes.

753
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:34,251
Vice President Knight?

754
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:35,792
Yes.

755
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:36,373
Councilor Marks?

756
00:56:36,613 --> 00:56:36,893
Yes.

757
00:56:37,454 --> 00:56:38,034
Councilor Morrell?

758
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:38,915
Yes.

759
00:56:39,455 --> 00:56:40,156
Councilor Scarpelli?

760
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:40,236
Yes.

761
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:41,577
President Caravaglio?

762
00:56:41,637 --> 00:56:41,837
Yes.

763
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:42,578
7 in the affirmative.

764
00:56:42,598 --> 00:56:43,239
Motion passes.

765
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:50,165
2-1-027 offered by Councilor Bears be it resolved that the Memphis City Council strongly condemns the violent insurrection

766
00:56:51,604 --> 00:57:03,234
at the United States Capitol on June 6, 2021, and it opposes any attempt to undermine the Constitution of the United States by disrupting the peaceful transition of power that is in the bedrock of our democracy.

767
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:04,235
Counselor Behrs.

768
00:57:05,176 --> 00:57:06,137
Thank you, Mr. President.

769
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:15,145
I think as many people in our community were feeling devastated a couple of weeks ago when we saw the

770
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:19,007
the temple of our democracy ransacked by a mob.

771
00:57:19,747 --> 00:57:22,148
And that was just awful to watch.

772
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:33,931
And I think it speaks to a larger issue in our country around respecting democracy and understanding that the democratic process is how decisions are made.

773
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:44,374
And as a democratic body, as a local council of our community in Medford, I think it's important for us to speak up for peaceful transitions of power, which we have every two years here at Medford,

774
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:52,248
respect for the rule of law and respect for our institutions of democracy.

775
00:57:52,288 --> 00:57:54,150
So that's the intent I had putting this forward.

776
00:57:55,731 --> 00:58:00,754
I am looking forward tomorrow to a transition of power, peaceful transition of power in our country.

777
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:08,860
And I think it's the responsibility of all elected officials across the country to stand up for that, regardless of party or belief, because we

778
00:58:09,682 --> 00:58:16,432
are the stewards of a very important institution, an institution that we've seen is deeply at risk over the past several years.

779
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:17,894
Thank you, Mr. President.

780
00:58:21,577 --> 00:58:22,378
Thank you, Mr. President.

781
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,000
I want to thank Councilor Behrs for putting this on the agenda.

782
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:33,286
I know often the council tends to shy away from issues that might be deemed something to be dealt with the state or levels beyond, but this is not one of those issues.

783
00:58:33,746 --> 00:58:45,035
What happened on January 6th was an assault on our democracy, and we must condemn what happened from every level of government and from every citizen, and we should stand up for what's right and what is just for this democracy.

784
00:58:45,095 --> 00:58:48,838
So I thank Councilor Behrs for putting this forward and the council's support of this.

785
00:58:49,399 --> 00:58:50,219
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

786
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:50,800
Councilor Date.

787
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,825
Who are we sending this condemnation to?

788
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,308
Councilor Baez, who are we sending this to?

789
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:01,213
I'm happy to send it to our federal delegation.

790
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,595
I believe that... They were in the building.

791
00:59:03,635 --> 00:59:05,096
I'm pretty sure they didn't like what was going on.

792
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:06,627
Yeah, it was.

793
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:08,448
It was really hard to hear some of those stories.

794
00:59:08,488 --> 00:59:14,873
I'd be happy to send it to them, but I think it's important for us as a council to make our position on the issue clear to our community.

795
00:59:15,353 --> 00:59:15,653
Thank you.

796
00:59:16,134 --> 00:59:18,736
So this is just another symbolic thing.

797
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:19,777
Yes, it will.

798
00:59:19,797 --> 00:59:21,418
This will be a symbolic approval.

799
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:21,838
Mr. President.

800
00:59:21,878 --> 00:59:24,760
Well, I think Mr. President, thank you.

801
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:28,003
Uh, council Falco.

802
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:30,509
Thank you, President Carvajal.

803
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:32,711
I do agree with this resolution 100%.

804
00:59:33,812 --> 00:59:38,215
People lost their lives on that day, and these actions should be condemned.

805
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:39,696
Thank you, President.

806
00:59:39,937 --> 00:59:40,957
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

807
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:41,778
Thank you.

808
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:52,807
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Baez, seconded by Councilor Morrell, that we send this out to our federal, if the clerk will send this out to our federal delegation.

809
00:59:53,808 --> 00:59:55,169
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

810
01:00:01,227 --> 01:00:01,767
Councilor Behrs.

811
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:03,088
Yes.

812
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:04,489
Councilor Falco.

813
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:05,049
Yes.

814
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:06,070
Vice President Knight.

815
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,690
Yes.

816
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,251
Councilor Marks.

817
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:08,631
Yes.

818
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:09,792
Councilor Morrell.

819
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:10,652
Yes.

820
01:00:11,072 --> 01:00:11,833
Councilor Scarpelli.

821
01:00:11,853 --> 01:00:12,133
Yes.

822
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:12,953
President Kerrio.

823
01:00:12,993 --> 01:00:14,634
Yes, seven affirmative motion passes.

824
01:00:14,654 --> 01:00:17,115
2-1-0-2-8, offered by Councilor Behrs.

825
01:00:17,876 --> 01:00:29,282
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council, that the, excuse me, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council and the city administration provide a written update on

826
01:00:30,112 --> 01:00:42,936
any plans or potential plans for mass COVID-19 vaccination sites in the city of Medford, and if the state or federal government are coordinating with the city regarding mass vaccinations for COVID-19.

827
01:00:42,956 --> 01:00:43,556
Councilor Baez.

828
01:00:46,397 --> 01:00:47,397
Thank you, Mr. President.

829
01:00:49,177 --> 01:00:52,838
This resolution is regarding COVID vaccination sites in Medford.

830
01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:58,920
I did have a chance to speak with Chief of Staff Rodriguez, who let me know that sites are being explored.

831
01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:06,148
funding is being lined up and there are hopes to open at least one site in our community within weeks, not within months.

832
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:17,970
Um, he said that, uh, per the resolution passing, if it passes the council, they will provide a more detailed updated writing, which I look forward to reading, but I do think it's a current thing.

833
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:19,231
Point of information.

834
01:01:19,251 --> 01:01:26,932
Mr. President, on December 15th, this council passed paper 20677, which is virtually identical to the paper, the council of bears is put on this evening.

835
01:01:26,972 --> 01:01:27,112
So,

836
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:29,740
The chief of staff says he needs a paper to cross his desk.

837
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,461
He's got to look back in his calendar about three weeks, because he's already got it.

838
01:01:33,601 --> 01:01:34,401
Thank you, Councilor Ntuk.

839
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:34,981
Councilor Baez.

840
01:01:36,682 --> 01:01:44,165
You know, I think this is specific to mass vaccination sites in the community, which I'm encouraged to see should be coming soon.

841
01:01:44,805 --> 01:01:45,805
Thank you, Councilor Baez.

842
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:47,005
Any further discussion?

843
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:49,866
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Baez.

844
01:01:49,886 --> 01:01:51,067
Councilor Maxwell.

845
01:01:52,592 --> 01:02:03,740
I just would like to say, Mr President, in my view of this, I think it's a disgrace, Mr President, that Massachusetts is at the bottom of the list when it comes to vaccine distribution.

846
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:11,605
We have the top hospitals in the world in Massachusetts, the top medical facilities, and we lag behind many other states

847
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:14,846
Mr. President, and the distribution of vaccines.

848
01:02:15,206 --> 01:02:28,829
The second point, Mr. President, I made this several weeks ago, is that we're vaccinating members of Congress that are in their 30s and 40s, Mr. President, with no comorbidities, but we can't vaccinate someone in their 70s and 80s.

849
01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:31,110
They have to wait two months, Mr. President.

850
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:41,292
It's a disgrace what's going on in this state, Mr. President, and people should be well aware of who's handling this and why it's in the way we are, Mr. President, the shape we're in.

851
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:42,933
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

852
01:02:44,155 --> 01:02:46,157
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Mizz.

853
01:02:46,297 --> 01:02:47,659
Councilor Mizz.

854
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:59,192
If I may just add to Councilor Marks' point, the state government and the federal government's lack of a plan was one of the major points of concern that Chief of Staff Rodriguez had, so I fully agree with Councilor Marks that

855
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,294
it's really a shame that the state is not more prepared.

856
01:03:02,594 --> 01:03:02,974
Thank you.

857
01:03:03,094 --> 01:03:04,074
Thank you.

858
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:08,075
Mr. President, if that's the case, if that's the case, we go on record for everything else.

859
01:03:08,495 --> 01:03:21,918
We should go on record sending a message, Mr. President, to our federal delegation stating how disappointed we are with the vaccination sites and the lack of vaccinations that have been distributed in this state.

860
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:27,599
So we go on record on behalf of the seniors and most vulnerable people in our community.

861
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:29,700
Mr. President, that's what we should be doing.

862
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,120
I would second that as an amendment.

863
01:03:31,761 --> 01:03:32,401
Thank you.

864
01:03:32,861 --> 01:03:33,661
So you want to make that?

865
01:03:34,702 --> 01:03:36,282
I would like to make that as an amendment.

866
01:03:36,302 --> 01:03:37,123
I would second that amendment.

867
01:03:37,223 --> 01:03:38,163
That's a great amendment.

868
01:03:38,363 --> 01:03:38,663
Okay.

869
01:03:39,704 --> 01:03:40,524
Thank you.

870
01:03:40,644 --> 01:03:41,504
Any further discussion?

871
01:03:42,405 --> 01:03:43,225
I agree wholeheartedly.

872
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:44,786
Thank you, Councilman.

873
01:03:44,806 --> 01:03:49,107
The motion by Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Mox, as amended by Councilor Mox.

874
01:03:50,448 --> 01:03:51,508
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

875
01:03:54,629 --> 01:03:55,209
Councilor Beers?

876
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,850
Yes.

877
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:57,930
Councilor Falco?

878
01:03:58,871 --> 01:03:59,051
Yes.

879
01:04:00,632 --> 01:04:01,013
Yes.

880
01:04:02,093 --> 01:04:02,454
Yes.

881
01:04:04,115 --> 01:04:04,395
Yes.

882
01:04:05,556 --> 01:04:05,876
Yes.

883
01:04:06,817 --> 01:04:07,037
Yes.

884
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:11,681
Seven affirmative motion passes two one zero two nine offered by vice-president night.

885
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:28,675
Be it resolved that the city administration provide the city council with a detailed and itemized accounting of the expenditures made from accounts five, seven, six, one, five, five, seven, six, two for the period of one, one, 2020 to date and be a further resolved

886
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:36,634
The Memphis City Council will be provided with copies of any legal judgments against the city during this period and be it.

887
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:45,086
again further resolve that the Memphis City Council be provided with copies in any voluntary settlements of legal matters during this period.

888
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:47,067
Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight.

889
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:49,047
Mr. President, thank you very much.

890
01:04:50,728 --> 01:04:59,230
In usual form, any legal settlement over $2,500 would have to come before the City Council if that settlement was voluntary and not a judgment by a judge.

891
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:08,276
And when we got a copy of the Warren articles that we fought for for so long, I had the opportunity to review them.

892
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:17,443
And when I got to the legal expenses line items under accounts numbers 5761 and 5762, I saw a number of expenditures that exceeded $2,500.

893
01:05:20,646 --> 01:05:27,951
Which led me to believe that there were legal settlements that were made that the appropriations were not passed through the council.

894
01:05:29,113 --> 01:05:43,144
So I'm asking for a detailed line item breakdown of those two accounts to do a review and conduct due diligence to make sure that we're in compliance with municipal finance law and to make sure that the matters that are supposed to appear before the council due to those, what's that word that everybody likes to use?

895
01:05:43,184 --> 01:05:43,805
John, what's that word?

896
01:05:43,825 --> 01:05:44,926
I believe it's transparency.

897
01:05:45,146 --> 01:05:46,547
Transparency, that's the word.

898
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:51,331
So that we can be as transparent as possible, but also so that we can be in compliance with municipal finance law.

899
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:56,375
So in the past, we've seen people that have come and have tripped on a sidewalk.

900
01:05:56,955 --> 01:06:00,979
broken an arm, come before the council and the council has had to approve their settlement.

901
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:04,322
Um, we've had vehicles damaged by a fire engine.

902
01:06:04,562 --> 01:06:08,265
Those individuals been damaged in car accidents by a fire engine and a DPW truck.

903
01:06:08,545 --> 01:06:10,027
Those settlements have had to come before the council.

904
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:17,193
Um, so I'd just like to see an accounting of a five, seven, six, one and five, seven, six, two, um, because it stuck out.

905
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:21,671
it didn't look right to me and I want to make sure that we're doing things the right way.

906
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:27,553
Um, as the fiduciary in this community, the city council has a strong responsibility financially.

907
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:32,214
Um, and if we're expending money without the appropriate approvals, that's a concern.

908
01:06:32,774 --> 01:06:40,676
Um, so I'd ask that the, uh, finance director provide us with this breakdown, um, in conjunction with the city solicitor, um, to be sure that we protect everybody's rights.

909
01:06:40,736 --> 01:06:43,457
If it's something that needs to be addressed in an executive session, so be it.

910
01:06:43,977 --> 01:06:48,138
I would happily welcome that opinion from the city councilor, I mean the city solicitor.

911
01:06:48,518 --> 01:06:51,339
But I really think it's something we need to take a look at, Mr. President.

912
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:57,641
There's a lot of talk about legal settlements that are occurring in this community, but some of those have to come before us.

913
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:04,683
And I'd like to make sure that we are being provided with the opportunity to do the work that we've been elected to do.

914
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,044
Thank you, Vice President Knight.

915
01:07:06,104 --> 01:07:06,744
Councilor Falco.

916
01:07:08,971 --> 01:07:14,036
Mr. President Caviello, thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward, and thank you for your persistence in getting these reports.

917
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:21,764
I did the same thing, I scrolled through and I did notice that there were a number of large numbers in these accounts.

918
01:07:22,364 --> 01:07:29,552
And if the councilor wouldn't mind me amending this, I'd like to know why these papers did not come to us for approval.

919
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:35,269
Once it goes over a certain amount, it's supposed to come to us for approval.

920
01:07:35,309 --> 01:07:36,870
We did not see any of these papers.

921
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:46,332
So if the councilor wouldn't mind me amending the resolution, I think that's something that we need to know specifically why these did not come to us.

922
01:07:46,952 --> 01:07:48,213
I have no problem amending the paper.

923
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:52,134
I just think it's important to point out that there's a difference between a settlement and a judgment.

924
01:07:52,214 --> 01:07:56,275
If there was a judgment by a judge, then it automatically gets paid.

925
01:07:56,355 --> 01:08:00,356
But if there was a settlement that was entered into voluntarily by the parties, then that voluntary expenditure.

926
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:01,997
has to come through the council.

927
01:08:02,017 --> 01:08:10,922
The council has to approve that money because it wasn't ordered by a judge, where if it's ordered by a judge, we can't say no to it anyway.

928
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,603
So I think that that's the issue.

929
01:08:12,623 --> 01:08:13,564
Thank you, Vice President Knight.

930
01:08:14,284 --> 01:08:20,388
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Falco.

931
01:08:20,408 --> 01:08:21,609
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

932
01:08:25,771 --> 01:08:26,331
Councilor Behrs?

933
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:27,252
Yes.

934
01:08:27,592 --> 01:08:28,273
Councilor Falco?

935
01:08:28,853 --> 01:08:29,073
Yes.

936
01:08:29,754 --> 01:08:30,414
Vice President Knight?

937
01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:30,903
Yes.

938
01:08:31,343 --> 01:08:31,884
Councilor Marks.

939
01:08:32,304 --> 01:08:32,504
Yes.

940
01:08:32,964 --> 01:08:33,564
Councilor Morrell.

941
01:08:34,185 --> 01:08:34,405
Yes.

942
01:08:34,705 --> 01:08:35,445
Councilor Scarpelli.

943
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:35,845
Yes.

944
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:36,846
President Caravaglio.

945
01:08:36,926 --> 01:08:37,366
Yes.

946
01:08:37,406 --> 01:08:49,932
7 affirmative motion passes 2 1 0 3 0 off of my vice president night being resolved at the Memphis city council extended its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Eugene McGillicuddy on his recent passing.

947
01:08:50,032 --> 01:08:50,632
Councilor Knight.

948
01:08:51,052 --> 01:08:52,473
Mr. President, thank you very much.

949
01:08:53,054 --> 01:08:57,938
Gene McGillicuddy, as many of us behind this rail know, was a fixture in the city of Medford for a long time.

950
01:08:59,259 --> 01:09:08,427
Any given summer afternoon from probably 1985 to 1995, you could have found him down at Santoro Field coaching Foodmaster.

951
01:09:09,408 --> 01:09:10,869
I'll tell you, he wasn't a great pitching coach.

952
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:18,054
Mr. President, because I moved to lacrosse after Little League, after playing for Coach McGillicuddy on Foodmaster for a number of years.

953
01:09:18,674 --> 01:09:19,315
Maybe too many.

954
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:23,858
I probably should have got moved up to the minors, out of the minors by the time I turned 15, but that didn't happen.

955
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:27,360
But with that being said, Mr. McGillicuddy and I go way back.

956
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,201
He was a dear friend of mine personally.

957
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:31,302
I had the opportunity to play for him as a child.

958
01:09:32,243 --> 01:09:35,605
My mother actually worked with Mr. McGillicuddy in the same office for a number of years.

959
01:09:36,445 --> 01:09:40,028
And then I had the opportunity of being a neighbor of his very recently, Mr. President.

960
01:09:40,628 --> 01:09:43,810
I had the opportunity to go to school with Kathleen, grew up with his daughter, Kathleen.

961
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:46,532
I've become very friendly with his son-in-law, John, over the years.

962
01:09:47,032 --> 01:09:55,357
And let me tell you, Gene McGillicuddy was just a great guy, someone that was always willing to help out, someone that was always willing to volunteer, someone that wore his heart on his sleeve.

963
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:59,420
He was a quiet man that carried a big stick.

964
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,621
When he spoke, he made sense.

965
01:10:02,342 --> 01:10:06,064
He didn't talk often, but when he did speak, it was because he had something to say and it was important.

966
01:10:06,564 --> 01:10:18,535
And he was someone that I admired, someone that I enjoyed growing up around, learning some of the lessons of life through Mr. McGillicuddy's dry sense of humor and interesting way of approaching things was always something I enjoyed.

967
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:22,378
So I had the opportunity of, like I said, living next door to Mr. McGillicuddy for a number of years.

968
01:10:22,878 --> 01:10:24,460
And he and Maureen were just great people.

969
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,220
And he's going to be sorely missed.

970
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:29,061
He was certainly someone that contributed to the fabric of this community.

971
01:10:29,482 --> 01:10:34,503
He's put in years and years and years in the city of Medford, grew up living on Hugh Mav, right behind the Dame School.

972
01:10:35,303 --> 01:10:38,344
Mr. McGillicuddy was a fixture in that neighborhood, taking care of his neighbors.

973
01:10:38,524 --> 01:10:41,665
His house was always open to the kids in the neighborhood.

974
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:48,948
And when he moved and downsized to the condos over at 190 High Street, he was someone that was always willing to give his time as a member of the board of trustees.

975
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,429
So Gene's volunteerism is second to none.

976
01:10:53,969 --> 01:10:58,431
that probably donated 50 years of his life to the city of Medford, to his neighbors, and to his friends.

977
01:10:58,852 --> 01:11:03,234
He's someone that should be admired, someone that should be recognized, but first of all, most importantly, someone that should be remembered.

978
01:11:03,934 --> 01:11:08,857
So I ask that my council colleagues join me in extending a deep and sincere condolences to the McGillicuddy family in their time of need.

979
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:10,799
Thank you, Vice President Knight.

980
01:11:10,819 --> 01:11:11,579
Councilor Scott Pelli.

981
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:14,941
Thank you, Council President and Councilor, for bringing this forward.

982
01:11:16,342 --> 01:11:19,823
Mr. and Mrs. McGillicuddy are definitely a fixture in our community.

983
01:11:20,264 --> 01:11:36,092
And when you say how, you know, you look at the backbone of our community and the members that make Medford, the people, the spirit, and the McGillicuddies are those type of people that will be missed.

984
01:11:36,132 --> 01:11:37,413
Mr. McGillicuddy will be missed.

985
01:11:41,599 --> 01:11:49,784
It's what I question every day is, who is the person that's going to take a Mr. McGillicuddy spot in our community?

986
01:11:50,144 --> 01:11:54,107
And those are huge shoes to fill, but that's what makes our community great.

987
01:11:54,147 --> 01:12:01,991
People like Mr. McGillicuddy and Mr. McGillicuddy who taught us how to be loving parents and members of our community.

988
01:12:02,492 --> 01:12:09,036
And I hung around with Karen for years and got to know them.

989
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:11,057
close and they were very great.

990
01:12:11,097 --> 01:12:12,037
They were very good people.

991
01:12:12,117 --> 01:12:16,880
And I know Mr. McGillicuddy is going to be missed in our community and we send our deepest condolences.

992
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,901
So God bless.

993
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,062
Thank you.

994
01:12:19,082 --> 01:12:19,842
Councilor Scott.

995
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:20,442
Councilor Marks.

996
01:12:20,963 --> 01:12:21,763
Thank you, Mr. President.

997
01:12:21,783 --> 01:12:27,707
I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on, um, you know, a true family man, Mr. McGillicuddy.

998
01:12:28,407 --> 01:12:35,992
And, uh, another fact about Mr. McGillicuddy for many years in this community, we would have not had local cable community access.

999
01:12:36,592 --> 01:12:38,672
if it wasn't for Mr. McGillicuddy.

1000
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:54,656
He's the one that was down there running the programs, making sure we had local programming, and was very instrumental in putting out community access for a number of years, among the many other things as Councilor Knight mentioned about his dedication and commitment to this community.

1001
01:12:55,256 --> 01:13:04,378
I'll miss seeing them both walking down the square hand in hand, Mr. President, but I wish his family and his wife

1002
01:13:05,318 --> 01:13:07,380
well in this grieving time, Mr. President.

1003
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:08,921
Thank you, Councilor Mox.

1004
01:13:08,981 --> 01:13:09,641
Councilor Falcone.

1005
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:12,723
Thank you, President Carviello, and I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

1006
01:13:12,743 --> 01:13:23,530
And I think, you know, hearing all my council colleagues talking about Mr. McGillicuddy, and you hear the words like volunteerism, community, family, and that's what he was all about.

1007
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:28,391
I grew up with his daughter, Karen, went to high school with her, and she was a fabulous person.

1008
01:13:29,031 --> 01:13:34,912
And I never knew Mr. McGillicuddy until later on in life, until I got involved in elected politics.

1009
01:13:35,572 --> 01:13:42,714
And he's someone that you always found helping out, always volunteering, always doing whatever he could do to help.

1010
01:13:43,474 --> 01:13:48,475
And he will be missed, and thoughts and prayers to him and his family.

1011
01:13:48,945 --> 01:13:50,086
Thank you, Councilor Falcone.

1012
01:13:50,146 --> 01:13:53,147
If I could express my own condolences to the family.

1013
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:59,350
I know Mr. McGillicuddy for many years and see them every Sunday, him and his wife, walking to Church St.

1014
01:13:59,390 --> 01:13:59,791
Rayfield.

1015
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:03,793
So again, and I think Councilor Scott probably made the big point.

1016
01:14:06,494 --> 01:14:10,516
People like Mr. McGillicuddy keep passing away and we can do these condolences every week.

1017
01:14:11,677 --> 01:14:13,638
Who steps up to fill those shoes?

1018
01:14:14,677 --> 01:14:18,079
for as many years of volunteerism to the community.

1019
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:23,823
So, again, you know, and this is what seems to be happening in our community.

1020
01:14:24,183 --> 01:14:28,385
These men and women of stature in our community are passing away due to aging.

1021
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:32,028
Who steps up to fill those giant shoes?

1022
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:35,230
So, again, my condolences to the McGillicuddy family.

1023
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,671
He will be missing the community.

1024
01:14:37,531 --> 01:14:39,132
Councilor Best, any comment?

1025
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:41,170
Let's run.

1026
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:45,233
Okay, on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

1027
01:14:45,993 --> 01:14:46,253
Second.

1028
01:14:46,693 --> 01:14:47,914
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1029
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,535
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1030
01:14:51,396 --> 01:14:51,896
Councilor Behrs?

1031
01:14:52,737 --> 01:14:52,937
Yes.

1032
01:14:53,677 --> 01:14:54,318
Councilor Falco?

1033
01:14:54,438 --> 01:14:54,658
Yes.

1034
01:14:55,338 --> 01:14:55,999
Vice President Knight?

1035
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:56,519
Yes.

1036
01:14:56,839 --> 01:14:57,380
Councilor Marks?

1037
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:57,980
Yes.

1038
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:58,840
Councilor Morrell?

1039
01:14:59,481 --> 01:14:59,681
Yes.

1040
01:15:00,021 --> 01:15:00,801
Councilor Scarpelli?

1041
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:01,162
Yes.

1042
01:15:01,262 --> 01:15:02,022
President Caravaglio?

1043
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:02,302
Yes.

1044
01:15:02,342 --> 01:15:03,143
Second the affirmative.

1045
01:15:03,343 --> 01:15:03,903
Motion passes.

1046
01:15:03,983 --> 01:15:06,685
If we could please have a moment of silence for Mr. McGillicuddy.

1047
01:15:21,657 --> 01:15:23,438
We have one paper under suspension.

1048
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:33,025
Motion by Vice President Knight to suspend the rules, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1049
01:15:33,605 --> 01:15:34,786
Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1050
01:15:39,809 --> 01:15:40,330
Councilor Behrs?

1051
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:41,450
Yes.

1052
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:42,591
Councilor Falco?

1053
01:15:42,611 --> 01:15:42,711
Yes.

1054
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:44,452
Vice President Knight?

1055
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:44,953
Yes.

1056
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:46,073
Councilor Marks?

1057
01:15:46,394 --> 01:15:46,734
Yes.

1058
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:47,574
Councilor Morrell?

1059
01:15:48,195 --> 01:15:48,435
Yes.

1060
01:15:48,895 --> 01:15:49,556
Councilor Scarpelli?

1061
01:15:49,576 --> 01:15:49,636
Yes.

1062
01:15:50,536 --> 01:15:53,159
Yes, 7 in favor of the motion passes.

1063
01:15:53,199 --> 01:16:00,887
Under suspension, 21031 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that former public health director,

1064
01:16:01,775 --> 01:16:10,278
And Elder Affairs Director Cameron Rose be recognized for being elected Vice President to the Board of Mystic Valley Elder Services.

1065
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:11,639
Councilor Mox.

1066
01:16:12,259 --> 01:16:13,480
Thank you, Mr. President.

1067
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,021
And if you can set the record straight, I apologize.

1068
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:19,302
This was offered by myself and Councilor Scott Pelli.

1069
01:16:19,682 --> 01:16:21,363
And that was my error, Mr. President.

1070
01:16:22,523 --> 01:16:34,866
Mystic Valley Elder Services represents 11 communities, including Method, and offers one-stop support for older adults, adults living with disabilities, and their caregivers.

1071
01:16:35,486 --> 01:16:44,528
The service includes transportation, nutrition, at-home care, health benefits counseling, health aging programs, protective services,

1072
01:16:52,782 --> 01:17:09,975
services supports thousands of Method residents with programs such as Meals on Wheels and the Trip Metro North program, which provides free transportation to medical appointments, shopping, banking, visiting friends, and other activities for our seniors, Mr. President.

1073
01:17:10,436 --> 01:17:20,083
Karen Rose was recently elected Vice President and has served on the board since 2011 in a number of capacities, such as the chair of the Board of Oversight,

1074
01:17:20,483 --> 01:17:24,665
and Planning Committee, and a member of the Board's Executive Finance Committee.

1075
01:17:25,306 --> 01:17:45,176
Karen served with distinction, Mr. President, for 15 years as the Director of Medford's Public Health Department during difficult times, stepped up and held dual roles as Director of Responsibilities for five years as both Public Health Director and Elder Affairs Director.

1076
01:17:46,277 --> 01:17:48,578
I've been doing this for a number of years, Mr. President,

1077
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:54,062
And I never like to rate people, but Karen was top notch.

1078
01:17:54,582 --> 01:17:57,164
She truly is, Mr. President.

1079
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,606
Whatever she did, she did to her fullest.

1080
01:18:00,026 --> 01:18:01,827
She continues to do to her fullest.

1081
01:18:02,267 --> 01:18:05,049
She gave this city everything as the head of

1082
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:11,291
public health and elder affairs, two very difficult positions, as you can imagine.

1083
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:24,094
And she ran them, let me tell you, with the utmost confidence, Mr. President, and not one of those programs ever slacked for a minute while Karen Rose was in charge, Mr. President.

1084
01:18:25,074 --> 01:18:28,215
You know, you knew when Karen walked in the room,

1085
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:42,218
She was very assertive in what she said, but she was also, Mr. President, someone that had a lot of feelings and someone that really cared about people and really cared about what she did in this community.

1086
01:18:42,878 --> 01:18:47,739
And all too often, I think that gets lost in a lot of translation nowadays.

1087
01:18:48,339 --> 01:18:52,680
People get more involved with the job and less about the people it impacts.

1088
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:59,665
And truly, Karen would be out there during every vaccination for the flu shot, would be out there.

1089
01:19:00,005 --> 01:19:05,689
The director didn't have to be out there, Mr. President, but she cared about what was going on in this community.

1090
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,311
She cared about the seniors.

1091
01:19:07,691 --> 01:19:16,337
You couldn't have a day without seeing Karen at the senior center when they had their many programs over there, Mr. President, and the bingos and everything else.

1092
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:17,718
I don't know how she does.

1093
01:19:17,738 --> 01:19:21,141
She must have had a twin because she divided herself equally

1094
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:26,745
Mr. President, with two very taxing responsibilities in this community.

1095
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:41,317
And I just want to congratulate her on her election to the Vice President of a very important organization that continues to assist thousands of Method residents in this community, Mr. President.

1096
01:19:41,957 --> 01:19:49,664
And I would like to send a citation to Karen congratulating her on behalf of her recent election.

1097
01:19:50,324 --> 01:20:00,286
And also, Mr. President, for her 15 years commitment to the residents of this community, in particular to the seniors of this community, Mr. President.

1098
01:20:00,766 --> 01:20:03,807
And I wish her well, Mr. President, in her future endeavors.

1099
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:04,547
Thank you.

1100
01:20:04,587 --> 01:20:05,287
Councilor Scott Belli.

1101
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:05,828
Thank you.

1102
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:07,368
And again, thank you, Councilor Mox.

1103
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:16,490
I think that when you talk about, you've said it all, but I think that while all this was going on, I remember Karen still being a devoted daughter.

1104
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:25,617
I mean, I know she went through some difficult times with her dad, and I remember her still working and being the most dedicated employee in this building.

1105
01:20:26,097 --> 01:20:33,864
And, you know, coming from two cities, I've worked with a lot of department heads in Somerville, a lot of department heads here for a long time, and by far,

1106
01:20:34,524 --> 01:20:41,531
she will stand out as one of the greatest for the fact that she brought knowledge, she brought dedication, and she brought compassion.

1107
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:44,093
I think that's one of the biggest, most important pieces.

1108
01:20:44,113 --> 01:20:51,160
With everything that she did, every single day, she brought that compassion that really made you feel that Karen was there.

1109
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:57,245
Two are probably one of our most neediest communities, because if you look at our seniors, especially,

1110
01:20:58,146 --> 01:21:00,409
And you see how lonely life can be at times for some.

1111
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,953
She would always find a way to make sure they were taken care of.

1112
01:21:03,973 --> 01:21:09,400
And I think that she was a great advocate for our seniors and the position she's in now.

1113
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:10,802
I know she'll flourish.

1114
01:21:10,942 --> 01:21:13,805
I congratulate her and we miss her.

1115
01:21:14,106 --> 01:21:17,490
And I think that we should all use her.

1116
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:24,115
her skills in moving forward in anything we do in our lives, because she was something special here in Medford.

1117
01:21:24,135 --> 01:21:25,676
So thank you, Councilor Moxley.

1118
01:21:25,716 --> 01:21:26,397
Appreciate that.

1119
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:30,760
And I think that she deserves all our congratulations and kudos.

1120
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,321
So thank you.

1121
01:21:31,341 --> 01:21:32,041
Thank you, Councilor Scott.

1122
01:21:32,061 --> 01:21:32,662
Vice President Knight.

1123
01:21:32,682 --> 01:21:34,543
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1124
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:38,166
Thank you, Councilor Moxley and Councilor Scott Kellogg for putting this on.

1125
01:21:38,647 --> 01:21:42,710
I had the pleasure of working with Karen for a number of years while she was here as our health director.

1126
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:45,972
And to echo Councilor Moxley's sentiments,

1127
01:21:47,878 --> 01:21:51,000
She was firm, but very fair and very compassionate.

1128
01:21:51,561 --> 01:21:59,887
And when Karen was here as a Director of Health and Elder Services, as Counselor Scott Pelley mentioned, she was also a very devoted daughter.

1129
01:22:01,388 --> 01:22:06,892
Karen played the role of caregiver to her father when her father was very ill.

1130
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:11,455
And that never got in the way of the work or the job that she did here.

1131
01:22:11,835 --> 01:22:13,877
And I can't think of a better person to be selected.

1132
01:22:15,165 --> 01:22:17,967
for Mystic Valley Elder Services to serve as the vice president at the Karen Rose.

1133
01:22:19,528 --> 01:22:25,953
A true professional, a great department head, someone that I sorely miss seeing around the building and seeing around the community.

1134
01:22:25,973 --> 01:22:29,576
I haven't seen her as much as I used to because of everything that's going on.

1135
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:41,144
But I'll tell you this, I feel better knowing that Karen Rose is on the board of directors and that she's a vice president over there where I have two aging parents that are in this community and I know

1136
01:22:41,605 --> 01:22:47,230
that there's somebody over there that's making decisions that's going to be sure that they put people first, not the dollar.

1137
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:48,851
And Karen Rose is that person.

1138
01:22:48,971 --> 01:22:54,076
So thank you very much to my council colleagues for putting this on and congratulations to Karen because she's a great person.

1139
01:22:54,136 --> 01:23:03,444
And this is truly nothing more than a reflections of all the hard work, dedication, dedication and action that she's put in over the past 30 years as a nurse.

1140
01:23:05,206 --> 01:23:05,866
Thank you, vice president.

1141
01:23:05,886 --> 01:23:05,946
Uh,

1142
01:23:07,322 --> 01:23:07,983
Councilor Felkel.

1143
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:09,404
Thank you, President Calvi.

1144
01:23:09,424 --> 01:23:11,365
I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

1145
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:16,750
And I basically agree with all the comments that my council colleagues have made.

1146
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:19,292
You're not going to find a better person than Karen.

1147
01:23:20,273 --> 01:23:22,254
Fabulous, does a great job, very knowledgeable.

1148
01:23:22,275 --> 01:23:24,396
So I just want to say congratulations and wish her well.

1149
01:23:24,817 --> 01:23:25,097
Thank you.

1150
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:26,904
Thank you, Councilor Falcon.

1151
01:23:26,944 --> 01:23:34,827
If I could echo my own sentiments, I knew Karen before I was a city councilor, and again, great person, good daughter.

1152
01:23:37,168 --> 01:23:40,610
You see her all the time out with her dad after dinner, several nights a week.

1153
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:46,453
She did an outstanding job as our health director here, and I think to come, she was

1154
01:23:47,053 --> 01:23:57,319
fair, and hardworking, and again, I think this is a great asset for Mississippi Valley Elder Service to have a person like Karen on their board.

1155
01:23:57,339 --> 01:24:06,505
So again, I congratulate Karen, and I know she'll continue to do great work in the city, and for our seniors, so thank you.

1156
01:24:08,726 --> 01:24:13,750
On the motion by Councilor Marks and Councilor Scott Kelly.

1157
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:14,230

Yes.

1187
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,000
Councilor Morrell.

1188
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:10,080

1196
01:25:22,258 --> 01:25:30,284
Um, this is a committee whole report that we, uh, had, uh, last week with, uh, our zoning, uh, consultant, uh, attorney Burbowski.

1197
01:25:31,064 --> 01:25:33,846
And we'll be meeting again with him next week.

1198
01:25:34,707 --> 01:25:37,129
He provided, he sent us out a first draft.

1199
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:46,176
We, we, after two hours, we made a lot of questions and hopefully we'll make more progress with this next week.

He stepped away.

1208
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:06,130
Okay.

1209
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:07,171
Uh, council marks.

1210
01:26:07,351 --> 01:26:07,691
Yes.

1211
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:08,612
Councilor Morrell.

1212
01:26:09,212 --> 01:26:09,473
Yes.

1213
01:26:09,913 --> 01:26:10,694
Councilor Scarpelli.

1214
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:11,134
Yes.

1215
01:26:11,274 --> 01:26:12,035
President carry yellow.

1216
01:26:12,155 --> 01:26:12,395
Yes.

1217
01:26:12,896 --> 01:26:13,636
Six in the affirmative.

1218
01:26:13,716 --> 01:26:15,018
One absent, one absent.

1219
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,239
Motion passes.

1220
01:26:16,979 --> 01:26:19,782
Uh, do we have anybody that wants to speak in public participation?

1221
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,333
Mr. President, before we get to the records, okay?

1222
01:26:24,573 --> 01:26:26,815
No, no, no, no, please.

1223
01:26:26,896 --> 01:26:29,478
Hearing and seeing none, Councilor Scott Pele.

1224
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:34,964
If I can, I know I got a phone, I had a phone call from a concerned resident that

1225
01:26:36,717 --> 01:26:47,940
sorry, confusing social media posts that stated that the council voting against the eviction moratorium.

1226
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:56,882
I just want to set the record straight, whether it's social media, other city counselors, that's not the privy of the city council.

1227
01:26:56,942 --> 01:26:58,402
We've gone to subcommittee.

1228
01:26:58,902 --> 01:27:03,243
We've, what we've, this is something that has come from the executive order from the mayor.

1229
01:27:03,823 --> 01:27:19,112
If with that, as I told the citizen, if we can ask the mayor to give us an update where they are on this executive order that's coming for them about the eviction moratorium and make sure the public understands that this is not a city council.

1230
01:27:19,592 --> 01:27:26,476
This wasn't driven by the city council because they don't care about people that are getting kicked out of their houses and being left homeless.

1231
01:27:26,797 --> 01:27:28,177
That's the furthest from the case.

1232
01:27:28,638 --> 01:27:32,100
So if we can, can we just get an update from the mayor, that'd be appreciated.

1233
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:32,460
Thank you.

1234
01:27:33,272 --> 01:27:34,833
Thank you, Mr. President.

1235
01:27:35,053 --> 01:27:35,733
Councilor Felco.

1236
01:27:35,793 --> 01:27:36,513
Thank you, Mr. President.

1237
01:27:36,533 --> 01:27:42,056
And if I just may add before we end this meeting, I know we talked about this a little bit in committee the whole earlier tonight.

1238
01:27:42,696 --> 01:27:50,519
Just a big thank you to the Human Rights Commission for organizing the King Day event yesterday.

1239
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:58,502
It was a great event, very informative, great speakers, and I just want to thank them for putting that together.

1240
01:27:58,642 --> 01:27:59,363
So thank you.

1241
01:27:59,423 --> 01:28:02,364
And I know a lot of my colleagues were on the line as well listening to that.

1242
01:28:03,004 --> 01:28:04,745
in watching it on Facebook, so thank you.

1243
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:05,286
Thank you.

1244
01:28:06,627 --> 01:28:07,227
Councilor Beas.

1245
01:28:08,968 --> 01:28:09,929
Thank you, Mr. President.

1246
01:28:10,029 --> 01:28:25,579
I just wanted to let residents and Councilor Scarpelli know we will be having a subcommittee on elderly and housing affairs next Wednesday, the 27th, to get an update from the mayor on the eviction moratorium and where the mayor's office is.

1247
01:28:25,719 --> 01:28:29,942
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli is correct, the mayor is the person who could issue this order.

1248
01:28:30,282 --> 01:28:30,622
Thank you.

1249
01:28:30,782 --> 01:28:31,663
Thank you, Councilor Beas.

1250
01:28:32,003 --> 01:28:39,550
Councilors, if you can contact me after the meeting in regards to a potential conflict with that meeting.

1251
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,741
Okay, I appreciate it.

1252
01:28:41,761 --> 01:28:42,141
Mr. President.

Councilor Morrell.

1254
01:28:44,123 --> 01:28:58,375
If I could, I just wanted to share that the commission on parking policy and enforcement is holding two public meetings with the intention to learn more about the mission of the commission, their ongoing work, and to provide feedback on current parking policies.

1255
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,037
There'll be one morning and one evening.

1256
01:29:01,177 --> 01:29:02,538
The first one is a morning one.

1257
01:29:02,638 --> 01:29:03,839
It is on Thursday, the 21st at 9 a.m.

1258
01:29:05,447 --> 01:29:07,669
The Zoom link for it can be found on the city website.

1259
01:29:07,749 --> 01:29:13,434
It's at medfordma.org slash boards slash parking dash policy.

1260
01:29:13,534 --> 01:29:16,877
I can put it on Facebook as well, but it should be easy to find on the city website.
