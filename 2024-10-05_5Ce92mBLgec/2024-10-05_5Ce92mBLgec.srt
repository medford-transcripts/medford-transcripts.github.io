1
00:00:00,902 --> 00:00:02,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, friends and neighbors.

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:10,789
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Terry E. Carter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:23,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to our inaugural edition of the live monthly presentation of Fresh Friday's Words and Music, rebranded, carved, and sanded for the month of October

4
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:50,976
[SPEAKER_05]: We are happy to be back following a great summer of WMCC programs, including the 5th Medford Jazz Festival, Hoops and Hope, the West Medford Senior Club Barbecue, the new commemorative brick installation, Summer Girls Basketball, our recent annual meeting, and the first in the annual community legislative forum.

5
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:56,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So things are definitely percolating here at 111 Arlington Street.

6
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:08,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks in part to assistance from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, Fresh Fridays is back and all new for another year.

7
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:14,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So as fall rolls in, we want to remind you that COVID is still out there.

8
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:18,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns.

9
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:21,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So masking is welcome, but not required.

10
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:27,096
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, we're just happy to be here sponsoring live programming at WMCC.

11
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:32,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're really, really glad to see our neighbors, our friends, and our supporters coming through the door.

12
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:35,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much for being here.

13
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:47,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks also to our other event sponsor, Kevin Harrington back there with Medford Community Media, and volunteer Mark Davidson is with them.

14
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:57,160
[SPEAKER_05]: They are consistently guiding us as we broadcast to you via MCM channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon.

15
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,064
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as on the MCM YouTube channel.

16
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:10,393
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're out there watching on your electronic devices, your computers, your telephones, television, what have you, welcome to the show.

17
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:15,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've got phones, if you want to put them on silent, that would be real good.

18
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:31,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so in my travels as a poet and an ambassador for the arts, I've been privileged to encounter some tremendous teachers, leaders, and history makers across a wide panorama of human endeavor.

19
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Words and music has given me the opportunity to bring a lot of those folks to your attention.

20
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:43,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight is no exception, so I hope you're ready for insightful and delightful.

21
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:57,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess for this evening, is relatively new to Medford, but she has already made a significant and positive impression on everyone who has crossed her path.

22
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:00,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I should ask you about your pronouns.

23
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:03,046
[SPEAKER_05]: She and her is good?

24
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:03,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all right.

25
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:13,321
[SPEAKER_05]: She is the inaugural leader of Medford's first ever creative arts center, the long-awaited arts collaborative Medford.

26
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:18,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Please welcome Regina Parkinson to Fresh Friday's Words and Music.

27
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:34,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So a little bit about Regina, she relocated the greater Boston area from New Orleans in Louisiana in May of 2021 for postgraduate studies and professional duties at Artists for Humanity of Boston.

28
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:40,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Artists for Humanity is a non-profit organization that hires teens to create art.

29
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:44,726
[SPEAKER_05]: and design projects for clients and communities.

30
00:03:45,547 --> 00:04:06,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Then prior to coming East, she had been a successful arts administrator in the Big Easy, where her work included co-founding a large-scale contemporary public event called the Lucky Art Fair, which showcased 30-plus visual artists and had more than 2,000 visitors over two weekends.

31
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

32
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:16,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Regina is passionate about creating and strengthening community partnerships and advancing the missions of social impact organizations.

33
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:23,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten to know her a little bit over these past several months, and she's a congenial and energetic person to be around.

34
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:37,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as Regina describes it, she was, I'm taking your words, over the moon to take on the new role of becoming the executive director of the brand new arts collaborative Medford in January of this year.

35
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:52,123
[SPEAKER_05]: She was found through an extensive search, and as you'll soon see, her accomplishments thus far has positioned our new community arts center for great success, both now and in the future.

36
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Regina Parkinson.

37
00:04:55,425 --> 00:05:03,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I'd like to share a little bit of verse to help shape the evening.

38
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:10,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know that I believe that poetry should be, above all things, accessible and inclusive.

39
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So this piece is called The Deep End of the Ocean.

40
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,111
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could just find it.

41
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:19,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

42
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:43,317
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of gripes me when so-called poets try to be deep, try to be down with each blade of Viridian green glass, and each waft of the Zephyrus breeze, and each chiseled rib on the Parthenon's Doric columns, and each silicate grain on the beaches of Bali.

43
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really take all that.

44
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:49,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Sat in a poetry performance seminar the other day.

45
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:59,211
[SPEAKER_04]: All the so-called poets were renowned in literary circles with credentials and certifications and designations up the wazoo.

46
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:18,598
[SPEAKER_05]: They had an elitist conclave about the poets of the next wave with all sorts of feminist fusillades against misogynistic menfolk and the sensual nature of egg yolk and the extremist views of James Polk and a whole bunch of mirrors in gray smoke, acting like they're so dang woke and can't even take a good joke.

47
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,860
[SPEAKER_05]: To my apparently untrained ear, however,

48
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:43,560
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't have much to say, other than polysyllabic pronouncements about the sweeping expanse of the waters on Mars, metrical landscapes and metaphors czars, about the deep end of the ocean, and how one must choke, bleed, and die to swim there.

49
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:48,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not what a brown-skinned poet like me is trying to tell y'all.

50
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:53,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about those Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes Be For Real lyrics.

51
00:06:54,051 --> 00:07:03,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the Child of the Universe bit and the no less than the rocks and trees part, but I'm just trying to tell my people that we're going to be all right.

52
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,309
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a story, too.

53
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:08,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Our existence is filled with poetry, too.

54
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need the deep end of the ocean to grow widening rivulets for me to contemplate.

55
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:20,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I'm going to anthropomorph into anything, it's going to be the lion of my pride.

56
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:30,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the shallow end of the pool, y'all, but not because my light is less dim and not because we brothers can't swim.

57
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:38,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because I know you'll see me better if the riptides of prideful intellect aren't constantly trying to pull me under.

58
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:55,829
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing even remotely poetic about another brother's creative juices being stifled, strangled, or silenced by condescending heretics or acid tongue polymics of ivory tower academics and Hegelian dialectics.

59
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:58,434
[SPEAKER_05]: do a Google search.

60
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:11,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Webinars and Zoom conferences, symposiums, consortiums, go-to meetings, and bucolic retreats can take you to all those deep places where the deep folk are holding forth.

61
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:14,138
[SPEAKER_05]: You're really smart, great.

62
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,999
[SPEAKER_05]: You're incredibly articulate, wonderful.

63
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:20,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You're intellectually gifted, cool.

64
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:26,243
[SPEAKER_05]: But a generous God didn't give you those gifts so you could rub folks' noses in them.

65
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:34,026
[SPEAKER_05]: BS, MS, and PhD ain't supposed to be called for bush, mush, pout higher and deeper.

66
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:36,677
[SPEAKER_05]: My river don't flow like that.

67
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:42,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Shakespeare was a safety school of the people, by the people, and for the people.

68
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean all of the people.

69
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Dunbar was total negritude with the mask and Melendian mind.

70
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Langston brought simple home.

71
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:53,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Maya brought traveling shoes.

72
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:57,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Barack bought caba, and Teddy G was about a cat in a hat.

73
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:13,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Poetry is organically rich, unlike any dissertation of the nutrient component comprised by the writer's literary compost, unlike any declamation of the metaphysics of metrical departures to the deep end of the ocean.

74
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:23,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you came here tonight to hear something esoteric, iconoclastic, or intellectually effete, I guess I'm going to have to take an incomplete.

75
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:24,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

76
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:26,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not down with that beat.

77
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:39,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a plain spoken poet with red velvet verses and no coded curses, speaking simple truth to power, obeying the scripture's sober call to write the revelation down and make it plain on tablets so that a herald can run with it.

78
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And no less than the rocks and the trees, I got a right to be here.

79
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:59,918
[SPEAKER_04]: As for the unfolding of the universe, I'm leaving that to all the so-called poets renowned in literary circles with credentials and certifications and designations at the deep end of the ocean.

80
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,801
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're ready to go.

81
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:04,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

82
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:11,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's how we're going to move.

83
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,828
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a nice, friendly chat with Regina.

84
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:22,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So Regina, talk about making the transition from Louisiana to Boston after having spent a number of years in Cajun country.

85
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

86
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:32,149
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about New Orleans that attracts so many people to it and keeps so many people there is that when you're born there, it's your whole life.

87
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:38,415
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go there, you really feel the sense of community stronger than I've ever felt it anywhere.

88
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:40,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's what made me want to move there.

89
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:44,480
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was there, it's what made me realize that this was my home.

90
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:47,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I felt that way about here.

91
00:10:49,485 --> 00:11:01,413
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was really enlightening and helpful, and their culture is beautiful, and I just feel so honored to have delved in it for a few years, but it became really clear to me why people feel that way about where they live.

92
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:02,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

93
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:04,195
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's profound.

94
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:07,697
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, that's not the deep end of the ocean, that's, but that's deep.

95
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:09,398
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

96
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,752
[SPEAKER_05]: What, if anything, did you know about Medford?

97
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:19,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And can you talk about being courted by the city to come be the ED of the Arts Collaborative?

98
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:24,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I lived in Medford immediately after I moved out of college.

99
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:25,438
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to UMass Amherst.

100
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,959
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother was getting his PhD at Tufts.

101
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,061
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a PhD in black holes.

102
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell you the title of the dissertation, but it's black holes.

103
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:37,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And I lived with him for a few months before I got a job and was living in Somerville.

104
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:42,378
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it just feels like the organic first place that I was trying to become an adult.

105
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:49,182
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, when I came back, and I moved back, and was working in South Boston, living in Medford, it just felt really natural.

106
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:58,026
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it came time to move on from Artists for Humanity, and that job posting was listed, it felt like some sort of divine intervention.

107
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,426
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, all right, very good.

108
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:06,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is maybe getting down in the weeds just a little bit.

109
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,253
[SPEAKER_05]: What was one significant thing the hiring committee was looking for?

110
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:16,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And what did you say to convince them that you were the right one for the job?

111
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at Susan Altman right now.

112
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:30,053
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were looking for someone that could see what had happened and what could happen.

113
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:30,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So a vision?

114
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:31,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.

115
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:37,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I just had that vision.

116
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,234
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was maybe born with that vision.

117
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:48,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I just tried to connect my past experiences to what could be really clearly.

118
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:50,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

119
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:55,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't mind me asking, what is a little bit of that vision?

120
00:12:56,502 --> 00:13:06,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this predates me by decades, and I'm standing on the work of many, many Medford natives, and I'm very aware of that.

121
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,528
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was clear that it was needed.

122
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:17,771
[SPEAKER_00]: It was clear we were answering a need that had existed, and there's no end to answering a need like that.

123
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:23,674
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's community, so it's ever-changing, and it can be as big as you can imagine it to be.

124
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:32,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vision is really to fulfill all the dreams of those people that got us here, and to give them everything they thought we could have.

125
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big vision, in other words.

126
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:34,879
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty big.

127
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a big vision.

128
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:37,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

129
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:41,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess you probably have answered the next question I was going to ask.

130
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of what attracted you to position in the area.

131
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:45,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But you knew it.

132
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:50,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had gotten a sent intervention for you.

133
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:51,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So that kind of answers that.

134
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:59,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So how have the first nine months gotten you ready for the next nine and beyond?

135
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:05,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's like training in a battlefield, you know, it's like I'm in the trenches.

136
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:05,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

137
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:08,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're busy and I don't think that'll stop.

138
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's good.

139
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:13,250
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to not react to things and just let them happen.

140
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,411
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that would be the training of the past nine months.

141
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:15,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

142
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:16,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

143
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:17,171
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

144
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.

145
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:21,373
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, obviously there's a bit of history now.

146
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:25,594
[SPEAKER_05]: What, what accomplishments are you proud, uh, most proud of so far?

147
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:29,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of the fact that we have 11 working artists in our building.

148
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:36,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of that and they're all active artists making their work in our building.

149
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:42,868
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of the fact that we have an after-school program that answers a need in our city where there's a little bit of a lack.

150
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:49,373
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of the fact that it is becoming very natural and organic for other

151
00:14:50,013 --> 00:15:04,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonprofits and organizations in our city to come to us to collaborate on the things that they need a home for okay that includes Reverend Wendy and the Sanctuary Church and that includes ensemble the ally project to be

152
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:06,744
[SPEAKER_05]: You were the first show.

153
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:10,487
[SPEAKER_05]: The first show.

154
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:17,992
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you that haven't been there, it's 162 Mystic Ave.

155
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:25,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And the big mural on top pops right out at you, so you can't miss it for anything else.

156
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,581
[SPEAKER_05]: The only other good mural on Mystic Ave is the one that I'm in.

157
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:30,261
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

158
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:31,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Down a little further.

159
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:33,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's in Somerville, and that's another story for another day.

160
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:34,464
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another story.

161
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:34,924
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

162
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:36,725
[SPEAKER_05]: But see these two murals, right?

163
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,146
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

164
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:39,286
[SPEAKER_05]: In any case.

165
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:40,107
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more murals.

166
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:40,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there will be.

167
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:41,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

168
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:41,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

169
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:47,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was amazing to have you guys there and be the inaugural show.

170
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:48,613
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really cool.

171
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:48,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

172
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:54,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And our second show was Amanda Palmer, um, who is also Boston Cambridge based.

173
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:55,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And she did a little pop up for fans.

174
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:57,816
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 80 people there and that was totally unexpected.

175
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:03,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so things have just really come our way that are, you know, of the people that we're making all this for.

176
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:03,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

177
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so many things.

178
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:15,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously on the second floor are the artist studios and classrooms and so forth.

179
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:28,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And then down on the bottom floor, there's a lot of really nice exhibit space and then an open space where the performances are set and they can be set vertically, they can be set horizontally.

180
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:34,436
[SPEAKER_05]: well designed and really, really interesting.

181
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:36,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So always something going on there.

182
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:42,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously the flip side of that is what major challenges have you come up against?

183
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:44,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one person.

184
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:47,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, who do we know that story?

185
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:48,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

186
00:16:48,307 --> 00:17:00,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's amazing that I'm here and that I'm in this position It was amazing that I have the board of directors that I have I cannot speak highly enough about them But we're a small team and we're trying to make big big things happen.

187
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:05,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they just don't have enough hours in my day Okay, which is a workable challenge, I think

188
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:15,302
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, well, you moved into the area with a whole lot of craziness kind of going on around you.

189
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:21,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And now kind of kitty corner to you, maybe, or is it directly across from you?

190
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:24,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this great American beer hall?

191
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:24,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

192
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:26,045
[SPEAKER_00]: They opened three weeks ago.

193
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:26,545
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

194
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:28,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Friend or foe?

195
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:28,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh friend.

196
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:29,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

197
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:30,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.

198
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:33,669
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out there and it's open space.

199
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:34,430
[SPEAKER_00]: It's live music.

200
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:40,635
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really going to change our, what I call the corridor that we're in and it's going to change Medford.

201
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:43,657
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where we, so it's awesome to have them on our side, literally.

202
00:17:44,187 --> 00:18:04,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those of you who haven't seen or heard about this great American beer hall, they moved into a huge space, craft beers up the yin-yang, all kinds of, you know, shows and performances going to be going on there all of the time,

203
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:12,310
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually are family friendly, so they have running around spaces for kids before the real drinking starts.

204
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:23,999
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's going to be another interesting departure for entertainment and socializing in Medford.

205
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:34,868
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're seeing is really like an answer to a lot of needs and lacks that we didn't have before, and so we have a community arts center now, we have a place to go hang out with your kids and grab an awesome local beer.

206
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:40,093
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really exciting to see Medford take on these big changes.

207
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:41,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome to be part of it.

208
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:49,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, West Medford, you know, was, you know, had, you know, kind of the benefit of getting kind of the first craft beer,

209
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:52,642
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of location right up the street on Harvard Avenue.

210
00:18:52,782 --> 00:19:00,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And Max Heineck, who is a poet and a songwriter and a singer himself, has been holding forth there for a little while now.

211
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:04,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know, craft beer emporium number two.

212
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,869
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a funny question.

213
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:11,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we had a little bit of a conversation about this over at the Arts Center.

214
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:18,113
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about being the neighbor of Medford's first ever legal cannabis dispensary?

215
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:22,675
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's like a really important embrace that they've done.

216
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:33,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they came in and thought about how they were going to affect the community in all ways, from all sides, and they partnered with someone that they felt like was a fit for their mission, which is very community oriented.

217
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,981
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's great.

218
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,322
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're a wonderful company to have on our side.

219
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:39,044
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be neighbors with.

220
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:39,824
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very friendly.

221
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:41,747
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so excited about our art.

222
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:45,251
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an extension of our current exhibition in their lobby space.

223
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:45,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness, okay.

224
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to sell artwork out of there.

225
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,014
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're friends.

226
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:48,895
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really good friends.

227
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:49,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

228
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:49,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

229
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:50,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

230
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:51,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

231
00:19:53,539 --> 00:20:02,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So will you talk a little bit about the past experiences that you've had that kind of prepped you for the role that you're in right now?

232
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:05,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that it's like fortune fire.

233
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:12,534
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I'm very happy to just be doing this as the sole employee at the moment is because I've done that before.

234
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:16,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the work is and what it takes.

235
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And also my passion is really there for supporting artists.

236
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:36,316
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had mentioned Lucky Art Fair And the thing about that fair is that we actually paid the artists to participate rather than having them pay us We didn't take any sales commissions It was all grassroots because I don't I did not feel in that moment in New Orleans and I don't feel generally that there's enough opportunity to really give

237
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:44,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Artists the leg up and getting their fiscal feet under them Which is this case for musicians is the case for visual artists.

238
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:49,815
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the case for craft artists I can go on and on but just being able to provide those resources.

239
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:51,077
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my life source.

240
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:51,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I

241
00:20:52,045 --> 00:21:01,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm really happy about that because whenever I go anywhere as a poet, I'm looking at folks and they're looking at me and we're trying to figure out who's going to do what first.

242
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's real good.

243
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:08,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk a little bit about your philosophy as an arts administrator.

244
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say it's similar to that idea.

245
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:19,266
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving people the connections and the resources so they don't think they're an artist, but they can actually paint.

246
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:23,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they see their artwork on a wall for the first time and they feel like a real artist.

247
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,276
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a real artist, they've been doing it in their living room, but they've never made an art sale and then we make their first art sale.

248
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,498
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just taking that and going one step further.

249
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:38,642
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a really awesome program in place in honor of Louise Mestrachot, who is one of the foundational people in our organization.

250
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:40,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a scholarship in her name.

251
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:46,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just accepted two scholars to be in our space, cost-free to them under her name, which is such an honor.

252
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:51,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so determined to get one of them her first major mural wall this year.

253
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,731
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be on the lookout, because that's going to be awesome.

254
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:55,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's my philosophy.

255
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:13,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and Louise, she was an artist in multiple mediums, and the work that you guys had on display, and the work that was being auctioned off, anybody who got anything from her really got a treasure, and they certainly got it at below retail.

256
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:24,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're gonna have another little auction coming up too, so just keep your eyes out, but we are very blessed to have some of her work on loan from her children, and yeah, it's really special to still have her name in our building.

257
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:42,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and Will Tenney, who is an eminent photographer in the Medford area, a lot of what you see on the wall in the West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project, the photographs that aren't archival, a lot of them are Will's photographs, and he

258
00:22:42,842 --> 00:23:02,041
[SPEAKER_05]: was instrumental in helping us put the book together as well as get this display which was housed at the Medford Historical Society for a little while and then at the library down in the lower level at the old building before we finally were able to kind of come to an agreement that this is where it should live permanently.

259
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:13,873
[SPEAKER_05]: But his exhibit over at ACM was really spectacular, and I was able to get a few little pieces of his work.

260
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:23,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean it's exhibits like that that really are showcasing the huge talent that exists in this community.

261
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:28,108
[SPEAKER_05]: are really very, very engaging, and people need to get out and see them.

262
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:30,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and his generosity can't go understated.

263
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:41,925
[SPEAKER_00]: He donated all of his artwork and any sales that we made, and he really pushed everyone he knew to come to that show, and all the sales that we made were split between us and Caché and Medfaird, which was just an incredible gift.

264
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:48,491
[SPEAKER_00]: on his behalf and I think our space is really meant to uplift Medford-based artists and make a regional name.

265
00:23:49,352 --> 00:23:55,497
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a little bit of back and forth in that space of artists that are specifically rooted in Medford and then artists that are nearby us as well.

266
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:57,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent, excellent, yeah.

267
00:23:57,338 --> 00:24:09,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a front end, with him it was a front end in the back and it came in with a wonderful opening and sold a bunch of stuff and then he had a closing to the show and a bunch of folks came in and

268
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a reunion.

269
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,930
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice.

270
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really enjoyed it, yeah.

271
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:22,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is Arts Collaborative Medford positioned for future success and longevity?

272
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,433
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.

273
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:38,538
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a super special gift in that space that I think only happens once in a lifetime, which is that because of the generosity of theory, we're gifted into that space cost free on a rent basis for 10 years.

274
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,482
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a future that we know is pretty stable.

275
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:48,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, the other ways that we're positioned is just community input.

276
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:54,894
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just people coming to us with ideas and with the verve to make it happen.

277
00:24:55,114 --> 00:24:56,736
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how we will succeed.

278
00:24:57,636 --> 00:24:59,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Are all your artist spaces filled now?

279
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two spaces open.

280
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

281
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody out there, you know, that's looking for a space?

282
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,462
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two spaces in a shared studio.

283
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:12,145
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a vault that we can't open and it's possible that the Isabella Stewart Gartner stolen paintings are in there.

284
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:13,805
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that that's not true.

285
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,687
[SPEAKER_00]: So come and get that studio space.

286
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:17,307
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

287
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:18,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could be a part of history.

288
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:19,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

289
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:19,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

290
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:20,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.

291
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,370
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something, they're out there somewhere.

292
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,070
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something in there.

293
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,551
[SPEAKER_05]: No reason why they couldn't be at ACM.

294
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:26,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

295
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:26,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um,

296
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:30,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you play a little game of word association with me?

297
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:30,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'd love to.

298
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:30,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

299
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:36,517
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so I'll give you a word and ask you to please give me a few sentences on what that word means to you.

300
00:25:36,757 --> 00:25:36,818
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

301
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:37,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you do that?

302
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:37,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

303
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:38,218
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

304
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:38,739
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

305
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Community.

306
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:50,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Community is, I believe, the thing that holds most people up on their darkest days and on their best days.

307
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:50,786
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

308
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:51,526
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

309
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:52,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Creativity.

310
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,256
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much a life source.

311
00:25:55,296 --> 00:26:03,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's pretty hard to go through life without some sort of outlet for everything you experience and I think creativity is that vehicle.

312
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful, wonderful.

313
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:06,542
[SPEAKER_05]: How about charity?

314
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:12,006
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we get so much when we give to other people.

315
00:26:13,026 --> 00:26:15,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And charity is really rad.

316
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

317
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:25,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We say in the kingdom, we say, press down, shaken together, running over, he'll give it back to you.

318
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:27,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, charity is wonderful.

319
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:29,917
[SPEAKER_05]: How about courage?

320
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:33,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Courage?

321
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:46,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Courage really comes from knowing yourself, trusting yourself, and just wanting to do things that don't exist already.

322
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:48,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow, okay, okay, all right, all right.

323
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:52,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this probably dovetails into that a little bit, adversity.

324
00:26:53,115 --> 00:26:55,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, adversity is the thing that you shape yourself against.

325
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:59,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I like that, I like that, okay.

326
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:01,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Perspective.

327
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:04,187
[SPEAKER_00]: It's necessary, it's very necessary.

328
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:14,651
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy to get stuck in your own little, you know, we're like on our phones all the time, we're like in our little worlds, but when you step back and you have a larger view, it's just, it's a real breath of fresh air.

329
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:17,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it is, it is.

330
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:18,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Stewardship.

331
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:22,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I feel like that's really synonymous with leadership, too.

332
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:30,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being a little bit more about other people than yourself and being willing to make those connections that are really fruitful.

333
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:56,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's absolutely essential in the role that you're playing now because resources are gonna come your way, people are gonna come, and you really do have to be a good steward of all of the gifts and the good things that come your way, and you also have to be a discriminating steward because everything that's good to you ain't necessarily good for you.

334
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you do have to be slightly selective.

335
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good, very good.

336
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:15,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So five years from now, what will you want the people of Medford to know about the collaborative and about your stewardship of the organization?

337
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:17,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, okay.

338
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:25,406
[SPEAKER_00]: In five years, I want people to know that it's accessible to them, in whatever that word means.

339
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:35,529
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to know that they have a home there, and I want them to know that I will always be so happy to see them.

340
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty simple.

341
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:44,152
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your statement on diversity, equity, and inclusion?

342
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:55,897
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, my statement on diversity, equity, inclusion is that

343
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:00,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a tough one.

344
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:03,730
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a specific thing.

345
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise you that there wouldn't be no gotchas, right?

346
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:16,661
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is, especially in Medford in this season, it's becoming so important for us to identify

347
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:30,247
[SPEAKER_05]: the organizations in the community that really are about allegiance and really are about fairness and really are about bringing people into the fold.

348
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:35,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not a gotcha.

349
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just kind of essential to your leadership.

350
00:29:40,091 --> 00:29:40,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.

351
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:50,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say with that that I'm, um, it might not seem like it cause we've done so much in nine months, but I'm actually really trying to take my time because I don't think that you can create true equity quickly.

352
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I think it's about a lot of face to face conversation.

353
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of rhetoric and fancy words for it.

354
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:01,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just about relationship and being really honest.

355
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:03,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I plan to do that.

356
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:09,133
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to take my time, um, and talk to everyone that wants to be a part of this and listen.

357
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:09,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

358
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:16,840
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take that and create what needs to be in order to create a space that is diverse and equitable and inclusive.

359
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:18,262
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will happen.

360
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, absolutely.

361
00:30:20,804 --> 00:30:22,205
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you tune out the noise?

362
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:30,793
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your go-to's in terms of relaxation and meditative spaces and all that good stuff?

363
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:42,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Music, long walks, white noise, and just good conversation where I can get everything off my chest.

364
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:46,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have all of that in your life?

365
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.

366
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very lucky.

367
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:48,682
[SPEAKER_05]: In abundance, I hope.

368
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:48,863
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.

369
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:50,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I have great walks in my life.

370
00:30:53,068 --> 00:31:01,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay What would people who are just meeting you for the first time be surprised to know about you

371
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

372
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:11,340
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'm not a natural redhead.

373
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:20,410
[SPEAKER_00]: That I used to be really into theater.

374
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.

375
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:27,077
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you fall away from being into theater?

376
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:28,618
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's here.

377
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:29,099
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

378
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:29,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's there.

379
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:31,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're still into theater.

380
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say this is what theater gave me, the ability to sit here at this table with you.

381
00:31:35,664 --> 00:31:36,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?

382
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:36,965
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

383
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:38,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

384
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:39,107
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

385
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:39,988
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

386
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:42,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So a turnabout is fair play.

387
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get to ask me whatever question you want to ask me.

388
00:31:48,054 --> 00:31:48,434
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

389
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:53,959
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first thought when you knew the Center was happening?

390
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:59,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So I go back to the first community center.

391
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:01,555
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the second building on the site.

392
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:14,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And we grew up as kids in the first building with a little old army barracks called the Quonset Hut that sat on a foundation that was poured by some guys from the neighborhood.

393
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:20,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Quonset Hut, the military hut, was trucked down here by the same guys.

394
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:26,393
[SPEAKER_05]: from Charlestown, I believe it was, where they had a temporary military installation.

395
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:34,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, I can't easily remember a time when we weren't at the community center.

396
00:32:35,943 --> 00:32:38,565
[SPEAKER_05]: We played basketball out back at Duggar Park.

397
00:32:41,468 --> 00:32:42,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a basement, actually.

398
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:45,671
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on a slab now, but the first building had a basement.

399
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:50,535
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had a pool table, bumper pool table, ping pong table down there.

400
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:53,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they had some little spaces in the back.

401
00:32:53,497 --> 00:33:04,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And in those little spaces in the back, we had modeling class, we had arts and crafts, we had all kinds of things that kept us kids busy and off the streets.

402
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:06,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were

403
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:09,828
[SPEAKER_05]: oodles of kids in the neighborhood when I was growing up.

404
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:24,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So the community center really was a hub of community engagement and a babysitter for the neighborhood's parents because they always knew that their kids were going to be pretty much in one of two places.

405
00:33:24,473 --> 00:33:28,835
[SPEAKER_05]: They were either going to be at the park or they were going to be at the community center.

406
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:36,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can remember my father, he would drive down in his old station wagon, and he'd roll down the window.

407
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:41,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, he's from one of the deepest places in Mississippi, right?

408
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:45,182
[SPEAKER_04]: If Mississippi got an ocean, he was from the deep end of that ocean.

409
00:33:45,803 --> 00:33:51,305
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, he would say, and I'm glad he's not in the room because he'd get me.

410
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:54,166
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd say, my brother's name is Jordan.

411
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:57,108
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd say, Jordan?

412
00:33:58,143 --> 00:33:58,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Jordan!

413
00:33:59,283 --> 00:34:04,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And then everybody, everybody who was playing ball at the time would chime in.

414
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:05,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like a chorus.

415
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:06,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Jordan!

416
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:08,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Jordan!

417
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:14,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are the kinds of memories I have of the first community center.

418
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:21,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming back, and I've been here for, it's going on 13 years now, managing elder services.

419
00:34:23,112 --> 00:34:26,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me an opportunity to do a couple of things.

420
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:27,873
[SPEAKER_05]: One, my mother was ailing.

421
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,394
[SPEAKER_05]: My father was ailing.

422
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:37,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a chance to come back, because I was living on the South Shore, I had a chance to come back and be with them.

423
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:44,197
[SPEAKER_05]: So working at the community center gave me a chance to reestablish my family community in ways that I hadn't been able to.

424
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:48,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And as they both passed, I was able to be present.

425
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:57,964
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a gift that I'm never going to be able to repay the community center for.

426
00:34:58,404 --> 00:35:05,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other thing is it gave me a chance to come and reclaim my place as a bit of the historian.

427
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:22,262
[SPEAKER_05]: History of the community center you know and be able to be one of the storytellers in the community center and I've sent it a lot of the poetry that I write on that particular aspect of being here so when I think of the communities and I.

428
00:35:22,842 --> 00:35:24,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think of it so fondly.

429
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of love for this place.

430
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:27,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, nothing lasts forever.

431
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:31,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But I came in as an interim.

432
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:34,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't think I was going to stay here for very long.

433
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:36,167
[SPEAKER_05]: But life shapes.

434
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:37,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Life shapes.

435
00:35:39,188 --> 00:35:41,008
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so I'm going to give you the last word.

436
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:42,769
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your parting thoughts?

437
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:44,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.

438
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, yes.

439
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:46,743
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be here.

440
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:48,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad that I'm here.

441
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:55,993
[SPEAKER_00]: My parting thoughts are that I hope that everything that you described is what we can create at Arts Collaborative Medford.

442
00:35:56,794 --> 00:36:03,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're on the brink of a lot of generations of memory and a lot of really beautiful shaping of our community.

443
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:04,382
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're in a really

444
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,323
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and interesting time at Medford.

445
00:36:07,243 --> 00:36:09,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited to be involved in it like in any way.

446
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:23,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you are swinging by Theory Wellness or you are swinging by Atlas Liquors or you're swinging by Great American Beer Hall, please stop in at Arts Collaborative Medford and say hello and look at some art and tell me what's on your mind.

447
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:24,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

448
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:28,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Come with my absolute highest recommendation.

449
00:36:29,094 --> 00:36:39,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's early in the game, but I can tell you from having had conversation with her and being over there for a couple events, it's going to be great.

450
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:40,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to stay great.

451
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,280
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to stay great.

452
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So avail yourself of the opportunity to go hang out, because she's a great host.

453
00:36:47,242 --> 00:36:48,023
[SPEAKER_05]: She really is, OK?

454
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:48,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll offer you water.

455
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:52,065
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a great guest as well, but she's a great host.

456
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:53,569
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

457
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,131
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

458
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much.

459
00:36:58,658 --> 00:36:59,118
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

460
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:06,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Bringing a new perspective and great talent to the arts community in greater Medford.

461
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:09,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important work that you're engaged in.

462
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:14,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope the city will treat you at least as well as it has treated me.

463
00:37:14,103 --> 00:37:20,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And to everyone watching, thanks so much for your attentiveness, your interest in our discussion.

466
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:34,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin.

467
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:41,658
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a break to reset our stage and share some WMCC announcements.

468
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go anywhere.

469
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:45,221
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

470
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,607
My chief steward over there.

471
00:37:55,627 --> 00:38:01,309
You can take your water if you want.

472
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:01,789
Thank you.

00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:02,649
And your can do.

474
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:04,210
So you know what to do with this, right?

475
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Do me a favor, Regina.

476
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Stick that in that mic stand right there.

477
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:54,534
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to gavel things to order, so to speak.

478
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:57,175
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

[SPEAKER_05]: So, first and foremost, thanks to everyone who joined us for our Summer 2024 events and our recent annual meeting.

[SPEAKER_05]: So, Pumpkin Smash.

490
00:40:34,326 --> 00:40:39,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and if you don't know what the Pumpkin Smash is, it's smashing pumpkins!

491
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:51,950
[SPEAKER_05]: In conjunction with Mothers Out Front, we'll be hosting the Pumpkin Smash early on Saturday, 11-2, 10-30 to one o'clock with Mothers Out Front.

492
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:08,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also want to, and unfortunately it's on the same day, the NAACP Freedom Fund Breakfast.

493
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:10,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's an important event.

494
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:13,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be over at Anthony's and Somerville.

495

[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:21,563
[SPEAKER_05]: 1130, excuse me.

498
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:25,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's always a wonderful event.

499
00:41:26,008 --> 00:41:28,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Great speakers, great music, a little poetry.

500
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:34,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be really nice, so make yourselves available for...

501
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:36,939
[SPEAKER_05]: for that.

502
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:47,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on 11-23, Saturday 11-23, we will have our annual Black Vendor and Holiday Fair here at the community center.

503
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:52,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful, wonderful vendors, all kinds of different goods.

504
00:41:53,674 --> 00:41:57,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a really, it's a great festive day.

505
00:41:57,657 --> 00:42:03,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So come out, spend some of your money in the neighborhood, and we'll be happy that you do.

506
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,053
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

507
00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:07,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if I can get myself together here.

508
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:10,658
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

509
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:13,240
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of paper, man.

510
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,901
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I doing with all this paper?

511
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:18,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I started out with all of this.

512
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:20,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

513
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:21,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

514
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:26,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my curse and my blessing.

515
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:27,571
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

516
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:37,530
[SPEAKER_05]: let's turn our attention to what I like to call the lyrical miracle that we've engaged for this evening's musical side of the ledger.

517
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:44,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Now tonight we feature a well-established and highly professional performer that has gained a huge

518
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:51,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that huge, but you know, that kind, you know, the good huge, not the bad huge.

519
00:42:52,405 --> 00:43:00,190
[SPEAKER_05]: A huge following and has also made some international friends as a singer, songwriter, musician, and teaching professional.

520
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:03,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Lydia, the lovely singer.

521
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:06,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Harrell is one of Boston's exceptional.

522
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:21,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Musical treasures, her sultry, soulful voice, this always chokes me up, and evocative songwriting have garnered her the attention and respect of the nation's finest musicians and venues.

523
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:32,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Lydia has shown an unbreakable ability to mold herself into any musical situation, jazz, pop, folk, soul, you name it.

524
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:49,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it performing with the Boston Pops, presenting her own original tunes, or serenading NBA fans with America's national anthem, Lydia's dedication to extracting the pure essence of the song goes virtually unmatched.

525
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:51,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here for this.

526
00:43:51,932 --> 00:44:12,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Lydia consistently performs in more than 150 shows a year, and not only as a solo actor, but in collaboration with other artists, such as world-renowned jazz musician, Bobby Floyd, and as one half of the duo, The Lady Parts, providing background vocals for Zap Mama, Ryan Montblanc,

527
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:14,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Albert Cummings and more.

528
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:31,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Recent musical accolades include singing lead on a Bob Marley tribute album, distributed by Sony Music Latin, winning the 2015 Duke Ellington Jazz Vocal Competition, performing at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York,

529
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:44,454
[SPEAKER_05]: winning the 2017 Mid-Atlantic Jazz Festival Voice Competition and recently being promoted to Assistant Professor of Voice at Berklee College of Music.

530
00:44:46,756 --> 00:44:47,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

531
00:44:48,597 --> 00:45:00,484
[SPEAKER_05]: She is a really hard-working musical miracle and the mom to an exceptional young son who takes great pride, I know this for a fact, in his exceptional mother.

532
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:12,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now the lovely singer is ably assisted by the multi-talented musician and songwriter Shindi, who we are welcoming.

533
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:13,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

534
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:18,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, two Fresh Fridays for the first time.

535
00:45:18,698 --> 00:45:22,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Shin is a New Yorker, currently based in Malden, Mass.

536
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:26,124
[SPEAKER_05]: He plays the bass and the acoustic guitar and probably a whole bunch of other stuff.

537
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:33,490
[SPEAKER_05]: He is also a sound engineer and music producer who has a lot of music out there on various platforms.

538
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,712
[SPEAKER_05]: He is also the proud father to a young son.

539
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:37,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

540
00:45:38,574 --> 00:45:39,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And daughter.

541
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:39,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And daughter.

542
00:45:39,795 --> 00:45:40,295
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, very good.

543
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting it, you know, sometimes on the way.

544
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So musical parents are in the building.

545
00:45:46,225 --> 00:45:50,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to West Medford, Lydia, and nice to meet you, Shindig.

546
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:53,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna get out the way and let y'all do what you do.

547
00:45:54,597 --> 00:45:55,758
You are never in the way.

548
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:56,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

549
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:03,770
[SPEAKER_11]: So Terry told me that it would be nice if I sang something from the Billie Holiday show.

550
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't come here with my pianist.

551
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,791
[SPEAKER_11]: And usually, that's what I do the Billie Holiday stuff with.

552
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:13,252
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to try something new with you and have a, because I do a lot of stuff.

553
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:15,052
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured, let's go a different direction.

554
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:19,313
[SPEAKER_11]: But I am going to sing Strange Fruit.

555
00:46:19,553 --> 00:46:25,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured I would start with that and just do it acapella, because that's a song you don't always need the accompaniment for.

556
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:42,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Southern trees bear strange fruit.

557
00:46:44,406 --> 00:46:51,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Blood on the leaves and blood at the root.

558
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:58,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze.

559
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:01,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Strange fruit hanging.

560
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:06,063
[SPEAKER_11]: From the poplar trees.

561
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:14,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Pastoral scene of the gallant south.

562
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:21,753
[SPEAKER_11]: The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth.

563
00:47:22,914 --> 00:47:28,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Scent of magnolia, sweet and fresh.

564
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:35,524
[SPEAKER_11]: than the sudden smell of burning flesh.

565
00:47:37,685 --> 00:47:58,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck, for the rain to gather, for the wind to suck, for the sun to rot,

566
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:08,137
[SPEAKER_10]: for the trees to drop.

567
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:18,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is a strange and bitter crop.

568
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:30,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

569
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:35,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

570
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:41,396
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a deep song, and I figured I'll do it now instead of doing a bunch of other songs and then trying to get into that.

571
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:43,497
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I can get there from the start.

572
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:47,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so sad for me to not do that show.

573
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,400
[SPEAKER_11]: It bummed me out.

574
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,060
[SPEAKER_11]: It really did.

575
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And I still apologize to this day for people that did get tickets.

576
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:53,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

577
00:48:53,103 --> 00:48:54,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea why it happened the way.

578
00:48:54,904 --> 00:48:56,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we all know why it happened.

579
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:58,986
[SPEAKER_11]: But the company closed as well, so I'm

580
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:05,296
[SPEAKER_11]: broke my heart, but thank you for wanting to hear more of it, because I love singing Billie Holiday.

581
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:08,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought my ukulele.

582
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,641
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been playing it a lot lately.

583
00:49:11,661 --> 00:49:12,542
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been writing on it.

584
00:49:13,823 --> 00:49:18,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Many years I've been writing on it, actually, but this one, yeah, this one's who's coming with me.

585
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:23,530
[SPEAKER_11]: This one I wrote, it's one of the first ones I wrote, because I learned blues on here first.

586
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:26,092
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't learn Hawaiian songs, you know what I'm saying?

587
00:49:26,623 --> 00:49:27,924
[SPEAKER_11]: No shade, I love Hawaiian songs.

588
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,565
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I didn't, everyone's like, tiny bubbles.

589
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I don't know anything about bubbles.

590
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:32,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know, I just know these.

591
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:39,251
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here we go.

592
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,071
Let's see.

593
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:04,544
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about that time for some change.

594
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:09,109
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't like how things are, that's when you rearrange.

595
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:10,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's coming with me?

596
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:22,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be scared, step right up.

597
00:50:23,644 --> 00:50:27,708
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's half-empty, come and fill your cup for who's coming with me.

598
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:32,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, we gotta stop.

599
00:50:34,393 --> 00:50:36,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about what we're doing.

600
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:41,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't think too long, got to get busy aside this schooling.

601
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, who's coming with me?

602
00:50:48,271 --> 00:50:49,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's coming with me?

603
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:57,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I can see right under the door.

604
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Ain't nothing stopping me no more.

605
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:03,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's coming with me?

606
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:12,158
[SPEAKER_11]: We may feel as if we're lost and all alone.

607
00:51:12,218 --> 00:51:16,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes that's when you got to stop playing with your smartphone.

608
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Things stop you from your dreams.

609
00:51:22,422 --> 00:51:23,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Come in with me.

610
00:51:23,523 --> 00:51:23,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh.

611
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:27,486
I said, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

612
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:33,032
I said, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

613
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:46,270
feel.

614
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:49,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone said something, give them something now, yeah.

615
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:28,627
[SPEAKER_10]: know what could happen tomorrow.

616
00:52:29,088 --> 00:52:31,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Honey, pull yourself together.

617
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:34,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Let go of your sorrow.

618
00:52:34,853 --> 00:52:36,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's coming with me?

619
00:52:36,994 --> 00:52:39,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's coming with me?

620
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:42,960
[SPEAKER_11]: No, don't you ever, ever stop.

621
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,261
Hey, let's go.

622
00:52:44,321 --> 00:52:46,823
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going straight through.

623
00:52:57,764 --> 00:53:02,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you coming, are you coming, coming with me?

624
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:08,311
Are you coming, are you coming, are you coming with me?

625
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:13,634
Are you coming, are you coming, coming with me?

626
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:18,417
Are you coming, are you coming, are you coming with me?

627
00:53:34,071 --> 00:53:36,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

628
00:53:41,777 --> 00:53:54,145
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so that one's one I just like to do to get people uplifted and excited and everything, but I'm looking at my list to make sure I cover the ones I really wanted to do and then go back to the other ones if it's like we're out of time, you know what I'm saying?

629
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:56,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I want to go straight to Stevie Wonder.

630
00:53:57,248 --> 00:53:58,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one?

631
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I love him so much.

632
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:01,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

633
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:06,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we have to do switching because he's so talented.

634
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:08,926
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to, you know, give him a moment to go to the other.

635
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:09,507
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's all right.

636
00:54:10,628 --> 00:54:11,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I promise it's worth it.

637
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:17,714
[SPEAKER_11]: I have known Shindig, goodness, early 2000s.

638
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:22,058
[SPEAKER_11]: And I knew him when he lived in New York.

639
00:54:22,779 --> 00:54:26,302
[SPEAKER_11]: So actually, he lived in Medford when he first moved here.

640
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:28,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And he didn't know about this until today.

641
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:31,002
[SPEAKER_11]: or well, until I asked him to do the gig.

642
00:54:31,022 --> 00:54:37,727
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's just like, when he walks in, he's like, we were up the street, what is this?

643
00:54:38,348 --> 00:54:40,029
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, well, now he knows.

644
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:45,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, he's still only in Malden, so it's, you know, he could still come by and hang and bring the kids, you know what I'm saying?

645
00:54:45,253 --> 00:54:45,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, yes.

646
00:54:46,554 --> 00:54:50,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really, I love when people see something for the first time and it's something beautiful.

647
00:54:50,917 --> 00:54:55,421
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've just, this is tremendous that it has been here this long and that it continues.

648
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:58,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Terry and all of your team for making that happen.

649
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:07,363
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, this song is, I don't remember the album, but it is part of a double song release thing.

650
00:55:08,203 --> 00:55:13,445
[SPEAKER_11]: The song's title is Superwoman, but then it says in parentheses, where were you when I needed you?

651
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:17,366
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not because it's an alternate title, it's because it's two different songs.

652
00:55:18,406 --> 00:55:19,786
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody's heard it, you know what I'm talking about.

653
00:55:19,826 --> 00:55:25,668
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes out of the other one, it goes, Mary wants to be a superwoman, very well, all of that, right?

654
00:55:26,028 --> 00:55:28,949
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it goes into this amazing song called Where Were You?

655
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:31,134
[SPEAKER_11]: When I Needed You.

656
00:55:33,116 --> 00:55:34,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, thank you.

657
00:55:34,178 --> 00:55:35,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, excellent album.

658
00:55:38,122 --> 00:55:42,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Stevie Wonder is, I teach advanced improv at Berklee College of Music.

659
00:55:42,207 --> 00:55:43,369
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the many things I teach.

660
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:45,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Stevie Wonder is my all-time favorite singer.

661
00:55:46,603 --> 00:55:53,289
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had this really great opportunity to do a whole deep dive into my top singer.

662
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:53,890
[SPEAKER_11]: We just did it.

663
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,053
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually had them sing in higher ground, which I will be doing later, hopefully.

664
00:55:58,153 --> 00:55:59,074
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll try to fit that in.

665
00:56:00,516 --> 00:56:02,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of them picked things that I didn't think they would pick.

666
00:56:03,058 --> 00:56:04,719
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was really fun to see that.

667
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're on to Brandy, who's a whole other.

668
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:10,085
[SPEAKER_11]: whole other can of worms, but it's really fun.

669
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:11,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And pretty soon we'll do Earth, Wind, and Fire, too.

670
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty excited about that as well.

671
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:13,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

672
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's just get right into the good stuff, right?

673
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:16,514
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

674
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:36,791
[SPEAKER_11]: When the summer came, you were not around.

675
00:56:37,652 --> 00:56:42,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the summer's gone, and love cannot be found.

676
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Where were you when I needed you last winter?

677
00:56:50,351 --> 00:57:05,888
[SPEAKER_11]: My love, when the winter came, you went further south, parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt.

678
00:57:06,729 --> 00:57:10,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Where were you when I needed you like

679
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:16,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, yeah.

680
00:57:17,223 --> 00:57:21,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Our love is at an end.

681
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:27,852
[SPEAKER_11]: But you say now things have changed.

682
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:35,398
[SPEAKER_10]: But tomorrow will reflect love's past.

683
00:57:40,998 --> 00:57:45,519
[SPEAKER_11]: When the winter came, you were not around.

684
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:52,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you say you changed, but it just can't be found.

685
00:57:53,582 --> 00:57:56,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Where were you when I needed you?

686
00:57:57,123 --> 00:57:59,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Where were you when I needed you?

687
00:57:59,204 --> 00:58:04,486
[SPEAKER_07]: La, la, la, la, la.

688
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:28,338
[SPEAKER_09]: ♪ La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

689
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, our love is at an end.

690
00:59:15,615 --> 00:59:16,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it up for him.

691
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:22,075
[SPEAKER_11]: But you say now things have changed.

692
00:59:22,737 --> 00:59:29,129
[SPEAKER_11]: But tomorrow, tomorrow will reflect love's past.

693
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Spring will fill the air when you come around.

694
00:59:39,856 --> 00:59:44,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Will the summer love and will it let me down?

695
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:50,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Where were you and I when I needed you last winter?

696
00:59:50,506 --> 00:59:53,509
[SPEAKER_11]: My love, my love.

697
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:02,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my love, my love, my love, my love.

01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,041
[SPEAKER_09]: My, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

699
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,063
[SPEAKER_09]: My love.

700
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:08,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Love.

701
01:00:08,843 --> 01:00:10,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

702
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:11,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

703
01:00:30,557 --> 01:00:32,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Where were you when I needed you?

704
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:44,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Like right, like right, like right.

705
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:48,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

706
01:00:57,338 --> 01:00:59,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, I got hot, I knew it was gonna happen.

707
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

708
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I'll wear a sweater, but I'll probably take the sweater off.

709
01:01:05,003 --> 01:01:10,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I play the ukulele better when my skin is touching it rather than cloth, it slips.

710
01:01:11,107 --> 01:01:13,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'm like, I can't get that.

711
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:14,709
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is better.

712
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:16,410
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, what am I gonna do?

713
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,371
[SPEAKER_11]: This is so much fun, I love doing this.

714
01:01:18,732 --> 01:01:20,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I have a new song.

715
01:01:21,653 --> 01:01:22,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one is it?

716
01:01:22,674 --> 01:01:23,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Under the Same Sky.

717
01:01:24,015 --> 01:01:25,156
[SPEAKER_11]: The one that I was talking about.

718
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:32,180
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do, I know you see me looking at this, on this one, I have to look at it still, because it's that new.

719
01:01:32,681 --> 01:01:33,962
[SPEAKER_11]: But I still want to share it.

720
01:01:34,842 --> 01:01:37,084
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have a lot of it memorized, so we'll see what happens.

721
01:01:37,124 --> 01:01:40,546
[SPEAKER_11]: If you see me stumble, you're getting the brand new song.

722
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:47,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, I'd say, what, right, Fresh Friday, come on.

723
01:01:47,891 --> 01:01:48,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.

724
01:01:50,529 --> 01:01:54,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I have like a rough recording on my phone or something, so I cannot wait to get this done.

725
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:56,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Shindig wants to record it.

726
01:01:57,393 --> 01:02:00,414
[SPEAKER_11]: We're both hearing really great ideas, so yeah.

727
01:02:00,594 --> 01:02:06,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's about, I tried to make it as general as possible so that we could all relate.

728
01:02:07,138 --> 01:02:18,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about you, but when I'm sitting and people watching, I actually think about things like, we are all under the same sky, we are looking at the same things, and life is happening.

729
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:19,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And it can be good,

730
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:41,635
[SPEAKER_11]: not be good and even like right now our lives were in progress and now we're all in this room together and i just think that's so amazing that we're i don't even know how to put it into the right words except for the little bit that i said in my song so i hope you enjoy it um we're trying to deal with it i hear we're hearing a distortion so we're trying to like work on that if you're if you're seeing that no it's okay you're fine though you really are

731
01:02:42,245 --> 01:02:43,986
[SPEAKER_11]: still playing great even through the distortion.

732
01:03:20,242 --> 01:03:22,703
[SPEAKER_11]: I like this hat, the Celtics pink hat.

733
01:03:26,766 --> 01:03:28,247
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost wore my Celtics dress today.

734
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I sang for the Celtics three times.

735
01:03:35,891 --> 01:03:37,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I sang the national anthem.

736
01:03:38,669 --> 01:03:39,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember the years, I'm sorry.

737
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when it was 2009.

738
01:03:43,173 --> 01:03:46,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the third time though, when I did it, I believe that was 2014 or 15.

739
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:48,998
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had to sing the Canadian one as well.

740
01:03:49,518 --> 01:03:51,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my goodness, I was so nervous.

741
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I'm gonna screw up somebody's national anthem.

742
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:57,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I start to sing and everybody that was from there started singing.

743
01:03:57,585 --> 01:03:58,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I'm fine.

744
01:03:59,487 --> 01:03:59,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

745
01:04:01,148 --> 01:04:02,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Not as many people were singing along to ours.

746
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:03,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Ours is hard.

747
01:04:03,529 --> 01:04:05,350
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot of octaves and stuff.

748
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,851
[SPEAKER_11]: But theirs, it stays kind of in this general area.

749
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:10,532
[SPEAKER_11]: So as I started to forget, I heard somebody else sing.

750
01:04:10,572 --> 01:04:11,933
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was like, oh, OK.

751
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:12,873
[SPEAKER_11]: We're good.

752
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:14,174
[SPEAKER_11]: It's safe.

753
01:04:14,274 --> 01:04:14,974
[SPEAKER_11]: It was frightening.

754
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:17,455
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was quite an experience.

755
01:04:17,515 --> 01:04:18,075
[SPEAKER_11]: It really was.

756
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like that they won recently.

757
01:04:21,957 --> 01:04:22,457
[SPEAKER_11]: That was nice.

758
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:23,878
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a sports fan, I know I am.

759
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:26,039
What's that doing?

760
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds OK now.

761
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:35,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you.

762
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:37,003
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.

763
01:05:20,089 --> 01:05:40,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Ž Ž Ž Under the same sky Ž Ž Ž People are living Ž Ž People are dying Ž Ž Ž Scheming and dreaming Ž

764
01:05:47,494 --> 01:05:56,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Sharing and stealing, reveling in the glamour of it all.

765
01:05:56,496 --> 01:06:01,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Suffering in disaster and downfall.

766
01:06:02,778 --> 01:06:07,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Under a watchful eye.

767
01:06:08,759 --> 01:06:10,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Under the same sky.

768
01:06:16,242 --> 01:06:25,530
[SPEAKER_10]: All of the sun and the moon, the brilliance of all those stars.

769
01:06:27,591 --> 01:06:32,355
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened this afternoon?

770
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:34,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Let it go.

771
01:06:34,376 --> 01:06:39,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it no more space in your mind.

772
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:42,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Life has such limited time.

773
01:06:45,327 --> 01:06:50,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't regret you're down the line.

774
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:52,151
Look up.

775
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:54,472
[SPEAKER_11]: See the sky.

776
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:56,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't cry.

777
01:06:57,193 --> 01:06:58,754
[SPEAKER_11]: There's your answer.

778
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

779
01:07:00,335 --> 01:07:04,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

780
01:07:04,177 --> 01:07:05,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Under the same sky.

781
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:12,521
[SPEAKER_11]: People are living and people are dying.

782
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:22,575
[SPEAKER_10]: They're scheming and dreaming.

783
01:07:22,635 --> 01:07:28,341
[SPEAKER_10]: They're sharing and stealing.

784
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:34,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Burbling in the glamour of it all.

785
01:07:34,887 --> 01:07:37,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Suffering and disaster and downfall.

786
01:08:00,256 --> 01:08:06,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Under a watchful eye.

787
01:08:06,658 --> 01:08:10,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Under a watchful eye.

788
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:14,580
[SPEAKER_10]: And under the same sky.

789
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,520
Ooh.

790
01:08:29,775 --> 01:08:37,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

791
01:08:37,499 --> 01:08:37,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

792
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,000
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm like hearing strings.

793
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,441
[SPEAKER_11]: He's actually beatboxing the beat he's imagining.

794
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:44,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you hear it too, right?

795
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:46,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, absolutely.

796
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:46,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

797
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:51,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Now let's look at, oh yeah, I don't know if I'm ready to do that at all.

798
01:08:51,647 --> 01:08:53,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do the shimmy.

799
01:08:53,788 --> 01:08:55,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes, all right.

800
01:08:56,209 --> 01:08:57,550
[SPEAKER_11]: So I watched this documentary.

801
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:02,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna say, I don't remember when this person passed away, but it was recent.

802
01:09:03,898 --> 01:09:07,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason I'm waiting to tell you is because I want everybody to go, oh, okay.

803
01:09:09,001 --> 01:09:21,990
[SPEAKER_11]: But I watched this documentary about her, and I thought, oh my goodness, her story is so tragic, and she was such a beautiful person and artist, but she got a lot of, when I say her name, you're gonna know exactly why.

804
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Sinead O'Connor, right.

805
01:09:25,554 --> 01:09:29,735
[SPEAKER_11]: And she passed away two weeks after I watched her documentary, so that just touched me even more.

806
01:09:29,775 --> 01:09:34,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh man, I wanted to go to Ireland and say, hey girl, it's okay, you know?

807
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,898
[SPEAKER_11]: And she was all for black folks.

808
01:09:36,938 --> 01:09:38,078
[SPEAKER_11]: She was about that life.

809
01:09:38,118 --> 01:09:41,839
[SPEAKER_11]: She had public enemy on the side, and Shin met her.

810
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:43,780
[SPEAKER_11]: He told me about that today.

811
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Or he saw her, he didn't meet her.

812
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,100
[SPEAKER_11]: You saw her?

813
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:47,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you saw her, that's what it was.

814
01:09:48,038 --> 01:09:53,342
[SPEAKER_11]: What a rough life and tough thing she went through, but she made beautiful music.

815
01:09:54,082 --> 01:09:56,844
[SPEAKER_11]: And this song was in her documentary.

816
01:09:57,644 --> 01:10:01,507
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty simple, but that's probably why I love it so much.

817
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:06,430
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to try to play my uke on it, but it's mostly Shin playing on this.

818
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:10,813
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

819
01:10:10,913 --> 01:10:12,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, let's just do you.

820
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:14,356
[SPEAKER_11]: What am I interfering for?

821
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:32,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for hearing me.

822
01:10:32,554 --> 01:10:37,797

[SPEAKER_09]: And for not leaving me.

[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for staying with me, yeah.

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

861
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:08,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

862
01:15:08,912 --> 01:15:15,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, you see how it's a simple, it's a lot of repeating, but it's just, it drew me in and I was like, oh, that's going on the set, that's happening.

863
01:15:16,182 --> 01:15:17,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes, yes.

864
01:15:17,965 --> 01:15:18,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

865
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to sit for this one.

866
01:15:22,211 --> 01:15:22,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just gonna.

867
01:15:29,716 --> 01:15:31,557
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you can't see me, I apologize.

868
01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:34,219
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll try to make it so you can.

869
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll sit right where I was.

870
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:40,483
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's because I hate to sit this uke on my lap for a moment for this song.

871
01:15:41,163 --> 01:15:42,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want the boom?

872
01:15:43,204 --> 01:15:44,125
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, I'll be okay.

873
01:15:44,245 --> 01:15:47,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so used to having to adjust to not having the boom.

874
01:15:47,247 --> 01:15:48,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa!

875
01:15:48,247 --> 01:15:50,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Way lower than I thought it was, but that's all right.

876
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:52,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, maybe I need the higher ones.

877
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,171
[SPEAKER_11]: The black ones, maybe?

878
01:15:54,191 --> 01:15:55,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let me try one of those black chairs.

879
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:02,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

880
01:16:02,611 --> 01:16:06,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate you.

881
01:16:07,273 --> 01:16:07,814
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can.

882
01:16:07,934 --> 01:16:10,956
[SPEAKER_11]: If not, though, yeah, we can take this off.

883
01:16:11,676 --> 01:16:12,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

884
01:16:14,378 --> 01:16:15,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, just a minute, let it come down.

885
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:18,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I see what you're doing.

886
01:16:20,621 --> 01:16:21,522
Awesome.

887
01:16:22,062 --> 01:16:23,143
Sorry, y'all, we're done.

888
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:24,684
That's all right.

889
01:16:24,804 --> 01:16:26,245
I believe it's worth it, so.

890
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

891
01:16:44,448 --> 01:16:44,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

892
01:16:45,549 --> 01:16:47,630
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, what I'm gonna do is move the sky.

893
01:16:50,211 --> 01:16:51,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't need it fully.

894
01:16:51,112 --> 01:16:52,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I only needed a little bit.

895
01:16:52,412 --> 01:16:54,894
[SPEAKER_11]: So this song, I've been part of a thing called

896
01:16:56,189 --> 01:17:08,839
[SPEAKER_11]: The Club Placime Folk Collective, and you know, I've always been known as more of a jazz R&B artist, but ever since I picked up this uke, it's opened up a lot more just genres and fans and stuff.

897
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:12,262
[SPEAKER_11]: But also, folk music is more than what we think.

898
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:13,623
[SPEAKER_11]: often think it is.

899
01:17:13,683 --> 01:17:30,156
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not all banjos and, you know, so it was really nice to be part of that collective because it was our way of educating people that there needs to be more diversity at Club Pessim, but at other places in the entire folk community, but honestly just in everything, but you gotta start somewhere, right?

900
01:17:30,556 --> 01:17:38,302
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's been a pleasure doing that and I did a show with one of them and they said, bring a traditional folk song and I was like,

901
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that is.

902
01:17:42,672 --> 01:17:44,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, and I also don't.

903
01:17:45,853 --> 01:17:47,654
[SPEAKER_11]: So I immediately went to You Are My Sunshine.

904
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:52,997
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, I am not going to play You Are My Sunshine, my only sunshine.

905
01:17:53,357 --> 01:17:55,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So I decided to play it like this.

906
01:18:06,172 --> 01:18:15,380
[SPEAKER_11]: The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed you held me in your arms.

907
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:20,185
[SPEAKER_11]: But when I woke, I was mistaken.

908
01:18:22,308 --> 01:18:26,371
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hung my head down and cried.

909
01:18:26,772 --> 01:18:31,235
[SPEAKER_11]: You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.

910
01:18:31,435 --> 01:18:36,039
[SPEAKER_10]: You make me happy when skies are gray.

911
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:42,044
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll never know, dear, how much I love you.

912
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:46,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't take my sunshine away.

913
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:55,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

914
01:18:57,041 --> 01:19:05,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll always love you and make you happy if you would only say the same.

915
01:19:07,803 --> 01:19:12,184
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you love me, why'd you leave me for another?

916
01:19:14,144 --> 01:19:16,245
[SPEAKER_11]: You gonna regret it someday.

917
01:19:18,032 --> 01:19:22,793
[SPEAKER_11]: You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.

918
01:19:22,813 --> 01:19:28,594
[SPEAKER_11]: You make me happy, happy when skies are gray.

919
01:19:28,794 --> 01:19:33,296
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll never know, dear, how much I love you.

920
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:38,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Please don't take my sunshine away.

921
01:19:39,977 --> 01:19:43,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't take my sunshine away.

922
01:19:50,969 --> 01:19:54,452
[SPEAKER_11]: You told me once, dear, you really loved me.

923
01:19:56,153 --> 01:19:59,756
[SPEAKER_11]: And no one else could come between.

924
01:20:01,678 --> 01:20:08,763
[SPEAKER_11]: But now you left me for that other, and you shattered all.

925
01:20:11,714 --> 01:20:17,037
[SPEAKER_11]: You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.

926
01:20:17,097 --> 01:20:22,080
[SPEAKER_11]: You make me happy, happy when skies are gray.

927
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:27,022
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll never know, dear, how much I love you.

928
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:32,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't take my sunshine away.

929
01:20:33,026 --> 01:20:36,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't take my sunshine away.

930
01:20:38,677 --> 01:20:42,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't take my sunshine away.

931
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:43,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Please don't take my sunshine.

932
01:20:55,626 --> 01:20:56,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

933
01:20:57,828 --> 01:20:59,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I just cannot play that standing up.

934
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:03,432
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too many things happening, so I needed it on my thigh.

935
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:04,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody ever notice that?

936
01:21:04,513 --> 01:21:07,075
[SPEAKER_11]: You ever wonder, like, how are they holding that?

937
01:21:07,115 --> 01:21:07,815
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no strap.

938
01:21:08,055 --> 01:21:08,816
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened here?

939
01:21:09,116 --> 01:21:11,158
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, there's little tricks we do.

940
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:14,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, see how he's holding the, that helps to play it better, yeah.

941
01:21:15,341 --> 01:21:18,063
[SPEAKER_11]: But it also helps me to stand up when I'm singing.

942
01:21:19,344 --> 01:21:21,546
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I had to go kind of back and forth.

943
01:21:21,926 --> 01:21:23,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for bearing with me for a moment

944
01:21:31,061 --> 01:21:32,422
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that song, oh my goodness.

945
01:21:32,743 --> 01:21:34,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to think about that.

946
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:38,708
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what, in the same kind of, oh, the other one.

947
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:40,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

948
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:42,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that one.

949
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:43,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot the name of it.

950
01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:45,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why I forgot the name of it.

951
01:21:45,254 --> 01:21:45,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the song.

952
01:21:46,315 --> 01:21:47,937
[SPEAKER_11]: But here I am going, I don't know the title.

953
01:21:47,997 --> 01:21:49,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know that I'll hum it.

954
01:21:50,799 --> 01:21:55,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just telling him how sometimes people will walk up to me while I'm playing, by the way, playing something.

955
01:22:07,726 --> 01:22:09,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me later.

956
01:22:10,929 --> 01:22:11,589
[SPEAKER_11]: So funny.

957
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:17,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, sometimes I didn't laugh at that, but that I just, when I remembered, I was like, that was actually pretty funny.

958
01:22:17,494 --> 01:22:19,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause they really thought I was listening.

959
01:22:19,856 --> 01:22:22,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about, but we can talk about it later.

960
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:25,120
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

961
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,701
[SPEAKER_11]: So this one, I just liked it.

962
01:22:26,801 --> 01:22:28,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Another uplifting, fun one.

963
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:29,403
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

964
01:22:30,364 --> 01:22:32,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus Shin, Shin likes to play this one.

965
01:22:33,404 --> 01:22:35,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh, if we can play, okay, yeah, let's do it.

966
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:36,713
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

967
01:22:37,796 --> 01:22:38,939
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's by Sam and Dave.

968
01:22:40,202 --> 01:22:40,443
All right.

969
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:17,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you ever feel sad?

970
01:26:19,312 --> 01:26:24,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

971
01:26:32,519 --> 01:26:32,920
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, cool.

972
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,521
[SPEAKER_11]: We've made our decision.

973
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:36,202
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Stevie Wonder.

974
01:26:37,062 --> 01:26:40,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually gave him two Stevie Wonder choices, so it was going to be Stevie no matter what.

975
01:26:41,565 --> 01:26:42,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Stevie or Stevie.

976
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:44,967
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, Stevie it is.

977
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:47,068
[SPEAKER_11]: At first I was thinking, oh, we put Stevie in the semantics.

978
01:26:51,523 --> 01:27:07,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope that everybody yeah I even said I was like even if you don't know you love Stevie right because sometimes you don't know what's a song that he wrote you know things like that I love I love teaching when it comes to that when it comes to people opening their eyes to

979
01:27:09,096 --> 01:27:10,037
[SPEAKER_11]: He wrote what now?

980
01:27:10,057 --> 01:27:13,579
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, he wrote I Can't Help It by Michael Jackson.

981
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,902
[SPEAKER_11]: He wrote Tell Me Something Good for Rufus and Chaka Khan.

982
01:27:18,383 --> 01:27:19,223
[SPEAKER_11]: He wrote all of that stuff.

983
01:27:19,664 --> 01:27:24,187
[SPEAKER_11]: And the dude's just, I mean, Minnie Riperton, he's all over her stuff, because she's all over his.

984
01:27:25,388 --> 01:27:27,349
[SPEAKER_11]: They just harmonizing and doing.

985
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:30,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember Maya Rudolph saying, yeah, he's Uncle Stevie to me.

986
01:27:30,251 --> 01:27:36,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, well, what a life to sit in the living room with Stevie Wonder and just be like, hey, uncle, give me a song.

987
01:27:37,093 --> 01:27:38,434
[SPEAKER_11]: But this one's one of my favorites.

988
01:27:39,054 --> 01:27:40,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I sang this at the Apollo.

989
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:44,158
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the ones that got me to get there for a second round, and it was really cool.

990
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:46,800
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

991
01:27:47,281 --> 01:27:48,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

992
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:48,862
[SPEAKER_03]: People.

993
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:07,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep on warring.

994
01:28:08,087 --> 01:28:09,568
Soldiers, keep on loving.

995
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:12,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they club like that.

996
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:13,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I said that backwards.

997
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:16,293
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all right.

998
01:28:16,313 --> 01:28:17,033
[SPEAKER_11]: World, keep on turning.

999
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:28,392
[SPEAKER_11]: because it won't be too long.

1000
01:28:28,452 --> 01:28:33,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Powers keep on lying while your people

1001
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:49,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep on dying.

1002
01:28:50,693 --> 01:28:54,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Very appropriate for this time of world.

1003
01:28:56,578 --> 01:28:59,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep on turning.

1004
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:02,684
[SPEAKER_11]: It won't be too long.

1005
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:03,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

1006
01:29:09,817 --> 01:29:13,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so darn glad he let me try it again.

1007
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:17,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Because my last time on earth, I lived a whole world of sin.

1008
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:21,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so glad that I ain't no more than I knew then.

1009
01:29:21,864 --> 01:29:27,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to keep on trying till I reach the highest ground.

1010
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:28,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1011
