    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=0.902s">Good</a>  evening, friends and neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=4.424s">My</a>  name is Terry E. Carter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=11.389s">Welcome</a>  to our inaugural edition of the live monthly presentation of Fresh Friday's Words and Music, rebranded, carved, and sanded for the month of October <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=24.398s">We</a>  are happy to be back following a great summer of WMCC programs, including the 5th Medford Jazz Festival, Hoops and Hope, the West Medford Senior Club Barbecue, the new commemorative brick installation, Summer Girls Basketball, our recent annual meeting, and the first in the annual community legislative forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=51.856s">So</a>  things are definitely percolating here at 111 Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=57.744s">Thanks</a>  in part to assistance from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, Fresh Fridays is back and all new for another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=69.511s">So</a>  as fall rolls in, we want to remind you that COVID is still out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=74.252s">And</a>  we're trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=78.394s">So</a>  masking is welcome, but not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=81.835s">As</a>  always, we're just happy to be here sponsoring live programming at WMCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=87.216s">And</a>  we're really, really glad to see our neighbors, our friends, and our supporters coming through the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=93.798s">Thanks</a>  so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=95.979s">Thanks</a>  also to our other event sponsor, Kevin Harrington back there with Medford Community Media, and volunteer Mark Davidson is with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=108.131s">They</a>  are consistently guiding us as we broadcast to you via MCM channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=117.74s">as</a>  well as on the MCM YouTube channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=121.104s">If</a>  you're out there watching on your electronic devices, your computers, your telephones, television, what have you, welcome to the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=130.954s">So</a>  if you've got phones, if you want to put them on silent, that would be real good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=137.227s">Okay,</a>  so in my travels as a poet and an ambassador for the arts, I've been privileged to encounter some tremendous teachers, leaders, and history makers across a wide panorama of human endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=151.37s">Words</a>  and music has given me the opportunity to bring a lot of those folks to your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=157.451s">Tonight</a>  is no exception, so I hope you're ready for insightful and delightful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=164.932s">So</a>  I guess for this evening, is relatively new to Medford, but she has already made a significant and positive impression on everyone who has crossed her path. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=178.903s">And</a>  I guess I should ask you about your pronouns. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=182.325s">She</a>  and her is good? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=183.146s">Okay,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=184.749s">She</a>  is the inaugural leader of Medford's first ever creative arts center, the long-awaited arts collaborative Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=193.722s">Please</a>  welcome Regina Parkinson to Fresh Friday's Words and Music. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=201.021s">So</a>  a little bit about Regina, she relocated the greater Boston area from New Orleans in Louisiana in May of 2021 for postgraduate studies and professional duties at Artists for Humanity of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=215.517s">Artists</a>  for Humanity is a non-profit organization that hires teens to create art. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=221.844s">and</a>  design projects for clients and communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=225.547s">Then</a>  prior to coming East, she had been a successful arts administrator in the Big Easy, where her work included co-founding a large-scale contemporary public event called the Lucky Art Fair, which showcased 30-plus visual artists and had more than 2,000 visitors over two weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=246.96s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=248.121s">Regina</a>  is passionate about creating and strengthening community partnerships and advancing the missions of social impact organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=256.493s">I've</a>  gotten to know her a little bit over these past several months, and she's a congenial and energetic person to be around. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=264.785s">So,</a>  as Regina describes it, she was, I'm taking your words, over the moon to take on the new role of becoming the executive director of the brand new arts collaborative Medford in January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=278.634s">She</a>  was found through an extensive search, and as you'll soon see, her accomplishments thus far has positioned our new community arts center for great success, both now and in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=292.844s">Again,</a>  Regina Parkinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=295.425s">So</a>  as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I'd like to share a little bit of verse to help shape the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=303.187s">Now,</a>  you know that I believe that poetry should be, above all things, accessible and inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=311.269s">So</a>  this piece is called The Deep End of the Ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=314.89s">If</a>  I could just find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=319.111s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=323.368s">It</a>  kind of gripes me when so-called poets try to be deep, try to be down with each blade of Viridian green glass, and each waft of the Zephyrus breeze, and each chiseled rib on the Parthenon's Doric columns, and each silicate grain on the beaches of Bali. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=344.161s">It</a>  doesn't really take all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=346.843s">Sat</a>  in a poetry performance seminar the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=350.745s">All</a>  the so-called poets were renowned in literary circles with credentials and certifications and designations up the wazoo. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=360.491s">They</a>  had an elitist conclave about the poets of the next wave with all sorts of feminist fusillades against misogynistic menfolk and the sensual nature of egg yolk and the extremist views of James Polk and a whole bunch of mirrors in gray smoke, acting like they're so dang woke and can't even take a good joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=379.659s">To</a>  my apparently untrained ear, however, <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=384.85s">They</a>  didn't have much to say, other than polysyllabic pronouncements about the sweeping expanse of the waters on Mars, metrical landscapes and metaphors czars, about the deep end of the ocean, and how one must choke, bleed, and die to swim there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=405.362s">It's</a>  not what a brown-skinned poet like me is trying to tell y'all. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=409.026s">I'm</a>  about those Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes Be For Real lyrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=414.051s">I</a>  get the Child of the Universe bit and the no less than the rocks and trees part, but I'm just trying to tell my people that we're going to be all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=424.048s">We</a>  have a story, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=426.029s">Our</a>  existence is filled with poetry, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=429.27s">I</a>  don't need the deep end of the ocean to grow widening rivulets for me to contemplate. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=435.673s">And</a>  if I'm going to anthropomorph into anything, it's going to be the lion of my pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=441.796s">I'm</a>  in the shallow end of the pool, y'all, but not because my light is less dim and not because we brothers can't swim. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=450.883s">It's</a>  because I know you'll see me better if the riptides of prideful intellect aren't constantly trying to pull me under. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=459.926s">There's</a>  nothing even remotely poetic about another brother's creative juices being stifled, strangled, or silenced by condescending heretics or acid tongue polymics of ivory tower academics and Hegelian dialectics. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=477.273s">do</a>  a Google search. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=478.854s">Webinars</a>  and Zoom conferences, symposiums, consortiums, go-to meetings, and bucolic retreats can take you to all those deep places where the deep folk are holding forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=492.537s">You're</a>  really smart, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=494.678s">You're</a>  incredibly articulate, wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=497.499s">You're</a>  intellectually gifted, cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=501.561s">But</a>  a generous God didn't give you those gifts so you could rub folks' noses in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=507.023s">BS,</a>  MS, and PhD ain't supposed to be called for bush, mush, pout higher and deeper. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=515.177s">My</a>  river don't flow like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=517.538s">Shakespeare</a>  was a safety school of the people, by the people, and for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=522.959s">I</a>  mean all of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=524.98s">Dunbar</a>  was total negritude with the mask and Melendian mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=529.962s">Langston</a>  brought simple home. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=532.062s">Maya</a>  brought traveling shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=533.903s">Barack</a>  bought caba, and Teddy G was about a cat in a hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=538.675s">Poetry</a>  is organically rich, unlike any dissertation of the nutrient component comprised by the writer's literary compost, unlike any declamation of the metaphysics of metrical departures to the deep end of the ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=554.651s">So</a>  if you came here tonight to hear something esoteric, iconoclastic, or intellectually effete, I guess I'm going to have to take an incomplete. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=564.354s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=565.135s">I'm</a>  not down with that beat. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=566.875s">I'm</a>  a plain spoken poet with red velvet verses and no coded curses, speaking simple truth to power, obeying the scripture's sober call to write the revelation down and make it plain on tablets so that a herald can run with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=580.28s">And</a>  no less than the rocks and the trees, I got a right to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=585.185s">As</a>  for the unfolding of the universe, I'm leaving that to all the so-called poets renowned in literary circles with credentials and certifications and designations at the deep end of the ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=601.56s">All</a>  right, we're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=604.342s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=609.263s">So</a>  here's how we're going to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=611.245s">We're</a>  going to have a nice, friendly chat with Regina. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=614.688s">So</a>  Regina, talk about making the transition from Louisiana to Boston after having spent a number of years in Cajun country.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=623.641s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=624.822s">The</a>  thing about New Orleans that attracts so many people to it and keeps so many people there is that when you're born there, it's your whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=632.83s">And</a>  when you go there, you really feel the sense of community stronger than I've ever felt it anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=638.635s">And</a>  so it's what made me want to move there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=640.457s">And</a>  while I was there, it's what made me realize that this was my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=645.781s">Because</a>  I felt that way about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=649.485s">and</a>  it was really enlightening and helpful, and their culture is beautiful, and I just feel so honored to have delved in it for a few years, but it became really clear to me why people feel that way about where they live.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=661.433s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=663.094s">That's,</a>  that's profound. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=664.235s">That's</a>  the, that's not the deep end of the ocean, that's, but that's deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=669.258s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=672.07s">What,</a>  if anything, did you know about Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=674.812s">And</a>  can you talk about being courted by the city to come be the ED of the Arts Collaborative?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=679.695s">Yeah,</a>  I lived in Medford immediately after I moved out of college. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=684.297s">So</a>  I went to UMass Amherst. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=686.078s">My</a>  brother was getting his PhD at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=688.52s">He</a>  has a PhD in black holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=690.141s">I</a>  couldn't tell you the title of the dissertation, but it's black holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=693.363s">And</a>  I lived with him for a few months before I got a job and was living in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=697.836s">And</a>  so, it just feels like the organic first place that I was trying to become an adult. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=703.339s">And</a>  so, when I came back, and I moved back, and was working in South Boston, living in Medford, it just felt really natural. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=710.202s">And</a>  when it came time to move on from Artists for Humanity, and that job posting was listed, it felt like some sort of divine intervention.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=719.005s">OK,</a>  all right, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=722.267s">And</a>  this is maybe getting down in the weeds just a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=726.83s">What</a>  was one significant thing the hiring committee was looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=732.693s">And</a>  what did you say to convince them that you were the right one for the job?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=737.56s">I'm</a>  looking at Susan Altman right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=742.225s">I</a>  think they were looking for someone that could see what had happened and what could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=750.133s">So</a>  a vision? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=751.452s">I</a>  believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=753.452s">And</a>  I think I just had that vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=757.713s">I</a>  think I was maybe born with that vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=759.694s">So</a>  I think I just tried to connect my past experiences to what could be really clearly.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=769.256s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=770.636s">And</a>  if you don't mind me asking, what is a little bit of that vision?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=776.502s">Well,</a>  this predates me by decades, and I'm standing on the work of many, many Medford natives, and I'm very aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=789.267s">So</a>  it was clear that it was needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=791.548s">It</a>  was clear we were answering a need that had existed, and there's no end to answering a need like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=797.791s">I</a>  mean, it's community, so it's ever-changing, and it can be as big as you can imagine it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=804.294s">So</a>  the vision is really to fulfill all the dreams of those people that got us here, and to give them everything they thought we could have.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=813.278s">It's</a>  a big vision, in other words.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=814.538s">It's</a>  pretty big.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=814.919s">Yeah,</a>  it's a big vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=816.499s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=818.039s">So</a>  I guess you probably have answered the next question I was going to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=821.38s">And</a>  that's kind of what attracted you to position in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=824.781s">But</a>  you knew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=826.042s">And</a>  you had gotten a sent intervention for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=830.423s">So</a>  that kind of answers that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=833.084s">So</a>  how have the first nine months gotten you ready for the next nine and beyond?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=841.806s">Um,</a>  it's like training in a battlefield, you know, it's like I'm in the trenches. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=845.287s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=845.948s">Uh,</a>  we're busy and I don't think that'll stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=848.789s">So,</a>  um, it's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=850.629s">It's</a>  good to not react to things and just let them happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=853.37s">So</a>  I think that would be the training of the past nine months. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=855.591s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=856.251s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=856.871s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=857.371s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=858.532s">So,</a>  you know, obviously there's a bit of history now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=861.433s">What,</a>  what accomplishments are you proud, uh, most proud of so far?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=865.834s">I'm</a>  proud of the fact that we have 11 working artists in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=871.338s">I'm</a>  really proud of that and they're all active artists making their work in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=876.723s">I'm</a>  really proud of the fact that we have an after-school program that answers a need in our city where there's a little bit of a lack. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=883.988s">I'm</a>  really proud of the fact that it is becoming very natural and organic for other <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=890.013s">Nonprofits</a>  and organizations in our city to come to us to collaborate on the things that they need a home for okay that includes Reverend Wendy and the Sanctuary Church and that includes ensemble the ally project to be</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=905.183s">You</a>  were the first show. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=906.764s">The</a>  first show. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=911.508s">For</a>  those of you that haven't been there, it's 162 Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=918.613s">And</a>  the big mural on top pops right out at you, so you can't miss it for anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=926.078s">The</a>  only other good mural on Mystic Ave is the one that I'm in. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=929.901s">That's</a>  true. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=930.281s">Down</a>  a little further. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=931.242s">But</a>  that's in Somerville, and that's another story for another day.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=933.983s">That's</a>  another story.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=934.624s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=934.944s">But</a>  see these two murals, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=936.805s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=938.386s">In</a>  any case.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=939.347s">There</a>  will be more murals.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=940.127s">Yeah,</a>  there will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=940.967s">I'm</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=941.468s">I'm</a>  sure.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=944.591s">Yeah,</a>  it was amazing to have you guys there and be the inaugural show.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=947.612s">It</a>  was really cool.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=948.693s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=949.133s">And</a>  our second show was Amanda Palmer, um, who is also Boston Cambridge based. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=954.215s">And</a>  she did a little pop up for fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=955.816s">We</a>  had 80 people there and that was totally unexpected. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=958.537s">Um,</a>  so things have just really come our way that are, you know, of the people that we're making all this for.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=963.779s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=964.292s">And</a>  it's so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=967.094s">I</a>  mean, obviously on the second floor are the artist studios and classrooms and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=975.621s">And</a>  then down on the bottom floor, there's a lot of really nice exhibit space and then an open space where the performances are set and they can be set vertically, they can be set horizontally. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=990.053s">well</a>  designed and really, really interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=994.516s">So</a>  always something going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=997.518s">So</a>  obviously the flip side of that is what major challenges have you come up against?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1003.942s">I'm</a>  one person.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1005.123s">Okay,</a>  who do we know that story? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1007.846s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1008.307s">Yeah,</a>  it's it's amazing that I'm here and that I'm in this position It was amazing that I have the board of directors that I have I cannot speak highly enough about them But we're a small team and we're trying to make big big things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1020.241s">Yeah,</a>  so they just don't have enough hours in my day Okay, which is a workable challenge, I think</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1025.64s">OK,</a>  well, you moved into the area with a whole lot of craziness kind of going on around you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1035.482s">And</a>  now kind of kitty corner to you, maybe, or is it directly across from you? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1042.264s">Is</a>  this great American beer hall?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1044.844s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1045.024s">They</a>  opened three weeks ago.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1046.125s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1047.365s">Friend</a>  or foe?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1048.425s">Oh</a>  friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1049.126s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1049.626s">Oh,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1050.807s">We</a>  hung out there and it's open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1053.689s">It's</a>  live music. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1054.53s">It's</a>  really going to change our, what I call the corridor that we're in and it's going to change Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1060.655s">It's</a>  where we, so it's awesome to have them on our side, literally.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1064.187s">So</a>  for those of you who haven't seen or heard about this great American beer hall, they moved into a huge space, craft beers up the yin-yang, all kinds of, you know, shows and performances going to be going on there all of the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1085.145s">They</a>  actually are family friendly, so they have running around spaces for kids before the real drinking starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1094.152s">It</a>  looks like it's going to be another interesting departure for entertainment and socializing in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1104.699s">I</a>  think what we're seeing is really like an answer to a lot of needs and lacks that we didn't have before, and so we have a community arts center now, we have a place to go hang out with your kids and grab an awesome local beer. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1114.888s">It's</a>  like really exciting to see Medford take on these big changes.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1120.233s">It's</a>  awesome to be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1121.674s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, West Medford, you know, was, you know, had, you know, kind of the benefit of getting kind of the first craft beer, <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1129.741s">kind</a>  of location right up the street on Harvard Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1132.782s">And</a>  Max Heineck, who is a poet and a songwriter and a singer himself, has been holding forth there for a little while now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1140.766s">So</a>  you know, craft beer emporium number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1145.988s">So</a>  this is a funny question. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1147.889s">I</a>  think we had a little bit of a conversation about this over at the Arts Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1152.23s">What</a>  do you think about being the neighbor of Medford's first ever legal cannabis dispensary?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1158.473s">I</a>  think that it's like a really important embrace that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1162.935s">I</a>  mean, they came in and thought about how they were going to affect the community in all ways, from all sides, and they partnered with someone that they felt like was a fit for their mission, which is very community oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1174.0s">So</a>  I think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1175.001s">I</a>  think they're a wonderful company to have on our side. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1178.263s">and</a>  to be neighbors with. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1179.064s">They're</a>  very friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1180.065s">They</a>  are so excited about our art. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1182.027s">We</a>  have an extension of our current exhibition in their lobby space. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1185.311s">Oh</a>  my goodness, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1185.871s">I'm</a>  able to sell artwork out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1187.153s">I</a>  mean, they're friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1188.114s">They're</a>  really good friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1188.915s">Wow.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1189.455s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1190.216s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1190.877s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1193.539s">So</a>  will you talk a little bit about the past experiences that you've had that kind of prepped you for the role that you're in right now?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1202.646s">Yeah,</a>  I think that it's like fortune fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1205.889s">The</a>  reason why I'm very happy to just be doing this as the sole employee at the moment is because I've done that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1213.635s">I</a>  know what the work is and what it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1217.317s">And</a>  also my passion is really there for supporting artists. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1220.12s">So</a>  you had mentioned Lucky Art Fair And the thing about that fair is that we actually paid the artists to participate rather than having them pay us We didn't take any sales commissions It was all grassroots because I don't I did not feel in that moment in New Orleans and I don't feel generally that there's enough opportunity to really give <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1236.836s">Artists</a>  the leg up and getting their fiscal feet under them Which is this case for musicians is the case for visual artists. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1244.247s">It's</a>  the case for craft artists I can go on and on but just being able to provide those resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1250.136s">It</a>  is my life source.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1251.297s">Yeah,</a>  I <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1252.045s">Well,</a>  I'm really happy about that because whenever I go anywhere as a poet, I'm looking at folks and they're looking at me and we're trying to figure out who's going to do what first. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1262.408s">So</a>  yeah, it's real good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1264.609s">Talk</a>  a little bit about your philosophy as an arts administrator.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1268.635s">Yeah,</a>  I would say it's similar to that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1271.518s">It's</a>  giving people the connections and the resources so they don't think they're an artist, but they can actually paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1279.366s">And</a>  so they see their artwork on a wall for the first time and they feel like a real artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1284.13s">They're</a>  a real artist, they've been doing it in their living room, but they've never made an art sale and then we make their first art sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1289.496s">It's</a>  just taking that and going one step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1291.778s">We</a>  have a really awesome program in place in honor of Louise Mestrachot, who is one of the foundational people in our organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1299.222s">And</a>  it's a scholarship in her name. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1301.023s">And</a>  we've just accepted two scholars to be in our space, cost-free to them under her name, which is such an honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1307.207s">And</a>  I'm so determined to get one of them her first major mural wall this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1312.01s">So</a>  just be on the lookout, because that's going to be awesome.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1314.831s">And</a>  that's my philosophy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1316.232s">Yeah,</a>  and Louise, she was an artist in multiple mediums, and the work that you guys had on display, and the work that was being auctioned off, anybody who got anything from her really got a treasure, and they certainly got it at below retail.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1333.782s">Yeah,</a>  we're gonna have another little auction coming up too, so just keep your eyes out, but we are very blessed to have some of her work on loan from her children, and yeah, it's really special to still have her name in our building.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1344.522s">Yeah,</a>  and Will Tenney, who is an eminent photographer in the Medford area, a lot of what you see on the wall in the West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project, the photographs that aren't archival, a lot of them are Will's photographs, and he <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1362.842s">was</a>  instrumental in helping us put the book together as well as get this display which was housed at the Medford Historical Society for a little while and then at the library down in the lower level at the old building before we finally were able to kind of come to an agreement that this is where it should live permanently. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1382.641s">But</a>  his exhibit over at ACM was really spectacular, and I was able to get a few little pieces of his work. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1394.133s">But</a>  yeah, I mean it's exhibits like that that really are showcasing the huge talent that exists in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1403.542s">are</a>  really very, very engaging, and people need to get out and see them.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1408.128s">Yeah,</a>  and his generosity can't go understated. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1410.351s">He</a>  donated all of his artwork and any sales that we made, and he really pushed everyone he knew to come to that show, and all the sales that we made were split between us and Caché and Medfaird, which was just an incredible gift. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1422.546s">on</a>  his behalf and I think our space is really meant to uplift Medford-based artists and make a regional name. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1429.352s">So</a>  we do a little bit of back and forth in that space of artists that are specifically rooted in Medford and then artists that are nearby us as well.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1435.797s">Excellent,</a>  excellent, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1437.338s">And</a>  it's a front end, with him it was a front end in the back and it came in with a wonderful opening and sold a bunch of stuff and then he had a closing to the show and a bunch of folks came in and <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1450.249s">It</a>  was like a reunion.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1451.63s">It</a>  was really nice.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1452.97s">I</a>  really, really enjoyed it, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1456.271s">So</a>  how is Arts Collaborative Medford positioned for future success and longevity?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1462.473s">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1465.214s">We</a>  have a super special gift in that space that I think only happens once in a lifetime, which is that because of the generosity of theory, we're gifted into that space cost free on a rent basis for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1479.979s">And</a>  so we have a future that we know is pretty stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1484.523s">And</a>  with that, the other ways that we're positioned is just community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1488.988s">So</a>  it's just people coming to us with ideas and with the verve to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1495.114s">And</a>  that is how we will succeed.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1497.636s">Are</a>  all your artist spaces filled now?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1500.319s">I</a>  have two spaces open. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1502.12s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1502.8s">Anybody</a>  out there, you know, that's looking for a space? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1504.901s">We</a>  have two spaces in a shared studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1506.562s">It</a>  has a vault that we can't open and it's possible that the Isabella Stewart Gartner stolen paintings are in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1512.165s">We</a>  don't know that that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1514.926s">So</a>  come and get that studio space.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1516.947s">That's</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1517.327s">And</a>  you could be a part of history.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1518.668s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1519.328s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1520.088s">Oh</a>  my goodness. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1520.869s">There's</a>  something, they're out there somewhere.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1522.39s">There's</a>  something in there.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1523.19s">No</a>  reason why they couldn't be at ACM. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1525.911s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1526.231s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1527.532s">Will</a>  you play a little game of word association with me? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1530.114s">Oh,</a>  I'd love to. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1530.714s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1530.874s">OK,</a>  so I'll give you a word and ask you to please give me a few sentences on what that word means to you.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1536.757s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1536.838s">Can</a>  you do that?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1537.578s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1537.938s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1538.478s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1539.519s">Community.</a> </p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1541.24s">Community</a>  is, I believe, the thing that holds most people up on their darkest days and on their best days.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1550.446s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1551.206s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1552.066s">Creativity.</a> </p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1554.094s">pretty</a>  much a life source. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1555.296s">I</a>  think that it's pretty hard to go through life without some sort of outlet for everything you experience and I think creativity is that vehicle.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1563.84s">Wonderful,</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1565.361s">How</a>  about charity?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1569.284s">I</a>  think that we get so much when we give to other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1573.026s">And</a>  charity is really rad.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1575.908s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1577.99s">We</a>  say in the kingdom, we say, press down, shaken together, running over, he'll give it back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1585.414s">So</a>  yeah, charity is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1588.316s">How</a>  about courage?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1592.739s">Courage?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1595.066s">Courage</a>  really comes from knowing yourself, trusting yourself, and just wanting to do things that don't exist already.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1606.812s">Oh,</a>  wow, okay, okay, all right, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1609.273s">Well,</a>  this probably dovetails into that a little bit, adversity.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1613.115s">Yeah,</a>  adversity is the thing that you shape yourself against.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1616.617s">Wow,</a>  I like that, I like that, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1620.659s">Perspective.</a> </p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1622.466s">It's</a>  necessary, it's very necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1624.527s">It's</a>  so easy to get stuck in your own little, you know, we're like on our phones all the time, we're like in our little worlds, but when you step back and you have a larger view, it's just, it's a real breath of fresh air.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1635.331s">Okay,</a>  it is, it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1637.852s">Stewardship.</a> </p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1639.673s">Oh,</a>  I feel like that's really synonymous with leadership, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1642.854s">Just</a>  being a little bit more about other people than yourself and being willing to make those connections that are really fruitful.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1650.805s">Yeah,</a>  it's absolutely essential in the role that you're playing now because resources are gonna come your way, people are gonna come, and you really do have to be a good steward of all of the gifts and the good things that come your way, and you also have to be a discriminating steward because everything that's good to you ain't necessarily good for you.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1677.242s">Yeah,</a>  you do have to be slightly selective.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1680.125s">Very</a>  good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1681.947s">So</a>  five years from now, what will you want the people of Medford to know about the collaborative and about your stewardship of the organization?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1695.683s">Ooh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1698.444s">In</a>  five years, I want people to know that it's accessible to them, in whatever that word means. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1706.827s">I</a>  want them to know that they have a home there, and I want them to know that I will always be so happy to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1716.97s">I</a>  think that's pretty simple.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1720.351s">What's</a>  your statement on diversity, equity, and inclusion?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1731.374s">OK,</a>  my statement on diversity, equity, inclusion is that <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1739.727s">Well,</a>  that's a tough one.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1741.268s">That's</a>  not a specific thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1743.79s">I</a>  promise you that there wouldn't be no gotchas, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1748.274s">But</a>  this is, especially in Medford in this season, it's becoming so important for us to identify <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1757.341s">the</a>  organizations in the community that really are about allegiance and really are about fairness and really are about bringing people into the fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1770.907s">So</a>  it's not a gotcha. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1776.149s">I</a>  think it's just kind of essential to your leadership.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1780.091s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1780.792s">I</a>  would say with that that I'm, um, it might not seem like it cause we've done so much in nine months, but I'm actually really trying to take my time because I don't think that you can create true equity quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1791.8s">Um,</a>  and so I think it's about a lot of face to face conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1795.583s">I</a>  don't have a lot of rhetoric and fancy words for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1798.946s">I</a>  think it's just about relationship and being really honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1802.368s">Um,</a>  so I plan to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1803.509s">I</a>  plan to take my time, um, and talk to everyone that wants to be a part of this and listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1809.654s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1810.354s">and</a>  then take that and create what needs to be in order to create a space that is diverse and equitable and inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1817.541s">But</a>  it will happen.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1818.582s">Absolutely,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1820.804s">How</a>  do you tune out the noise? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1822.245s">What</a>  are your go-to's in terms of relaxation and meditative spaces and all that good stuff?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1831.303s">Music,</a>  long walks, white noise, and just good conversation where I can get everything off my chest.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1843.397s">And</a>  you have all of that in your life?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1846.3s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1846.76s">I'm</a>  very lucky.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1847.601s">In</a>  abundance, I hope.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1848.702s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1848.883s">I</a>  have great walks in my life.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1853.068s">Okay</a>  What would people who are just meeting you for the first time be surprised to know about you</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1868.157s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1869.639s">That</a>  I'm not a natural redhead. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1876.286s">That</a>  I used to be really into theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1880.43s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1884.875s">How</a>  did you fall away from being into theater?</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1887.377s">I</a>  think it's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1888.918s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1889.139s">I</a>  think it's there.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1889.899s">So</a>  you're still into theater.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1891.4s">I</a>  mean, I would say this is what theater gave me, the ability to sit here at this table with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1895.664s">Oh,</a>  really? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1896.585s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1897.505s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1898.787s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1899.407s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1900.188s">So</a>  a turnabout is fair play. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1902.71s">So</a>  you get to ask me whatever question you want to ask me.</p>

    <p>[Regina]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1908.054s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1908.655s">What</a>  was your first thought when you knew the Center was happening?</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1916.152s">So</a>  I go back to the first community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1919.614s">This</a>  is the second building on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1922.396s">And</a>  we grew up as kids in the first building with a little old army barracks called the Quonset Hut that sat on a foundation that was poured by some guys from the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1934.384s">And</a>  the Quonset Hut, the military hut, was trucked down here by the same guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1941.568s">from</a>  Charlestown, I believe it was, where they had a temporary military installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1948.555s">And</a>  like I said, I can't easily remember a time when we weren't at the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1955.943s">We</a>  played basketball out back at Duggar Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1961.468s">It</a>  had a basement, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1962.949s">We're</a>  on a slab now, but the first building had a basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1966.292s">And</a>  they had a pool table, bumper pool table, ping pong table down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1971.075s">And</a>  then they had some little spaces in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1973.497s">And</a>  in those little spaces in the back, we had modeling class, we had arts and crafts, we had all kinds of things that kept us kids busy and off the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1984.405s">And</a>  there were <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1986.927s">oodles</a>  of kids in the neighborhood when I was growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=1990.448s">So</a>  the community center really was a hub of community engagement and a babysitter for the neighborhood's parents because they always knew that their kids were going to be pretty much in one of two places. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2004.473s">They</a>  were either going to be at the park or they were going to be at the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2010.035s">And</a>  I can remember my father, he would drive down in his old station wagon, and he'd roll down the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2017.059s">Now,</a>  he's from one of the deepest places in Mississippi, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2021.601s">If</a>  Mississippi got an ocean, he was from the deep end of that ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2025.803s">But</a>  anyways, he would say, and I'm glad he's not in the room because he'd get me. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2031.705s">He'd</a>  say, my brother's name is Jordan. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2035.807s">He'd</a>  say, Jordan? <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2038.143s">Jordan!</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2039.283s">And</a>  then everybody, everybody who was playing ball at the time would chime in. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2044.906s">And</a>  it was like a chorus. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2046.266s">Jordan!</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2047.466s">Jordan!</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2049.507s">So</a>  those are the kinds of memories I have of the first community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2055.209s">Coming</a>  back, and I've been here for, it's going on 13 years now, managing elder services. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2063.112s">It</a>  gave me an opportunity to do a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2066.713s">One,</a>  my mother was ailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2068.334s">My</a>  father was ailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2070.014s">So</a>  I had a chance to come back, because I was living on the South Shore, I had a chance to come back and be with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2077.716s">So</a>  working at the community center gave me a chance to reestablish my family community in ways that I hadn't been able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2085.378s">And</a>  as they both passed, I was able to be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2090.919s">That's</a>  a gift that I'm never going to be able to repay the community center for. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2098.404s">And</a>  then the other thing is it gave me a chance to come and reclaim my place as a bit of the historian. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2107.429s">History</a>  of the community center you know and be able to be one of the storytellers in the community center and I've sent it a lot of the poetry that I write on that particular aspect of being here so when I think of the communities and I. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2122.842s">I</a>  mean, I think of it so fondly. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2124.623s">I</a>  have a lot of love for this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2126.183s">And</a>  you know, nothing lasts forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2128.324s">But</a>  I came in as an interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2132.045s">And</a>  I didn't think I was going to stay here for very long. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2134.606s">But</a>  life shapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2137.367s">Life</a>  shapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2139.188s">OK,</a>  so I'm going to give you the last word. <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ce92mBLgec&t=2141.508s">What</a>  are your parting thoughts?</p>
