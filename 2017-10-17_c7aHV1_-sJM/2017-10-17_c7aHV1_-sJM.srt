1
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:09,672
[SPEAKER_25]: Testing, testing.

2
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:13,894
[SPEAKER_25]: Testing, 1, 2, 3.

3
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Testing, 1, 2, 3.

4
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:18,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Good?

5
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:20,879
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

6
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,360
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

7
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:43,696
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion to revert back to the region of the meeting.

8
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:50,700
[SPEAKER_25]: Meeting is now back in session.

9
00:17:50,720 --> 00:18:05,489
[SPEAKER_25]: 17-711 offered by Councilor Lococoon being resolved that the city solicitor's office looks into making sure the rice pond will remain open to Bedford residents only after a grant was received from the Massachusetts office of coastal zone management.

10
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:06,770
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Lococoon.

11
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

12
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:25,303
[SPEAKER_18]: My attention was drawn to an article that was in the transcript last week by a concerned Medford resident with regards to us thankfully getting a grant from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.

13
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:34,865
[SPEAKER_18]: I think obviously it's a grant that we're going to put to good use, but the resident, and I'm sure a number of residents who frequent the pond,

14
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:45,687
[SPEAKER_18]: who fought last year to make sure it remained open to only Medford residents are now making, want to make sure that that's still going to be the case if we do accept and use this grant.

15
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,909
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it's a valid question.

16
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:59,456
[SPEAKER_18]: I would assume and hope that this definitely will stay open to just Medford residents, but maybe we could get a report back just to confirm that and to put residents' minds at ease.

17
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:01,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be very helpful.

18
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:03,939
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we have the solicitor here right now, but I don't know

19
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:05,968
[SPEAKER_18]: answer such a question.

20
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,532
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure you're not ready to answer it, but thank you.

21
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:12,613
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

22
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:24,843
[SPEAKER_18]: And before Rose called the last resolution was with regards, there was a number of people complaining to, um, the pitcher of the council meeting last Tuesday.

23
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:34,271
[SPEAKER_18]: And we spoke about Councilor Marks and I spoke about, um, the complaints we received and hopefully we can get that fixed and get the whole system, which we've been asking for fixed.

24
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:42,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, in the near future, because for some reason, sometimes the city council meetings are not being, and no fault of anybody doing the picture.

25
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:49,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but it just needs to be updated because the complaints were rolling in on Tuesday with regards to the picture.

26
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:54,069
[SPEAKER_18]: So I move approval on this resolution and, um, ask for my colleagues support.

27
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:55,410
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

28
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, Mr. President, uh, this is the first I've heard of the city receiving a grant.

29
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:01,234
[SPEAKER_24]: Could the councilor tell us a little bit about what this grant is?

30
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,075
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Locren.

31
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:03,495
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

32
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:04,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

33
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:09,405
[SPEAKER_18]: In the Medford transcript, it's a rain garden coming to Wright's Pond.

34
00:20:09,946 --> 00:20:21,370
[SPEAKER_18]: The city of Method is constructing a rain garden at the Middlesex Falls Pond that will help filter out pollutants, including phosphorus, nitrogen, suspended solids, and bacteria.

35
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,411
[SPEAKER_18]: It will also be designed to conserve water.

36
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,212
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a project they're gonna do in the near future.

37
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:32,054
[SPEAKER_18]: The rain garden project will cost the city a total of $50,000.

38
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:40,700
[SPEAKER_18]: and is a match project for $125,000 grant that Medford received from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.

39
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:47,764
[SPEAKER_18]: I can go into more detail, there's another few paragraphs, but it was on page A3 of the Medford transcript.

40
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:55,167
[SPEAKER_18]: The rain gutter will contain plants that soak up phosphorus, nitrogen from rainwater before it flows into Wright's Pond.

41
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,931
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it seems like a natural way to remove

42
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:21,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously chemicals from the pond, so anything we have with regards to a grant to be able to do this I think is extremely important, especially I have another resolution on where the article does mention some concerning things as well, but I think the rain garden is definitely a step in the right direction.

43
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:27,710
[SPEAKER_18]: It's only going to help better the pond, especially for the hundreds of kids that swim in that pond every summer.

44
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,091
[SPEAKER_25]: point of information.

45
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:32,172
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Dela Rousseau.

46
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:35,776
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, are we talking about, uh, item number 17 7 1 1 or 1 1 at the moment?

47
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:35,776
1 1.

48
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:36,016
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

49
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:37,098
[SPEAKER_21]: And the vote is to, uh,

50
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:48,018
[SPEAKER_22]: remain open to residents only after a grant was received.

51
00:21:48,378 --> 00:22:02,043
[SPEAKER_22]: And the solicitor will... I don't quite understand the semantics of the resolution and I don't know if we should base our... We are waiting for an opinion from the solicitor.

52
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:02,683
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

53
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:03,824
[SPEAKER_25]: He will give us an opinion on that.

54
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:04,564
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

55
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:05,904
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor, do you want to vote on 17711?

56
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:08,405
[SPEAKER_25]: I move approval of the question, Mr. President.

57
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:12,026
[SPEAKER_18]: 17711, but just to respond, I'm not really sure what the confusion is.

58
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,887
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes when you get a state or federal grant,

59
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:22,757
[SPEAKER_18]: It changes the parameters of how we operate, so we are making sure that the hundreds of families that use it from Medford, it remains only Medford.

60
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:31,628
[SPEAKER_18]: This was a big issue back about a year ago when some of the law was looked into and they were potentially going to be opening it up to non-Medford residents.

61
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:34,096
[SPEAKER_18]: the city will kind of... Thank you.

62
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,477
[SPEAKER_25]: You are correct Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

63
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:38,539
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn on 17.7.1.1.

64
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,501
[SPEAKER_25]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

65
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:43,021
[SPEAKER_27]: Roll call.

66
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:45,083
[SPEAKER_25]: Roll call has been requested Mr. Clerk.

67
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:51,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Dela Rousseau.

68
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:53,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

69
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:59,245
[SPEAKER_21]: 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

70
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:00,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

71
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:29,581
[SPEAKER_25]: 17 7 1 2 offered by council and go current be a resolve that the energy environment office update the Medford city council as to why the city does not test rights pawn for certain pollutants that could be caused by runoff of snow of plowed piles of snow near right near the pond in the winter.

72
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:39,024
[SPEAKER_25]: Be a further resolve that once the rain gun is put in place, right spawn will be tested for such pollutants before opening in the summer of 2018 council Lungo current.

73
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

74
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:43,015
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to bring this up.

75
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:46,818
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a second resident email me with regards to the same article.

76
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:55,684
[SPEAKER_18]: In the second part of the article, it mentions how the city stores plowed snow on Rice Pond.

77
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:01,809
[SPEAKER_18]: And residents have grown increasingly concerned about pollutants in the pond.

78
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:06,672
[SPEAKER_18]: And then our energy and environment director said because the city

79
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:12,979
[SPEAKER_18]: City stores plowed piles of snow near the pond in the winter, which runs into the pond when it melts.

80
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,242
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a way for the runoff to get clean, treated, and filtered naturally.

81
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:18,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully the rain guards will help that.

82
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:24,868
[SPEAKER_18]: But it says we've tested what is there, but there's a perception that there's bad stuff running off in there.

83
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:34,175
[SPEAKER_18]: So a resident who does frequent the pond called me, also asked me to reference the article, and it is concerning that we're putting plowed snow there.

84
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:43,937
[SPEAKER_18]: So my next, this resolution and the next has to do with figuring out if we can maybe do it another way.

85
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:51,160
[SPEAKER_18]: If we have runoff, there's a number of different things that are coming off the snow within the snow that are being stored at Wright's Pond.

86
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should look into it more.

87
00:24:53,681 --> 00:25:02,765
[SPEAKER_18]: And if this is a problem, then we can hopefully store the snow somewhere else because we want to make sure that we're keeping the pond as safe and clean as possible.

88
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:09,680
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that a resident was interested in the topic.

89
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:25,386
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if I can name him, but did reach out to the director of the Mystic River Watershed Association, who thought that piling up snow and allowing it to run into the pond is a poor choice.

90
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:29,487
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think this is just something that definitely needs to be looked into.

91
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:34,486
[SPEAKER_18]: If we have piled snow that can be put somewhere else, I think we need to do that.

92
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:46,168
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could have a response from our energy and environment office with regards to if there's been any testing, if so, what type of testing and when, that would be extremely helpful.

93
00:25:46,688 --> 00:25:54,410
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we haven't, then maybe we should see how the rain garden goes once it's implemented, then potentially do some testing.

94
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,891
[SPEAKER_18]: That's obviously not my forte, but if we could kind of

95
00:25:59,335 --> 00:26:00,495
[SPEAKER_18]: figure out what's going on here.

96
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,296
[SPEAKER_18]: I will be much appreciated.

97
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:03,056
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

98
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:07,897
[SPEAKER_25]: Council on the motion by council and go current seconded by councilor Falco.

99
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:08,577
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor.

100
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:13,419
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes 17 seven one three offered by council local current.

101
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:21,121
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it resolved that the Medford city council be provided a list of all places that plowed snow is stored during the winter months.

102
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:22,161
[SPEAKER_25]: Council on go current.

103
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:23,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

104
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:32,574
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could just have the Department of Public Works and or the administration let the City Council know where snow is, is kept when we take it off our streets.

105
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:38,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that just goes hand in hand with the prior resolution to try to make sure we're storing it in the right place.

106
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:39,298
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

107
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:43,880
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Lueb-Curran, seconded by Councilor Scott Peli.

108
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,601

116
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,821
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Mox.

117
00:27:08,122 --> 00:27:09,143
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

118
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:19,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I received a call from a resident on Emerson street who said, uh, because the street is a cut through, uh, cars are speeding down and, uh, where we purchased recently,

119
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,494
[SPEAKER_20]: two electronic speeding signs.

120
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,017
[SPEAKER_20]: I would ask that one be placed on Emerson street.

121
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:36,667
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, and in addition, uh, the city has moved from the 30 mile hour speed signs to now the new ordinance, which is 25, which was enacted by this council and by the traffic commission.

122
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:48,796
[SPEAKER_20]: I thank the chief who's here tonight, uh, that, uh, additional signs be placed on our secondary roads, Mr. President, um, that, uh, alert residents of the new, uh, speed, which is 25 miles an hour.

123
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:50,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

124
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:55,510

[SPEAKER_25]: Vice president marks.

128
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:08,698
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you Mr. President.

129
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,480
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, this has been on the sidewalk list for some time now.

130
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,202
[SPEAKER_20]: And, uh, the resident asked me to, uh, try to expedite, uh, because of trip and fall concerns.

131
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:24,625
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would just ask that this be sent to Mr. Karen's and DPW in the interest of public safety.

132
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:25,065
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

139
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:54,999
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, residents are probably aware, uh, on the Somerville Method line in South Method, there's been an issue for a number of years with rodents and, uh, the city embarked upon, uh, a program which,

140
00:28:55,998 --> 00:29:16,652
[SPEAKER_20]: monitors and sets out traps in particular areas, and now I'm receiving complaints in the Wellington area, some of which may be due to the bridge construction that's going on and some of the other development, but I've been getting a number of complaints of rodents in the Wellington area, and just recently I received two phone calls

141
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:25,386
[SPEAKER_20]: on North Medford up at the top of the heights where they're seeing rats in the area, Mr. President.

142
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:36,556
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would ask that the city immediately set up some type of monitor or activity to

143
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,405
[SPEAKER_20]: try to nip this in the bud, Mr. President.

144
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,586
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

145
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:43,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Del Russo.

146
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:48,529
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, I resent the fact that South Medford has been singled out as a place for rats.

147
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:59,695
[SPEAKER_22]: Secondly, I want to thank always the Department of Public Health, which has been proactive over the years in

148
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:08,362
[SPEAKER_22]: an urban area where rats are part of the landscape, but that does not mean we have to suffer their incursions.

149
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:10,844
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you to the Board of Health.

150
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:21,432
[SPEAKER_22]: We've suffered an uptick in their activity over the summer months because of some of the work done on the Green Line Extension Project, Mr. President.

151
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:36,996
[SPEAKER_22]: It is no doubt that the work done in the Wellington area has certainly moved some of them, and that may be exacerbated as we're entering the winter months and our little furry friends are looking for a place to bed down for the winter.

152
00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:48,579
[SPEAKER_22]: So I hope that the Board of Health will not only exercise their own discretion in this matter, but urge the contractors in the area who are required

153
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,902
[SPEAKER_22]: to bait and monitor to step up their efforts.

154
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:53,823
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

155
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:57,866
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

156
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:58,587
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

157
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:00,228
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

158
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:09,175
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the construction equipment left on Mangle Street be removed in the interest of public safety.

159
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:10,236
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Mox.

160
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:11,657
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

161
00:31:11,677 --> 00:31:17,602
[SPEAKER_20]: There was some road work done on Mangles and that surrounding area, and some construction equipment has been left

162
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:24,765
[SPEAKER_20]: alongside the road for a period of time and residents are concerned and would like to see the equipment move, Mr. President.

163
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:28,547
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

164
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,227
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

165
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:30,688
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

166
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:40,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that a pedestrian crossing button be added to the blinking lights at the corner of 9th Street and Middlesex Avenue.

167
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:41,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Mox.

168
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:46,376
[SPEAKER_20]: We're probably all familiar with this particular intersection at 9th and Middlesex.

169
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:50,485
[SPEAKER_20]: It's right at the entrance to a Cappy's on Middlesex.

170
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:58,269
[SPEAKER_20]: And sometime back, uh, the council, um, actually pushed our state delegation to get a working blinking light.

171
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:09,294
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, we tried to get a full set of lights there, but we were instructed by the state because of the proximity to the intersection of Wellington, that that wouldn't be feasible by the state traffic engineer.

172
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:19,087
[SPEAKER_20]: And now I'm asking, Mr. President, if anyone has ever had to traverse there, they'll realize that the light blinks, but no one stops.

173
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:22,630
[SPEAKER_20]: And to get across, you're taking your life in your own hands.

174
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:36,700
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would ask that this be sent to our state delegation where Middlesex is a state road, requesting that the addition of a pedestrian crossing button be added to the blinking set of lights.

175
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,461
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

176
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,049
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

177
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:42,670
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

178
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:42,751
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

179
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:44,255
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

180
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,362
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved.

181
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:54,048
[SPEAKER_25]: that the car park parking lot receive a speed bump and a slow down parking lot signs be installed.

182
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice president marks.

183
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:12,238
[SPEAKER_20]: So, uh, Mr. President, this Saturday I was at car park and, um, I had a number of residents that were attending a birthday party in the taut lot come up to me and said, do you realize when you're coming up Fulton street, uh, that you, where the street branches off that,

184
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:22,175
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no indication that you're going into an actual parking lot, which is car park and cars are still going at the same clip as if they were on Fulton street.

185
00:33:22,956 --> 00:33:25,380
[SPEAKER_20]: And it really is a very dangerous situation.

186
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:28,804
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, their suggestion, which I think is great.

187
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:29,926
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know we have the chief here.

188
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:35,348
[SPEAKER_20]: uh, would be to put at least some, uh, warning signs that you're entering a parking lot.

189
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:36,908
[SPEAKER_20]: This is no longer a road.

190
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:50,413
[SPEAKER_20]: And secondly, uh, I'd like to see a race crosswalk, but I know we have those, uh, movable, uh, speed bumps that the city is putting around the community, uh, in a way to chief, would you mind coming up?

191
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:54,715
[SPEAKER_20]: We'd like to put you on the spot chief.

192
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:00,779
[SPEAKER_25]: Chief, name and address of the record, please.

193
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Leo A. Sacco, Jr.

194
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:04,902
[SPEAKER_19]: 227 Elm Street, Medford.

195
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:05,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Chief of Police.

196
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:09,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Just if you could address, do you know what I'm talking about when you come up, Fulton?

197
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:10,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

198
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:17,212
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a way that we could kind of address maybe some signage and possible speed bump?

199
00:34:17,232 --> 00:34:19,414
[SPEAKER_20]: I know race crosswalk is expensive.

200
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:24,565
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the raised crosswalk issue is somewhat out of my control.

201
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:29,066
[SPEAKER_19]: We can recommend, but we can't force it to happen because of the cost factor.

202
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:32,988
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, the temporary speed bump is doable.

203
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:35,709
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll speak with Mr. Kevins to see if there are any available.

204
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:37,890
[SPEAKER_19]: Signage is the simple thing.

205
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,232
[SPEAKER_19]: We can post that area that technically there's no outlet.

206
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:50,544
[SPEAKER_19]: when they go straight and a lot of times when cars are coming straight up Fulton, they just go straight and they think they can connect with the rest of Fulton and they can't.

207
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:59,632
[SPEAKER_19]: So post it at that end and then, you know, the speed limit, the posting for children playing playground.

208
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:01,153
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be great.

209
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:04,016
[SPEAKER_19]: So those, the signage piece is simple.

210
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:08,620
[SPEAKER_19]: The other piece of the crosswalk, the speed bump takes a little more effort.

211
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:09,701
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, chief.

212
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:10,622
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, chief.

213
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,842
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by vice-president Mark, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

214
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,163
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, let this be sent to the traffic commission.

215
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:25,788
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, and now the chief is going to have that be sent to the traffic commission on the motion by vice-president Mark, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

216
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:26,448
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor.

217
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:28,109
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

218
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,232
[SPEAKER_25]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

219
00:35:33,252 --> 00:35:39,095
[SPEAKER_25]: 17 7 0 9 petition by John Sterola, 20 Metcalf Street, Medford to address the council.

220
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:42,387
[SPEAKER_25]: on how to serve the people of Medford.

221
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:44,428
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

222
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:48,271
[SPEAKER_37]: John Starello, 20 Medcom Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

223
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:51,513
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilors.

224
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:53,475
[SPEAKER_37]: Very happy to be here.

225
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:55,316
[SPEAKER_25]: It's always a pleasure to have you here, Dr. Starello.

226
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:57,918
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, I appreciate that coming from you.

227
00:35:58,118 --> 00:35:58,338
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

228
00:35:58,358 --> 00:35:58,818
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, sir.

229
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:04,022
[SPEAKER_37]: And I do want to ask the audience if I'm too loud or not.

230
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:05,003
[SPEAKER_37]: Can you hear me clearly?

231
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:08,234
[SPEAKER_37]: Uh, I have problems with hearing too here.

232
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:15,536
[SPEAKER_37]: So, uh, I also want to, I want to thank city clerk at Ed Finn for providing me with this, uh, hearing aid.

233
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:17,117
[SPEAKER_37]: That'll help very much.

234
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:22,818
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, anyway, my subject, uh, tonight is how to serve, uh, the people of metric.

235
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:28,300
[SPEAKER_37]: And of course we're all very interested in that because that's the purpose of government service.

236
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,661
[SPEAKER_37]: We wouldn't need government at all if we did not need service.

237
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:34,222
[SPEAKER_37]: And so,

238
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:43,156
[SPEAKER_37]: The city council here takes an oath to support the Massachusetts constitution and that way to serve the people of the Commonwealth.

239
00:36:44,577 --> 00:37:02,163
[SPEAKER_37]: The council is to be appreciated for this loyalty to the people and we, the people have faith that the council will serve the people and that this is the reason we vote to elect you and we express pride in your service.

240
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:09,056
[SPEAKER_37]: And we trust you to do your job because of what we think is in your hearts.

241
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:22,519
[SPEAKER_37]: We think that in your hearts is the desire to make life less painful and more comfortable for us at a reasonable cost to us.

242
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:30,380
[SPEAKER_37]: We, the people support the city government by paying our taxes as the government ordains.

243
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:39,184
[SPEAKER_37]: And we give up some of our precious liberties, and we trust that the government will spend our hard-earned money wisely.

244
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:41,906
[SPEAKER_37]: But does it?

245
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:48,711
[SPEAKER_37]: In my opinion, Medford is near insolvency.

246
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,752
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, notice I say near.

247
00:37:52,593 --> 00:38:00,779
[SPEAKER_37]: I hope I am wrong, but the very tight financial condition of Medford will not permit us to proceed with the police station.

248
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:31,045
[SPEAKER_37]: the fire station, the library, school building maintenance, infrastructure, pension funding, proper zoning in order to limit density, preserving neighborhoods, reducing park fees and parking permits, street cleaning, police foot patrols, Medford Square revitalization, payroll increases for our employees, removal of tree stumps, on and on.

249
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,423
[SPEAKER_37]: Medford would have to borrow many millions of dollars to pay for all those needs.

250
00:38:38,723 --> 00:38:48,410
[SPEAKER_37]: We already have a debt of $51 million, which we reduce at a cost of $6 million a year.

251
00:38:49,971 --> 00:38:54,794
[SPEAKER_37]: But we need $22 million for the police station alone.

252
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:08,149
[SPEAKER_37]: Taxes must be raised year after year as they have been for the past 30 years in good times and in recessions in order to keep our heads above water.

253
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:18,898
[SPEAKER_37]: And now the city is taxing the taxes we have already paid and it is using the community preservation act to do this.

254
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:25,363
[SPEAKER_37]: Our tax levy is at the very top limit, which proposition two and a half permits.

255
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:34,112
[SPEAKER_37]: which is $109 million this year alone, which is $4 million more than last year.

256
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:47,560
[SPEAKER_37]: Now add to that $4 million more, the $1 million CPA surtax, and we have a 25% increase over the increase.

257
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,021
[SPEAKER_37]: Confusing, isn't it?

258
00:39:51,582 --> 00:39:54,504
[SPEAKER_37]: But CPA supporters love the extra revenue.

259
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:58,901
[SPEAKER_37]: which takes from Peter to pay Paul.

260
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:06,266
[SPEAKER_37]: Our city government is averse to charter review, which has not been discussed in 30 years.

261
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:12,651
[SPEAKER_37]: We have a charter which gives power to a strong mayor and a weak council.

262
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:14,872
[SPEAKER_37]: No offense.

263
00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:22,038
[SPEAKER_37]: Our city government is averse to term limits, which will provide more democracy for the folks.

264
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:33,347
[SPEAKER_37]: Two terms were adequate for George Washington, for Thomas Jefferson, for James Madison, for James Monroe, and Andrew Jackson, et cetera, et cetera.

265
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:36,950
[SPEAKER_37]: And two terms should be enough for us.

266
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:50,079
[SPEAKER_37]: In the Federalist Papers, James Madison said, a republic is a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the people.

267
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:57,819
[SPEAKER_37]: and is administered by people holding their offices for a limited period.

268
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,481
[SPEAKER_37]: James Madison wrote that in 1788.

269
00:41:04,803 --> 00:41:07,404
[SPEAKER_37]: Are our civil servants insecure?

270
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:10,565
[SPEAKER_37]: You bet they are.

271
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:15,007
[SPEAKER_37]: For what other reason would they seek public office over and over again?

272
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:20,070
[SPEAKER_37]: I wish the mayor and the council could shed their insecurities.

273
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:24,314
[SPEAKER_37]: Incumbency is selfish.

274
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:29,078
[SPEAKER_37]: Have you noticed how the promise of increased revenue makes incumbents ravenous?

275
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,604
[SPEAKER_37]: They should feel secure in their ability and power to give of themselves outside of politics.

276
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:38,806
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, to give.

277
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:43,410
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, there is the way to serve the people of Medford.

278
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:47,233
[SPEAKER_37]: The incumbents must get out of the way.

279
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:55,787
[SPEAKER_37]: We have one mayor and seven councils and they stay for many, many years.

280
00:41:57,207 --> 00:42:05,730
[SPEAKER_37]: Each Councilor is paid $30,000 a year, which is more than $750 for each meeting like this one.

281
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:16,353
[SPEAKER_37]: But we have 36,000 registered voters and many of them would be happy to serve without compensation.

282
00:42:17,574 --> 00:42:17,854
[SPEAKER_37]: Why?

283
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,873
[SPEAKER_37]: because they are, by nature, generous people.

284
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:43,540
[SPEAKER_37]: We must urge our voters to vote out the career politicians, to drain the Medford morass, and to vote in the outsiders, because the People's City Council, now listen carefully to this, has been co-opted by the school committee.

285
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:48,002
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, as I see it, the school committee infiltrates

286
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:50,355
[SPEAKER_37]: and then runs the city council.

287
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:55,817
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a case of the tail wagging the dog.

288
00:42:57,098 --> 00:42:57,838
[SPEAKER_37]: Let me explain.

289
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:06,002
[SPEAKER_37]: The mayor is chairman of the school committee and is compensated for that position in the school committee budget.

290
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:11,004
[SPEAKER_37]: A majority of the city council has connections with the school committees.

291
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:16,167
[SPEAKER_37]: Some have relatives on the school payroll now

292
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:21,956
[SPEAKER_37]: and another school committee member may be elected to the city council this year.

293
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:37,884
[SPEAKER_37]: Having finished seventh in the primary elections, the city council votes to accept the school budget as it is presented by the superintendent schools and the school committee each June of the year without making any significant changes.

294
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:45,628
[SPEAKER_37]: We just don't know where the school committee ends and the city council begins.

295
00:43:47,412 --> 00:43:49,873
[SPEAKER_37]: No one favors education more than I do.

296
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:55,095
[SPEAKER_37]: All of my fulfillment and the fulfillment of my four children is due to education.

297
00:43:56,656 --> 00:44:02,139
[SPEAKER_37]: But our school committee, which also rules the city, does not educate.

298
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:07,781
[SPEAKER_37]: The school budget compensates all of them very, very well.

299
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:13,684
[SPEAKER_37]: The cost to the city of Bedford is probably $13,000 a year for each enrolled student.

300
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:17,791
[SPEAKER_37]: That's very high.

301
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:23,215
[SPEAKER_37]: And yet, the record is regrettable.

302
00:44:25,156 --> 00:44:27,297
[SPEAKER_37]: Our next generation must be saved.

303
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:30,999
[SPEAKER_37]: We must serve all the people of Medford.

304
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,301
[SPEAKER_37]: We must vote out the incumbents.

305
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:38,604
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

306
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:57,565
[SPEAKER_25]: 17-714 petition by Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, to address the council on the issue of becoming a sanctuary city.

307
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:08,549
[SPEAKER_25]: Before Councilor Penta, I'm sorry, my former councilor gets up, I'd like to read something that the city council passed unanimously in November of 2016.

308
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:11,050
[SPEAKER_25]: Dear Mr. President and city councils,

309
00:45:13,203 --> 00:45:24,045
[SPEAKER_25]: Whereas the strength of our nation is derived from its history of diversity that has enriched our community with a variety of cultures, faith, traditions, and viewpoints.

310
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:32,686
[SPEAKER_25]: And whereas the city of Method is a community that welcomes and values the very racial and ethnic makeup of our residents.

311
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:40,628
[SPEAKER_25]: And whereas the city of Method stands in support of all immigrant groups and newcomers as they pursue the American dream.

312
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:42,608
[SPEAKER_25]: And whereas the city of Method

313
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:54,359
[SPEAKER_25]: will work to model our city as a safe and welcoming place that equally encourages all to speak, seek personal advancement, and to reside in peaceful consentment and method.

314
00:45:54,459 --> 00:46:09,206
[SPEAKER_25]: And the safe method rejects all words and acts of hate, indifference, and intolerance that undermine our neighbors, communities of faith, and our schools, and thwart the promise of equal justice.

315
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,548
[SPEAKER_25]: Whereas our nation was founded

316
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:23,259
[SPEAKER_25]: on the fundamental principles that all persons are entitled to equal protection of law, equal opportunity, and the enjoyment of civil and human rights.

317
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:35,244
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, therefore, the city of Method proudly supports the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and the collaboration of race in Medford and beyond.

318
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:38,866
[SPEAKER_25]: And signed, Mayor Stephanie Burke.

319
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:41,907
[SPEAKER_25]: And this was passed on a seven to zero,

320
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:44,769
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion by the City Council.

321
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:46,390
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

322
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:51,574
[SPEAKER_39]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party.

323
00:46:53,676 --> 00:47:05,285
[SPEAKER_39]: I come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on.

324
00:47:06,145 --> 00:47:10,889
[SPEAKER_39]: At the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tudin for propelling this issue

325
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:13,675
[SPEAKER_39]: before our citizens of the city of Method.

326
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:26,121
[SPEAKER_39]: Since this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take.

327
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:36,626
[SPEAKER_39]: To me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council, the school committee, take a position on this issue.

328
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:54,914
[SPEAKER_39]: Because isn't it weird, when we think about our America today, and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League, or little Pop Warner kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue.

329
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:58,115
[SPEAKER_39]: And our culture seems to be at issue.

330
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:01,296
[SPEAKER_39]: But where are we going with all of that?

331
00:48:01,396 --> 00:48:02,456
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't know.

332
00:48:02,496 --> 00:48:05,337
[SPEAKER_39]: Sanctuary City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s.

333
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:16,882
[SPEAKER_39]: Central folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place.

334
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:28,947
[SPEAKER_39]: And what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out.

335
00:48:29,821 --> 00:48:37,826
[SPEAKER_39]: But that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities.

336
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:50,215
[SPEAKER_39]: And as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016.

337
00:48:51,756 --> 00:48:57,220
[SPEAKER_39]: If you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Method stands in support of all immigrant groups.

338
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,001
[SPEAKER_39]: I think the word before all,

339
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,090
[SPEAKER_39]: an immigrant should be legal.

340
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,331
[SPEAKER_39]: All legal immigrant groups.

341
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:09,153
[SPEAKER_39]: Because we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws.

342
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:11,554
[SPEAKER_39]: Its foundation is built on laws.

343
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:15,515
[SPEAKER_39]: And it's on the legality of what we do each and every day.

344
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:28,239
[SPEAKER_39]: And it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right

345
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:32,117
[SPEAKER_39]: We're giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility.

346
00:49:33,497 --> 00:49:39,861
[SPEAKER_39]: But the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer.

347
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:52,047
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue.

348
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:55,029
[SPEAKER_39]: It says, all lives matter.

349
00:49:56,315 --> 00:49:57,796
[SPEAKER_39]: Everybody's lives matter.

350
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:01,479
[SPEAKER_39]: White, black, blue, green, I don't care what nationality you are.

351
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:10,906
[SPEAKER_39]: If you're here in this country, and you're here legally, or you have the proper legal documents, earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters.

352
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:18,212
[SPEAKER_39]: And for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now.

353
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:23,688
[SPEAKER_39]: We as a community are very generous to so many people.

354
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:45,525
[SPEAKER_39]: You members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding, and if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Method, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Method.

355
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,088
[SPEAKER_39]: You've also seen monies go to legal, council,

356
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:57,678
[SPEAKER_39]: for people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward.

357
00:50:59,158 --> 00:51:06,560
[SPEAKER_39]: We also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can.

358
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:15,343
[SPEAKER_39]: And while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal?

359
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:19,604
[SPEAKER_39]: And I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself,

360
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,040
[SPEAKER_39]: presents that particular situation.

361
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:25,563
[SPEAKER_39]: Like I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on.

362
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:36,049
[SPEAKER_39]: Sanctuary cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws.

363
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:43,474
[SPEAKER_39]: And they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities.

364
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:47,837
[SPEAKER_39]: Now, in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress,

365
00:51:49,591 --> 00:52:01,239
[SPEAKER_39]: It stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from.

366
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,941
[SPEAKER_39]: But inclusive of those crimes,

367
00:52:05,196 --> 00:52:11,538
[SPEAKER_39]: There was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014 drunk driving charges to individuals that did not have a license.

368
00:52:11,558 --> 00:52:15,240
[SPEAKER_39]: There were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time.

369
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,847
[SPEAKER_39]: What does that say to the law abiding citizen?

370
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:40,250
[SPEAKER_39]: But more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel?

371
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:48,814
[SPEAKER_39]: Who especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not.

372
00:52:49,214 --> 00:52:53,537
[SPEAKER_39]: You can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me.

373
00:52:55,064 --> 00:53:09,312
[SPEAKER_39]: It has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally.

374
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:17,277
[SPEAKER_39]: And that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be here legally, but that I can arrest and imprison.

375
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:19,618
[SPEAKER_39]: And that's really not right.

376
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:26,271
[SPEAKER_39]: There's a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died.

377
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:27,991
[SPEAKER_39]: He came from Levone, Texas.

378
00:53:29,112 --> 00:53:33,213
[SPEAKER_39]: And he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision.

379
00:53:34,134 --> 00:53:41,776
[SPEAKER_39]: And he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old, strike that, his four-year-old daughter and his 22-month-old son.

380
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:50,079
[SPEAKER_39]: The illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence.

381
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:55,764
[SPEAKER_39]: a two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter.

382
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:19,248
[SPEAKER_39]: The woman, subsequent to that, has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation, because she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that, and the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic, she now becomes the culprit and not the victim.

383
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:22,196
[SPEAKER_39]: These are just little nuances.

384
00:54:22,236 --> 00:54:23,657
[SPEAKER_39]: We can go to the entire country.

385
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:31,823
[SPEAKER_39]: There are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country.

386
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:33,084
[SPEAKER_39]: And that's not right.

387
00:54:33,364 --> 00:54:35,766
[SPEAKER_39]: Absolutely not right.

388
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:41,970
[SPEAKER_39]: When we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system.

389
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,432
[SPEAKER_39]: They go to our quality schools.

390
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:46,933
[SPEAKER_39]: They get free housing and free food.

391
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:48,935
[SPEAKER_39]: But they don't choose to blend in

392
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:53,775
[SPEAKER_39]: by learning English and assimilating to our American culture.

393
00:54:54,835 --> 00:55:11,943
[SPEAKER_39]: And further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in, it adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America.

394
00:55:13,123 --> 00:55:17,345
[SPEAKER_39]: So the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office.

395
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:22,776
[SPEAKER_39]: I haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature.

396
00:55:22,816 --> 00:55:29,319
[SPEAKER_39]: Just one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities.

397
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:30,879
[SPEAKER_39]: I commend him for it.

398
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:31,979
[SPEAKER_39]: He took his position.

399
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,901
[SPEAKER_39]: It's a very important issue to be discussed.

400
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:44,744
[SPEAKER_39]: Because if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd,

401
00:55:46,365 --> 00:55:50,488
[SPEAKER_39]: resolution, well, this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city.

402
00:55:51,129 --> 00:55:52,830
[SPEAKER_39]: Either we are or we're not.

403
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:59,095
[SPEAKER_39]: And I think you councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position.

404
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:10,605
[SPEAKER_39]: And the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against, in a common level headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree.

405
00:56:11,752 --> 00:56:14,874
[SPEAKER_39]: And that's where I think we need to be going here in this community.

406
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:21,079
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93.

407
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:22,680
[SPEAKER_39]: It says we are a welcoming.

408
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,461
[SPEAKER_39]: We've always been a welcoming committee.

409
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:31,046
[SPEAKER_39]: We've got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years.

410
00:56:31,326 --> 00:56:34,529
[SPEAKER_39]: And slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore.

411
00:56:35,129 --> 00:56:38,332
[SPEAKER_39]: The cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control.

412
00:56:38,872 --> 00:56:39,833
[SPEAKER_39]: Makes no sense at all.

413
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:48,192
[SPEAKER_39]: And if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen.

414
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:52,234
[SPEAKER_39]: You can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on.

415
00:56:52,474 --> 00:56:53,634
[SPEAKER_39]: And Dr. Stirella was right.

416
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:55,756
[SPEAKER_39]: Your finances will be so out of control.

417
00:56:56,656 --> 00:57:01,859
[SPEAKER_39]: And if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it.

418
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:08,322
[SPEAKER_39]: And please let the people know as a candidate for office that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it.

419
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,891
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. Panto, we're running, you're running over your time.

420
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:11,451
[SPEAKER_25]: That was a lot.

421
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:13,994
[SPEAKER_25]: I think this is a very important issue.

422
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:15,735
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, we have a 10 minute timeframe.

423
00:57:16,156 --> 00:57:16,476
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

424
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:20,880
[SPEAKER_25]: There are other people that will let you speak.

425
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:30,028
[SPEAKER_39]: I think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone

426
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:36,563
[SPEAKER_39]: should tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal.

427
00:57:37,244 --> 00:57:47,398
[SPEAKER_39]: That's their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.

428
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:02,262
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

429
00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:04,163
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Curtis Tudin.

430
00:58:04,364 --> 00:58:19,655
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 340 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts, and I'm here to speak in support of Medford pursuing sanctuary city status or any initiative that makes it clear that this is a community that is welcoming and safe for all residents, regardless of immigration status.

431
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:23,479
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a lot of reasoning behind that.

432
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:27,903
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, I also agree that it's an important topic that people need to take a stance on.

433
00:58:28,323 --> 00:58:32,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I commend the city council for their statement from last November.

434
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:36,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it definitely got a point across that you were trying to make.

435
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I commend the mayor and the police chief for,

436
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:51,689
[SPEAKER_12]: expressing and assuring me in different conversations and other residents that Medford doesn't practice the tactics that are what sanctuary city status tries to address.

437
00:58:52,289 --> 00:59:00,954
[SPEAKER_12]: But all of that is great to practice, but it's one of those rare problems where we actually have to preach what we practice.

438
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:03,135
[SPEAKER_12]: So that shouldn't be too difficult.

439
00:59:03,175 --> 00:59:08,418
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're already a city that does all these great things, we need to be clear in stating

440
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:16,924
[SPEAKER_12]: that we are a sanctuary city status or we are a safe community, whatever the title may be, it's up to the community to decide that particular label.

441
00:59:17,544 --> 00:59:22,588
[SPEAKER_12]: But we need something that's clear so that all residents in the community can understand it.

442
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:33,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Specifically, as an employee of Bedford Public Schools, I see on a regular basis when immigrant families come into the building and because they don't speak English,

443
00:59:34,077 --> 01:00:01,248
[SPEAKER_12]: And because of the culture of fear that is added on to by all the statistics that were read, even though it is documented that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than ordinary legal Americans, every day these families come into the Medford Public Schools and they're afraid to make eye contact because they don't know where that may lead, whether it's with an authority figure,

444
01:00:01,788 --> 01:00:04,329
[SPEAKER_12]: or with a teacher or anybody, even another student.

445
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:28,919
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish, as someone who doesn't speak another language, that I could hand them a piece of paper in any language that clearly explains that being part of Medford Public Schools is a right of all students and that in this building, or really in all city buildings, you shouldn't feel discriminated against or in danger in any way, whether that's in a classroom or talking to a police officer or talking to a firefighter, going to an emergency room,

446
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:39,726
[SPEAKER_12]: all these essential aspects of just being a human being that a city should be able to provide without a culture of fear that is unfortunately sweeping across the country.

447
01:00:39,786 --> 01:00:49,392
[SPEAKER_12]: So for Medford to stand up and label itself what I will ultimately see as the right side of history, then I think now is the appropriate time to do so.

448
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:54,375
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for listening and I appreciate everybody coming out and contributing to the conversation.

449
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:05,971
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

450
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:10,434
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Kevin Wolfson, 159 Central Ave.

451
01:01:11,275 --> 01:01:18,300
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for welcoming the public and the chance to speak.

452
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,862
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm a participant in a group called Safe Medford that many of you have heard from.

453
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:25,545
[SPEAKER_23]: The mission of our group is to advocate for

454
01:01:26,112 --> 01:01:28,897
[SPEAKER_23]: all people in Medford, regardless of their immigration status.

455
01:01:29,138 --> 01:01:34,869
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know many of you, I hope, have seen our website, safemedford.org.

456
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:37,033
[SPEAKER_23]: If you haven't, I hope that you will take the time to look through it.

457
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:54,728
[SPEAKER_23]: And you'll notice that we don't use the term sanctuary city because it is often connected to statistics like Mr. Pinto was citing, and this sort of kind of building of fear that is not what we're about, not what we're intending, and that we feel distorts the issue.

458
01:01:54,829 --> 01:02:07,357
[SPEAKER_23]: So the term that we use is safe communities, but regardless of what the term is, our goal is to pass a set of policies, and these are policies that are used across the country.

459
01:02:08,618 --> 01:02:19,606
[SPEAKER_23]: that are supported by police organizations and sheriffs across the country that clarify how the police does and does not work with federal immigration.

460
01:02:20,526 --> 01:02:32,115
[SPEAKER_23]: The Homeland Security Department, which is what ICE is part of, is, if I recall correctly, the second largest, second most heavily, second biggest funded

461
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:35,397
[SPEAKER_23]: It's either second or third in the entire country.

462
01:02:35,497 --> 01:02:38,278
[SPEAKER_23]: They have no lack of resources.

463
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:39,959
[SPEAKER_23]: They are extremely well-funded.

464
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:46,883
[SPEAKER_23]: They have all of the money they need to do the work that they are supposed to do, and that all of us will agree is important work.

465
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:57,233
[SPEAKER_23]: The Medford Police Department, the city of Method, clearly from statements of people so far tonight, clearly is not nearly as well funded.

466
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:04,816
[SPEAKER_23]: The Medford Police Department doesn't have enough police officers, according to many people, and I have no doubt about that.

467
01:03:05,737 --> 01:03:13,360
[SPEAKER_23]: The police station itself is in disrepair, and I know that there is the welcome push to build a new police department.

468
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:24,872
[SPEAKER_23]: And a large part of why we're asking for what we're asking for is so that the limited resources of Medford aren't co-opted by a very well-funded national organization.

469
01:03:24,912 --> 01:03:32,880
[SPEAKER_23]: It's about protecting, in one way, about protecting Medford's rights to be an independent community that decides what to do with its own resources.

470
01:03:33,756 --> 01:03:34,836
[SPEAKER_23]: That's one thing I wanted to point out.

471
01:03:34,856 --> 01:03:45,800
[SPEAKER_23]: The other thing that I wanted to point out is the discussion of legality and illegal and legal immigrants and that sort of thing.

472
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,662
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to point out that immigration offenses are civil offenses.

473
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:56,044
[SPEAKER_23]: They are not criminal offenses, and they are often connected to criminal offenses with statistics, again, like Mr. Pinto was talking about.

474
01:03:57,805 --> 01:04:00,607
[SPEAKER_23]: But that is not what we're getting at.

475
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:14,477
[SPEAKER_23]: We're getting at people who are at various stages of immigration documentation not being treated like criminals for what is a civil offense in the same way that a speeding ticket is a civil offense.

476
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:23,784
[SPEAKER_23]: Like Mr. Tootin just said, immigration status has no correlation to people being more violent.

477
01:04:25,807 --> 01:04:31,275
[SPEAKER_23]: There are plenty of ways that you can pick statistics that make it seem like that's the case, and it's not the case.

478
01:04:32,196 --> 01:04:37,544
[SPEAKER_23]: And, again, I hope you'll look at the safemetford.org website, where we explain that more clearly and more thoroughly.

479
01:04:39,466 --> 01:04:50,916
[SPEAKER_23]: Finally, I want to point out that cities that have these policies, I mentioned earlier that police organizations and sheriffs across the country support policies like this.

480
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:54,379
[SPEAKER_23]: Cities that have these policies are economically stronger.

481
01:04:54,939 --> 01:04:56,780
[SPEAKER_23]: They are statistically safer.

482
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:10,388
[SPEAKER_23]: And the reason for that is that people who might be at risk of being targeted by ICE don't feel like they're afraid to call the police if they see a crime or if they are a victim of a crime.

483
01:05:11,168 --> 01:05:12,849
[SPEAKER_23]: And that makes all of us safer.

484
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,491
[SPEAKER_23]: So, again, thank you for the chance to speak.

485
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:16,792
That's all I have.

486
01:05:25,393 --> 01:05:28,114
[SPEAKER_32]: Maria Stott, 122 Boston Avenue.

487
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:29,934
[SPEAKER_32]: Good evening.

488
01:05:30,495 --> 01:05:33,495
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you all for the opportunity to be here, and thank you for serving.

489
01:05:34,216 --> 01:05:34,996
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a service.

490
01:05:36,056 --> 01:05:38,417
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to give you just a few facts.

491
01:05:39,237 --> 01:05:41,938
[SPEAKER_32]: I am a lifetime member of the NAACP.

492
01:05:43,198 --> 01:05:45,019
[SPEAKER_32]: I am a member of Safe Medford.

493
01:05:45,819 --> 01:05:54,402
[SPEAKER_32]: Before I give you four facts, I want to say that my husband was an immigrant, and my in-laws were immigrants, and the thought

494
01:05:55,481 --> 01:06:04,305
[SPEAKER_32]: of my child coming home from school one day and her grandmother or her dad not being there is insane.

495
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:18,833
[SPEAKER_32]: Less than 3% of 11 million undocumented residents have been convicted of felonies compared to 6% of the general population.

496
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:25,176
[SPEAKER_32]: Undocumented residents are ineligible

497
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:36,634
[SPEAKER_32]: for programs like SNAP and TANF and non-emergency Medicare, yet they pay into our social security system.

498
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:48,819
[SPEAKER_32]: It's true, some new immigrants, newly arrived immigrants do go to our public schools, but second and third generation immigrants stimulate our economy.

499
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,341
[SPEAKER_32]: Unauthorized people, undocumented people,

500
01:06:55,506 --> 01:07:00,829
[SPEAKER_32]: pay about $12 billion a year in state and local taxes.

501
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:01,869
[SPEAKER_32]: And this is cited from 2015.

502
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:12,275
[SPEAKER_32]: Immigrants with little English and limited job skills do the jobs that Americans often don't want to do.

503
01:07:13,956 --> 01:07:19,499
[SPEAKER_32]: We are a richer society when we are an inclusive society.

504
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,101
[SPEAKER_32]: And I really want people to

505
01:07:24,728 --> 01:07:27,550
[SPEAKER_32]: seek understanding, and then to be understood.

506
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:38,657
[SPEAKER_32]: There is a difference between undocumented individuals and criminals who have broken federal and state laws.

507
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:39,877
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

508
01:07:40,498 --> 01:07:40,838
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

509
01:07:47,982 --> 01:07:49,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

510
01:07:50,424 --> 01:07:51,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

511
01:07:51,564 --> 01:07:53,506
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

512
01:07:55,526 --> 01:08:02,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Over the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States.

513
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:13,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Me, personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way.

514
01:08:13,997 --> 01:08:18,200
[SPEAKER_15]: But we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S.

515
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Constitution.

516
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:20,481
[SPEAKER_15]: And under the U.S.

517
01:08:20,521 --> 01:08:22,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Constitution, there are laws that govern

518
01:08:23,553 --> 01:08:25,975
[SPEAKER_15]: how one becomes a citizen of the United States.

519
01:08:26,696 --> 01:08:41,930
[SPEAKER_15]: For a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to.

520
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:48,816
[SPEAKER_15]: You're subverting the Constitution, which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from

521
01:08:49,494 --> 01:08:55,137
[SPEAKER_15]: impoverished or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life.

522
01:08:55,257 --> 01:09:00,919
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration.

523
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:15,986
[SPEAKER_15]: While it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time, a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States.

524
01:09:17,726 --> 01:09:18,667
[SPEAKER_15]: On the state level,

525
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:23,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Among the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year.

526
01:09:23,972 --> 01:09:26,514
[SPEAKER_15]: At the federal level, it's $45 billion a year.

527
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:41,307
[SPEAKER_15]: So the costs coming in don't even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on.

528
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,913
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that for a city like Medford,

529
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,592
[SPEAKER_15]: for a group like Safe Medford to come along.

530
01:09:52,273 --> 01:09:58,340
[SPEAKER_15]: And this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else.

531
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:04,428
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a matter of respect for the law in becoming a citizen of the United States.

532
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:21,859
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has

533
01:10:23,562 --> 01:10:30,027
[SPEAKER_15]: really the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be.

534
01:10:30,808 --> 01:10:41,336
[SPEAKER_15]: And under the guise of the feel-good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city.

535
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:43,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll leave you with this question.

536
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:49,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Medford being a welcoming city by

537
01:10:50,185 --> 01:10:52,448
[SPEAKER_15]: basically subverting the rule of U.S.

538
01:10:52,508 --> 01:11:03,082
[SPEAKER_15]: constitutional law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do?

539
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:05,505
[SPEAKER_15]: When a new resident or a new business

540
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:14,474
[SPEAKER_15]: comes to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is.

541
01:11:14,934 --> 01:11:21,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Here are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant.

542
01:11:21,921 --> 01:11:22,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Here are the city services.

543
01:11:23,043 --> 01:11:25,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's when we pick up trash in your neighborhood.

544
01:11:26,106 --> 01:11:27,387
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a welcoming city?

545
01:11:28,688 --> 01:11:29,069
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not.

546
01:11:29,861 --> 01:11:35,205
[SPEAKER_15]: But circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S.

547
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:36,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Constitution is?

548
01:11:37,347 --> 01:11:38,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I beg to differ.

549
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

550
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,567
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Rachel van drop.

551
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:49,308
[SPEAKER_29]: I live at 19 Fulton street.

552
01:11:49,328 --> 01:11:55,190
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I am a part of safe Medford and I've also been a part of, uh, the people power as well.

553
01:11:55,310 --> 01:12:00,672
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would just like to clarify, um, that we have not been dictating what the police should be doing.

554
01:12:00,792 --> 01:12:10,375
[SPEAKER_29]: We have been asking them to put their current policies in writing so that that can be used to ensure people that they are not going to be

555
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:11,815
[SPEAKER_29]: treated in such a way.

556
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:15,797
[SPEAKER_29]: We're not saying do this, we're saying we appreciate that you are doing this.

557
01:12:16,317 --> 01:12:20,158
[SPEAKER_29]: As things are, please put it in writing so that it can be clarified.

558
01:12:20,678 --> 01:12:21,038
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

559
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:21,538
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

560
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:31,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

561
01:12:31,061 --> 01:12:31,942
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

562
01:12:31,962 --> 01:12:32,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

563
01:12:33,002 --> 01:12:34,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Munir Germanus.

564
01:12:34,703 --> 01:12:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I live at 3 Summit Road, and I appreciate

565
01:12:39,451 --> 01:12:43,214
[SPEAKER_03]: the opportunity to address this group.

566
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a naturalized citizen.

567
01:12:46,376 --> 01:12:52,440
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife and I became citizens primarily because we happen to be well educated.

568
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,862
[SPEAKER_03]: We both have PhDs.

569
01:12:55,562 --> 01:13:02,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was very useful for various businesses to work and hire us.

570
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:08,271
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many immigrants who unfortunately don't have that luxury and

571
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:16,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I think basically welcoming means welcoming for all and not welcoming just for the educated.

572
01:13:20,032 --> 01:13:31,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So I personally am quite in favor of having Medford and actually all of Massachusetts become a sanctuary city, just like the state of California.

573
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:37,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would certainly urge all candidates running for office

574
01:13:38,638 --> 01:13:43,082
[SPEAKER_03]: including you, ladies and gentlemen, to do the same.

575
01:13:43,422 --> 01:13:43,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

576
01:13:43,983 --> 01:13:44,383
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

577
01:13:58,855 --> 01:13:59,196
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

578
01:13:59,236 --> 01:14:00,257
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

579
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:05,101
[SPEAKER_31]: Eileen Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford.

580
01:14:07,748 --> 01:14:11,330
[SPEAKER_31]: For all of my adult life, I have worked with immigrants.

581
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:16,492
[SPEAKER_31]: The past 25, I've been teaching English to adults.

582
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:20,814
[SPEAKER_31]: I agree it's a good idea for immigrants to speak English.

583
01:14:21,654 --> 01:14:22,895
[SPEAKER_31]: Where are the programs?

584
01:14:23,595 --> 01:14:24,556
[SPEAKER_31]: Where is the money?

585
01:14:25,736 --> 01:14:26,617
[SPEAKER_31]: People come here.

586
01:14:26,637 --> 01:14:33,280
[SPEAKER_31]: They have to work hard to support their families, you know, and often they don't have cars,

587
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,010
[SPEAKER_31]: maybe working two, three jobs and they don't have the time to learn English.

588
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:43,259
[SPEAKER_31]: Sometimes when people are laid off from jobs they get

589
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:53,352
[SPEAKER_31]: So they get unemployment compensation, and part of the deal for that is that they take English classes.

590
01:14:53,572 --> 01:15:08,855
[SPEAKER_31]: I've had those kind of people, women who have been in this country for 25 years, never learned English, because they didn't have the opportunity, they didn't have the time, they didn't have the money, but when they were given it, they were so, so happy.

591
01:15:09,435 --> 01:15:11,156
[SPEAKER_31]: to learn English.

592
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:19,239
[SPEAKER_31]: So if we want people to learn English, we have to put more money into programs to teach them English, you know?

593
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:29,163
[SPEAKER_31]: And also, you know, the talking about immigrants and criminals is so deceptive because

594
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:39,156
[SPEAKER_31]: Immigrants and undocumented immigrants have a much, much lower rate of crime than American citizens do.

595
01:15:39,776 --> 01:15:46,738
[SPEAKER_31]: Most of them are just too busy trying to survive and doing lots of jobs that Americans don't want to do.

596
01:15:48,226 --> 01:15:52,889
[SPEAKER_31]: And who is it who decides who comes into the United States?

597
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:57,953
[SPEAKER_31]: Isn't it a bunch of white men with privilege and power and money?

598
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:06,559
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, who says that a woman from Honduras who's fleeing domestic violence and gangs can't come in?

599
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:08,140
[SPEAKER_25]: Can we keep it down in the back?

600
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,060
[SPEAKER_25]: There's someone who's speaking.

601
01:16:09,821 --> 01:16:10,161
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

602
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:11,662
[SPEAKER_25]: I apologize.

603
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:12,583
[SPEAKER_31]: That's OK.

604
01:16:13,523 --> 01:16:15,065
[SPEAKER_31]: And to talk about the flag.

605
01:16:16,107 --> 01:16:20,390
[SPEAKER_31]: But not to mention slavery, the legacy of slavery that we're living in.

606
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:32,640
[SPEAKER_31]: To talk about disrespect to the country when we're not talking about all the numerous black people that we've seen slaughtered by white racism, by white supremacy.

607
01:16:34,147 --> 01:16:49,312
[SPEAKER_31]: And when people object to that, when people stand up and say this is wrong, or they take a knee or they protest, then the issue becomes the flag and not discrimination, not unjust killings.

608
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:51,833
[SPEAKER_31]: It's so deceptive.

609
01:16:53,613 --> 01:16:57,055
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, my grandparents came here from Poland.

610
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:01,256
[SPEAKER_31]: I wouldn't be alive if they hadn't been able to come here

611
01:17:02,876 --> 01:17:11,163
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate the United States so much, and my life, and the life of my children, my grandchildren, and my new great-grandchildren.

612
01:17:12,604 --> 01:17:15,207
[SPEAKER_31]: And I want the same rights for other people.

613
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,308
[SPEAKER_31]: I've met these people.

614
01:17:17,408 --> 01:17:18,449
[SPEAKER_31]: They're good people.

615
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:20,611
[SPEAKER_31]: They contribute to our country.

616
01:17:20,952 --> 01:17:24,254
[SPEAKER_31]: They do a lot of jobs that other people don't want to do.

617
01:17:24,274 --> 01:17:27,897
[SPEAKER_31]: I recently had hip replacement surgery.

618
01:17:28,738 --> 01:17:33,521
[SPEAKER_31]: And who were the people that were taking care of old people in this country but immigrants?

619
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:37,203
[SPEAKER_31]: And believe me, I didn't ask them if they were documented.

620
01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:41,325
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't care if they're documented or they're undocumented.

621
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,386
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm glad they're here.

622
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:43,947
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm glad they're safe.

623
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:47,569
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm glad they're contributing to our communities with their

624
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:51,171
[SPEAKER_31]: skills and their money.

625
01:17:51,191 --> 01:18:00,056
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, right now, we've had an instance where down on the Cape, they had trouble staffing the hotels and the restaurants, right?

626
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:06,519
[SPEAKER_31]: And people lost money down there because they didn't have enough immigrants like they used to have.

627
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:14,364
[SPEAKER_31]: And in California, they're having trouble getting people picking the fruit and the vegetables, right?

628
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:26,065
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, you may want to call them illegal or whatever you want to call them, but they've done a lot of work for our country, and they haven't been treated fairly a lot of times.

629
01:18:26,705 --> 01:18:30,446
[SPEAKER_31]: And I just want to stand and say, I support these people.

630
01:18:30,526 --> 01:18:41,090
[SPEAKER_31]: I think they contribute to our economy and to the richness of our culture, which isn't only white and Christian, but is multicultural.

631
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,211
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

632
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:42,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

633
01:18:53,936 --> 01:18:54,316
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

634
01:18:54,376 --> 01:18:55,596
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

635
01:18:55,776 --> 01:18:57,797
[SPEAKER_34]: Joanna Hicks, 15 Talbot Street.

636
01:18:59,657 --> 01:19:04,478
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm a fourth generation Japanese American and Filipino on my mother's side.

637
01:19:05,478 --> 01:19:16,420
[SPEAKER_34]: And some of you may know, during World War II, Japanese Americans were incarcerated, 120,000 of them, just on the basis of their national origin.

638
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,181
[SPEAKER_34]: Some of the men of that generation went on to serve for the

639
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:29,543
[SPEAKER_34]: in the armed forces and became the most decorated unit in World War II, sent into some of the most dangerous missions.

640
01:19:30,483 --> 01:19:47,091
[SPEAKER_34]: And I wanted to support safe communities in Medford and speak out that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, serve this country in the military as well as contributing to the economy.

641
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:47,991
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

642
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:48,792
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

643
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:57,818
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

644
01:19:57,858 --> 01:19:59,038
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

645
01:19:59,218 --> 01:20:01,439
[SPEAKER_11]: William graves, 69 Stanley Avenue.

646
01:20:01,459 --> 01:20:04,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I'm also a member of safe Medford.

647
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, in addition, I'm a, I'm an immigration lawyer and I've been practicing immigration law for about 20 years.

648
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:17,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I think that having Medford become a safe community and declaring itself a safe community is, is a good idea.

649
01:20:17,862 --> 01:20:19,763
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it promotes safety in the community.

650
01:20:20,203 --> 01:20:21,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it subverts the law.

651
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:23,884
[SPEAKER_11]: It certainly doesn't separate the federal law in any way.

652
01:20:24,824 --> 01:20:25,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, immigration law,

653
01:20:26,897 --> 01:20:28,538
[SPEAKER_11]: isn't really constitutional law.

654
01:20:28,778 --> 01:20:29,899
[SPEAKER_11]: It's statutory law.

655
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:36,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Congress basically has the power to make laws governing immigration, and it's enforced by the executive branch.

656
01:20:39,485 --> 01:20:42,347
[SPEAKER_11]: It's primarily civil law, as Kevin had pointed out earlier.

657
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:43,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much of it is criminal law.

658
01:20:44,008 --> 01:20:52,414
[SPEAKER_11]: So when people are here without documentation or expired documentation, they're here in a civil violation, not a criminal violation.

659
01:20:53,715 --> 01:21:00,557
[SPEAKER_11]: In, in recent months I think the climate of fear has greatly increased and I certainly see this in my practice.

660
01:21:01,438 --> 01:21:12,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I see, I get calls from parents who are afraid to send their kids, their US citizen kids to school because they're afraid that they may be questioned about the immigration status of one or both of their parents.

661
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:17,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, I try to let them know that that's not the case and that won't happen.

662
01:21:17,863 --> 01:21:17,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

663
01:21:18,953 --> 01:21:25,537
[SPEAKER_11]: People are afraid to go out, and I think that people are afraid to call the police when they're a victim of a crime or if they witness a crime.

664
01:21:25,897 --> 01:21:28,899
[SPEAKER_11]: They're afraid to come to City Hall to complain about a landlord.

665
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:45,029
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that creating a safe community and Medford declaring itself a safe community will make all residents, all members of our community, the people with whom we live, to feel welcome and to feel welcome to communicate with the police or with the city.

666
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,190
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I have to say.

667
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:47,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

668
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:55,417
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

669
01:21:55,817 --> 01:21:58,078
[SPEAKER_25]: Records, the meeting of October 10th.

670
01:22:04,161 --> 01:22:05,262
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

671
01:22:12,525 --> 01:22:14,526
[SPEAKER_27]: Rachel Tannenhouse, 26 Pearl Street, please.

672
01:22:16,126 --> 01:22:16,347
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi.

673
01:22:18,427 --> 01:22:22,329
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Rachel and I am the granddaughter of refugees.

674
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:30,240
[SPEAKER_27]: And yes, I am in favor of Medford being a sanctuary city.

675
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,981
[SPEAKER_27]: So you all can get a head start on snarking now.

676
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:40,303
[SPEAKER_27]: And my grandmother, who is 97, came here as a refugee.

677
01:22:41,143 --> 01:22:52,686
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't know, or I haven't really asked whether or not she got here legally, because I don't care, because I'm pretty happy to be alive, and also Hitler.

678
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:04,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Frankly, if people are escaping genocide, I think that really that is a situation that I don't get to do a lot of judging about.

679
01:23:04,722 --> 01:23:11,044
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, I'm pretty sure that there are a number of people in the room who have studied their history.

680
01:23:12,424 --> 01:23:17,185
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you have done so, then you know that much of the rhetoric around immigrants today is

681
01:23:18,089 --> 01:23:25,992
[SPEAKER_27]: very, very similar to the rhetoric around Jewish refugees in the 1940s, late 1930s, early 1940s.

682
01:23:27,672 --> 01:23:36,255
[SPEAKER_27]: Really, really very similar, talking about crime rates, talking about loyalty to the country, talking about who are we really letting in, talking about who's a real American.

683
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:45,338
[SPEAKER_27]: And I just want to make that really clear that a lot of people, some of whom are relatives of mine, died because of that sort of rhetoric.

684
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:49,072
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not really interested in a community where we let that happen again.

685
01:23:50,413 --> 01:23:53,815
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the things we talk about, one of the things that we say is never again.

686
01:23:54,696 --> 01:24:07,524
[SPEAKER_27]: And I really feel that as a member of a community who, you know, every few years or so somebody pops up and tries to wipe us out, we've gotten really good at looking out for this kind of thing.

687
01:24:08,425 --> 01:24:08,885
[SPEAKER_27]: Real good.

688
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:10,486
[SPEAKER_27]: We know it when we see it.

689
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,981
[SPEAKER_27]: And I also feel like there have been some logical fallacies that have been going on here.

690
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:24,363
[SPEAKER_27]: For example, if you're really excited about the statement that all lives matter, then you have to believe that all lives matter.

691
01:24:25,183 --> 01:24:26,243
[SPEAKER_27]: And the question is, do they?

692
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:33,625
[SPEAKER_27]: Or is it just the people that you decide matter?

693
01:24:33,725 --> 01:24:37,386
[SPEAKER_27]: You can't say, all lives matter, and then in the same breath say, but not yours.

694
01:24:37,966 --> 01:24:38,466
[SPEAKER_27]: Not these.

695
01:24:39,267 --> 01:24:40,167
[SPEAKER_27]: These do not have.

696
01:24:41,434 --> 01:24:42,675
[SPEAKER_27]: These can't be safe here.

697
01:24:43,376 --> 01:24:54,844
[SPEAKER_27]: I also agree with the statement that, obviously, God forbid somebody in this room gets attacked or robbed or anything like that, and there's a witness who is undocumented.

698
01:24:55,425 --> 01:24:59,388
[SPEAKER_27]: You're on your own under these current circumstances because

699
01:25:00,326 --> 01:25:03,529
[SPEAKER_27]: they're not going to get sent back to a place where somebody's trying to wipe them out.

700
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:17,001
[SPEAKER_27]: And I should point out, by the way, that in my family, nobody ever asks my family if they are here legally because they pass because they're white and nobody cares and nobody stops and checks you if you're white.

701
01:25:17,722 --> 01:25:25,969
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, I think that when we also talk about who's here and who's getting checked and who's not, it's really clear that we only mean certain

702
01:25:26,474 --> 01:25:32,821
[SPEAKER_27]: certain, even if you don't think you mean it, you really only mean certain subcategories of folks who are undocumented.

703
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:44,435
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, I love how people who generally espouse small government are really okay with our police department being federalized and with the federal government telling our local police department what to do.

704
01:25:46,216 --> 01:25:48,457
[SPEAKER_27]: That doesn't really follow logically.

705
01:25:49,257 --> 01:26:00,583
[SPEAKER_27]: What we are saying is that a federal agency cannot come in and commandeer our local police department and use their resources to do their work with a sanctuary city.

706
01:26:01,024 --> 01:26:06,046
[SPEAKER_27]: And so my question again is, are you for small government or are you only for some small government?

707
01:26:07,566 --> 01:26:26,193
[SPEAKER_27]: And I also agree that I hear and I agree that our police department is severely overworked and under-resourced and not making a statement that the federal government can't come in and commandeer them and use them for their own purposes is simply adding to the problem.

708
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:30,235
[SPEAKER_27]: And I hear a lot of people talking about how we have to make things easier

709
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,321
[SPEAKER_27]: for our police department.

710
01:26:32,341 --> 01:26:33,901
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to hire more police officers.

711
01:26:33,961 --> 01:26:35,542
[SPEAKER_27]: We need to build a new police station.

712
01:26:35,882 --> 01:26:51,029
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you believe those things, then why would you possibly believe that you would want to stretch their resources for things that aren't even being done by a local agency, that actually a federal agency is perfectly capable of doing themselves?

713
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:58,492
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel like this is a situation where we want to be on the right side of history.

714
01:26:59,349 --> 01:27:02,430
[SPEAKER_27]: Because my family has seen what the other side of history looks like.

715
01:27:03,931 --> 01:27:06,452
[SPEAKER_27]: And it ain't pretty, and it killed a bunch of us.

716
01:27:07,732 --> 01:27:24,559
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you think anything different is going on in the countries that are specifically the numbers are being cut down on, if you think anything all that different is going on in Syria, if you think anything all that different is going on in Sudan, then maybe you haven't studied your history all that well.

717
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,860
[SPEAKER_27]: I hear Medford public schools are pretty good.

718
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:28,821
[SPEAKER_27]: You should go take a class.

719
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:39,208
[SPEAKER_27]: I just want to say that I can't see much, but I see you, Mr. Penta.

720
01:27:40,609 --> 01:27:44,270
[SPEAKER_25]: I see what people are doing.

721
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:51,652
[SPEAKER_27]: I see what the people who want to keep out immigrants are doing.

722
01:27:52,933 --> 01:27:55,954
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know what was done to my family, and I know what it looks like.

723
01:27:57,774 --> 01:28:00,015
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm not going to sit here and let it happen again.

724
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:08,606
[SPEAKER_27]: So yeah, I am really, really in favor of all the candidates stating their position on this, because I want to know who to vote for and who not to.

725
01:28:08,646 --> 01:28:10,549
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think, actually, we're all in agreement about that.

726
01:28:10,609 --> 01:28:16,555
[SPEAKER_27]: We all want folks to make a statement on these things, because we know where we fall on this, and we want to know who to vote for.

727
01:28:16,615 --> 01:28:19,038
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that's something we are all on the same page.

728
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:21,361
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much.

729
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:21,741
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

730
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:22,302
[SPEAKER_27]: Have a good evening.

731
01:28:29,178 --> 01:28:29,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

732
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:30,678
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

733
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:35,619
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio and I live on Yale street in Medford.

734
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:38,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a pretty hot topic here.

735
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I'm going to tell you something right now.

736
01:28:40,741 --> 01:28:47,242
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take all the statistics, all the figures and everything, just throw them out the window because everybody skews statistics.

737
01:28:47,842 --> 01:28:54,924
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's really aggravating is these people come up here and they say, well, my family did this and my family did this and I'm this and I'm that.

738
01:28:55,264 --> 01:28:55,704
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all,

739
01:28:56,257 --> 01:28:57,138
[SPEAKER_05]: part of the same group.

740
01:28:57,218 --> 01:29:05,104
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all, in our families, every single one of us, have had people that have bled and died in fields far away from here, okay?

741
01:29:05,844 --> 01:29:13,370
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing that really aggravates me is if you notice the tone, it only took a matter of 10 minutes before we got into white privilege, okay?

742
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:16,633
[SPEAKER_05]: We're responsible for everything in this world that goes wrong.

743
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:18,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sick and tired of that.

744
01:29:18,454 --> 01:29:20,556
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't legislate behavior on somebody.

745
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, I don't understand this culture of fear.

746
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:26,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen that.

747
01:29:27,642 --> 01:29:31,944
[SPEAKER_05]: This city, Medford, was more diverse than it is now when I was growing up.

748
01:29:32,684 --> 01:29:34,685
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody, that's right, they are immigrants.

749
01:29:34,985 --> 01:29:36,225
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all immigrants here.

750
01:29:36,645 --> 01:29:37,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's all ways to come in here.

751
01:29:38,486 --> 01:29:40,507
[SPEAKER_05]: But what they're doing is they're making it very divisive.

752
01:29:41,187 --> 01:29:44,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's them against people that have a different point of view.

753
01:29:45,488 --> 01:29:48,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a different point of view, you're on the wrong side of history.

754
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:50,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a bunch of baloney.

755
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:57,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to tell you that nobody is saying you can't come here or anything like that.

756
01:29:58,221 --> 01:30:03,702
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you take a real good look at it, we've had a botched up immigration system for years here.

757
01:30:04,282 --> 01:30:16,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And now a certain political group has found out that by catering and offering to illegals that they've created their own voting block for the future.

758
01:30:16,546 --> 01:30:16,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

759
01:30:17,186 --> 01:30:20,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just sick and tired of everybody being blamed.

760
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:23,614
[SPEAKER_05]: When other people, you know, is this safe, Medford?

761
01:30:24,194 --> 01:30:26,195
[SPEAKER_05]: You're insinuating that Medford is not safe.

762
01:30:26,655 --> 01:30:31,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford is safe, and the police should be commended for what they're doing with what they have.

763
01:30:32,778 --> 01:30:37,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So just think before they speak over here, because I'm getting really aggravated about this nonsense.

764
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:37,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

765
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:38,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

766
01:30:44,404 --> 01:30:45,705
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

767
01:30:46,285 --> 01:30:48,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street.

768
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:54,228
[SPEAKER_02]: former Medford City Council candidate, October 17th, 2017.

769
01:30:54,508 --> 01:31:04,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all immigrants, except for the Eskimo and the Indian, plural.

770
01:31:05,656 --> 01:31:09,899
[SPEAKER_02]: In a perfect world, or a perfect country, we would not even have borders.

771
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:20,820
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, my father sponsored my mother's brother to come from Northern Italy to come here back in the 60s.

772
01:31:22,461 --> 01:31:27,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had to get him a job and gave him an apartment, half price.

773
01:31:30,103 --> 01:31:36,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of feel bad for the people that are trying to do this legally.

774
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:37,986
[SPEAKER_02]: They're waiting in line.

775
01:31:38,506 --> 01:31:40,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're paying attorney fees

776
01:31:43,032 --> 01:31:44,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else they're paying, I don't know.

777
01:31:45,915 --> 01:31:48,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they won't be able to get in legally.

778
01:31:49,157 --> 01:31:53,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what kind of a process it is these days, if there is such a system at all.

779
01:31:56,063 --> 01:32:05,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore, I coined the phrase, all sentient beings matter, period.

780
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that, not Bob Dylan.

781
01:32:09,555 --> 01:32:09,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

782
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:14,356
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

783
01:32:14,376 --> 01:32:15,576
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

784
01:32:18,457 --> 01:32:20,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Scafoe, 9th Sunset Avenue, Medford.

785
01:32:21,998 --> 01:32:25,198
[SPEAKER_14]: And we talk about white privilege.

786
01:32:26,519 --> 01:32:30,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I've gotten hit a couple of times by me being rich, white and privileged.

787
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:31,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Rich?

788
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:32,920
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

789
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:41,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe a little well off than other people, but the privilege was for me to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week to get to this point.

790
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:42,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So I worked very hard.

791
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,981
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a, I'm a second generation of immigrants.

792
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:53,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, both sides, my father and my mother's side, um, came in and they came in legally.

793
01:32:54,182 --> 01:32:55,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, they worked very hard.

794
01:32:55,883 --> 01:32:59,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, they did what they had to do and we followed that suit right down the line.

795
01:32:59,503 --> 01:33:06,364
[SPEAKER_14]: I got my work ethic from my grandparents that I was able to work 15 to 20 hours a day, seven days a week to get to this point.

796
01:33:07,405 --> 01:33:09,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I employ, um,

797
01:33:10,572 --> 01:33:20,159
[SPEAKER_14]: At least 60% of my, my employment staff are immigrants and they are very good workers.

798
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they legal?

799
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:25,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're legal, but they work very, very hard.

800
01:33:26,523 --> 01:33:32,748
[SPEAKER_14]: So tonight I just want to, I just want to make the record straight as how I feel as far as, you know, sanctuary cities.

801
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:38,432
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to express a concern and a request

802
01:33:39,469 --> 01:33:40,489
[SPEAKER_14]: to this honorable body.

803
01:33:40,969 --> 01:33:44,410
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a concern regarding a statement which was made by a council candidate.

804
01:33:46,491 --> 01:33:54,993
[SPEAKER_14]: He has promised if elected to the council that he would make a certain that he would make certain that method became a sanctuary city.

805
01:33:56,813 --> 01:34:00,954
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a bold statement with all doubts removed of his intention.

806
01:34:01,174 --> 01:34:03,275
[SPEAKER_14]: I give him credit for being honest.

807
01:34:04,255 --> 01:34:08,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I strongly disagree with him on this issue because

808
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:10,381
[SPEAKER_14]: We are a country of laws.

809
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:12,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Laws are legal documents.

810
01:34:12,962 --> 01:34:15,423
[SPEAKER_14]: They say what they say, not what you want them to say.

811
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:20,005
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want a law changed, you work to have it changed.

812
01:34:20,866 --> 01:34:22,227
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't circumvent the law.

813
01:34:23,087 --> 01:34:32,692
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I have listened and observed others, both elected councilors and candidates, use words and phrases which appear to have a hidden agenda.

814
01:34:33,492 --> 01:34:35,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I see this as an attempt

815
01:34:35,677 --> 01:34:40,599
[SPEAKER_14]: to receive approval and support from certain voting blocks that exist in the city.

816
01:34:40,999 --> 01:34:41,740
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not right.

817
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:43,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me repeat.

818
01:34:44,661 --> 01:34:48,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not in favor of sanctuary cities here in Medford or anywhere else.

819
01:34:49,663 --> 01:34:53,324
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my opinion and more importantly is my right to express such.

820
01:34:54,345 --> 01:35:01,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore I'm requesting that all city Councilors and candidates make it known by a simple yes or no,

821
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,960
[SPEAKER_14]: whether they are for Medford becoming a sanctuary city or not.

822
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:08,642
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a simple yes or no answer.

823
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:12,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilors, you have the opportunity this evening to set the record straight.

824
01:35:12,825 --> 01:35:13,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes or no?

825
01:35:13,926 --> 01:35:15,147
[SPEAKER_14]: The public has the right to know.

826
01:35:16,288 --> 01:35:25,476
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

827
01:35:25,656 --> 01:35:25,936
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

828
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:28,438
[SPEAKER_39]: Robert Penteciro, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

829
01:35:29,079 --> 01:35:31,421
[SPEAKER_39]: First of all, for the young lady to my behind me,

830
01:35:33,038 --> 01:35:35,419
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm not a white privileged individual.

831
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:46,865
[SPEAKER_39]: I've had to work for everything in my life, starting at five o'clock in the morning for eight consecutive years, driving a canteen truck, being held up three times, shot at twice.

832
01:35:47,925 --> 01:35:50,967
[SPEAKER_39]: But I didn't give up because I knew what I wanted to do.

833
01:35:51,327 --> 01:35:54,709
[SPEAKER_39]: I wanted to get a college education and go forward with my life.

834
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:56,550
[SPEAKER_39]: And that's what I did.

835
01:35:56,890 --> 01:36:00,892
[SPEAKER_39]: I did not come here tonight to be decisive or

836
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,471
[SPEAKER_39]: Have people become decisive.

837
01:36:03,531 --> 01:36:10,803
[SPEAKER_39]: I came here tonight to present an issue, thanking Mr. Tudin, who made the acknowledgement that he is for a sanctuary city.

838
01:36:11,745 --> 01:36:14,550
[SPEAKER_39]: It's a subject matter that needs to be discussed.

839
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:18,618
[SPEAKER_39]: The statistics that were given are actual statistics.

840
01:36:18,838 --> 01:36:21,059
[SPEAKER_39]: You can't get away because they're not lying.

841
01:36:21,899 --> 01:36:37,807
[SPEAKER_39]: And for the other lady who indicated that the crime rate for the individuals who are undocumented are less than regular American citizens that are documented and are legal, that in and of itself spells to the question of the police department.

842
01:36:38,487 --> 01:36:45,333
[SPEAKER_39]: They're doing more work because they have to deal with undocumented illegals over and beyond their regular course.

843
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:48,556
[SPEAKER_39]: Now, are all of them bad people?

844
01:36:48,696 --> 01:36:49,637
[SPEAKER_39]: Absolutely not.

845
01:36:49,897 --> 01:36:52,119
[SPEAKER_39]: Do they deserve a fair shot?

846
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:52,900
[SPEAKER_39]: Absolutely.

847
01:36:54,298 --> 01:36:59,503
[SPEAKER_39]: And if they have to have some political intervention, which is taking place right now in Washington, so be it.

848
01:37:00,324 --> 01:37:01,765
[SPEAKER_39]: But the fact of the matter is this.

849
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:15,198
[SPEAKER_39]: I stand here and I resent the fact that anyone, any seven of you or anyone in this audience, who wants to turn around and say, because I was born white, that I am privileged, that is false, that is wrong, and that is a lie.

850
01:37:15,519 --> 01:37:17,641
[SPEAKER_39]: And you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that.

851
01:37:18,321 --> 01:37:18,682
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

852
01:37:27,771 --> 01:37:28,976
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

853
01:37:29,278 --> 01:37:31,768
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, Eileen Lerner, 9 Adams Circle.

854
01:37:33,304 --> 01:37:37,845
[SPEAKER_31]: When I talked about rich and privileged people, I wasn't talking about you, Mr. Penta.

855
01:37:38,505 --> 01:37:41,786
[SPEAKER_31]: I was talking about the people that write the immigration laws.

856
01:37:42,026 --> 01:37:48,028
[SPEAKER_31]: I was talking about the people who decide to put Japanese people into concentration camps.

857
01:37:48,828 --> 01:37:55,310
[SPEAKER_31]: The people who decide whether people come in from certain countries and not from certain other countries.

858
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:58,351
[SPEAKER_31]: I was not talking about you, Mr. Penta.

859
01:37:59,847 --> 01:38:11,152
[SPEAKER_31]: But the fact is, you have to realize that white supremacy has been in control in this country, and that it is under attack now.

860
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:15,314
[SPEAKER_31]: And that is a fact, whether you want to face it or not.

861
01:38:16,655 --> 01:38:17,035
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

862
01:38:22,717 --> 01:38:23,117
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

863
01:38:23,157 --> 01:38:24,618
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

864
01:38:24,978 --> 01:38:26,139
[SPEAKER_30]: My name is Shelly Kroll.

865
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:28,500
[SPEAKER_30]: I live at 8 Boylston Terrace in Medford.

866
01:38:29,295 --> 01:38:31,338
[SPEAKER_30]: I've been a Medford resident for about 30 years.

867
01:38:31,999 --> 01:38:39,269
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm also a labor attorney in Boston and the granddaughter of immigrants, as probably most of us here are.

868
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:44,617
[SPEAKER_30]: My grandparents were fortunate because when they fled violence in Russia,

869
01:38:46,027 --> 01:38:52,290
[SPEAKER_30]: immigration laws were much less restrictive than they are today, and they really didn't have to go through too much scrutiny.

870
01:38:53,030 --> 01:39:00,493
[SPEAKER_30]: Those of us who follow the law knows that laws change very frequently when political administrations change.

871
01:39:01,053 --> 01:39:13,959
[SPEAKER_30]: And with regard to immigration laws, when we talk about undocumented immigrants, many of the people who are undocumented were legal when they came to this country, but the status changes as the law changed.

872
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,582
[SPEAKER_30]: We have Haitian immigrants who may be losing their protected status.

873
01:39:18,382 --> 01:39:27,407
[SPEAKER_30]: We have the DACA dreamers who were raised in this country and who had been promised a road to citizenship and who are now in peril.

874
01:39:28,027 --> 01:39:38,613
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's not only the immigrants that are fleeing violence, as our grandparents did, but immigrants who came here legally who can now find themselves undocumented and at risk.

875
01:39:38,993 --> 01:39:40,714
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's just one point I want to make.

876
01:39:41,206 --> 01:39:49,989
[SPEAKER_30]: Then secondly, I very much applaud the speaker who talked about having a business and working hard to establish a business that employs good immigrant workers.

877
01:39:50,869 --> 01:40:01,893
[SPEAKER_30]: Most of our grandparents worked very hard so that those of us who followed them could go to school, become professionals, pursue businesses, work with our hands, whatever it took.

878
01:40:02,694 --> 01:40:08,716
[SPEAKER_30]: But what I can tell you from my labor practice is that there are a lot of companies who are unscrupulous.

879
01:40:09,232 --> 01:40:17,019
[SPEAKER_30]: And they employ undocumented immigrants in order to keep wages low, in order to violate safety laws, and to imperil all of us.

880
01:40:17,519 --> 01:40:23,064
[SPEAKER_30]: It's that kind of competition that lowers the bar in a community like Medford and other communities.

881
01:40:23,585 --> 01:40:34,795
[SPEAKER_30]: And as long as you have immigrant workers who are in fear of complaining and reporting crimes or complaining about safety violations, you stand at risk that that

882
01:40:35,205 --> 01:40:38,987
[SPEAKER_30]: is going to bring down the standard of living of everybody in our community.

883
01:40:39,428 --> 01:40:39,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

884
01:40:46,251 --> 01:40:47,472
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

885
01:40:48,013 --> 01:40:49,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

886
01:40:49,093 --> 01:40:50,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

887
01:40:50,834 --> 01:40:51,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll try to be very brief.

888
01:40:53,156 --> 01:40:57,318
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know anybody from my side of this issue

889
01:40:57,776 --> 01:41:00,599
[SPEAKER_15]: who doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city.

890
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration.

891
01:41:04,783 --> 01:41:19,357
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards.

892
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:28,463
[SPEAKER_15]: It's difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels.

893
01:41:28,844 --> 01:41:45,997
[SPEAKER_15]: But I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege.

894
01:41:46,377 --> 01:41:50,640
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear-mongering.

895
01:41:53,289 --> 01:41:55,814
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a little hypocritical, Mr. President.

896
01:41:56,115 --> 01:41:58,099
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to address the point of

897
01:41:58,937 --> 01:42:08,225
[SPEAKER_15]: being for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force.

898
01:42:09,246 --> 01:42:12,108
[SPEAKER_15]: It has nothing to do with limited government.

899
01:42:12,328 --> 01:42:17,492
[SPEAKER_15]: It has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens.

900
01:42:17,933 --> 01:42:23,197
[SPEAKER_15]: We are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force.

901
01:42:25,038 --> 01:42:26,840
[SPEAKER_15]: In the current policy of not

902
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:29,063
[SPEAKER_15]: ask an immigration status.

903
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:34,289
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support.

904
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:38,975
[SPEAKER_15]: But make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford

905
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:54,526
[SPEAKER_15]: group is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status.

906
01:42:54,946 --> 01:42:59,828
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program

907
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:14,478
[SPEAKER_15]: which Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE.

908
01:43:15,298 --> 01:43:16,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Massachusetts never

909
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:20,032
[SPEAKER_15]: joined on to the Secured Communities Program.

910
01:43:20,692 --> 01:43:22,593
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really don't know why.

911
01:43:22,653 --> 01:43:33,558
[SPEAKER_15]: And whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws.

912
01:43:34,518 --> 01:43:37,920
[SPEAKER_15]: that govern legal citizenship in the United States.

913
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:42,742
[SPEAKER_15]: And my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws.

914
01:43:43,102 --> 01:43:47,004
[SPEAKER_15]: It has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism.

915
01:43:47,344 --> 01:43:55,027
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws.

916
01:43:55,227 --> 01:43:56,808
[SPEAKER_15]: And those laws have to be respected.

917
01:43:57,288 --> 01:44:01,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country

918
01:44:01,963 --> 01:44:02,443
[SPEAKER_15]: to come to.

919
01:44:03,104 --> 01:44:22,913
[SPEAKER_15]: And finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever is in power of immigration to know where to go to.

920
01:44:24,374 --> 01:44:32,480
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's actually not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States.

921
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,822
[SPEAKER_15]: You're actually putting a target on their back.

922
01:44:35,122 --> 01:44:35,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

923
01:44:35,703 --> 01:44:36,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

924
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:43,248
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, Chief.

925
01:44:44,249 --> 01:44:45,330
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

926
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:50,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Leo A. Sacco, Jr., 227 Elm Street, Medford, Chief of Police.

927
01:44:52,236 --> 01:44:54,137
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, I don't mean to belabor your meeting.

928
01:44:54,177 --> 01:44:59,320
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you're almost ready to move on to the next topic, but a few things were mentioned tonight that I have to clear up.

929
01:44:59,941 --> 01:45:04,283
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm concerned about the people who are at home watching this and thinking that Medford is not a safe city.

930
01:45:05,884 --> 01:45:09,006
[SPEAKER_19]: First and foremost, Medford is a very safe city.

931
01:45:09,426 --> 01:45:11,047
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a very welcoming community.

932
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:18,052
[SPEAKER_19]: All you have to do is look at the real estate transfers and see what the prices are for the homes that are being sold in the city.

933
01:45:18,532 --> 01:45:20,713
[SPEAKER_19]: People want to move to this community.

934
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:21,894
[SPEAKER_19]: People want to live here.

935
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:25,601
[SPEAKER_19]: people like this community because it is a safe community.

936
01:45:26,602 --> 01:45:35,105
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have the statistics with me this evening, but I can tell you this, that our crime rate in this, in this city is much lower than our surrounding communities.

937
01:45:35,806 --> 01:45:38,167
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's one of the reasons why people want to live here.

938
01:45:38,767 --> 01:45:44,369
[SPEAKER_19]: The low crime rate is directly related to the hard work of the men and women of the Medford police department.

939
01:45:45,029 --> 01:45:46,370
[SPEAKER_19]: But beyond that,

940
01:45:47,628 --> 01:46:01,427
[SPEAKER_19]: It's due to the work of the residents that live in the city, all residents that live in the city that are willing to call and report a crime, report a suspicious activity, report that they've been involved in, they've been the victim of a crime.

941
01:46:01,957 --> 01:46:06,321
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's one of the things we're concerned about as a police department, that we don't want to stifle that.

942
01:46:06,781 --> 01:46:18,992
[SPEAKER_19]: We want everyone to feel comfortable to come forward to the police, to report being a victim of a crime, to report what they may have seen in other criminal actions, which will help us to keep the city safe.

943
01:46:19,912 --> 01:46:26,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it was said earlier by some members that were before this rail that the police department is being told what to do.

944
01:46:27,797 --> 01:46:29,678
[SPEAKER_19]: Police department is not being told what to do.

945
01:46:30,138 --> 01:46:34,841
[SPEAKER_19]: Police department is following the same practice and procedure that we've followed for many years.

946
01:46:35,642 --> 01:46:39,424
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been a police officer 36 years in the city, 27 of them as chief.

947
01:46:40,064 --> 01:46:41,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing has changed.

948
01:46:42,065 --> 01:46:46,367
[SPEAKER_19]: We do the same thing today that we did pretty much 36 years ago.

949
01:46:46,987 --> 01:46:51,069
[SPEAKER_19]: So my entire career, we've been following the same practice and procedure.

950
01:46:51,509 --> 01:46:57,832
[SPEAKER_19]: I can tell you that I very rarely asked anyone if they were a citizen of the United States.

951
01:46:58,552 --> 01:47:03,614
[SPEAKER_19]: But if I put the handcuffs on someone and arrested them, there's a procedure that we follow.

952
01:47:04,455 --> 01:47:05,575
[SPEAKER_19]: They come to the station.

953
01:47:06,216 --> 01:47:06,956
[SPEAKER_19]: They are booked.

954
01:47:07,956 --> 01:47:09,737
[SPEAKER_19]: In the booking, we get all their information.

955
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:11,658
[SPEAKER_19]: They are fingerprinted.

956
01:47:11,977 --> 01:47:13,999
[SPEAKER_19]: The fingerprints go to the FBI.

957
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,921
[SPEAKER_19]: FBI shares them with other entities.

958
01:47:16,941 --> 01:47:20,644
[SPEAKER_19]: So it goes to the state, then it goes to the FBI and they share it with the other entities.

959
01:47:21,605 --> 01:47:27,229
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes it can be 10 minutes, sometimes it can be two hours, sometimes it can be as much as a day.

960
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:35,096
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll get something back saying that that person is not who they say they are because all arrests are backed up by fingerprints.

961
01:47:36,693 --> 01:47:41,657
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the only time we really know when someone may be in this country illegally.

962
01:47:41,717 --> 01:47:44,179
[SPEAKER_19]: They may have been deported before and sent back.

963
01:47:44,879 --> 01:47:46,341
[SPEAKER_19]: And there isn't anyone in this room.

964
01:47:46,421 --> 01:47:54,387
[SPEAKER_19]: There isn't anyone in the city, anyone in the state or anyone in the country that doesn't want to see violent criminals arrested and dealt with regardless of their status.

965
01:47:55,268 --> 01:48:00,492
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can assure you that they're not running loose because the Medford police are being sloppy or they're ignoring something.

966
01:48:01,052 --> 01:48:04,615
[SPEAKER_19]: If they're, if they're out there, there's maybe some other glitch in the works.

967
01:48:05,077 --> 01:48:06,678
[SPEAKER_19]: but it isn't the part of the police department.

968
01:48:06,718 --> 01:48:08,400
[SPEAKER_19]: We make the arrests that need to be made.

969
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:25,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes I can tell you that it hasn't happened, at least in this past year, but I can tell you since probably November when the elections happened and January when that administration took office, the fear factor rose.

970
01:48:28,235 --> 01:48:31,698
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably because of all of the rhetoric about immigration enforcement.

971
01:48:32,469 --> 01:48:36,672
[SPEAKER_19]: But nothing changed over the past several years or from the past several years.

972
01:48:37,072 --> 01:48:39,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything we do is the same as what we did before.

973
01:48:40,975 --> 01:48:47,679
[SPEAKER_19]: And we check everyone that we arrest and they go to Somerville District Court.

974
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:53,863
[SPEAKER_19]: If ICE calls us and said, we have a detainer for the person that you have, we don't hold them based on that detainer.

975
01:48:53,903 --> 01:48:56,125
[SPEAKER_19]: We already had them under arrest for another charge.

976
01:48:57,119 --> 01:49:04,524
[SPEAKER_19]: If they make bail or they end up being transported to Somerville District Court in the morning, ICE is told where those people will be.

977
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:06,005
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the extent of it.

978
01:49:06,085 --> 01:49:07,666
[SPEAKER_19]: We do not serve as ICE agents.

979
01:49:09,348 --> 01:49:13,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Civil immigration laws are primarily the responsibility of the federal government.

980
01:49:13,811 --> 01:49:21,556
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been said we're not, we don't have the resources to go knock on doors and check statuses, nor do we really have the interest to do that.

981
01:49:21,956 --> 01:49:24,118
[SPEAKER_19]: We just, what will we do if we found them?

982
01:49:24,653 --> 01:49:26,374
[SPEAKER_19]: Would ICE be able to respond and help us?

983
01:49:26,415 --> 01:49:27,175
[SPEAKER_19]: They probably would not.

984
01:49:28,496 --> 01:49:41,207
[SPEAKER_19]: By the same token, we're not being deputized to work as ICE agents, but if they call us because they're in the middle of something, if it's an officer safety issue, yes, we'll go help them to make sure that they don't get hurt or that no one else gets hurt.

985
01:49:42,668 --> 01:49:48,714
[SPEAKER_19]: But I can tell you, we have not had a situation in the city of Method that resulted at least in an ICE detainer that I know of.

986
01:49:49,234 --> 01:49:52,397
[SPEAKER_19]: We have made several arrests, major league drug dealers,

987
01:49:53,652 --> 01:50:06,397
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've sought information for mice and in a couple of cases that were detained as issued, but those are serious criminal criminals, criminal element that's bringing poison into our community and they had to be dealt with.

988
01:50:06,457 --> 01:50:18,261
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think anyone disagrees with that being done, but I don't want anyone in the public, anyone that's watching this or anyone in this room tonight to think that the Medford police are going easy on crime or easy on the immigration issue.

989
01:50:19,142 --> 01:50:22,343
[SPEAKER_19]: We work within the realm that we're dealt dealt with and uh,

990
01:50:23,885 --> 01:50:25,706
[SPEAKER_19]: We do the best that we can with what we have.

991
01:50:26,646 --> 01:50:33,488
[SPEAKER_19]: No one is going to escape what needs to be done, but we're not going out there looking just for the civil violation.

992
01:50:33,528 --> 01:50:35,208
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not our focus.

993
01:50:35,648 --> 01:50:39,809
[SPEAKER_19]: I think everyone agrees that we have far more important things that we need to do.

994
01:50:39,869 --> 01:50:43,410
[SPEAKER_19]: But getting back to the main issue, Medford is a safe city.

995
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:47,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever you want to call it otherwise, this is a safe city.

996
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:48,832
[SPEAKER_19]: People come here and we have

997
01:50:49,775 --> 01:50:51,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Great police officers out there doing a great job.

998
01:50:51,879 --> 01:50:53,762
[SPEAKER_19]: We definitely need more.

999
01:50:55,063 --> 01:50:57,924
[SPEAKER_19]: but we're only as good as the information we receive from the public.

1000
01:50:57,964 --> 01:51:02,464
[SPEAKER_19]: So we want all segments of the, of the public, uh, documented, undocumented.

1001
01:51:02,484 --> 01:51:07,885
[SPEAKER_19]: We want people coming forward to, uh, if they're a witness of a crime to come forward and tell us what they saw.

1002
01:51:08,205 --> 01:51:21,088
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want anyone to be quiet and we don't want a segment of the community to be victimized because they're in fear of coming forward that they'd be exposed that no doubt be a victim of robberies on a regular basis.

1003
01:51:21,188 --> 01:51:21,288
[SPEAKER_19]: So,

1004
01:51:22,322 --> 01:51:23,162
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for your time.

1005
01:51:23,202 --> 01:51:24,382
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to clear that up.

1006
01:51:24,422 --> 01:51:26,383
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.

1007
01:51:26,403 --> 01:51:27,623
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Chief, for keeping us safe.

1008
01:51:28,283 --> 01:51:36,825
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

1009
01:51:37,305 --> 01:51:40,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Massachusetts.

1010
01:51:41,325 --> 01:51:43,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I have great respect for the Medford Police Department.

1011
01:51:43,486 --> 01:51:46,226
[SPEAKER_04]: There are the majority are fine men and women.

1012
01:51:47,106 --> 01:51:50,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I was videotaping them up at Montvale Plaza.

1013
01:51:51,783 --> 01:51:56,466
[SPEAKER_04]: But I respectfully disagree with our police chief, because I don't feel very safe in this city.

1014
01:51:57,646 --> 01:52:04,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Behind my house, a man was brutalized and murdered on Salem Street, his head beaten in so badly his brains were splattered.

1015
01:52:05,931 --> 01:52:08,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I see so much traffic problems.

1016
01:52:08,992 --> 01:52:11,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen so many car accidents outside my window as I'm typing.

1017
01:52:12,174 --> 01:52:17,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a guy in the street on Salem Street, and I've had to get two restraining orders on people.

1018
01:52:17,817 --> 01:52:20,839
[SPEAKER_04]: The police didn't help me at all, not the fine good men and women.

1019
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:27,405
[SPEAKER_04]: But for political reasons, I had to go get a four-year restraining order on someone who was coming to my home and threatening me.

1020
01:52:28,006 --> 01:52:47,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So no, when I read in the paper that an MBTA cop doesn't get a breathalyzer, but eight days later, I'm in criminal court because people are lying about me, or if I get assaulted outside of these doors by someone in this room, and the police don't do a proper investigation, but I have to spend thousands of dollars in court to find out that people lied about me.

1021
01:52:47,623 --> 01:52:49,004
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this isn't a safe city.

1022
01:52:49,365 --> 01:52:51,406
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the haves and the have-nots.

1023
01:52:51,727 --> 01:52:59,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're outspoken, as I am, and you try to better your city, which I have tried to do, I have been beaten, I've been harassed, and I've been threatened.

1024
01:52:59,853 --> 01:53:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And Police Chief Sacco has not helped me at all.

1025
01:53:02,456 --> 01:53:04,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So shame on you, Police Chief Sacco.

1026
01:53:04,237 --> 01:53:07,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a victim, and you hung me out to dry, Chief.

1027
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And your own son didn't even get a breathalyzer.

1028
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,321
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1029
01:53:22,846 --> 01:53:26,674
[SPEAKER_25]: Records of the meeting of October 10, 2017 were passed to Councilor Knight.

1030
01:53:26,995 --> 01:53:28,638
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

1031
01:53:41,349 --> 01:53:47,838
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to accept the minutes as amended, although seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1032
01:53:47,858 --> 01:53:48,479
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1033
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:50,181
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1034
01:53:51,503 --> 01:53:54,787
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1035
01:53:54,807 --> 01:53:55,508
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1036
01:53:57,111 --> 01:53:58,673
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes, meeting adjourned.
