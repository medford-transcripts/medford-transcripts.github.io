1
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:09,672
Testing, testing.

2
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:13,894
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

3
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,437
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

4
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:18,878
Good?

5
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:20,879
All right.

6
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,360
All right.

7
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:43,696
Motion to revert back to the region of the meeting.

8
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:50,700
Meeting is now back in session.

9
00:17:50,720 --> 00:18:05,489
17-711 offered by Councilor Lococoon being resolved that the city solicitor's office looks into making sure the rice pond will remain open to Bedford residents only after a grant was received from the Massachusetts office of coastal zone management.

10
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:06,770
Councilor Lococoon.

11
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,272
Thank you, President Carviello.

12
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:25,303
My attention was drawn to an article that was in the transcript last week by a concerned Medford resident with regards to us thankfully getting a grant from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.

13
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:34,865
I think obviously it's a grant that we're going to put to good use, but the resident, and I'm sure a number of residents who frequent the pond,

14
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:45,687
who fought last year to make sure it remained open to only Medford residents are now making, want to make sure that that's still going to be the case if we do accept and use this grant.

15
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,909
I believe it's a valid question.

16
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:59,456
I would assume and hope that this definitely will stay open to just Medford residents, but maybe we could get a report back just to confirm that and to put residents' minds at ease.

17
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:01,117
I think that would be very helpful.

18
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:03,939
I know we have the solicitor here right now, but I don't know

19
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:05,968
answer such a question.

20
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,532
I'm sure you're not ready to answer it, but thank you.

21
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:12,613
Thank you.

22
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:24,843
And before Rose called the last resolution was with regards, there was a number of people complaining to, um, the pitcher of the council meeting last Tuesday.

23
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:34,271
And we spoke about council marks and I spoke about, um, the complaints we received and hopefully we can get that fixed and get the whole system, which we've been asking for fixed.

24
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:42,841
Um, in the near future, because for some reason, sometimes the city council meetings are not being, and no fault of anybody doing the picture.

25
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:49,465
Um, but it just needs to be updated because the complaints were rolling in on Tuesday with regards to the picture.

26
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:54,069
So I move approval on this resolution and, um, ask for my colleagues support.

27
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:55,410
Councilor Knight.

28
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,792
Um, Mr. President, uh, this is the first I've heard of the city receiving a grant.

29
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:01,234
Could the councilor tell us a little bit about what this grant is?

30
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,075
Councilor Locren.

31
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:03,495
Yes.

32
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:04,396
Councilor Knight.

33
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:09,405
In the Medford transcript, it's a rain garden coming to Wright's Pond.

34
00:20:09,946 --> 00:20:21,370
The city of Medford is constructing a rain garden at the Middlesex Falls Pond that will help filter out pollutants, including phosphorus, nitrogen, suspended solids, and bacteria.

35
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,411
It will also be designed to conserve water.

36
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,212
So it's a project they're gonna do in the near future.

37
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:32,054
The rain garden project will cost the city a total of $50,000.

38
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:40,700
and is a match project for $125,000 grant that Medford received from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.

39
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:47,764
I can go into more detail, there's another few paragraphs, but it was on page A3 of the Medford transcript.

40
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:55,167
The rain gutter will contain plants that soak up phosphorus, nitrogen from rainwater before it flows into Wright's Pond.

41
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,931
I think it seems like a natural way to remove

42
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:21,767
Obviously chemicals from the pond, so anything we have with regards to a grant to be able to do this I think is extremely important, especially I have another resolution on where the article does mention some concerning things as well, but I think the rain garden is definitely a step in the right direction.

43
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:27,710
It's only going to help better the pond, especially for the hundreds of kids that swim in that pond every summer.

44
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,091
point of information.

45
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:32,172
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

46
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:35,776
Mr. President, are we talking about, uh, item number 17 7 1 1 or 1 1 at the moment?

47
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:35,776
1 1.

48
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:36,016
Yes.

49
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:37,098
And the vote is to, uh,

50
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:48,018
remain open to residents only after a grant was received.

51
00:21:48,378 --> 00:22:02,043
And the solicitor will... I don't quite understand the semantics of the resolution and I don't know if we should base our... We are waiting for an opinion from the solicitor.

52
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:02,683
Thank you.

53
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:03,824
He will give us an opinion on that.

54
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:04,564
Thank you.

55
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:05,904
Councilor, do you want to vote on 17711?

56
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:08,405
I move approval of the question, Mr. President.

57
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:12,026
17711, but just to respond, I'm not really sure what the confusion is.

58
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,887
Sometimes when you get a state or federal grant,

59
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:22,757
It changes the parameters of how we operate, so we are making sure that the hundreds of families that use it from Medford, it remains only Medford.

60
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:31,628
This was a big issue back about a year ago when some of the law was looked into and they were potentially going to be opening it up to non-Medford residents.

61
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:34,096
the city will kind of... Thank you.

62
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,477
You are correct Councilor Locario.

63
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:38,539
On the motion by Councilor Locario on 17.7.1.1.

64
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,501
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

65
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:43,021
Roll call.

66
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:45,083
Roll call has been requested Mr. Clerk.

67
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:51,887
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

68
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:53,868
Yes.

69
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:59,245
7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

70
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:00,287
Motion passes.

71
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:29,581
17 7 1 2 offered by council and go current be a resolve that the energy environment office update the Memphis city council as to why the city does not test rights pawn for certain pollutants that could be caused by runoff of snow of plowed piles of snow near right near the pond in the winter.

72
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:39,024
Be a further resolve that once the rain gun is put in place, right spawn will be tested for such pollutants before opening in the summer of 2018 council Lungo current.

73
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,294
Thank you, President Carviello.

74
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:43,015
I wanted to bring this up.

75
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:46,818
I had a second resident email me with regards to the same article.

76
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:55,684
In the second part of the article, it mentions how the city stores plowed snow on Rice Pond.

77
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:01,809
And residents have grown increasingly concerned about pollutants in the pond.

78
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:06,672
And then our energy and environment director said because the city

79
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:12,979
City stores plowed piles of snow near the pond in the winter, which runs into the pond when it melts.

80
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,242
This is a way for the runoff to get clean, treated, and filtered naturally.

81
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:18,864
Hopefully the rain guards will help that.

82
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:24,868
But it says we've tested what is there, but there's a perception that there's bad stuff running off in there.

83
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:34,175
So a resident who does frequent the pond called me, also asked me to reference the article, and it is concerning that we're putting plowed snow there.

84
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:43,937
So my next, this resolution and the next has to do with figuring out if we can maybe do it another way.

85
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:51,160
If we have runoff, there's a number of different things that are coming off the snow within the snow that are being stored at Wright's Pond.

86
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,641
Maybe we should look into it more.

87
00:24:53,681 --> 00:25:02,765
And if this is a problem, then we can hopefully store the snow somewhere else because we want to make sure that we're keeping the pond as safe and clean as possible.

88
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:09,680
I know that a resident was interested in the topic.

89
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:25,386
I'm not sure if I can name him, but did reach out to the director of the Mystic River Watershed Association, who thought that piling up snow and allowing it to run into the pond is a poor choice.

90
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:29,487
So I think this is just something that definitely needs to be looked into.

91
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:34,486
If we have piled snow that can be put somewhere else, I think we need to do that.

92
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:46,168
So if we could have a response from our energy and environment office with regards to if there's been any testing, if so, what type of testing and when, that would be extremely helpful.

93
00:25:46,688 --> 00:25:54,410
And if we haven't, then maybe we should see how the rain garden goes once it's implemented, then potentially do some testing.

94
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,891
That's obviously not my forte, but if we could kind of

95
00:25:59,335 --> 00:26:00,495
figure out what's going on here.

96
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,296
I will be much appreciated.

97
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:03,056
Thank you.

98
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:07,897
Council on the motion by council and go current seconded by councilor Falco.

99
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:08,577
All those in favor.

100
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:13,419
Motion passes 17 seven one three offered by council local current.

101
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:21,121
Be it resolved that the Memphis city council be provided a list of all places that plowed snow is stored during the winter months.

102
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:22,161
Council on go current.

103
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:23,729
Thank you, President Carviello.

104
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:32,574
If we could just have the Department of Public Works and or the administration let the City Council know where snow is, is kept when we take it off our streets.

105
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:38,117
I think that just goes hand in hand with the prior resolution to try to make sure we're storing it in the right place.

106
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:39,298
Thank you.

107
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:43,880
On the motion of Councilor Lueb-Curran, seconded by Councilor Scott Peli.

108
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,601
All those in favor?

109
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:44,941
Aye.

110
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:46,402
Motion passes.

111
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:48,563
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

112
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,232
seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

113
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:52,772
All in favor?

114
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:54,133
Motion passes.

115
00:26:54,413 --> 00:27:04,660
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the electronic speed sign be placed on Emerson street and a 25 mile per hour sign be posted.

116
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,821
Vice President Mox.

117
00:27:08,122 --> 00:27:09,143
Thank you, Mr. President.

118
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:19,189
Um, I received a call from a resident on Emerson street who said, uh, because the street is a cut through, uh, cars are speeding down and, uh, where we purchased recently,

119
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,494
two electronic speeding signs.

120
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,017
I would ask that one be placed on Emerson street.

121
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:36,667
Uh, and in addition, uh, the city has moved from the 30 mile hour speed signs to now the new ordinance, which is 25, which was enacted by this council and by the traffic commission.

122
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:48,796
I thank the chief who's here tonight, uh, that, uh, additional signs be placed on our secondary roads, Mr. President, um, that, uh, alert residents of the new, uh, speed, which is 25 miles an hour.

123
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:50,324
Thank you.

124
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:55,510
On the motion by Councillor, on the motion by Councillor Marks, seconded by Councillor Donnarusso.

125
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:56,472
All those in favour.

126
00:27:57,113 --> 00:28:06,077
Motion passes offered by council by vice president marks being resolved at the sidewalk at three 49 Fulton street be replaced in the interest of public safety.

127
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:07,037
Vice president marks.

128
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:08,698
Thank you Mr. President.

129
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,480
Um, this has been on the sidewalk list for some time now.

130
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,202
And, uh, the resident asked me to, uh, try to expedite, uh, because of trip and fall concerns.

131
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:24,625
So I would just ask that this be sent to Mr. Karen's and DPW in the interest of public safety.

132
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:25,065
Thank you.

133
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:28,573
On the motion by vice-president Mark, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

134
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:29,253
All those in favor.

135
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:32,354
Motion passes offered by council by vice-president Marks.

136
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:36,955
Be it resolved that the rodent issue in North Method in Wellington be discussed.

137
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:38,115
Vice-president Marks.

138
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:40,255
Thank you, Mr. President.

139
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:54,999
Um, residents are probably aware, uh, on the Somerville Method line in South Method, there's been an issue for a number of years with rodents and, uh, the city embarked upon, uh, a program which,

140
00:28:55,998 --> 00:29:16,652
monitors and sets out traps in particular areas, and now I'm receiving complaints in the Wellington area, some of which may be due to the bridge construction that's going on and some of the other development, but I've been getting a number of complaints of rodents in the Wellington area, and just recently I received two phone calls

141
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:25,386
on North Meffitt up at the top of the heights where they're seeing rats in the area, Mr. President.

142
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:36,556
So I would ask that the city immediately set up some type of monitor or activity to

143
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,405
try to nip this in the bud, Mr. President.

144
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,586
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

145
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:43,186
Councilor Del Russo.

146
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:48,529
Mr. President, I resent the fact that South Medford has been singled out as a place for rats.

147
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:59,695
Secondly, I want to thank always the Department of Public Health, which has been proactive over the years in

148
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:08,362
an urban area where rats are part of the landscape, but that does not mean we have to suffer their incursions.

149
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:10,844
So thank you to the Board of Health.

150
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:21,432
We've suffered an uptick in their activity over the summer months because of some of the work done on the Green Line Extension Project, Mr. President.

151
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:36,996
It is no doubt that the work done in the Wellington area has certainly moved some of them, and that may be exacerbated as we're entering the winter months and our little furry friends are looking for a place to bed down for the winter.

152
00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:48,579
So I hope that the Board of Health will not only exercise their own discretion in this matter, but urge the contractors in the area who are required

153
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,902
to bait and monitor to step up their efforts.

154
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:53,823
Thank you.

155
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:57,866
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

156
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:58,587
All those in favor?

157
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:00,228
Motion passes.

158
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:09,175
Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the construction equipment left on Mangle Street be removed in the interest of public safety.

159
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:10,236
Vice President Mox.

160
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:11,657
Thank you, Mr. President.

161
00:31:11,677 --> 00:31:17,602
There was some road work done on Mangles and that surrounding area, and some construction equipment has been left

162
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:24,765
alongside the road for a period of time and residents are concerned and would like to see the equipment move, Mr. President.

163
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:28,547
On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

164
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,227
All those in favor?

165
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:30,688
Motion passes.

166
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:40,333
Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that a pedestrian crossing button be added to the blinking lights at the corner of 9th Street and Middlesex Avenue.

167
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:41,333
Vice President Mox.

168
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:46,376
We're probably all familiar with this particular intersection at 9th and Middlesex.

169
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:50,485
It's right at the entrance to a Cappy's on Middlesex.

170
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:58,269
And sometime back, uh, the council, um, actually pushed our state delegation to get a working blinking light.

171
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:09,294
Uh, we tried to get a full set of lights there, but we were instructed by the state because of the proximity to the intersection of Wellington, that that wouldn't be feasible by the state traffic engineer.

172
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:19,087
And now I'm asking, Mr. President, if anyone has ever had to traverse there, they'll realize that the light blinks, but no one stops.

173
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:22,630
And to get across, you're taking your life in your own hands.

174
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:36,700
So I would ask that this be sent to our state delegation where Middlesex is a state road, requesting that the addition of a pedestrian crossing button be added to the blinking set of lights.

175
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,461
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

176
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,049
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

177
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:42,670
All those in favor?

178
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:42,751
Aye.

179
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:44,255
Motion passes.

180
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,362
Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved.

181
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:54,048
that the car park parking lot receive a speed bump and a slow down parking lot signs be installed.

182
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,048
Vice president marks.

183
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:12,238
So, uh, Mr. President, this Saturday I was at car park and, um, I had a number of residents that were attending a birthday party in the taut lot come up to me and said, do you realize when you're coming up Fulton street, uh, that you, where the street branches off that,

184
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:22,175
There's no indication that you're going into an actual parking lot, which is car park and cars are still going at the same clip as if they were on Fulton street.

185
00:33:22,956 --> 00:33:25,380
And it really is a very dangerous situation.

186
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:28,804
Um, their suggestion, which I think is great.

187
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:29,926
And I know we have the chief here.

188
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:35,348
uh, would be to put at least some, uh, warning signs that you're entering a parking lot.

189
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:36,908
This is no longer a road.

190
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:50,413
And secondly, uh, I'd like to see a race crosswalk, but I know we have those, uh, movable, uh, speed bumps that the city is putting around the community, uh, in a way to chief, would you mind coming up?

191
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:54,715
We'd like to put you on the spot chief.

192
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:00,779
Chief, name and address of the record, please.

193
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,721
Leo A. Sacco, Jr.

194
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:04,902
227 Elm Street, Medford.

195
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:05,863
Chief of Police.

196
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:09,766
Just if you could address, do you know what I'm talking about when you come up, Fulton?

197
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:10,687
Yes.

198
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:17,212
Is there a way that we could kind of address maybe some signage and possible speed bump?

199
00:34:17,232 --> 00:34:19,414
I know race crosswalk is expensive.

200
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:24,565
Yeah, the raised crosswalk issue is somewhat out of my control.

201
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:29,066
We can recommend, but we can't force it to happen because of the cost factor.

202
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:32,988
Of course, the temporary speed bump is doable.

203
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:35,709
I'll speak with Mr. Kevins to see if there are any available.

204
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:37,890
Signage is the simple thing.

205
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,232
We can post that area that technically there's no outlet.

206
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:50,544
when they go straight and a lot of times when cars are coming straight up Fulton, they just go straight and they think they can connect with the rest of Fulton and they can't.

207
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:59,632
So post it at that end and then, you know, the speed limit, the posting for children playing playground.

208
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:01,153
That'd be great.

209
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:04,016
So those, the signage piece is simple.

210
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:08,620
The other piece of the crosswalk, the speed bump takes a little more effort.

211
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:09,701
Thank you, chief.

212
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:10,622
Thank you, chief.

213
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,842
On the motion by vice-president Mark, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

214
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,163
Mr. President, let this be sent to the traffic commission.

215
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:25,788
Um, and now the chief is going to have that be sent to the traffic commission on the motion by vice-president Mark, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

216
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:26,448
All those in favor.

217
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:28,109
Motion passes.

218
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,232
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

219
00:35:33,252 --> 00:35:39,095
17 7 0 9 petition by John Sterola, 20 Metcalf Street, Medford to address the council.

220
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:42,387
on how to serve the people of Medford.

221
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:44,428
Name and address for the record, please.

222
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:48,271
John Starello, 20 Medcom Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

223
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:51,513
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, counselors.

224
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:53,475
Very happy to be here.

225
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:55,316
It's always a pleasure to have you here, Dr. Starello.

226
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:57,918
Well, I appreciate that coming from you.

227
00:35:58,118 --> 00:35:58,338
Thank you.

228
00:35:58,358 --> 00:35:58,818
Thank you, sir.

229
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:04,022
And I do want to ask the audience if I'm too loud or not.

230
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:05,003
Can you hear me clearly?

231
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:08,234
Uh, I have problems with hearing too here.

232
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:15,536
So, uh, I also want to, I want to thank city clerk at Ed Finn for providing me with this, uh, hearing aid.

233
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:17,117
That'll help very much.

234
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:22,818
Well, anyway, my subject, uh, tonight is how to serve, uh, the people of metric.

235
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:28,300
And of course we're all very interested in that because that's the purpose of government service.

236
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,661
We wouldn't need government at all if we did not need service.

237
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:34,222
And so,

238
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:43,156
The city council here takes an oath to support the Massachusetts constitution and that way to serve the people of the Commonwealth.

239
00:36:44,577 --> 00:37:02,163
The council is to be appreciated for this loyalty to the people and we, the people have faith that the council will serve the people and that this is the reason we vote to elect you and we express pride in your service.

240
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:09,056
And we trust you to do your job because of what we think is in your hearts.

241
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:22,519
We think that in your hearts is the desire to make life less painful and more comfortable for us at a reasonable cost to us.

242
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:30,380
We, the people support the city government by paying our taxes as the government ordains.

243
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:39,184
And we give up some of our precious liberties, and we trust that the government will spend our hard-earned money wisely.

244
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:41,906
But does it?

245
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:48,711
In my opinion, Medford is near insolvency.

246
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,752
Now, notice I say near.

247
00:37:52,593 --> 00:38:00,779
I hope I am wrong, but the very tight financial condition of Medford will not permit us to proceed with the police station.

248
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:31,045
the fire station, the library, school building maintenance, infrastructure, pension funding, proper zoning in order to limit density, preserving neighborhoods, reducing park fees and parking permits, street cleaning, police foot patrols, Medford Square revitalization, payroll increases for our employees, removal of tree stumps, on and on.

249
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,423
Medford would have to borrow many millions of dollars to pay for all those needs.

250
00:38:38,723 --> 00:38:48,410
We already have a debt of $51 million, which we reduce at a cost of $6 million a year.

251
00:38:49,971 --> 00:38:54,794
But we need $22 million for the police station alone.

252
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:08,149
Taxes must be raised year after year as they have been for the past 30 years in good times and in recessions in order to keep our heads above water.

253
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:18,898
And now the city is taxing the taxes we have already paid and it is using the community preservation act to do this.

254
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:25,363
Our tax levy is at the very top limit, which proposition two and a half permits.

255
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:34,112
which is $109 million this year alone, which is $4 million more than last year.

256
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:47,560
Now add to that $4 million more, the $1 million CPA surtax, and we have a 25% increase over the increase.

257
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,021
Confusing, isn't it?

258
00:39:51,582 --> 00:39:54,504
But CPA supporters love the extra revenue.

259
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:58,901
which takes from Peter to pay Paul.

260
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:06,266
Our city government is averse to charter review, which has not been discussed in 30 years.

261
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:12,651
We have a charter which gives power to a strong mayor and a weak council.

262
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:14,872
No offense.

263
00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:22,038
Our city government is averse to term limits, which will provide more democracy for the folks.

264
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:33,347
Two terms were adequate for George Washington, for Thomas Jefferson, for James Madison, for James Monroe, and Andrew Jackson, et cetera, et cetera.

265
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:36,950
And two terms should be enough for us.

266
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:50,079
In the Federalist Papers, James Madison said, a republic is a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the people.

267
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:57,819
and is administered by people holding their offices for a limited period.

268
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,481
James Madison wrote that in 1788.

269
00:41:04,803 --> 00:41:07,404
Are our civil servants insecure?

270
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:10,565
You bet they are.

271
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:15,007
For what other reason would they seek public office over and over again?

272
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:20,070
I wish the mayor and the council could shed their insecurities.

273
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:24,314
Incumbency is selfish.

274
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:29,078
Have you noticed how the promise of increased revenue makes incumbents ravenous?

275
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,604
They should feel secure in their ability and power to give of themselves outside of politics.

276
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:38,806
Yes, to give.

277
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:43,410
Now, there is the way to serve the people of Medford.

278
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:47,233
The incumbents must get out of the way.

279
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:55,787
We have one mayor and seven councils and they stay for many, many years.

280
00:41:57,207 --> 00:42:05,730
Each counselor is paid $30,000 a year, which is more than $750 for each meeting like this one.

281
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:16,353
But we have 36,000 registered voters and many of them would be happy to serve without compensation.

282
00:42:17,574 --> 00:42:17,854
Why?

283
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,873
because they are, by nature, generous people.

284
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:43,540
We must urge our voters to vote out the career politicians, to drain the Medford morass, and to vote in the outsiders, because the People's City Council, now listen carefully to this, has been co-opted by the school committee.

285
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:48,002
Yes, as I see it, the school committee infiltrates

286
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:50,355
and then runs the city council.

287
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:55,817
This is a case of the tail wagging the dog.

288
00:42:57,098 --> 00:42:57,838
Let me explain.

289
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:06,002
The mayor is chairman of the school committee and is compensated for that position in the school committee budget.

290
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:11,004
A majority of the city council has connections with the school committees.

291
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:16,167
Some have relatives on the school payroll now

292
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:21,956
and another school committee member may be elected to the city council this year.

293
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:37,884
Having finished seventh in the primary elections, the city council votes to accept the school budget as it is presented by the superintendent schools and the school committee each June of the year without making any significant changes.

294
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:45,628
We just don't know where the school committee ends and the city council begins.

295
00:43:47,412 --> 00:43:49,873
No one favors education more than I do.

296
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:55,095
All of my fulfillment and the fulfillment of my four children is due to education.

297
00:43:56,656 --> 00:44:02,139
But our school committee, which also rules the city, does not educate.

298
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:07,781
The school budget compensates all of them very, very well.

299
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:13,684
The cost to the city of Bedford is probably $13,000 a year for each enrolled student.

300
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:17,791
That's very high.

301
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:23,215
And yet, the record is regrettable.

302
00:44:25,156 --> 00:44:27,297
Our next generation must be saved.

303
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:30,999
We must serve all the people of Medford.

304
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,301
We must vote out the incumbents.

305
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:38,604
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

306
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:57,565
17-714 petition by Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, to address the council on the issue of becoming a sanctuary city.

307
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:08,549
Before Councilor Penta, I'm sorry, my former councilor gets up, I'd like to read something that the city council passed unanimously in November of 2016.

308
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:11,050
Dear Mr. President and city councils,

309
00:45:13,203 --> 00:45:24,045
Whereas the strength of our nation is derived from its history of diversity that has enriched our community with a variety of cultures, faith, traditions, and viewpoints.

310
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:32,686
And whereas the city of Medford is a community that welcomes and values the very racial and ethnic makeup of our residents.

311
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:40,628
And whereas the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups and newcomers as they pursue the American dream.

312
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:42,608
And whereas the city of Medford

313
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:54,359
will work to model our city as a safe and welcoming place that equally encourages all to speak, seek personal advancement, and to reside in peaceful consentment and method.

314
00:45:54,459 --> 00:46:09,206
And the safe method rejects all words and acts of hate, indifference, and intolerance that undermine our neighbors, communities of faith, and our schools, and thwart the promise of equal justice.

315
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,548
Whereas our nation was founded

316
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:23,259
on the fundamental principles that all persons are entitled to equal protection of law, equal opportunity, and the enjoyment of civil and human rights.

317
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:35,244
Now, therefore, the city of Medford proudly supports the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and the collaboration of race in Medford and beyond.

318
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:38,866
And signed, Mayor Stephanie Burke.

319
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:41,907
And this was passed on a seven to zero,

320
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:44,769
Motion by the City Council.

321
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:46,390
Name and address for the record, please.

322
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:51,574
Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party.

323
00:46:53,676 --> 00:47:05,285
I come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on.

324
00:47:06,145 --> 00:47:10,889
At the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tudin for propelling this issue

325
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:13,675
before our citizens of the city of Medford.

326
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:26,121
Since this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take.

327
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:36,626
To me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council, the school committee, take a position on this issue.

328
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:54,914
Because isn't it weird, when we think about our America today, and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League, or little Pop Warner kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue.

329
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:58,115
And our culture seems to be at issue.

330
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:01,296
But where are we going with all of that?

331
00:48:01,396 --> 00:48:02,456
I don't know.

332
00:48:02,496 --> 00:48:05,337
Sanctuary City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s.

333
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:16,882
Central folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place.

334
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:28,947
And what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out.

335
00:48:29,821 --> 00:48:37,826
But that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities.

336
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:50,215
And as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016.

337
00:48:51,756 --> 00:48:57,220
If you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups.

338
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,001
I think the word before all,

339
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,090
an immigrant should be legal.

340
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,331
All legal immigrant groups.

341
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:09,153
Because we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws.

342
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:11,554
Its foundation is built on laws.

343
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:15,515
And it's on the legality of what we do each and every day.

344
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:28,239
And it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right

345
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:32,117
We're giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility.

346
00:49:33,497 --> 00:49:39,861
But the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer.

347
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:52,047
You know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue.

348
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:55,029
It says, all lives matter.

349
00:49:56,315 --> 00:49:57,796
Everybody's lives matter.

350
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:01,479
White, black, blue, green, I don't care what nationality you are.

351
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:10,906
If you're here in this country, and you're here legally, or you have the proper legal documents, earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters.

352
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:18,212
And for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now.

353
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:23,688
We as a community are very generous to so many people.

354
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:45,525
You members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding, and if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Medford, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Medford.

355
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,088
You've also seen monies go to legal, council,

356
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:57,678
for people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward.

357
00:50:59,158 --> 00:51:06,560
We also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can.

358
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:15,343
And while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal?

359
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:19,604
And I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself,

360
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,040
presents that particular situation.

361
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:25,563
Like I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on.

362
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:36,049
Sanctuary cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws.

363
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:43,474
And they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities.

364
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:47,837
Now, in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress,

365
00:51:49,591 --> 00:52:01,239
It stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from.

366
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,941
But inclusive of those crimes,

367
00:52:05,196 --> 00:52:11,538
There was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014 drunk driving charges to individuals that did not have a license.

368
00:52:11,558 --> 00:52:15,240
There were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time.

369
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,847
What does that say to the law abiding citizen?

370
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:40,250
But more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel?

371
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:48,814
Who especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not.

372
00:52:49,214 --> 00:52:53,537
You can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me.

373
00:52:55,064 --> 00:53:09,312
It has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally.

374
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:17,277
And that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be here legally, but that I can arrest and imprison.

375
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:19,618
And that's really not right.

376
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:26,271
There's a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died.

377
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:27,991
He came from Levone, Texas.

378
00:53:29,112 --> 00:53:33,213
And he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision.

379
00:53:34,134 --> 00:53:41,776
And he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old, strike that, his four-year-old daughter and his 22-month-old son.

380
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:50,079
The illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence.

381
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:55,764
a two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter.

382
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:19,248
The woman, subsequent to that, has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation, because she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that, and the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic, she now becomes the culprit and not the victim.

383
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:22,196
These are just little nuances.

384
00:54:22,236 --> 00:54:23,657
We can go to the entire country.

385
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:31,823
There are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country.

386
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:33,084
And that's not right.

387
00:54:33,364 --> 00:54:35,766
Absolutely not right.

388
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:41,970
When we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system.

389
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,432
They go to our quality schools.

390
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:46,933
They get free housing and free food.

391
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:48,935
But they don't choose to blend in

392
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:53,775
by learning English and assimilating to our American culture.

393
00:54:54,835 --> 00:55:11,943
And further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in, it adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America.

394
00:55:13,123 --> 00:55:17,345
So the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office.

395
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:22,776
I haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature.

396
00:55:22,816 --> 00:55:29,319
Just one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities.

397
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:30,879
I commend him for it.

398
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:31,979
He took his position.

399
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,901
It's a very important issue to be discussed.

400
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:44,744
Because if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd,

401
00:55:46,365 --> 00:55:50,488
resolution, well, this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city.

402
00:55:51,129 --> 00:55:52,830
Either we are or we're not.

403
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:59,095
And I think you councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position.

404
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:10,605
And the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against, in a common level headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree.

405
00:56:11,752 --> 00:56:14,874
And that's where I think we need to be going here in this community.

406
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:21,079
You know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93.

407
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:22,680
It says we are a welcoming.

408
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,461
We've always been a welcoming committee.

409
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:31,046
We've got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years.

410
00:56:31,326 --> 00:56:34,529
And slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore.

411
00:56:35,129 --> 00:56:38,332
The cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control.

412
00:56:38,872 --> 00:56:39,833
Makes no sense at all.

413
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:48,192
And if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen.

414
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:52,234
You can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on.

415
00:56:52,474 --> 00:56:53,634
And Dr. Stirella was right.

416
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:55,756
Your finances will be so out of control.

417
00:56:56,656 --> 00:57:01,859
And if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it.

418
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:08,322
And please let the people know as a candidate for office that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it.

419
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,891
Mr. Panto, we're running, you're running over your time.

420
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:11,451
That was a lot.

421
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:13,994
I think this is a very important issue.

422
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:15,735
You know, we have a 10 minute timeframe.

423
00:57:16,156 --> 00:57:16,476
Okay.

424
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:20,880
There are other people that will let you speak.

425
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:30,028
I think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone

426
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:36,563
should tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal.

427
00:57:37,244 --> 00:57:47,398
That's their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.

428
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:02,262
Name and address of the record, please.

429
00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:04,163
Hi, my name is Curtis Tudin.

430
00:58:04,364 --> 00:58:19,655
I live at 340 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts, and I'm here to speak in support of Medford pursuing sanctuary city status or any initiative that makes it clear that this is a community that is welcoming and safe for all residents, regardless of immigration status.

431
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:23,479
So there is a lot of reasoning behind that.

432
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:27,903
It's, I also agree that it's an important topic that people need to take a stance on.

433
00:58:28,323 --> 00:58:32,227
I commend the city council for their statement from last November.

434
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:36,010
Um, it definitely got a point across that you were trying to make.

435
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,853
I commend the mayor and the police chief for,

436
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:51,689
expressing and assuring me in different conversations and other residents that Medford doesn't practice the tactics that are what sanctuary city status tries to address.

437
00:58:52,289 --> 00:59:00,954
But all of that is great to practice, but it's one of those rare problems where we actually have to preach what we practice.

438
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:03,135
So that shouldn't be too difficult.

439
00:59:03,175 --> 00:59:08,418
If we're already a city that does all these great things, we need to be clear in stating

440
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:16,924
that we are a sanctuary city status or we are a safe community, whatever the title may be, it's up to the community to decide that particular label.

441
00:59:17,544 --> 00:59:22,588
But we need something that's clear so that all residents in the community can understand it.

442
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:33,217
Specifically, as an employee of Bedford Public Schools, I see on a regular basis when immigrant families come into the building and because they don't speak English,

443
00:59:34,077 --> 01:00:01,248
And because of the culture of fear that is added on to by all the statistics that were read, even though it is documented that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than ordinary legal Americans, every day these families come into the Medford Public Schools and they're afraid to make eye contact because they don't know where that may lead, whether it's with an authority figure,

444
01:00:01,788 --> 01:00:04,329
or with a teacher or anybody, even another student.

445
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:28,919
I wish, as someone who doesn't speak another language, that I could hand them a piece of paper in any language that clearly explains that being part of Medford Public Schools is a right of all students and that in this building, or really in all city buildings, you shouldn't feel discriminated against or in danger in any way, whether that's in a classroom or talking to a police officer or talking to a firefighter, going to an emergency room,

446
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:39,726
all these essential aspects of just being a human being that a city should be able to provide without a culture of fear that is unfortunately sweeping across the country.

447
01:00:39,786 --> 01:00:49,392
So for Medford to stand up and label itself what I will ultimately see as the right side of history, then I think now is the appropriate time to do so.

448
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:54,375
So thank you for listening and I appreciate everybody coming out and contributing to the conversation.

449
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:05,971
Name and address for the record, please.

450
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:10,434
My name is Kevin Wolfson, 159 Central Ave.

451
01:01:11,275 --> 01:01:18,300
Thank you for welcoming the public and the chance to speak.

452
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,862
I'm a participant in a group called Safe Medford that many of you have heard from.

453
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:25,545
The mission of our group is to advocate for

454
01:01:26,112 --> 01:01:28,897
all people in Medford, regardless of their immigration status.

455
01:01:29,138 --> 01:01:34,869
And I know many of you, I hope, have seen our website, safemedford.org.

456
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:37,033
If you haven't, I hope that you will take the time to look through it.

457
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:54,728
And you'll notice that we don't use the term sanctuary city because it is often connected to statistics like Mr. Pinto was citing, and this sort of kind of building of fear that is not what we're about, not what we're intending, and that we feel distorts the issue.

458
01:01:54,829 --> 01:02:07,357
So the term that we use is safe communities, but regardless of what the term is, our goal is to pass a set of policies, and these are policies that are used across the country.

459
01:02:08,618 --> 01:02:19,606
that are supported by police organizations and sheriffs across the country that clarify how the police does and does not work with federal immigration.

460
01:02:20,526 --> 01:02:32,115
The Homeland Security Department, which is what ICE is part of, is, if I recall correctly, the second largest, second most heavily, second biggest funded

461
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:35,397
It's either second or third in the entire country.

462
01:02:35,497 --> 01:02:38,278
They have no lack of resources.

463
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:39,959
They are extremely well-funded.

464
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:46,883
They have all of the money they need to do the work that they are supposed to do, and that all of us will agree is important work.

465
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:57,233
The Medford Police Department, the city of Medford, clearly from statements of people so far tonight, clearly is not nearly as well funded.

466
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:04,816
The Medford Police Department doesn't have enough police officers, according to many people, and I have no doubt about that.

467
01:03:05,737 --> 01:03:13,360
The police station itself is in disrepair, and I know that there is the welcome push to build a new police department.

468
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:24,872
And a large part of why we're asking for what we're asking for is so that the limited resources of Medford aren't co-opted by a very well-funded national organization.

469
01:03:24,912 --> 01:03:32,880
It's about protecting, in one way, about protecting Medford's rights to be an independent community that decides what to do with its own resources.

470
01:03:33,756 --> 01:03:34,836
That's one thing I wanted to point out.

471
01:03:34,856 --> 01:03:45,800
The other thing that I wanted to point out is the discussion of legality and illegal and legal immigrants and that sort of thing.

472
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,662
I want to point out that immigration offenses are civil offenses.

473
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:56,044
They are not criminal offenses, and they are often connected to criminal offenses with statistics, again, like Mr. Pinto was talking about.

474
01:03:57,805 --> 01:04:00,607
But that is not what we're getting at.

475
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:14,477
We're getting at people who are at various stages of immigration documentation not being treated like criminals for what is a civil offense in the same way that a speeding ticket is a civil offense.

476
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:23,784
Like Mr. Tootin just said, immigration status has no correlation to people being more violent.

477
01:04:25,807 --> 01:04:31,275
There are plenty of ways that you can pick statistics that make it seem like that's the case, and it's not the case.

478
01:04:32,196 --> 01:04:37,544
And, again, I hope you'll look at the safemetford.org website, where we explain that more clearly and more thoroughly.

479
01:04:39,466 --> 01:04:50,916
Finally, I want to point out that cities that have these policies, I mentioned earlier that police organizations and sheriffs across the country support policies like this.

480
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:54,379
Cities that have these policies are economically stronger.

481
01:04:54,939 --> 01:04:56,780
They are statistically safer.

482
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:10,388
And the reason for that is that people who might be at risk of being targeted by ICE don't feel like they're afraid to call the police if they see a crime or if they are a victim of a crime.

483
01:05:11,168 --> 01:05:12,849
And that makes all of us safer.

484
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,491
So, again, thank you for the chance to speak.

485
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:16,792
That's all I have.

486
01:05:25,393 --> 01:05:28,114
Maria Stott, 122 Boston Avenue.

487
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:29,934
Good evening.

488
01:05:30,495 --> 01:05:33,495
Thank you all for the opportunity to be here, and thank you for serving.

489
01:05:34,216 --> 01:05:34,996
This is a service.

490
01:05:36,056 --> 01:05:38,417
I'd like to give you just a few facts.

491
01:05:39,237 --> 01:05:41,938
I am a lifetime member of the NAACP.

492
01:05:43,198 --> 01:05:45,019
I am a member of Safe Medford.

493
01:05:45,819 --> 01:05:54,402
Before I give you four facts, I want to say that my husband was an immigrant, and my in-laws were immigrants, and the thought

494
01:05:55,481 --> 01:06:04,305
of my child coming home from school one day and her grandmother or her dad not being there is insane.

495
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:18,833
Less than 3% of 11 million undocumented residents have been convicted of felonies compared to 6% of the general population.

496
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:25,176
Undocumented residents are ineligible

497
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:36,634
for programs like SNAP and TANF and non-emergency Medicare, yet they pay into our social security system.

498
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:48,819
It's true, some new immigrants, newly arrived immigrants do go to our public schools, but second and third generation immigrants stimulate our economy.

499
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,341
Unauthorized people, undocumented people,

500
01:06:55,506 --> 01:07:00,829
pay about $12 billion a year in state and local taxes.

501
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:01,869
And this is cited from 2015.

502
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:12,275
Immigrants with little English and limited job skills do the jobs that Americans often don't want to do.

503
01:07:13,956 --> 01:07:19,499
We are a richer society when we are an inclusive society.

504
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,101
And I really want people to

505
01:07:24,728 --> 01:07:27,550
seek understanding, and then to be understood.

506
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:38,657
There is a difference between undocumented individuals and criminals who have broken federal and state laws.

507
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:39,877
Thank you.

508
01:07:40,498 --> 01:07:40,838
Thank you.

509
01:07:47,982 --> 01:07:49,243
Name and address for the record, please.

510
01:07:50,424 --> 01:07:51,444
Thank you, Mr. President.

511
01:07:51,564 --> 01:07:53,506
I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

512
01:07:55,526 --> 01:08:02,070
Over the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States.

513
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:13,337
Me, personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way.

514
01:08:13,997 --> 01:08:18,200
But we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S.

515
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,000
Constitution.

516
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:20,481
And under the U.S.

517
01:08:20,521 --> 01:08:22,923
Constitution, there are laws that govern

518
01:08:23,553 --> 01:08:25,975
how one becomes a citizen of the United States.

519
01:08:26,696 --> 01:08:41,930
For a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to.

520
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:48,816
You're subverting the Constitution, which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from

521
01:08:49,494 --> 01:08:55,137
impoverished or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life.

522
01:08:55,257 --> 01:09:00,919
One of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration.

523
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:15,986
While it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time, a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States.

524
01:09:17,726 --> 01:09:18,667
On the state level,

525
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:23,412
Among the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year.

526
01:09:23,972 --> 01:09:26,514
At the federal level, it's $45 billion a year.

527
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:41,307
So the costs coming in don't even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on.

528
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,913
I don't think that for a city like Medford,

529
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,592
for a group like Safe Medford to come along.

530
01:09:52,273 --> 01:09:58,340
And this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else.

531
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:04,428
It's a matter of respect for the law in becoming a citizen of the United States.

532
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:21,859
It's an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has

533
01:10:23,562 --> 01:10:30,027
really the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be.

534
01:10:30,808 --> 01:10:41,336
And under the guise of the feel-good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city.

535
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:43,738
I'll leave you with this question.

536
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:49,362
Is Medford being a welcoming city by

537
01:10:50,185 --> 01:10:52,448
basically subverting the rule of U.S.

538
01:10:52,508 --> 01:11:03,082
constitutional law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do?

539
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:05,505
When a new resident or a new business

540
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:14,474
comes to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is.

541
01:11:14,934 --> 01:11:21,041
Here are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant.

542
01:11:21,921 --> 01:11:22,983
Here are the city services.

543
01:11:23,043 --> 01:11:25,425
Here's when we pick up trash in your neighborhood.

544
01:11:26,106 --> 01:11:27,387
That's a welcoming city?

545
01:11:28,688 --> 01:11:29,069
It's not.

546
01:11:29,861 --> 01:11:35,205
But circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S.

547
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:36,706
Constitution is?

548
01:11:37,347 --> 01:11:38,087
I beg to differ.

549
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,148
Thank you, Mr. President.

550
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,567
My name is Rachel van drop.

551
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:49,308
I live at 19 Fulton street.

552
01:11:49,328 --> 01:11:55,190
Um, I am a part of safe Medford and I've also been a part of, uh, the people power as well.

553
01:11:55,310 --> 01:12:00,672
And I would just like to clarify, um, that we have not been dictating what the police should be doing.

554
01:12:00,792 --> 01:12:10,375
We have been asking them to put their current policies in writing so that that can be used to ensure people that they are not going to be

555
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:11,815
treated in such a way.

556
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:15,797
We're not saying do this, we're saying we appreciate that you are doing this.

557
01:12:16,317 --> 01:12:20,158
As things are, please put it in writing so that it can be clarified.

558
01:12:20,678 --> 01:12:21,038
Thank you.

559
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:21,538
Thank you.

560
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:31,041
Good evening.

561
01:12:31,061 --> 01:12:31,942
Name and address of the record, please.

562
01:12:31,962 --> 01:12:32,862
Good evening.

563
01:12:33,002 --> 01:12:34,162
I'm Munir Germanus.

564
01:12:34,703 --> 01:12:39,004
I live at 3 Summit Road, and I appreciate

565
01:12:39,451 --> 01:12:43,214
the opportunity to address this group.

566
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,335
I am a naturalized citizen.

567
01:12:46,376 --> 01:12:52,440
My wife and I became citizens primarily because we happen to be well educated.

568
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,862
We both have PhDs.

569
01:12:55,562 --> 01:13:02,627
So it was very useful for various businesses to work and hire us.

570
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:08,271
There are many immigrants who unfortunately don't have that luxury and

571
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:16,991
I think basically welcoming means welcoming for all and not welcoming just for the educated.

572
01:13:20,032 --> 01:13:31,859
So I personally am quite in favor of having Medford and actually all of Massachusetts become a sanctuary city, just like the state of California.

573
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:37,883
And I would certainly urge all candidates running for office

574
01:13:38,638 --> 01:13:43,082
including you, ladies and gentlemen, to do the same.

575
01:13:43,422 --> 01:13:43,742
Thank you.

576
01:13:43,983 --> 01:13:44,383
Thank you.

577
01:13:58,855 --> 01:13:59,196
Thank you.

578
01:13:59,236 --> 01:14:00,257
Name and address of the record, please.

579
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:05,101
Eileen Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford.

580
01:14:07,748 --> 01:14:11,330
For all of my adult life, I have worked with immigrants.

581
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:16,492
The past 25, I've been teaching English to adults.

582
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:20,814
I agree it's a good idea for immigrants to speak English.

583
01:14:21,654 --> 01:14:22,895
Where are the programs?

584
01:14:23,595 --> 01:14:24,556
Where is the money?

585
01:14:25,736 --> 01:14:26,617
People come here.

586
01:14:26,637 --> 01:14:33,280
They have to work hard to support their families, you know, and often they don't have cars,

587
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,010
maybe working two, three jobs and they don't have the time to learn English.

588
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:43,259
Sometimes when people are laid off from jobs they get

589
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:53,352
So they get unemployment compensation, and part of the deal for that is that they take English classes.

590
01:14:53,572 --> 01:15:08,855
I've had those kind of people, women who have been in this country for 25 years, never learned English, because they didn't have the opportunity, they didn't have the time, they didn't have the money, but when they were given it, they were so, so happy.

591
01:15:09,435 --> 01:15:11,156
to learn English.

592
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:19,239
So if we want people to learn English, we have to put more money into programs to teach them English, you know?

593
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:29,163
And also, you know, the talking about immigrants and criminals is so deceptive because

594
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:39,156
Immigrants and undocumented immigrants have a much, much lower rate of crime than American citizens do.

595
01:15:39,776 --> 01:15:46,738
Most of them are just too busy trying to survive and doing lots of jobs that Americans don't want to do.

596
01:15:48,226 --> 01:15:52,889
And who is it who decides who comes into the United States?

597
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:57,953
Isn't it a bunch of white men with privilege and power and money?

598
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:06,559
You know, who says that a woman from Honduras who's fleeing domestic violence and gangs can't come in?

599
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:08,140
Can we keep it down in the back?

600
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,060
There's someone who's speaking.

601
01:16:09,821 --> 01:16:10,161
Thank you.

602
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:11,662
I apologize.

603
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:12,583
That's OK.

604
01:16:13,523 --> 01:16:15,065
And to talk about the flag.

605
01:16:16,107 --> 01:16:20,390
But not to mention slavery, the legacy of slavery that we're living in.

606
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:32,640
To talk about disrespect to the country when we're not talking about all the numerous black people that we've seen slaughtered by white racism, by white supremacy.

607
01:16:34,147 --> 01:16:49,312
And when people object to that, when people stand up and say this is wrong, or they take a knee or they protest, then the issue becomes the flag and not discrimination, not unjust killings.

608
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:51,833
It's so deceptive.

609
01:16:53,613 --> 01:16:57,055
You know, my grandparents came here from Poland.

610
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:01,256
I wouldn't be alive if they hadn't been able to come here

611
01:17:02,876 --> 01:17:11,163
I appreciate the United States so much, and my life, and the life of my children, my grandchildren, and my new great-grandchildren.

612
01:17:12,604 --> 01:17:15,207
And I want the same rights for other people.

613
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,308
I've met these people.

614
01:17:17,408 --> 01:17:18,449
They're good people.

615
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:20,611
They contribute to our country.

616
01:17:20,952 --> 01:17:24,254
They do a lot of jobs that other people don't want to do.

617
01:17:24,274 --> 01:17:27,897
I recently had hip replacement surgery.

618
01:17:28,738 --> 01:17:33,521
And who were the people that were taking care of old people in this country but immigrants?

619
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:37,203
And believe me, I didn't ask them if they were documented.

620
01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:41,325
I didn't care if they're documented or they're undocumented.

621
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,386
I'm glad they're here.

622
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:43,947
I'm glad they're safe.

623
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:47,569
I'm glad they're contributing to our communities with their

624
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:51,171
skills and their money.

625
01:17:51,191 --> 01:18:00,056
I mean, right now, we've had an instance where down on the Cape, they had trouble staffing the hotels and the restaurants, right?

626
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:06,519
And people lost money down there because they didn't have enough immigrants like they used to have.

627
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:14,364
And in California, they're having trouble getting people picking the fruit and the vegetables, right?

628
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:26,065
You know, you may want to call them illegal or whatever you want to call them, but they've done a lot of work for our country, and they haven't been treated fairly a lot of times.

629
01:18:26,705 --> 01:18:30,446
And I just want to stand and say, I support these people.

630
01:18:30,526 --> 01:18:41,090
I think they contribute to our economy and to the richness of our culture, which isn't only white and Christian, but is multicultural.

631
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,211
Thank you.

632
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:42,951
Thank you.

633
01:18:53,936 --> 01:18:54,316
Good evening.

634
01:18:54,376 --> 01:18:55,596
Name and address of the record, please.

635
01:18:55,776 --> 01:18:57,797
Joanna Hicks, 15 Talbot Street.

636
01:18:59,657 --> 01:19:04,478
I'm a fourth generation Japanese American and Filipino on my mother's side.

637
01:19:05,478 --> 01:19:16,420
And some of you may know, during World War II, Japanese Americans were incarcerated, 120,000 of them, just on the basis of their national origin.

638
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,181
Some of the men of that generation went on to serve for the

639
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:29,543
in the armed forces and became the most decorated unit in World War II, sent into some of the most dangerous missions.

640
01:19:30,483 --> 01:19:47,091
And I wanted to support safe communities in Medford and speak out that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, serve this country in the military as well as contributing to the economy.

641
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:47,991
Thank you.

642
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:48,792
Thank you.

643
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:57,818
Good evening.

644
01:19:57,858 --> 01:19:59,038
Name and address of the record, please.

645
01:19:59,218 --> 01:20:01,439
William graves, 69 Stanley Avenue.

646
01:20:01,459 --> 01:20:04,760
Uh, I'm also a member of safe Medford.

647
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,621
And, uh, in addition, I'm a, I'm an immigration lawyer and I've been practicing immigration law for about 20 years.

648
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:17,322
Um, I think that having Medford become a safe community and declaring itself a safe community is, is a good idea.

649
01:20:17,862 --> 01:20:19,763
And I think it promotes safety in the community.

650
01:20:20,203 --> 01:20:21,643
I don't think it subverts the law.

651
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:23,884
It certainly doesn't separate the federal law in any way.

652
01:20:24,824 --> 01:20:25,924
Um, immigration law,

653
01:20:26,897 --> 01:20:28,538
isn't really constitutional law.

654
01:20:28,778 --> 01:20:29,899
It's statutory law.

655
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:36,684
Congress basically has the power to make laws governing immigration, and it's enforced by the executive branch.

656
01:20:39,485 --> 01:20:42,347
It's primarily civil law, as Kevin had pointed out earlier.

657
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:43,928
Not much of it is criminal law.

658
01:20:44,008 --> 01:20:52,414
So when people are here without documentation or expired documentation, they're here in a civil violation, not a criminal violation.

659
01:20:53,715 --> 01:21:00,557
In, in recent months I think the climate of fear has greatly increased and I certainly see this in my practice.

660
01:21:01,438 --> 01:21:12,181
I see, I get calls from parents who are afraid to send their kids, their US citizen kids to school because they're afraid that they may be questioned about the immigration status of one or both of their parents.

661
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:17,063
And you know, I try to let them know that that's not the case and that won't happen.

662
01:21:17,863 --> 01:21:17,923
Um,

663
01:21:18,953 --> 01:21:25,537
People are afraid to go out, and I think that people are afraid to call the police when they're a victim of a crime or if they witness a crime.

664
01:21:25,897 --> 01:21:28,899
They're afraid to come to City Hall to complain about a landlord.

665
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:45,029
And I think that creating a safe community and Medford declaring itself a safe community will make all residents, all members of our community, the people with whom we live, to feel welcome and to feel welcome to communicate with the police or with the city.

666
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,190
That's all I have to say.

667
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:47,711
Thank you.

668
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:55,417
Thank you.

669
01:21:55,817 --> 01:21:58,078
Records, the meeting of October 10th.

670
01:22:04,161 --> 01:22:05,262
Name and address of the record, please.

671
01:22:12,525 --> 01:22:14,526
Rachel Tannenhouse, 26 Pearl Street, please.

672
01:22:16,126 --> 01:22:16,347
Hi.

673
01:22:18,427 --> 01:22:22,329
My name is Rachel and I am the granddaughter of refugees.

674
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:30,240
And yes, I am in favor of Medford being a sanctuary city.

675
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,981
So you all can get a head start on snarking now.

676
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:40,303
And my grandmother, who is 97, came here as a refugee.

677
01:22:41,143 --> 01:22:52,686
And I don't know, or I haven't really asked whether or not she got here legally, because I don't care, because I'm pretty happy to be alive, and also Hitler.

678
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:04,062
Frankly, if people are escaping genocide, I think that really that is a situation that I don't get to do a lot of judging about.

679
01:23:04,722 --> 01:23:11,044
Now, I'm pretty sure that there are a number of people in the room who have studied their history.

680
01:23:12,424 --> 01:23:17,185
So if you have done so, then you know that much of the rhetoric around immigrants today is

681
01:23:18,089 --> 01:23:25,992
very, very similar to the rhetoric around Jewish refugees in the 1940s, late 1930s, early 1940s.

682
01:23:27,672 --> 01:23:36,255
Really, really very similar, talking about crime rates, talking about loyalty to the country, talking about who are we really letting in, talking about who's a real American.

683
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:45,338
And I just want to make that really clear that a lot of people, some of whom are relatives of mine, died because of that sort of rhetoric.

684
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:49,072
I'm not really interested in a community where we let that happen again.

685
01:23:50,413 --> 01:23:53,815
One of the things we talk about, one of the things that we say is never again.

686
01:23:54,696 --> 01:24:07,524
And I really feel that as a member of a community who, you know, every few years or so somebody pops up and tries to wipe us out, we've gotten really good at looking out for this kind of thing.

687
01:24:08,425 --> 01:24:08,885
Real good.

688
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:10,486
We know it when we see it.

689
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,981
And I also feel like there have been some logical fallacies that have been going on here.

690
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:24,363
For example, if you're really excited about the statement that all lives matter, then you have to believe that all lives matter.

691
01:24:25,183 --> 01:24:26,243
And the question is, do they?

692
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:33,625
Or is it just the people that you decide matter?

693
01:24:33,725 --> 01:24:37,386
You can't say, all lives matter, and then in the same breath say, but not yours.

694
01:24:37,966 --> 01:24:38,466
Not these.

695
01:24:39,267 --> 01:24:40,167
These do not have.

696
01:24:41,434 --> 01:24:42,675
These can't be safe here.

697
01:24:43,376 --> 01:24:54,844
I also agree with the statement that, obviously, God forbid somebody in this room gets attacked or robbed or anything like that, and there's a witness who is undocumented.

698
01:24:55,425 --> 01:24:59,388
You're on your own under these current circumstances because

699
01:25:00,326 --> 01:25:03,529
they're not going to get sent back to a place where somebody's trying to wipe them out.

700
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:17,001
And I should point out, by the way, that in my family, nobody ever asks my family if they are here legally because they pass because they're white and nobody cares and nobody stops and checks you if you're white.

701
01:25:17,722 --> 01:25:25,969
So, you know, I think that when we also talk about who's here and who's getting checked and who's not, it's really clear that we only mean certain

702
01:25:26,474 --> 01:25:32,821
certain, even if you don't think you mean it, you really only mean certain subcategories of folks who are undocumented.

703
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:44,435
Also, I love how people who generally espouse small government are really okay with our police department being federalized and with the federal government telling our local police department what to do.

704
01:25:46,216 --> 01:25:48,457
That doesn't really follow logically.

705
01:25:49,257 --> 01:26:00,583
What we are saying is that a federal agency cannot come in and commandeer our local police department and use their resources to do their work with a sanctuary city.

706
01:26:01,024 --> 01:26:06,046
And so my question again is, are you for small government or are you only for some small government?

707
01:26:07,566 --> 01:26:26,193
And I also agree that I hear and I agree that our police department is severely overworked and under-resourced and not making a statement that the federal government can't come in and commandeer them and use them for their own purposes is simply adding to the problem.

708
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:30,235
And I hear a lot of people talking about how we have to make things easier

709
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,321
for our police department.

710
01:26:32,341 --> 01:26:33,901
We have to hire more police officers.

711
01:26:33,961 --> 01:26:35,542
We need to build a new police station.

712
01:26:35,882 --> 01:26:51,029
And if you believe those things, then why would you possibly believe that you would want to stretch their resources for things that aren't even being done by a local agency, that actually a federal agency is perfectly capable of doing themselves?

713
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:58,492
I feel like this is a situation where we want to be on the right side of history.

714
01:26:59,349 --> 01:27:02,430
Because my family has seen what the other side of history looks like.

715
01:27:03,931 --> 01:27:06,452
And it ain't pretty, and it killed a bunch of us.

716
01:27:07,732 --> 01:27:24,559
And if you think anything different is going on in the countries that are specifically the numbers are being cut down on, if you think anything all that different is going on in Syria, if you think anything all that different is going on in Sudan, then maybe you haven't studied your history all that well.

717
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,860
I hear Medford public schools are pretty good.

718
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:28,821
You should go take a class.

719
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:39,208
I just want to say that I can't see much, but I see you, Mr. Penta.

720
01:27:40,609 --> 01:27:44,270
I see what people are doing.

721
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:51,652
I see what the people who want to keep out immigrants are doing.

722
01:27:52,933 --> 01:27:55,954
And I know what was done to my family, and I know what it looks like.

723
01:27:57,774 --> 01:28:00,015
And I'm not going to sit here and let it happen again.

724
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:08,606
So yeah, I am really, really in favor of all the candidates stating their position on this, because I want to know who to vote for and who not to.

725
01:28:08,646 --> 01:28:10,549
And I think, actually, we're all in agreement about that.

726
01:28:10,609 --> 01:28:16,555
We all want folks to make a statement on these things, because we know where we fall on this, and we want to know who to vote for.

727
01:28:16,615 --> 01:28:19,038
So I think that's something we are all on the same page.

728
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:21,361
Thank you very much.

729
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:21,741
Thank you.

730
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:22,302
Have a good evening.

731
01:28:29,178 --> 01:28:29,518
Good evening.

732
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:30,678
Name and address of the record, please.

733
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:35,619
My name is Anthony D'Antonio and I live on Yale street in Medford.

734
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:38,460
And it's a pretty hot topic here.

735
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,681
Um, but I'm going to tell you something right now.

736
01:28:40,741 --> 01:28:47,242
You can take all the statistics, all the figures and everything, just throw them out the window because everybody skews statistics.

737
01:28:47,842 --> 01:28:54,924
But what's really aggravating is these people come up here and they say, well, my family did this and my family did this and I'm this and I'm that.

738
01:28:55,264 --> 01:28:55,704
We're all,

739
01:28:56,257 --> 01:28:57,138
part of the same group.

740
01:28:57,218 --> 01:29:05,104
We've all, in our families, every single one of us, have had people that have bled and died in fields far away from here, okay?

741
01:29:05,844 --> 01:29:13,370
But the thing that really aggravates me is if you notice the tone, it only took a matter of 10 minutes before we got into white privilege, okay?

742
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:16,633
We're responsible for everything in this world that goes wrong.

743
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:18,014
Well, I'm sick and tired of that.

744
01:29:18,454 --> 01:29:20,556
You can't legislate behavior on somebody.

745
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,801
Everybody, I don't understand this culture of fear.

746
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:26,562
I haven't seen that.

747
01:29:27,642 --> 01:29:31,944
This city, Medford, was more diverse than it is now when I was growing up.

748
01:29:32,684 --> 01:29:34,685
And everybody, that's right, they are immigrants.

749
01:29:34,985 --> 01:29:36,225
We're all immigrants here.

750
01:29:36,645 --> 01:29:37,986
And there's all ways to come in here.

751
01:29:38,486 --> 01:29:40,507
But what they're doing is they're making it very divisive.

752
01:29:41,187 --> 01:29:44,848
Because it's them against people that have a different point of view.

753
01:29:45,488 --> 01:29:48,869
So if you have a different point of view, you're on the wrong side of history.

754
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:50,270
Well, that's a bunch of baloney.

755
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:57,821
So I just want to tell you that nobody is saying you can't come here or anything like that.

756
01:29:58,221 --> 01:30:03,702
But if you take a real good look at it, we've had a botched up immigration system for years here.

757
01:30:04,282 --> 01:30:16,206
And now a certain political group has found out that by catering and offering to illegals that they've created their own voting block for the future.

758
01:30:16,546 --> 01:30:16,906
Okay.

759
01:30:17,186 --> 01:30:20,967
And I'm just sick and tired of everybody being blamed.

760
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:23,614
When other people, you know, is this safe, Medford?

761
01:30:24,194 --> 01:30:26,195
You're insinuating that Medford is not safe.

762
01:30:26,655 --> 01:30:31,698
Medford is safe, and the police should be commended for what they're doing with what they have.

763
01:30:32,778 --> 01:30:37,461
So just think before they speak over here, because I'm getting really aggravated about this nonsense.

764
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:37,841
Thank you.

765
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:38,201
Thank you.

766
01:30:44,404 --> 01:30:45,705
Name and address for the record, please.

767
01:30:46,285 --> 01:30:48,106
Andrew Castaneda, Cushman Street.

768
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:54,228
former Memphis City Council candidate, October 17th, 2017.

769
01:30:54,508 --> 01:31:04,015
We're all immigrants, except for the Eskimo and the Indian, plural.

770
01:31:05,656 --> 01:31:09,899
In a perfect world, or a perfect country, we would not even have borders.

771
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:20,820
On the other hand, my father sponsored my mother's brother to come from Northern Italy to come here back in the 60s.

772
01:31:22,461 --> 01:31:27,002
And he had to get him a job and gave him an apartment, half price.

773
01:31:30,103 --> 01:31:36,245
And I kind of feel bad for the people that are trying to do this legally.

774
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:37,986
They're waiting in line.

775
01:31:38,506 --> 01:31:40,827
Maybe they're paying attorney fees

776
01:31:43,032 --> 01:31:44,894
Who else they're paying, I don't know.

777
01:31:45,915 --> 01:31:48,217
And maybe they won't be able to get in legally.

778
01:31:49,157 --> 01:31:53,862
And I don't know what kind of a process it is these days, if there is such a system at all.

779
01:31:56,063 --> 01:32:05,191
So therefore, I coined the phrase, all sentient beings matter, period.

780
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,474
I said that, not Bob Dylan.

781
01:32:09,555 --> 01:32:09,876
Thank you.

782
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:14,356
Good evening.

783
01:32:14,376 --> 01:32:15,576
Name and address of the record, please.

784
01:32:18,457 --> 01:32:20,657
Ray Scafoe, 9th Sunset Avenue, Medford.

785
01:32:21,998 --> 01:32:25,198
And we talk about white privilege.

786
01:32:26,519 --> 01:32:30,960
I've gotten hit a couple of times by me being rich, white and privileged.

787
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:31,940
Rich?

788
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:32,920
I don't think so.

789
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:41,342
Maybe a little well off than other people, but the privilege was for me to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week to get to this point.

790
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:42,720
So I worked very hard.

791
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,981
I'm a, I'm a second generation of immigrants.

792
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:53,602
Uh, both sides, my father and my mother's side, um, came in and they came in legally.

793
01:32:54,182 --> 01:32:55,222
Uh, they worked very hard.

794
01:32:55,883 --> 01:32:59,463
Um, they did what they had to do and we followed that suit right down the line.

795
01:32:59,503 --> 01:33:06,364
I got my work ethic from my grandparents that I was able to work 15 to 20 hours a day, seven days a week to get to this point.

796
01:33:07,405 --> 01:33:09,485
I employ, um,

797
01:33:10,572 --> 01:33:20,159
At least 60% of my, my employment staff are immigrants and they are very good workers.

798
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,160
Are they legal?

799
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:25,583
Yeah, they're legal, but they work very, very hard.

800
01:33:26,523 --> 01:33:32,748
So tonight I just want to, I just want to make the record straight as how I feel as far as, you know, sanctuary cities.

801
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:38,432
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to express a concern and a request

802
01:33:39,469 --> 01:33:40,489
to this honorable body.

803
01:33:40,969 --> 01:33:44,410
I have a concern regarding a statement which was made by a council candidate.

804
01:33:46,491 --> 01:33:54,993
He has promised if elected to the council that he would make a certain that he would make certain that method became a sanctuary city.

805
01:33:56,813 --> 01:34:00,954
This is a bold statement with all doubts removed of his intention.

806
01:34:01,174 --> 01:34:03,275
I give him credit for being honest.

807
01:34:04,255 --> 01:34:08,036
Although I strongly disagree with him on this issue because

808
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:10,381
We are a country of laws.

809
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:12,302
Laws are legal documents.

810
01:34:12,962 --> 01:34:15,423
They say what they say, not what you want them to say.

811
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:20,005
If you want a law changed, you work to have it changed.

812
01:34:20,866 --> 01:34:22,227
You don't circumvent the law.

813
01:34:23,087 --> 01:34:32,692
However, I have listened and observed others, both elected councilors and candidates, use words and phrases which appear to have a hidden agenda.

814
01:34:33,492 --> 01:34:35,253
I see this as an attempt

815
01:34:35,677 --> 01:34:40,599
to receive approval and support from certain voting blocks that exist in the city.

816
01:34:40,999 --> 01:34:41,740
This is not right.

817
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:43,640
Let me repeat.

818
01:34:44,661 --> 01:34:48,742
I am not in favor of sanctuary cities here in Medford or anywhere else.

819
01:34:49,663 --> 01:34:53,324
This is my opinion and more importantly is my right to express such.

820
01:34:54,345 --> 01:35:01,988
Therefore I'm requesting that all city counselors and candidates make it known by a simple yes or no,

821
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,960
whether they are for Medford becoming a sanctuary city or not.

822
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:08,642
That's a simple yes or no answer.

823
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:12,725
Counselors, you have the opportunity this evening to set the record straight.

824
01:35:12,825 --> 01:35:13,366
Yes or no?

825
01:35:13,926 --> 01:35:15,147
The public has the right to know.

826
01:35:16,288 --> 01:35:25,476
Thank you.

827
01:35:25,656 --> 01:35:25,936
Thank you.

828
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:28,438
Robert Penteciro, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

829
01:35:29,079 --> 01:35:31,421
First of all, for the young lady to my behind me,

830
01:35:33,038 --> 01:35:35,419
I'm not a white privileged individual.

831
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:46,865
I've had to work for everything in my life, starting at five o'clock in the morning for eight consecutive years, driving a canteen truck, being held up three times, shot at twice.

832
01:35:47,925 --> 01:35:50,967
But I didn't give up because I knew what I wanted to do.

833
01:35:51,327 --> 01:35:54,709
I wanted to get a college education and go forward with my life.

834
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:56,550
And that's what I did.

835
01:35:56,890 --> 01:36:00,892
I did not come here tonight to be decisive or

836
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,471
Have people become decisive.

837
01:36:03,531 --> 01:36:10,803
I came here tonight to present an issue, thanking Mr. Tudin, who made the acknowledgement that he is for a sanctuary city.

838
01:36:11,745 --> 01:36:14,550
It's a subject matter that needs to be discussed.

839
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:18,618
The statistics that were given are actual statistics.

840
01:36:18,838 --> 01:36:21,059
You can't get away because they're not lying.

841
01:36:21,899 --> 01:36:37,807
And for the other lady who indicated that the crime rate for the individuals who are undocumented are less than regular American citizens that are documented and are legal, that in and of itself spells to the question of the police department.

842
01:36:38,487 --> 01:36:45,333
They're doing more work because they have to deal with undocumented illegals over and beyond their regular course.

843
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:48,556
Now, are all of them bad people?

844
01:36:48,696 --> 01:36:49,637
Absolutely not.

845
01:36:49,897 --> 01:36:52,119
Do they deserve a fair shot?

846
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:52,900
Absolutely.

847
01:36:54,298 --> 01:36:59,503
And if they have to have some political intervention, which is taking place right now in Washington, so be it.

848
01:37:00,324 --> 01:37:01,765
But the fact of the matter is this.

849
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:15,198
I stand here and I resent the fact that anyone, any seven of you or anyone in this audience, who wants to turn around and say, because I was born white, that I am privileged, that is false, that is wrong, and that is a lie.

850
01:37:15,519 --> 01:37:17,641
And you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that.

851
01:37:18,321 --> 01:37:18,682
Thank you.

852
01:37:27,771 --> 01:37:28,976
Name and address for the record, please.

853
01:37:29,278 --> 01:37:31,768
Okay, Eileen Lerner, 9 Adams Circle.

854
01:37:33,304 --> 01:37:37,845
When I talked about rich and privileged people, I wasn't talking about you, Mr. Penta.

855
01:37:38,505 --> 01:37:41,786
I was talking about the people that write the immigration laws.

856
01:37:42,026 --> 01:37:48,028
I was talking about the people who decide to put Japanese people into concentration camps.

857
01:37:48,828 --> 01:37:55,310
The people who decide whether people come in from certain countries and not from certain other countries.

858
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:58,351
I was not talking about you, Mr. Penta.

859
01:37:59,847 --> 01:38:11,152
But the fact is, you have to realize that white supremacy has been in control in this country, and that it is under attack now.

860
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:15,314
And that is a fact, whether you want to face it or not.

861
01:38:16,655 --> 01:38:17,035
Thank you.

862
01:38:22,717 --> 01:38:23,117
Good evening.

863
01:38:23,157 --> 01:38:24,618
Name and address of the record, please.

864
01:38:24,978 --> 01:38:26,139
My name is Shelly Kroll.

865
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:28,500
I live at 8 Boylston Terrace in Medford.

866
01:38:29,295 --> 01:38:31,338
I've been a Medford resident for about 30 years.

867
01:38:31,999 --> 01:38:39,269
I'm also a labor attorney in Boston and the granddaughter of immigrants, as probably most of us here are.

868
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:44,617
My grandparents were fortunate because when they fled violence in Russia,

869
01:38:46,027 --> 01:38:52,290
immigration laws were much less restrictive than they are today, and they really didn't have to go through too much scrutiny.

870
01:38:53,030 --> 01:39:00,493
Those of us who follow the law knows that laws change very frequently when political administrations change.

871
01:39:01,053 --> 01:39:13,959
And with regard to immigration laws, when we talk about undocumented immigrants, many of the people who are undocumented were legal when they came to this country, but the status changes as the law changed.

872
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,582
We have Haitian immigrants who may be losing their protected status.

873
01:39:18,382 --> 01:39:27,407
We have the DACA dreamers who were raised in this country and who had been promised a road to citizenship and who are now in peril.

874
01:39:28,027 --> 01:39:38,613
So it's not only the immigrants that are fleeing violence, as our grandparents did, but immigrants who came here legally who can now find themselves undocumented and at risk.

875
01:39:38,993 --> 01:39:40,714
And that's just one point I want to make.

876
01:39:41,206 --> 01:39:49,989
Then secondly, I very much applaud the speaker who talked about having a business and working hard to establish a business that employs good immigrant workers.

877
01:39:50,869 --> 01:40:01,893
Most of our grandparents worked very hard so that those of us who followed them could go to school, become professionals, pursue businesses, work with our hands, whatever it took.

878
01:40:02,694 --> 01:40:08,716
But what I can tell you from my labor practice is that there are a lot of companies who are unscrupulous.

879
01:40:09,232 --> 01:40:17,019
And they employ undocumented immigrants in order to keep wages low, in order to violate safety laws, and to imperil all of us.

880
01:40:17,519 --> 01:40:23,064
It's that kind of competition that lowers the bar in a community like Medford and other communities.

881
01:40:23,585 --> 01:40:34,795
And as long as you have immigrant workers who are in fear of complaining and reporting crimes or complaining about safety violations, you stand at risk that that

882
01:40:35,205 --> 01:40:38,987
is going to bring down the standard of living of everybody in our community.

883
01:40:39,428 --> 01:40:39,788
Thank you.

884
01:40:46,251 --> 01:40:47,472
Name and address of the record, please.

885
01:40:48,013 --> 01:40:49,033
Thank you, Mr. President.

886
01:40:49,093 --> 01:40:50,794
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

887
01:40:50,834 --> 01:40:51,995
I'll try to be very brief.

888
01:40:53,156 --> 01:40:57,318
I don't know anybody from my side of this issue

889
01:40:57,776 --> 01:41:00,599
who doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city.

890
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,543
I didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration.

891
01:41:04,783 --> 01:41:19,357
In fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards.

892
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:28,463
It's difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels.

893
01:41:28,844 --> 01:41:45,997
But I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege.

894
01:41:46,377 --> 01:41:50,640
And then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear-mongering.

895
01:41:53,289 --> 01:41:55,814
It's just a little hypocritical, Mr. President.

896
01:41:56,115 --> 01:41:58,099
I also want to address the point of

897
01:41:58,937 --> 01:42:08,225
being for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force.

898
01:42:09,246 --> 01:42:12,108
It has nothing to do with limited government.

899
01:42:12,328 --> 01:42:17,492
It has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens.

900
01:42:17,933 --> 01:42:23,197
We are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force.

901
01:42:25,038 --> 01:42:26,840
In the current policy of not

902
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:29,063
ask an immigration status.

903
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:34,289
If that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support.

904
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:38,975
But make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford

905
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:54,526
group is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status.

906
01:42:54,946 --> 01:42:59,828
You know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program

907
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:14,478
which Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE.

908
01:43:15,298 --> 01:43:16,299
Massachusetts never

909
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:20,032
joined on to the Secured Communities Program.

910
01:43:20,692 --> 01:43:22,593
And I really don't know why.

911
01:43:22,653 --> 01:43:33,558
And whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws.

912
01:43:34,518 --> 01:43:37,920
that govern legal citizenship in the United States.

913
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:42,742
And my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws.

914
01:43:43,102 --> 01:43:47,004
It has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism.

915
01:43:47,344 --> 01:43:55,027
It's just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws.

916
01:43:55,227 --> 01:43:56,808
And those laws have to be respected.

917
01:43:57,288 --> 01:44:01,570
Are you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country

918
01:44:01,963 --> 01:44:02,443
to come to.

919
01:44:03,104 --> 01:44:22,913
And finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever is in power of immigration to know where to go to.

920
01:44:24,374 --> 01:44:32,480
So it's actually not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States.

921
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,822
You're actually putting a target on their back.

922
01:44:35,122 --> 01:44:35,683
Thank you, Mr. President.

923
01:44:35,703 --> 01:44:36,083
Thank you.

924
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:43,248
Good evening, Chief.

925
01:44:44,249 --> 01:44:45,330
Name and address of the record, please.

926
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:50,534
Leo A. Sacco, Jr., 227 Elm Street, Medford, Chief of Police.

927
01:44:52,236 --> 01:44:54,137
I'm sorry, I don't mean to belabor your meeting.

928
01:44:54,177 --> 01:44:59,320
I know you're almost ready to move on to the next topic, but a few things were mentioned tonight that I have to clear up.

929
01:44:59,941 --> 01:45:04,283
I'm concerned about the people who are at home watching this and thinking that Medford is not a safe city.

930
01:45:05,884 --> 01:45:09,006
First and foremost, Medford is a very safe city.

931
01:45:09,426 --> 01:45:11,047
It's a very welcoming community.

932
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:18,052
All you have to do is look at the real estate transfers and see what the prices are for the homes that are being sold in the city.

933
01:45:18,532 --> 01:45:20,713
People want to move to this community.

934
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:21,894
People want to live here.

935
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:25,601
people like this community because it is a safe community.

936
01:45:26,602 --> 01:45:35,105
I don't have the statistics with me this evening, but I can tell you this, that our crime rate in this, in this city is much lower than our surrounding communities.

937
01:45:35,806 --> 01:45:38,167
And that's one of the reasons why people want to live here.

938
01:45:38,767 --> 01:45:44,369
The low crime rate is directly related to the hard work of the men and women of the Medford police department.

939
01:45:45,029 --> 01:45:46,370
But beyond that,

940
01:45:47,628 --> 01:46:01,427
It's due to the work of the residents that live in the city, all residents that live in the city that are willing to call and report a crime, report a suspicious activity, report that they've been involved in, they've been the victim of a crime.

941
01:46:01,957 --> 01:46:06,321
And that's one of the things we're concerned about as a police department, that we don't want to stifle that.

942
01:46:06,781 --> 01:46:18,992
We want everyone to feel comfortable to come forward to the police, to report being a victim of a crime, to report what they may have seen in other criminal actions, which will help us to keep the city safe.

943
01:46:19,912 --> 01:46:26,836
Now it was said earlier by some members that were before this rail that the police department is being told what to do.

944
01:46:27,797 --> 01:46:29,678
Police department is not being told what to do.

945
01:46:30,138 --> 01:46:34,841
Police department is following the same practice and procedure that we've followed for many years.

946
01:46:35,642 --> 01:46:39,424
I've been a police officer 36 years in the city, 27 of them as chief.

947
01:46:40,064 --> 01:46:41,125
Nothing has changed.

948
01:46:42,065 --> 01:46:46,367
We do the same thing today that we did pretty much 36 years ago.

949
01:46:46,987 --> 01:46:51,069
So my entire career, we've been following the same practice and procedure.

950
01:46:51,509 --> 01:46:57,832
I can tell you that I very rarely asked anyone if they were a citizen of the United States.

951
01:46:58,552 --> 01:47:03,614
But if I put the handcuffs on someone and arrested them, there's a procedure that we follow.

952
01:47:04,455 --> 01:47:05,575
They come to the station.

953
01:47:06,216 --> 01:47:06,956
They are booked.

954
01:47:07,956 --> 01:47:09,737
In the booking, we get all their information.

955
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:11,658
They are fingerprinted.

956
01:47:11,977 --> 01:47:13,999
The fingerprints go to the FBI.

957
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,921
FBI shares them with other entities.

958
01:47:16,941 --> 01:47:20,644
So it goes to the state, then it goes to the FBI and they share it with the other entities.

959
01:47:21,605 --> 01:47:27,229
And sometimes it can be 10 minutes, sometimes it can be two hours, sometimes it can be as much as a day.

960
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:35,096
We'll get something back saying that that person is not who they say they are because all arrests are backed up by fingerprints.

961
01:47:36,693 --> 01:47:41,657
And that's the only time we really know when someone may be in this country illegally.

962
01:47:41,717 --> 01:47:44,179
They may have been deported before and sent back.

963
01:47:44,879 --> 01:47:46,341
And there isn't anyone in this room.

964
01:47:46,421 --> 01:47:54,387
There isn't anyone in the city, anyone in the state or anyone in the country that doesn't want to see violent criminals arrested and dealt with regardless of their status.

965
01:47:55,268 --> 01:48:00,492
And I can assure you that they're not running loose because the Medford police are being sloppy or they're ignoring something.

966
01:48:01,052 --> 01:48:04,615
If they're, if they're out there, there's maybe some other glitch in the works.

967
01:48:05,077 --> 01:48:06,678
but it isn't the part of the police department.

968
01:48:06,718 --> 01:48:08,400
We make the arrests that need to be made.

969
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:25,353
Sometimes I can tell you that it hasn't happened, at least in this past year, but I can tell you since probably November when the elections happened and January when that administration took office, the fear factor rose.

970
01:48:28,235 --> 01:48:31,698
It's probably because of all of the rhetoric about immigration enforcement.

971
01:48:32,469 --> 01:48:36,672
But nothing changed over the past several years or from the past several years.

972
01:48:37,072 --> 01:48:39,734
Everything we do is the same as what we did before.

973
01:48:40,975 --> 01:48:47,679
And we check everyone that we arrest and they go to Somerville District Court.

974
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:53,863
If ICE calls us and said, we have a detainer for the person that you have, we don't hold them based on that detainer.

975
01:48:53,903 --> 01:48:56,125
We already had them under arrest for another charge.

976
01:48:57,119 --> 01:49:04,524
If they make bail or they end up being transported to Somerville District Court in the morning, ICE is told where those people will be.

977
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:06,005
And that's the extent of it.

978
01:49:06,085 --> 01:49:07,666
We do not serve as ICE agents.

979
01:49:09,348 --> 01:49:13,370
Civil immigration laws are primarily the responsibility of the federal government.

980
01:49:13,811 --> 01:49:21,556
It's been said we're not, we don't have the resources to go knock on doors and check statuses, nor do we really have the interest to do that.

981
01:49:21,956 --> 01:49:24,118
We just, what will we do if we found them?

982
01:49:24,653 --> 01:49:26,374
Would ICE be able to respond and help us?

983
01:49:26,415 --> 01:49:27,175
They probably would not.

984
01:49:28,496 --> 01:49:41,207
By the same token, we're not being deputized to work as ICE agents, but if they call us because they're in the middle of something, if it's an officer safety issue, yes, we'll go help them to make sure that they don't get hurt or that no one else gets hurt.

985
01:49:42,668 --> 01:49:48,714
But I can tell you, we have not had a situation in the city of Medford that resulted at least in an ICE detainer that I know of.

986
01:49:49,234 --> 01:49:52,397
We have made several arrests, major league drug dealers,

987
01:49:53,652 --> 01:50:06,397
And we've sought information for mice and in a couple of cases that were detained as issued, but those are serious criminal criminals, criminal element that's bringing poison into our community and they had to be dealt with.

988
01:50:06,457 --> 01:50:18,261
And I don't think anyone disagrees with that being done, but I don't want anyone in the public, anyone that's watching this or anyone in this room tonight to think that the Medford police are going easy on crime or easy on the immigration issue.

989
01:50:19,142 --> 01:50:22,343
We work within the realm that we're dealt dealt with and uh,

990
01:50:23,885 --> 01:50:25,706
We do the best that we can with what we have.

991
01:50:26,646 --> 01:50:33,488
No one is going to escape what needs to be done, but we're not going out there looking just for the civil violation.

992
01:50:33,528 --> 01:50:35,208
That's not our focus.

993
01:50:35,648 --> 01:50:39,809
I think everyone agrees that we have far more important things that we need to do.

994
01:50:39,869 --> 01:50:43,410
But getting back to the main issue, Medford is a safe city.

995
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:47,211
Whatever you want to call it otherwise, this is a safe city.

996
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:48,832
People come here and we have

997
01:50:49,775 --> 01:50:51,838
Great police officers out there doing a great job.

998
01:50:51,879 --> 01:50:53,762
We definitely need more.

999
01:50:55,063 --> 01:50:57,924
but we're only as good as the information we receive from the public.

1000
01:50:57,964 --> 01:51:02,464
So we want all segments of the, of the public, uh, documented, undocumented.

1001
01:51:02,484 --> 01:51:07,885
We want people coming forward to, uh, if they're a witness of a crime to come forward and tell us what they saw.

1002
01:51:08,205 --> 01:51:21,088
We don't want anyone to be quiet and we don't want a segment of the community to be victimized because they're in fear of coming forward that they'd be exposed that no doubt be a victim of robberies on a regular basis.

1003
01:51:21,188 --> 01:51:21,288
So,

1004
01:51:22,322 --> 01:51:23,162
Thank you for your time.

1005
01:51:23,202 --> 01:51:24,382
I just wanted to clear that up.

1006
01:51:24,422 --> 01:51:26,383
If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.

1007
01:51:26,403 --> 01:51:27,623
Thank you, Chief, for keeping us safe.

1008
01:51:28,283 --> 01:51:36,825
Name and address of the record, please.

1009
01:51:37,305 --> 01:51:40,705
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Massachusetts.

1010
01:51:41,325 --> 01:51:43,466
I have great respect for the Medford Police Department.

1011
01:51:43,486 --> 01:51:46,226
There are the majority are fine men and women.

1012
01:51:47,106 --> 01:51:50,087
I was videotaping them up at Montvale Plaza.

1013
01:51:51,783 --> 01:51:56,466
But I respectfully disagree with our police chief, because I don't feel very safe in this city.

1014
01:51:57,646 --> 01:52:04,930
Behind my house, a man was brutalized and murdered on Salem Street, his head beaten in so badly his brains were splattered.

1015
01:52:05,931 --> 01:52:08,952
I see so much traffic problems.

1016
01:52:08,992 --> 01:52:11,714
I've seen so many car accidents outside my window as I'm typing.

1017
01:52:12,174 --> 01:52:17,437
I saw a guy in the street on Salem Street, and I've had to get two restraining orders on people.

1018
01:52:17,817 --> 01:52:20,839
The police didn't help me at all, not the fine good men and women.

1019
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:27,405
But for political reasons, I had to go get a four-year restraining order on someone who was coming to my home and threatening me.

1020
01:52:28,006 --> 01:52:47,023
So no, when I read in the paper that an MBTA cop doesn't get a breathalyzer, but eight days later, I'm in criminal court because people are lying about me, or if I get assaulted outside of these doors by someone in this room, and the police don't do a proper investigation, but I have to spend thousands of dollars in court to find out that people lied about me.

1021
01:52:47,623 --> 01:52:49,004
No, this isn't a safe city.

1022
01:52:49,365 --> 01:52:51,406
You have the haves and the have-nots.

1023
01:52:51,727 --> 01:52:59,253
And if you're outspoken, as I am, and you try to better your city, which I have tried to do, I have been beaten, I've been harassed, and I've been threatened.

1024
01:52:59,853 --> 01:53:01,995
And Police Chief Sacco has not helped me at all.

1025
01:53:02,456 --> 01:53:04,157
So shame on you, Police Chief Sacco.

1026
01:53:04,237 --> 01:53:07,900
I'm a victim, and you hung me out to dry, Chief.

1027
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,863
And your own son didn't even get a breathalyzer.

1028
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,321
Thank you.

1029
01:53:22,846 --> 01:53:26,674
Records of the meeting of October 10, 2017 were passed to Councilor Night.

1030
01:53:26,995 --> 01:53:28,638
Councilor Night, how did you find those records?

1031
01:53:41,349 --> 01:53:47,838
On the motion by Councilor Knight to accept the minutes as amended, although seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

1032
01:53:47,858 --> 01:53:48,479
All those in favor?

1033
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:50,181
Motion passes.

1034
01:53:51,503 --> 01:53:54,787
Motion by Councilor Dela Russo to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1035
01:53:54,807 --> 01:53:55,508
All those in favor?

1036
01:53:57,111 --> 01:53:58,673
Motion passes, meeting adjourned.

1037
01:57:45,316 --> 01:57:47,178
OK, I'll do it, but I don't really want to.

1038
01:57:48,059 --> 01:57:55,446
Now, clearly, in the book, it's presidential politics, but presidential character, I suppose, perhaps an imaginary kind of long ago.

1039
01:57:55,887 --> 01:58:03,455
But no one in the current context, I assume, could avoid seeing certain parallels with the current inhabitant of the White House.

1040
01:58:03,775 --> 01:58:05,497
Did George Saunders bring this up at all?

1041
01:58:05,537 --> 01:58:06,538
Was he interested in that?

1042
01:58:06,778 --> 01:58:13,963
Yes, I mean, obviously he started writing it four years ago and I don't think he would have been hoping that Donald Trump would become president.

1043
01:58:13,983 --> 01:58:15,464
Let's be totally blunt about that.

1044
01:58:15,664 --> 01:58:18,386
But he's a journalist, as I say, at the posh end of journalism.

1045
01:58:19,147 --> 01:58:24,550
The New Yorker asked him to report on Donald Trump as he was then a candidate.

1046
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:35,218
He told me that he set off on the US publicity trail for this book, however, just after Donald Trump had entered the White House, with some claim to be a bit of an expert, of course, on Donald Trump.

1047
01:58:35,578 --> 01:58:48,996
and he told me that the, broadly speaking, unhappy young people, unhappy with the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House, actually found some kind of succour, some kind of comfort in discussing with him his new book and talking about it.

1048
01:58:49,568 --> 01:58:51,709
And we did 28 cities in 30 days.

1049
01:58:52,149 --> 01:58:59,033
And it was so therapeutic for me, you know, to get in front of a crowd of, my audience skews a little young in the States, so kind of heartbroken young people.

1050
01:58:59,133 --> 01:59:01,675
And we just talked it out, you know, during the readings.

1051
01:59:01,775 --> 01:59:08,879
And I thought it was really wonderful to have Lincoln in our minds, but also to have a work of art that was weird and strange and hard.

1052
01:59:09,019 --> 01:59:10,280
It was refreshing for me to have done it.

1053
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:12,181
And I think it was refreshing for us to talk about that.

1054
01:59:13,055 --> 01:59:15,457
Now, Vincent, you've read the book, I presume.

1055
01:59:15,737 --> 01:59:17,199
OK, is it good?

1056
01:59:17,319 --> 01:59:18,159
Would you like it?

1057
01:59:18,299 --> 01:59:22,163
I mean, ridiculous question, but you've read it, and I think you're probably the only one in the studio who has.

1058
01:59:22,403 --> 01:59:24,265
No, no, no, it's a perfectly fair question.

1059
01:59:24,345 --> 01:59:29,429
And not everything I read for The Man Booker, or whatever the topic of the day may be, I really love.

1060
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:31,831
Actually, George Sanders said something

1061
01:59:32,111 --> 01:59:52,389
absolutely honest I think he's terribly nice guy terribly honest guy in his press conference he said lots of people have been telling him they get to page 30 or so and then think they can't take not the topic but the way it's written and it's written in a strange way a very very short paragraphs not entirely but as I flick through in this not radiophonic way you see it's written in

1062
01:59:53,470 --> 02:00:10,398
paragraphs of two three sentences he told me he was slightly influenced by thinking about Twitter and he's been trying to write like this for a while so if you can get past that and I have to say I did have to force myself sometimes you know it's nice if you have to read a novel for work you don't have any alternative so you've got to get on with it

1063
02:00:10,638 --> 02:00:14,480
And I would say, to be honest, about 50 pages in, I began to click with it.

1064
02:00:14,801 --> 02:00:18,563
And the underlying story is deeply emotional and very engrossing.

1065
02:00:18,823 --> 02:00:22,885
And strangely enough, there is, well, maybe not strangely enough, there is talk of a film.

1066
02:00:23,226 --> 02:00:25,247
I actually think it would make a magnificent play.

1067
02:00:25,267 --> 02:00:29,029
Because it's a bit like dialogue, as well as being a bit like Twitter.

1068
02:00:29,349 --> 02:00:33,592
But actually, he's taken an option, so to speak, on his own novel.

1069
02:00:33,952 --> 02:00:36,774
And they're now trying to turn it into a movie.

1070
02:00:37,654 --> 02:00:41,216
Well, we do happen to have a real live Texan in the studio, at no extra expense.

1071
02:00:41,256 --> 02:00:43,877
So, Andy, first of all, I mean, you haven't read this, have you?

1072
02:00:43,897 --> 02:00:44,077
No, no.

1073
02:00:44,417 --> 02:00:46,658
But we're talking about this as if it really matters.

1074
02:00:46,698 --> 02:00:49,920
I mean, does the Man Booker Prize matter in America?

1075
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,261
No, that's an exactly right question.

1076
02:00:53,581 --> 02:00:55,482
And I can't claim George Sanders.

1077
02:00:55,602 --> 02:00:57,683
He's an Amarillo, which is kind of up in the panhandle.

1078
02:00:57,743 --> 02:00:58,763
I'm from Fort Worth.

1079
02:00:59,284 --> 02:01:00,224
But he's a Texan.

1080
02:01:00,244 --> 02:01:00,564
That's great.

1081
02:01:02,285 --> 02:01:12,988
When I heard about this, and when I heard we were going to be talking about it, I texted my brother about eight times, and I said, hey, Joe, does this lead you to reading it as an English teacher?

1082
02:01:13,188 --> 02:01:15,469
He teaches ninth graders English in America.

1083
02:01:15,509 --> 02:01:17,689
I said, does it lead your kids to buy the book?

1084
02:01:17,809 --> 02:01:21,631
Does it mean that Saunders Sales will grow in the United States?

1085
02:01:22,491 --> 02:01:26,392
He said, look, the sticker on the book makes everyone want to read it.

1086
02:01:26,892 --> 02:01:28,234
Really, that actually does make a difference.

1087
02:01:28,254 --> 02:01:28,996
That's what my brothers told me.

1088
02:01:29,036 --> 02:01:35,066
So I said, okay, sort of my follow up to my brother, does it mean anything for English teachers?

1089
02:01:35,106 --> 02:01:38,952
Does it mean that you're actually going to change your reading list based on a prize?

1090
02:01:39,943 --> 02:01:42,845
He said no.

1091
02:01:42,925 --> 02:01:48,888
So they're not going to get, Saunders isn't going to get contracts with schools necessarily, certainly not next year or in a couple of years.

1092
02:01:49,428 --> 02:01:50,209
But it'll help his sales.

1093
02:01:50,489 --> 02:01:51,149
Oh, without a doubt.

1094
02:01:51,670 --> 02:01:52,310
And I think you're right.

1095
02:01:52,330 --> 02:01:57,573
I think you see, I mean, you see the different sort of stickers on the books and it's like, oh, this won an award.

1096
02:01:57,633 --> 02:01:58,714
It's probably pretty good.

1097
02:01:58,814 --> 02:02:02,116
And Man Booker certainly has a reputation in the U.S.

1098
02:02:02,256 --> 02:02:06,558
Well, Simon, does it have a reputation in Singapore or around where you hang around in Asia?

1099
02:02:06,578 --> 02:02:09,100
I mean, do people, are people impressed at all by these kind of things?

1100
02:02:10,695 --> 02:02:14,279
I don't think that's a topic that's going to come up very much today, I'm sorry to say.

1101
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:22,128
And I have to confess, I haven't read the book either, although it does actually look very interesting, and it looks very contemporary too.

1102
02:02:22,689 --> 02:02:30,878
But would booksellers, you know, you go into a bookshop in Singapore, would you see plastered over it, Man Booker, and would people read it, buy it on that basis, do you think?

1103
02:02:32,029 --> 02:02:35,754
A small number would, I mean the story of bookshops in Singapore is not a happy one.

1104
02:02:36,875 --> 02:02:40,080
You know, the largest and best bookshop closed down some years ago.

1105
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:45,787
We've only really got one bookshop of any size, which is an English bookshop, which in a country of six million people is a bit sad.

1106
02:02:46,448 --> 02:02:47,709
That's surprising, isn't it, really?

1107
02:02:47,849 --> 02:02:56,853
But, I mean, given, obviously, it's a Commonwealth, well, it's recognised by a lot of Commonwealth authors, you might think, perhaps, that it's more impressive in that sort of way, but perhaps not.

1108
02:02:57,973 --> 02:02:59,714
Actually, it's an interesting thing in this.

1109
02:02:59,754 --> 02:03:06,697
Let me come back to you on this, Vincent, because this is a prize that has been opened up to Americans, as we said, only very recently, and they are dominating it.

1110
02:03:06,837 --> 02:03:07,497
Is that a problem?

1111
02:03:08,078 --> 02:03:11,400
Three out of six this year are American.

1112
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:13,080
It's a huge industry.

1113
02:03:13,221 --> 02:03:14,841
It sells an enormous amount of books.

1114
02:03:15,742 --> 02:03:27,969
And also, it indicates the way that I think the book industry is going, that titles and prizes mean an awful lot, especially as people are buying on, let's be honest, Amazon and that kind of thing.

1115
02:03:28,209 --> 02:03:30,090
These kind of labels do help.

1116
02:03:30,310 --> 02:03:30,810
make a difference.

1117
02:03:30,830 --> 02:03:31,330
Well, there we are.

1118
02:03:31,931 --> 02:03:32,771
It's a good book.

1119
02:03:32,831 --> 02:03:33,351
We've said that.

1120
02:03:33,371 --> 02:03:35,392
We've got the authentication for that from Vincent.

1121
02:03:35,692 --> 02:03:37,113
It's sitting on the desk in front of him there.

1122
02:03:37,553 --> 02:03:38,454
I'm going to have a go.

1123
02:03:38,834 --> 02:03:40,555
Thanks to all of you for listening.

1124
02:03:40,595 --> 02:03:41,555
Thanks to all of you being here.

1125
02:03:41,575 --> 02:03:43,636
We've had quite a crowded studio tonight.

1126
02:03:43,716 --> 02:03:46,197
Thanks to Simon over there in Singapore and Andy here.

1127
02:03:46,517 --> 02:03:47,438
That's it from Business Matters.

1128
02:03:47,538 --> 02:03:47,978
Back tomorrow.

1129
02:03:48,098 --> 02:03:48,318
Bye-bye.

1130
02:03:54,474 --> 02:04:00,498
This is the BBC World Service, where we're looking for solutions to the problem of domestic violence.

1131
02:04:01,259 --> 02:04:03,981
100 women on the BBC World Service.

1132
02:04:04,281 --> 02:04:15,349
The domestic violence will always happen if the men keep thinking that they have the right to hit the woman, and if the wife keep thinking that they deserve to be hit by the man.

1133
02:04:15,629 --> 02:04:17,030
Behind closed doors.

1134
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:21,673
Listen to the whole series at bbcworldservice.com slash 100 women.

1135
02:04:25,222 --> 02:04:27,563
You're listening to the BBC World Service.

1136
02:04:54,605 --> 02:04:58,348
Hello, at 1 o'clock GMT, welcome to the newsroom from the BBC World Service.

1137
02:04:58,428 --> 02:04:59,148
I'm Ben Bland.

1138
02:04:59,709 --> 02:05:03,191
The Chinese Communist Party's National Congress begins in Beijing.

1139
02:05:03,351 --> 02:05:06,714
Big leadership changes are expected in President Xi's top team.

1140
02:05:07,715 --> 02:05:09,936
The Islamic State group has been driven out of Raqqa.

1141
02:05:09,976 --> 02:05:14,379
We hear from inside the Syrian city where US-backed militia have defeated them.

1142
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:21,845
A bunch of SDF armoured vehicles came and did a symbolic drive around the roundabout, flying their flags.

1143
02:05:22,569 --> 02:05:26,491
where three years ago Islamic State had done the same thing, flying its black flags.

1144
02:05:27,071 --> 02:05:32,474
Just hours before President Trump's new travel ban was due to come in, a judge in Hawaii has blocked it.

1145
02:05:32,534 --> 02:05:34,635
We'll explain why and what happens next.

1146
02:05:35,115 --> 02:05:44,559
Also coming up... For me, it was just hearing the story that he had gone into the crypt of his son, and I sort of had a little bit of a mental image of Lincoln holding the body in a graveyard at night.

1147
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:52,143
The American author George Saunders, who's just won the Man Booker Prize for his novel about President Lincoln grieving over the death of his son.

1148
02:05:54,884 --> 02:05:57,045
I'm Stuart McIntosh with the BBC News.

1149
02:05:57,105 --> 02:05:57,425
Hello.

1150
02:05:58,205 --> 02:06:01,406
China's ruling communists are about to begin their party congress.

1151
02:06:01,646 --> 02:06:06,587
Security has been tightened across China ahead of the gathering which takes place once every five years.

1152
02:06:07,227 --> 02:06:11,348
China's President Xi Jinping is expected to set out his future priorities.

1153
02:06:11,648 --> 02:06:13,109
Robin Brandt is in Beijing.

1154
02:06:13,953 --> 02:06:24,357
Thousands of the Communist Party's most senior figures will come together here at the Great Hall of the People in a rainy Tiananmen Square to witness a week of authoritarian theatre.

1155
02:06:24,678 --> 02:06:34,542
Xi Jinping will open proceedings with a speech that assesses the promises made five years ago and, more importantly, points to the priorities for China going forward.

1156
02:06:34,822 --> 02:06:36,963
Much of it will need to be decoded.

1157
02:06:37,443 --> 02:06:43,049
He will be confirmed for another term at the top but there is a crucial transition going on here.

1158
02:06:43,390 --> 02:06:50,178
Most of the senior leadership are retiring and many in the level underneath will be replaced too after elections.

1159
02:06:51,144 --> 02:06:57,566
A US judge has largely blocked the latest version of President Trump's travel ban, hours before it was due to come into force.

1160
02:06:58,126 --> 02:07:06,508
The ban, announced last month, targets travellers from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, North Korea, and certain individuals from Venezuela.

1161
02:07:06,889 --> 02:07:07,889
Peter Bowes reports.

1162
02:07:08,729 --> 02:07:17,776
Judge Derek Watson, sitting in Hawaii, has stepped in to block the implementation of the ban with respect to all of the countries except North Korea and Venezuela.

1163
02:07:18,256 --> 02:07:25,041
The state of Hawaii had argued that federal immigration law did not give the administration the authority to impose the restrictions.

1164
02:07:25,602 --> 02:07:36,890
Judge Watson said the policy lacked sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.

1165
02:07:37,751 --> 02:07:40,332
The White House called the ruling dangerously flawed.

1166
02:07:41,092 --> 02:07:50,456
The Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, has said the results of Sunday's gubernatorial elections have sent a strong message to the United States and its allies.

1167
02:07:51,036 --> 02:08:00,059
Mr Maduro said the unexpected victories of his candidates in 17 of the 23 regions showed the Venezuelan people couldn't be cowed by an economic war.

1168
02:08:01,445 --> 02:08:14,896
The President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has called on the country's parliament to decide whether the government should remain in office, following what he said were grave failings in the handling of recent deadly forest fires.

1169
02:08:15,176 --> 02:08:17,858
More than 100 people have died in less than four months.

1170
02:08:18,438 --> 02:08:20,340
Alison Roberts has the details.

1171
02:08:21,015 --> 02:08:26,157
Portugal's president is a largely ceremonial figure but does have the power to dissolve Parliament.

1172
02:08:26,417 --> 02:08:32,380
In Oliveira do Hospital, one of the areas ravaged by the recent fires, he met and comforted victims' families.

1173
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:40,523
Then he spoke out, calling for action to ensure that citizens are never again abandoned to their fate as so many were this time.

1174
02:08:40,883 --> 02:08:49,347
Parliament, he said, must clarify whether it wants the government to stay on or it will lack a mandate to enact urgent reforms in forestry and civil defence.

1175
02:08:50,492 --> 02:08:52,873
This is the World News from the BBC.

1176
02:08:54,393 --> 02:09:02,935
The Iraqi Prime Minister has called for talks with Kurdish leaders to resolve the crisis that's followed last month's independence referendum in the country's Kurdish areas.

1177
02:09:03,416 --> 02:09:11,878
Haider al-Abadi was speaking after government forces took control of two Kurdish strongholds and all oil production facilities in the region of Kirkuk.

1178
02:09:13,203 --> 02:09:23,187
The chief of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, has resigned after reports that he harassed a producer and ignored allegations of sexual assault by the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein.

1179
02:09:23,848 --> 02:09:30,771
His resignation follows a series of tweets by the American actress Rose McGowan addressed to the head of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.

1180
02:09:31,291 --> 02:09:35,773
She said Mr. Price had repeatedly ignored her complaints of rape by Mr. Weinstein.

1181
02:09:36,253 --> 02:09:39,395
The film producer denies all claims of non-consensual sex.

1182
02:09:39,695 --> 02:09:41,816
There's been no comment from Mr. Price.

1183
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:44,349
Discussions over U.S.

1184
02:09:44,389 --> 02:09:53,117
proposals to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement have been extended into next year amid continuing differences between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

1185
02:09:53,937 --> 02:09:56,600
After a fourth round of talks in Washington, the U.S.

1186
02:09:56,700 --> 02:10:02,565
Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he hoped to be able to rebalance the agreement.

1187
02:10:03,025 --> 02:10:07,049
Ministers from Mexico and Canada suggested there were limits to what they could accept.

1188
02:10:08,459 --> 02:10:14,743
The American author George Saunders has won this year's Man Booker Prize, a prestigious British literary award.

1189
02:10:15,304 --> 02:10:23,369
Mr Saunders won for his first full novel, Lincoln in the Bardo, which follows the US President's grief over the death of his son in 1862.

1190
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:27,172
Here's our arts correspondent, Rebecca Jones.

1191
02:10:27,612 --> 02:10:29,393
Lincoln in the Bardo, George Saunders.

1192
02:10:31,055 --> 02:10:34,337
Your Royal Highness, readers and writers, it's all downhill from here.

1193
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:38,883
George Saunders accepting one of the biggest prizes in publishing.

1194
02:10:39,603 --> 02:10:45,528
His book's starting point was a real moment in history when President Lincoln's beloved son died.

1195
02:10:46,248 --> 02:10:54,555
George Saunders decided to tell the story through more than 100 ghosts stuck in the Bardo, a Tibetan state between life and death.

1196
02:10:55,876 --> 02:10:59,539
Hello, you're listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service with me, Ben Bland.

1197
02:11:00,649 --> 02:11:04,910
It's an event that happens once every five years and decides China's future.

1198
02:11:05,151 --> 02:11:12,933
Major leadership changes are expected at the very highest levels of the Communist Party, which is holding its 19th National Congress in Beijing.

1199
02:11:13,493 --> 02:11:18,775
President Xi Jinping has just opened the gathering with a speech to more than 2,000 delegates.

1200
02:11:19,235 --> 02:11:19,755
Let's have a listen.

1201
02:11:19,955 --> 02:11:27,458
Syria say they've taken control of the city of Raqqa, which so-called Islamic State once claimed as the capital of its caliphate.

1202
02:11:29,213 --> 02:11:35,957
Unfortunately, we haven't quite got the link to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

1203
02:11:36,198 --> 02:11:40,020
That is something we'll return to a little later.

1204
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:43,022
But President Xi has been speaking at the Great Hall of the People.

1205
02:11:43,042 --> 02:11:52,328
There's little doubt among most people that he'll secure a second term as General Secretary of China's Communist Party, which is the most powerful position within the one-party state.

1206
02:11:52,988 --> 02:12:01,159
But it's thought that Mr Xi could also use the Congress to lay the groundwork for extending his leadership beyond the year 2022, which is when he's meant to retire.
