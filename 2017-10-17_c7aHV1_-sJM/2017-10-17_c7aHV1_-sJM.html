    <p>[Scafoe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1038.037s">Testing,</a>  1, 2, 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1038.698s">Good?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1038.898s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1042.06s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1061.735s">Motion</a>  to revert back to the region of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1065.717s">Meeting</a>  is now back in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1070.72s">17-711</a>  offered by Councilor Lococoon being resolved that the city solicitor's office looks into making sure the rice pond will remain open to Bedford residents only after a grant was received from the Massachusetts office of coastal zone management. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1085.789s">Councilor</a>  Lococoon.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1087.69s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1091.34s">My</a>  attention was drawn to an article that was in the transcript last week by a concerned Medford resident with regards to us thankfully getting a grant from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1105.323s">I</a>  think obviously it's a grant that we're going to put to good use, but the resident, and I'm sure a number of residents who frequent the pond, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1115.7s">who</a>  fought last year to make sure it remained open to only Medford residents are now making, want to make sure that that's still going to be the case if we do accept and use this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1126.367s">I</a>  believe it's a valid question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1128.929s">I</a>  would assume and hope that this definitely will stay open to just Medford residents, but maybe we could get a report back just to confirm that and to put residents' minds at ease. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1139.716s">I</a>  think that would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1141.937s">I</a>  know we have the solicitor here right now, but I don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1144.907s">answer</a>  such a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1147.769s">I'm</a>  sure you're not ready to answer it, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1151.713s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1154.375s">And</a>  before Rose called the last resolution was with regards, there was a number of people complaining to, um, the pitcher of the council meeting last Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1165.364s">And</a>  we spoke about Councilor Marks and I spoke about, um, the complaints we received and hopefully we can get that fixed and get the whole system, which we've been asking for fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1174.915s">Um,</a>  in the near future, because for some reason, sometimes the city council meetings are not being, and no fault of anybody doing the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1183.381s">Um,</a>  but it just needs to be updated because the complaints were rolling in on Tuesday with regards to the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1189.585s">So</a>  I move approval on this resolution and, um, ask for my colleagues support.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1194.829s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1195.77s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, uh, this is the first I've heard of the city receiving a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1198.812s">Could</a>  the councilor tell us a little bit about what this grant is? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1202.354s">Councilor</a>  Locren. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1203.355s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1203.515s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1205.464s">In</a>  the Medford transcript, it's a rain garden coming to Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1209.946s">The</a>  city of Medford is constructing a rain garden at the Middlesex Falls Pond that will help filter out pollutants, including phosphorus, nitrogen, suspended solids, and bacteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1221.85s">It</a>  will also be designed to conserve water. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1225.951s">So</a>  it's a project they're gonna do in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1228.832s">The</a>  rain garden project will cost the city a total of $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1233.697s">and</a>  is a match project for $125,000 grant that Medford received from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1241.601s">I</a>  can go into more detail, there's another few paragraphs, but it was on page A3 of the Medford transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1248.644s">The</a>  rain gutter will contain plants that soak up phosphorus, nitrogen from rainwater before it flows into Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1259.649s">I</a>  think it seems like a natural way to remove <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1265.2s">Obviously</a>  chemicals from the pond, so anything we have with regards to a grant to be able to do this I think is extremely important, especially I have another resolution on where the article does mention some concerning things as well, but I think the rain garden is definitely a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1281.787s">It's</a>  only going to help better the pond, especially for the hundreds of kids that swim in that pond every summer.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1290.25s">point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1291.171s">Councilor</a>  Dela Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1292.232s">Mr.</a>  President, are we talking about, uh, item number 17 7 1 1 or 1 1 at the moment? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1295.896s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1296.137s">And</a>  the vote is to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1304.537s">remain</a>  open to residents only after a grant was received. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1308.378s">And</a>  the solicitor will... I don't quite understand the semantics of the resolution and I don't know if we should base our... We are waiting for an opinion from the solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1322.063s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1322.703s">He</a>  will give us an opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1324.164s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1324.784s">Councilor,</a>  do you want to vote on 17711? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1325.984s">I</a>  move approval of the question, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1328.425s">17711,</a>  but just to respond, I'm not really sure what the confusion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1332.066s">Sometimes</a>  when you get a state or federal grant, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1334.327s">It</a>  changes the parameters of how we operate, so we are making sure that the hundreds of families that use it from Medford, it remains only Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1342.797s">This</a>  was a big issue back about a year ago when some of the law was looked into and they were potentially going to be opening it up to non-Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1352.335s">the</a>  city will kind of... Thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1354.116s">You</a>  are correct Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1356.017s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn on 17.7.1.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1358.859s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[Tannenhouse]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1362.621s">Roll</a>  call.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1363.241s">Roll</a>  call has been requested Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1370.906s">Councilor</a>  Dela Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1373.688s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1375.118s">7</a>  in the affirmative, none in the negative.</p>

    <p>[Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1379.726s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1392.236s">17</a>  7 1 2 offered by council and go current be a resolve that the energy environment office update the Medford city council as to why the city does not test rights pawn for certain pollutants that could be caused by runoff of snow of plowed piles of snow near right near the pond in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1409.881s">Be</a>  a further resolve that once the rain gun is put in place, right spawn will be tested for such pollutants before opening in the summer of 2018 council Lungo current.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1419.753s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1421.494s">I</a>  wanted to bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1423.075s">I</a>  had a second resident email me with regards to the same article. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1426.838s">In</a>  the second part of the article, it mentions how the city stores plowed snow on Rice Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1436.645s">And</a>  residents have grown increasingly concerned about pollutants in the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1442.729s">And</a>  then our energy and environment director said because the city <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1447.515s">City</a>  stores plowed piles of snow near the pond in the winter, which runs into the pond when it melts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1453.78s">This</a>  is a way for the runoff to get clean, treated, and filtered naturally. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1457.362s">Hopefully</a>  the rain guards will help that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1459.524s">But</a>  it says we've tested what is there, but there's a perception that there's bad stuff running off in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1465.388s">So</a>  a resident who does frequent the pond called me, also asked me to reference the article, and it is concerning that we're putting plowed snow there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1474.713s">So</a>  my next, this resolution and the next has to do with figuring out if we can maybe do it another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1483.977s">If</a>  we have runoff, there's a number of different things that are coming off the snow within the snow that are being stored at Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1491.56s">Maybe</a>  we should look into it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1493.681s">And</a>  if this is a problem, then we can hopefully store the snow somewhere else because we want to make sure that we're keeping the pond as safe and clean as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1505.419s">I</a>  know that a resident was interested in the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1509.901s">I'm</a>  not sure if I can name him, but did reach out to the director of the Mystic River Watershed Association, who thought that piling up snow and allowing it to run into the pond is a poor choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1525.506s">So</a>  I think this is just something that definitely needs to be looked into. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1530.365s">If</a>  we have piled snow that can be put somewhere else, I think we need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1534.646s">So</a>  if we could have a response from our energy and environment office with regards to if there's been any testing, if so, what type of testing and when, that would be extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1546.688s">And</a>  if we haven't, then maybe we should see how the rain garden goes once it's implemented, then potentially do some testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1554.51s">That's</a>  obviously not my forte, but if we could kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1559.335s">figure</a>  out what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1560.515s">I</a>  will be much appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1562.736s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1563.076s">Council</a>  on the motion by council and go current seconded by councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1567.957s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1569.378s">Motion</a>  passes 17 seven one three offered by council local current. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1573.859s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford city council be provided a list of all places that plowed snow is stored during the winter months. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1581.181s">Council</a>  on go current.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1582.588s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1583.769s">If</a>  we could just have the Department of Public Works and or the administration let the City Council know where snow is, is kept when we take it off our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1592.654s">I</a>  think that just goes hand in hand with the prior resolution to try to make sure we're storing it in the right place.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1598.917s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1599.378s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Lueb-Curran, seconded by Councilor Scott Peli. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1603.92s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1783.527s">Mr.</a>  President, I resent the fact that South Medford has been singled out as a place for rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1790.05s">Secondly,</a>  I want to thank always the Department of Public Health, which has been proactive over the years in <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1800.837s">an</a>  urban area where rats are part of the landscape, but that does not mean we have to suffer their incursions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1808.983s">So</a>  thank you to the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1811.645s">We've</a>  suffered an uptick in their activity over the summer months because of some of the work done on the Green Line Extension Project, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1822.552s">It</a>  is no doubt that the work done in the Wellington area has certainly moved some of them, and that may be exacerbated as we're entering the winter months and our little furry friends are looking for a place to bed down for the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1837.656s">So</a>  I hope that the Board of Health will not only exercise their own discretion in this matter, but urge the contractors in the area who are required <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1849.159s">to</a>  bait and monitor to step up their efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1853.403s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1975.809s">So,</a>  uh, Mr. President, this Saturday I was at car park and, um, I had a number of residents that were attending a birthday party in the taut lot come up to me and said, do you realize when you're coming up Fulton street, uh, that you, where the street branches off that, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1992.742s">There's</a>  no indication that you're going into an actual parking lot, which is car park and cars are still going at the same clip as if they were on Fulton street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2002.956s">And</a>  it really is a very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2006.081s">Um,</a>  their suggestion, which I think is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2008.824s">And</a>  I know we have the chief here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2010.666s">uh,</a>  would be to put at least some, uh, warning signs that you're entering a parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2015.368s">This</a>  is no longer a road. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2017.409s">And</a>  secondly, uh, I'd like to see a race crosswalk, but I know we have those, uh, movable, uh, speed bumps that the city is putting around the community, uh, in a way to chief, would you mind coming up? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2033.494s">We'd</a>  like to put you on the spot chief.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2038.977s">Chief,</a>  name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2046.784s">Just</a>  if you could address, do you know what I'm talking about when you come up, Fulton? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2050.006s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2050.867s">Is</a>  there a way that we could kind of address maybe some signage and possible speed bump? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2057.232s">I</a>  know race crosswalk is expensive.</p>

    <p>[Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2060.663s">Yeah,</a>  the raised crosswalk issue is somewhat out of my control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2064.605s">We</a>  can recommend, but we can't force it to happen because of the cost factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2069.086s">Of</a>  course, the temporary speed bump is doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2073.028s">I'll</a>  speak with Mr. Kevins to see if there are any available. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2076.589s">Signage</a>  is the simple thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2077.93s">We</a>  can post that area that technically there's no outlet. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2083.578s">when</a>  they go straight and a lot of times when cars are coming straight up Fulton, they just go straight and they think they can connect with the rest of Fulton and they can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2091.265s">So</a>  post it at that end and then, you know, the speed limit, the posting for children playing playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2100.633s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2101.214s">So</a>  those, the signage piece is simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2104.316s">The</a>  other piece of the crosswalk, the speed bump takes a little more effort.</p>
