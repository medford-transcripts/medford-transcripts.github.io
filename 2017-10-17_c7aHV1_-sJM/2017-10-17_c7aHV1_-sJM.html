    <p>[Scafoe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1038.037s">Testing,</a>  1, 2, 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1038.698s">Good?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1038.898s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1042.06s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1061.735s">Motion</a>  to revert back to the region of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1065.717s">Meeting</a>  is now back in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1070.72s">17-711</a>  offered by Councilor Lococoon being resolved that the city solicitor's office looks into making sure the rice pond will remain open to Bedford residents only after a grant was received from the Massachusetts office of coastal zone management. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1085.789s">Councilor</a>  Lococoon.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1087.69s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1091.34s">My</a>  attention was drawn to an article that was in the transcript last week by a concerned Medford resident with regards to us thankfully getting a grant from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1105.323s">I</a>  think obviously it's a grant that we're going to put to good use, but the resident, and I'm sure a number of residents who frequent the pond, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1115.7s">who</a>  fought last year to make sure it remained open to only Medford residents are now making, want to make sure that that's still going to be the case if we do accept and use this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1126.367s">I</a>  believe it's a valid question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1128.929s">I</a>  would assume and hope that this definitely will stay open to just Medford residents, but maybe we could get a report back just to confirm that and to put residents' minds at ease. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1139.716s">I</a>  think that would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1141.937s">I</a>  know we have the solicitor here right now, but I don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1144.907s">answer</a>  such a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1147.769s">I'm</a>  sure you're not ready to answer it, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1151.713s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1154.375s">And</a>  before Rose called the last resolution was with regards, there was a number of people complaining to, um, the pitcher of the council meeting last Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1165.364s">And</a>  we spoke about Councilor Marks and I spoke about, um, the complaints we received and hopefully we can get that fixed and get the whole system, which we've been asking for fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1174.915s">Um,</a>  in the near future, because for some reason, sometimes the city council meetings are not being, and no fault of anybody doing the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1183.381s">Um,</a>  but it just needs to be updated because the complaints were rolling in on Tuesday with regards to the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1189.585s">So</a>  I move approval on this resolution and, um, ask for my colleagues support.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1194.829s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1195.77s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, uh, this is the first I've heard of the city receiving a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1198.812s">Could</a>  the councilor tell us a little bit about what this grant is? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1202.354s">Councilor</a>  Locren. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1203.355s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1203.515s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1205.464s">In</a>  the Medford transcript, it's a rain garden coming to Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1209.946s">The</a>  city of Medford is constructing a rain garden at the Middlesex Falls Pond that will help filter out pollutants, including phosphorus, nitrogen, suspended solids, and bacteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1221.85s">It</a>  will also be designed to conserve water. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1225.951s">So</a>  it's a project they're gonna do in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1228.832s">The</a>  rain garden project will cost the city a total of $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1233.697s">and</a>  is a match project for $125,000 grant that Medford received from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1241.601s">I</a>  can go into more detail, there's another few paragraphs, but it was on page A3 of the Medford transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1248.644s">The</a>  rain gutter will contain plants that soak up phosphorus, nitrogen from rainwater before it flows into Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1259.649s">I</a>  think it seems like a natural way to remove <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1265.2s">Obviously</a>  chemicals from the pond, so anything we have with regards to a grant to be able to do this I think is extremely important, especially I have another resolution on where the article does mention some concerning things as well, but I think the rain garden is definitely a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1281.787s">It's</a>  only going to help better the pond, especially for the hundreds of kids that swim in that pond every summer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1290.25s">point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1291.171s">Councilor</a>  Dela Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1292.232s">Mr.</a>  President, are we talking about, uh, item number 17 7 1 1 or 1 1 at the moment? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1295.896s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1296.137s">And</a>  the vote is to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1304.537s">remain</a>  open to residents only after a grant was received. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1308.378s">And</a>  the solicitor will... I don't quite understand the semantics of the resolution and I don't know if we should base our... We are waiting for an opinion from the solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1322.063s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1322.703s">He</a>  will give us an opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1324.164s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1324.784s">Councilor,</a>  do you want to vote on 17711? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1325.984s">I</a>  move approval of the question, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1328.425s">17711,</a>  but just to respond, I'm not really sure what the confusion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1332.066s">Sometimes</a>  when you get a state or federal grant, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1334.327s">It</a>  changes the parameters of how we operate, so we are making sure that the hundreds of families that use it from Medford, it remains only Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1342.797s">This</a>  was a big issue back about a year ago when some of the law was looked into and they were potentially going to be opening it up to non-Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1352.335s">the</a>  city will kind of... Thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1354.116s">You</a>  are correct Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1356.017s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn on 17.7.1.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1358.859s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[Tannenhouse]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1362.621s">Roll</a>  call.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1363.241s">Roll</a>  call has been requested Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1370.906s">Councilor</a>  Dela Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1373.688s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1375.118s">7</a>  in the affirmative, none in the negative.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1379.726s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1392.236s">17</a>  7 1 2 offered by council and go current be a resolve that the energy environment office update the Medford city council as to why the city does not test rights pawn for certain pollutants that could be caused by runoff of snow of plowed piles of snow near right near the pond in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1409.881s">Be</a>  a further resolve that once the rain gun is put in place, right spawn will be tested for such pollutants before opening in the summer of 2018 council Lungo current.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1419.753s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1421.494s">I</a>  wanted to bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1423.075s">I</a>  had a second resident email me with regards to the same article. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1426.838s">In</a>  the second part of the article, it mentions how the city stores plowed snow on Rice Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1436.645s">And</a>  residents have grown increasingly concerned about pollutants in the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1442.729s">And</a>  then our energy and environment director said because the city <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1447.515s">City</a>  stores plowed piles of snow near the pond in the winter, which runs into the pond when it melts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1453.78s">This</a>  is a way for the runoff to get clean, treated, and filtered naturally. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1457.362s">Hopefully</a>  the rain guards will help that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1459.524s">But</a>  it says we've tested what is there, but there's a perception that there's bad stuff running off in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1465.388s">So</a>  a resident who does frequent the pond called me, also asked me to reference the article, and it is concerning that we're putting plowed snow there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1474.713s">So</a>  my next, this resolution and the next has to do with figuring out if we can maybe do it another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1483.977s">If</a>  we have runoff, there's a number of different things that are coming off the snow within the snow that are being stored at Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1491.56s">Maybe</a>  we should look into it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1493.681s">And</a>  if this is a problem, then we can hopefully store the snow somewhere else because we want to make sure that we're keeping the pond as safe and clean as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1505.419s">I</a>  know that a resident was interested in the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1509.901s">I'm</a>  not sure if I can name him, but did reach out to the director of the Mystic River Watershed Association, who thought that piling up snow and allowing it to run into the pond is a poor choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1525.506s">So</a>  I think this is just something that definitely needs to be looked into. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1530.365s">If</a>  we have piled snow that can be put somewhere else, I think we need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1534.646s">So</a>  if we could have a response from our energy and environment office with regards to if there's been any testing, if so, what type of testing and when, that would be extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1546.688s">And</a>  if we haven't, then maybe we should see how the rain garden goes once it's implemented, then potentially do some testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1554.51s">That's</a>  obviously not my forte, but if we could kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1559.335s">figure</a>  out what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1560.515s">I</a>  will be much appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1562.736s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1563.076s">Council</a>  on the motion by council and go current seconded by councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1567.957s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1569.378s">Motion</a>  passes 17 seven one three offered by council local current. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1573.859s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford city council be provided a list of all places that plowed snow is stored during the winter months. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1581.181s">Council</a>  on go current.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1582.588s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1583.769s">If</a>  we could just have the Department of Public Works and or the administration let the City Council know where snow is, is kept when we take it off our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1592.654s">I</a>  think that just goes hand in hand with the prior resolution to try to make sure we're storing it in the right place.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1598.917s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1599.378s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Lueb-Curran, seconded by Councilor Scott Peli. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1603.92s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2046.784s">Just</a>  if you could address, do you know what I'm talking about when you come up, Fulton? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2050.006s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2050.867s">Is</a>  there a way that we could kind of address maybe some signage and possible speed bump? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2057.232s">I</a>  know race crosswalk is expensive.</p>

    <p>[Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2060.663s">Yeah,</a>  the raised crosswalk issue is somewhat out of my control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2064.605s">We</a>  can recommend, but we can't force it to happen because of the cost factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2069.086s">Of</a>  course, the temporary speed bump is doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2073.028s">I'll</a>  speak with Mr. Kevins to see if there are any available. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2076.589s">Signage</a>  is the simple thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2077.93s">We</a>  can post that area that technically there's no outlet. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2083.578s">when</a>  they go straight and a lot of times when cars are coming straight up Fulton, they just go straight and they think they can connect with the rest of Fulton and they can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2091.265s">So</a>  post it at that end and then, you know, the speed limit, the posting for children playing playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2100.633s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2101.214s">So</a>  those, the signage piece is simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2104.316s">The</a>  other piece of the crosswalk, the speed bump takes a little more effort.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2490.359s">They</a>  should feel secure in their ability and power to give of themselves outside of politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2497.525s">Yes,</a>  to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2499.807s">Now,</a>  there is the way to serve the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2504.651s">The</a>  incumbents must get out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2510.285s">We</a>  have one mayor and seven councils and they stay for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2517.207s">Each</a>  Councilor is paid $30,000 a year, which is more than $750 for each meeting like this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2527.411s">But</a>  we have 36,000 registered voters and many of them would be happy to serve without compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2537.574s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2539.912s">because</a>  they are, by nature, generous people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2544.674s">We</a>  must urge our voters to vote out the career politicians, to drain the Medford morass, and to vote in the outsiders, because the People's City Council, now listen carefully to this, has been co-opted by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2564.221s">Yes,</a>  as I see it, the school committee infiltrates <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2568.874s">and</a>  then runs the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2571.315s">This</a>  is a case of the tail wagging the dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2577.098s">Let</a>  me explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2578.719s">The</a>  mayor is chairman of the school committee and is compensated for that position in the school committee budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2587.003s">A</a>  majority of the city council has connections with the school committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2592.865s">Some</a>  have relatives on the school payroll now <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2598.314s">and</a>  another school committee member may be elected to the city council this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2602.336s">Having</a>  finished seventh in the primary elections, the city council votes to accept the school budget as it is presented by the superintendent schools and the school committee each June of the year without making any significant changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2620.105s">We</a>  just don't know where the school committee ends and the city council begins. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2627.412s">No</a>  one favors education more than I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2630.994s">All</a>  of my fulfillment and the fulfillment of my four children is due to education. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2636.656s">But</a>  our school committee, which also rules the city, does not educate. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2643.419s">The</a>  school budget compensates all of them very, very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2648.742s">The</a>  cost to the city of Bedford is probably $13,000 a year for each enrolled student. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2656.991s">That's</a>  very high. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2659.512s">And</a>  yet, the record is regrettable. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2665.156s">Our</a>  next generation must be saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2668.318s">We</a>  must serve all the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2672.8s">We</a>  must vote out the incumbents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2677.363s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2685.38s">17-714</a>  petition by Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, to address the council on the issue of becoming a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2697.945s">Before</a>  Councilor Penta, I'm sorry, my former councilor gets up, I'd like to read something that the city council passed unanimously in November of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2708.589s">Dear</a>  Mr. President and city councils, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2713.203s">Whereas</a>  the strength of our nation is derived from its history of diversity that has enriched our community with a variety of cultures, faith, traditions, and viewpoints. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2724.245s">And</a>  whereas the city of Medford is a community that welcomes and values the very racial and ethnic makeup of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2732.806s">And</a>  whereas the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups and newcomers as they pursue the American dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2741.288s">And</a>  whereas the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2743.274s">will</a>  work to model our city as a safe and welcoming place that equally encourages all to speak, seek personal advancement, and to reside in peaceful consentment and method. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2754.459s">And</a>  the safe method rejects all words and acts of hate, indifference, and intolerance that undermine our neighbors, communities of faith, and our schools, and thwart the promise of equal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2770.227s">Whereas</a>  our nation was founded <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2773.115s">on</a>  the fundamental principles that all persons are entitled to equal protection of law, equal opportunity, and the enjoyment of civil and human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2783.439s">Now,</a>  therefore, the city of Medford proudly supports the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and the collaboration of race in Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2795.784s">And</a>  signed, Mayor Stephanie Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2798.926s">And</a>  this was passed on a seven to zero, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2803.308s">Motion</a>  by the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2805.129s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2806.831s">Robert</a>  Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2813.676s">I</a>  come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2826.145s">At</a>  the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tudin for propelling this issue <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2831.714s">before</a>  our citizens of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2834.415s">Since</a>  this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2847.181s">To</a>  me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council, the school committee, take a position on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2857.449s">Because</a>  isn't it weird, when we think about our America today, and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League, or little Pop Warner kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2875.734s">And</a>  our culture seems to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2879.355s">But</a>  where are we going with all of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2881.396s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2882.496s">Sanctuary</a>  City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2886.778s">Central</a>  folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2896.962s">And</a>  what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2909.821s">But</a>  that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2918.967s">And</a>  as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2931.756s">If</a>  you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2937.7s">I</a>  think the word before all, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2939.83s">an</a>  immigrant should be legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2941.791s">All</a>  legal immigrant groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2944.051s">Because</a>  we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2949.533s">Its</a>  foundation is built on laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2952.014s">And</a>  it's on the legality of what we do each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2955.535s">And</a>  it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2969.155s">We're</a>  giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2973.497s">But</a>  the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2981.141s">You</a>  know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2992.607s">It</a>  says, all lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2996.315s">Everybody's</a>  lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2998.617s">White,</a>  black, blue, green, I don't care what nationality you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3002.46s">If</a>  you're here in this country, and you're here legally, or you have the proper legal documents, earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3011.847s">And</a>  for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3020.586s">We</a>  as a community are very generous to so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3024.389s">You</a>  members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding, and if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Medford, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3046.085s">You've</a>  also seen monies go to legal, council, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3050.216s">for</a>  people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3059.158s">We</a>  also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3068.241s">And</a>  while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3076.423s">And</a>  I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3080.219s">presents</a>  that particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3082.541s">Like</a>  I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3086.983s">Sanctuary</a>  cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3096.99s">And</a>  they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3104.775s">Now,</a>  in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3109.591s">It</a>  stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3122.019s">But</a>  inclusive of those crimes, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3125.196s">There</a>  was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014 drunk driving charges to individuals that did not have a license. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3131.558s">There</a>  were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3152.065s">What</a>  does that say to the law abiding citizen? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3154.887s">But</a>  more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3161.69s">Who</a>  especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3169.214s">You</a>  can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3175.064s">It</a>  has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3190.393s">And</a>  that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be here legally, but that I can arrest and imprison. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3197.977s">And</a>  that's really not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3200.609s">There's</a>  a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3206.651s">He</a>  came from Levone, Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3209.112s">And</a>  he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3214.134s">And</a>  he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old, strike that, his four-year-old daughter and his 22-month-old son. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3223.017s">The</a>  illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3231.283s">a</a>  two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3237.404s">The</a>  woman, subsequent to that, has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation, because she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that, and the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic, she now becomes the culprit and not the victim. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3260.455s">These</a>  are just little nuances. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3262.236s">We</a>  can go to the entire country. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3264.318s">There</a>  are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3272.303s">And</a>  that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3273.364s">Absolutely</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3276.386s">When</a>  we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3283.071s">They</a>  go to our quality schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3285.352s">They</a>  get free housing and free food. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3287.614s">But</a>  they don't choose to blend in <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3289.653s">by</a>  learning English and assimilating to our American culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3294.835s">And</a>  further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in, it adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3313.123s">So</a>  the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3318.615s">I</a>  haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3322.816s">Just</a>  one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3330.099s">I</a>  commend him for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3331.119s">He</a>  took his position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3333.26s">It's</a>  a very important issue to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3337.961s">Because</a>  if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3346.365s">resolution,</a>  well, this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3351.129s">Either</a>  we are or we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3354.292s">And</a>  I think you councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3359.656s">And</a>  the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against, in a common level headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3371.752s">And</a>  that's where I think we need to be going here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3375.515s">You</a>  know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3381.379s">It</a>  says we are a welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3382.88s">We've</a>  always been a welcoming committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3384.661s">We've</a>  got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3391.326s">And</a>  slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3395.129s">The</a>  cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3398.872s">Makes</a>  no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3400.868s">And</a>  if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3408.572s">You</a>  can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3412.474s">And</a>  Dr. Stirella was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3413.995s">Your</a>  finances will be so out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3416.656s">And</a>  if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3422.399s">And</a>  please let the people know as a candidate for office that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3428.729s">Mr.</a>  Panto, we're running, you're running over your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3430.931s">That</a>  was a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3432.432s">I</a>  think this is a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3434.154s">You</a>  know, we have a 10 minute timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3436.156s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3436.996s">There</a>  are other people that will let you speak.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3441.36s">I</a>  think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3450.615s">should</a>  tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3457.244s">That's</a>  their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3481.161s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Tudin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3482.662s">Hi,</a>  my name is Curtis Tudin. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3484.364s">I</a>  live at 340 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts, and I'm here to speak in support of Medford pursuing sanctuary city status or any initiative that makes it clear that this is a community that is welcoming and safe for all residents, regardless of immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3500.496s">So</a>  there is a lot of reasoning behind that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3503.639s">It's,</a>  I also agree that it's an important topic that people need to take a stance on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3508.323s">I</a>  commend the city council for their statement from last November. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3512.247s">Um,</a>  it definitely got a point across that you were trying to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3516.07s">I</a>  commend the mayor and the police chief for, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3520.163s">expressing</a>  and assuring me in different conversations and other residents that Medford doesn't practice the tactics that are what sanctuary city status tries to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3532.289s">But</a>  all of that is great to practice, but it's one of those rare problems where we actually have to preach what we practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3541.334s">So</a>  that shouldn't be too difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3543.175s">If</a>  we're already a city that does all these great things, we need to be clear in stating <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3549.298s">that</a>  we are a sanctuary city status or we are a safe community, whatever the title may be, it's up to the community to decide that particular label. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3557.544s">But</a>  we need something that's clear so that all residents in the community can understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3563.729s">Specifically,</a>  as an employee of Bedford Public Schools, I see on a regular basis when immigrant families come into the building and because they don't speak English, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3574.077s">And</a>  because of the culture of fear that is added on to by all the statistics that were read, even though it is documented that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than ordinary legal Americans, every day these families come into the Medford Public Schools and they're afraid to make eye contact because they don't know where that may lead, whether it's with an authority figure, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3601.788s">or</a>  with a teacher or anybody, even another student. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3605.79s">I</a>  wish, as someone who doesn't speak another language, that I could hand them a piece of paper in any language that clearly explains that being part of Medford Public Schools is a right of all students and that in this building, or really in all city buildings, you shouldn't feel discriminated against or in danger in any way, whether that's in a classroom or talking to a police officer or talking to a firefighter, going to an emergency room, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3629.46s">all</a>  these essential aspects of just being a human being that a city should be able to provide without a culture of fear that is unfortunately sweeping across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3639.786s">So</a>  for Medford to stand up and label itself what I will ultimately see as the right side of history, then I think now is the appropriate time to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3649.472s">So</a>  thank you for listening and I appreciate everybody coming out and contributing to the conversation.</p>

    <p>[Wolfson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3667.712s">My</a>  name is Kevin Wolfson, 159 Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3671.275s">Thank</a>  you for welcoming the public and the chance to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3678.44s">I'm</a>  a participant in a group called Safe Medford that many of you have heard from. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3683.343s">The</a>  mission of our group is to advocate for <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3686.112s">all</a>  people in Medford, regardless of their immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3689.138s">And</a>  I know many of you, I hope, have seen our website, safemedford.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3694.989s">If</a>  you haven't, I hope that you will take the time to look through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3697.557s">And</a>  you'll notice that we don't use the term sanctuary city because it is often connected to statistics like Mr. Pinto was citing, and this sort of kind of building of fear that is not what we're about, not what we're intending, and that we feel distorts the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3714.829s">So</a>  the term that we use is safe communities, but regardless of what the term is, our goal is to pass a set of policies, and these are policies that are used across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3728.618s">that</a>  are supported by police organizations and sheriffs across the country that clarify how the police does and does not work with federal immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3740.526s">The</a>  Homeland Security Department, which is what ICE is part of, is, if I recall correctly, the second largest, second most heavily, second biggest funded <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3752.755s">It's</a>  either second or third in the entire country. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3755.497s">They</a>  have no lack of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3758.358s">They</a>  are extremely well-funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3760.42s">They</a>  have all of the money they need to do the work that they are supposed to do, and that all of us will agree is important work. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3768.53s">The</a>  Medford Police Department, the city of Medford, clearly from statements of people so far tonight, clearly is not nearly as well funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3777.273s">The</a>  Medford Police Department doesn't have enough police officers, according to many people, and I have no doubt about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3785.737s">The</a>  police station itself is in disrepair, and I know that there is the welcome push to build a new police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3793.84s">And</a>  a large part of why we're asking for what we're asking for is so that the limited resources of Medford aren't co-opted by a very well-funded national organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3804.912s">It's</a>  about protecting, in one way, about protecting Medford's rights to be an independent community that decides what to do with its own resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3813.756s">That's</a>  one thing I wanted to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3814.856s">The</a>  other thing that I wanted to point out is the discussion of legality and illegal and legal immigrants and that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3825.86s">I</a>  want to point out that immigration offenses are civil offenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3829.702s">They</a>  are not criminal offenses, and they are often connected to criminal offenses with statistics, again, like Mr. Pinto was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3837.805s">But</a>  that is not what we're getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3840.647s">We're</a>  getting at people who are at various stages of immigration documentation not being treated like criminals for what is a civil offense in the same way that a speeding ticket is a civil offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3855.117s">Like</a>  Mr. Tootin just said, immigration status has no correlation to people being more violent. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3865.807s">There</a>  are plenty of ways that you can pick statistics that make it seem like that's the case, and it's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3872.196s">And,</a>  again, I hope you'll look at the safemetford.org website, where we explain that more clearly and more thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3879.466s">Finally,</a>  I want to point out that cities that have these policies, I mentioned earlier that police organizations and sheriffs across the country support policies like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3891.196s">Cities</a>  that have these policies are economically stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3894.939s">They</a>  are statistically safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3898.021s">And</a>  the reason for that is that people who might be at risk of being targeted by ICE don't feel like they're afraid to call the police if they see a crime or if they are a victim of a crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3911.168s">And</a>  that makes all of us safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3913.71s">So,</a>  again, thank you for the chance to speak.</p>

    <p>[Stott]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3925.393s">Maria</a>  Stott, 122 Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3929.374s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3930.495s">Thank</a>  you all for the opportunity to be here, and thank you for serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3934.216s">This</a>  is a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3936.056s">I'd</a>  like to give you just a few facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3939.237s">I</a>  am a lifetime member of the NAACP. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3943.198s">I</a>  am a member of Safe Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3945.819s">Before</a>  I give you four facts, I want to say that my husband was an immigrant, and my in-laws were immigrants, and the thought <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3955.481s">of</a>  my child coming home from school one day and her grandmother or her dad not being there is insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3968.147s">Less</a>  than 3% of 11 million undocumented residents have been convicted of felonies compared to 6% of the general population. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3981.334s">Undocumented</a>  residents are ineligible <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3985.95s">for</a>  programs like SNAP and TANF and non-emergency Medicare, yet they pay into our social security system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3998.875s">It's</a>  true, some new immigrants, newly arrived immigrants do go to our public schools, but second and third generation immigrants stimulate our economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4010.88s">Unauthorized</a>  people, undocumented people, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4015.506s">pay</a>  about $12 billion a year in state and local taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4020.989s">And</a>  this is cited from 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4022.49s">Immigrants</a>  with little English and limited job skills do the jobs that Americans often don't want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4033.956s">We</a>  are a richer society when we are an inclusive society. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4042.04s">And</a>  I really want people to <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4044.728s">seek</a>  understanding, and then to be understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4048.711s">There</a>  is a difference between undocumented individuals and criminals who have broken federal and state laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4059.517s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4067.982s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4070.424s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4071.564s">I'm</a>  Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4075.526s">Over</a>  the centuries of this nation, we've always welcomed immigrants to the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4082.67s">Me,</a>  personally, I encourage more immigration to the United States, especially if it's from countries that oppress their people in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4093.997s">But</a>  we do have a supreme law of the land, and it is the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4098.24s">Constitution.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4099.641s">And</a>  under the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4100.521s">Constitution,</a>  there are laws that govern <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4103.553s">how</a>  one becomes a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4106.696s">For</a>  a city to automatically dictate what the police can or can't do in terms of immigration questions undermines the very reason it makes this country good to come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4122.83s">You're</a>  subverting the Constitution, which for centuries has helped a lot of people come from <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4129.494s">impoverished</a>  or oppressive nations to come here and build a much better life. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4135.257s">One</a>  of the things I want to talk about is the cost of illegal immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4141.079s">While</a>  it's true that the last speaker said it's something like $12 billion that they're putting back into the economy, at the same time, a year, it's $135 billion that's coming out for the cost of illegal immigration to the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4157.726s">On</a>  the state level, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4159.969s">Among</a>  the 50 states, it's $88 billion a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4163.972s">At</a>  the federal level, it's $45 billion a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4166.995s">So</a>  the costs coming in don't even come close to the cost going out in terms of prison upkeep, schools, hospital, all sorts of things that these costs rise on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4184.93s">I</a>  don't think that for a city like Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4189.269s">for</a>  a group like Safe Medford to come along. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4192.273s">And</a>  this has nothing to do with building fear or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4198.641s">It's</a>  a matter of respect for the law in becoming a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4205.28s">It's</a>  an affront, in my opinion, to the many millions of people who have come here the legal way, to all of a sudden just basically grant amnesty, which is essentially what this is, by dictating to the police that, quite frankly, I don't think the city council has <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4223.562s">really</a>  the experience to tell police officers what their policy should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4230.808s">And</a>  under the guise of the feel-good appeal to the emotions of making Medford a welcoming city, like Mr. Penta said, we've always been a welcoming city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4242.417s">I'll</a>  leave you with this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4245.779s">Is</a>  Medford being a welcoming city by <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4250.185s">basically</a>  subverting the rule of U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4252.508s">constitutional</a>  law by not enforcing it, by policy, or would we be a welcoming city by doing something very simple that this city does not do? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4263.682s">When</a>  a new resident or a new business <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4266.145s">comes</a>  to this city to open shop or to live here, Medford does not send them a welcome packet saying, here's where Wright's Pond is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4274.934s">Here</a>  are some discount coupons to the Chevalier Theater or to Carol's Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4281.921s">Here</a>  are the city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4283.043s">Here's</a>  when we pick up trash in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4286.106s">That's</a>  a welcoming city? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4288.688s">It's</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4289.861s">But</a>  circumventing the laws governing immigration under the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4295.566s">Constitution</a>  is? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4297.347s">I</a>  beg to differ. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4298.208s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[van drop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4306.127s">My</a>  name is Rachel van drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4307.688s">I</a>  live at 19 Fulton street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4309.328s">Um,</a>  I am a part of safe Medford and I've also been a part of, uh, the people power as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4315.31s">And</a>  I would just like to clarify, um, that we have not been dictating what the police should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4320.792s">We</a>  have been asking them to put their current policies in writing so that that can be used to ensure people that they are not going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4330.815s">treated</a>  in such a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4331.855s">We're</a>  not saying do this, we're saying we appreciate that you are doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4336.317s">As</a>  things are, please put it in writing so that it can be clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4340.678s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Munir Jirmanus]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4351.962s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4353.002s">I'm</a>  Munir Germanus. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4354.703s">I</a>  live at 3 Summit Road, and I appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4359.451s">the</a>  opportunity to address this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4363.734s">I</a>  am a naturalized citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4366.376s">My</a>  wife and I became citizens primarily because we happen to be well educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4372.88s">We</a>  both have PhDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4375.562s">So</a>  it was very useful for various businesses to work and hire us. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4383.347s">There</a>  are many immigrants who unfortunately don't have that luxury and <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4389.306s">I</a>  think basically welcoming means welcoming for all and not welcoming just for the educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4400.032s">So</a>  I personally am quite in favor of having Medford and actually all of Massachusetts become a sanctuary city, just like the state of California. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4412.74s">And</a>  I would certainly urge all candidates running for office <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4418.638s">including</a>  you, ladies and gentlemen, to do the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4423.422s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4423.983s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4438.855s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4439.236s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4440.837s">Eileen</a>  Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4447.748s">For</a>  all of my adult life, I have worked with immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4452.29s">The</a>  past 25, I've been teaching English to adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4457.593s">I</a>  agree it's a good idea for immigrants to speak English. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4461.654s">Where</a>  are the programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4463.595s">Where</a>  is the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4465.736s">People</a>  come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4466.637s">They</a>  have to work hard to support their families, you know, and often they don't have cars, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4474.56s">maybe</a>  working two, three jobs and they don't have the time to learn English. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4480.173s">Sometimes</a>  when people are laid off from jobs they get <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4484.89s">So</a>  they get unemployment compensation, and part of the deal for that is that they take English classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4493.572s">I've</a>  had those kind of people, women who have been in this country for 25 years, never learned English, because they didn't have the opportunity, they didn't have the time, they didn't have the money, but when they were given it, they were so, so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4509.435s">to</a>  learn English. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4511.596s">So</a>  if we want people to learn English, we have to put more money into programs to teach them English, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4520.119s">And</a>  also, you know, the talking about immigrants and criminals is so deceptive because <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4530.413s">Immigrants</a>  and undocumented immigrants have a much, much lower rate of crime than American citizens do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4539.776s">Most</a>  of them are just too busy trying to survive and doing lots of jobs that Americans don't want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4548.226s">And</a>  who is it who decides who comes into the United States? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4553.69s">Isn't</a>  it a bunch of white men with privilege and power and money? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4558.953s">You</a>  know, who says that a woman from Honduras who's fleeing domestic violence and gangs can't come in?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4566.639s">Can</a>  we keep it down in the back? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4568.18s">There's</a>  someone who's speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4569.821s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4570.181s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4571.822s">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4573.523s">And</a>  to talk about the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4576.107s">But</a>  not to mention slavery, the legacy of slavery that we're living in. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4581.231s">To</a>  talk about disrespect to the country when we're not talking about all the numerous black people that we've seen slaughtered by white racism, by white supremacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4594.147s">And</a>  when people object to that, when people stand up and say this is wrong, or they take a knee or they protest, then the issue becomes the flag and not discrimination, not unjust killings. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4610.152s">It's</a>  so deceptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4613.613s">You</a>  know, my grandparents came here from Poland. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4618.155s">I</a>  wouldn't be alive if they hadn't been able to come here <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4622.876s">I</a>  appreciate the United States so much, and my life, and the life of my children, my grandchildren, and my new great-grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4632.604s">And</a>  I want the same rights for other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4636.007s">I've</a>  met these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4637.408s">They're</a>  good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4638.489s">They</a>  contribute to our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4640.952s">They</a>  do a lot of jobs that other people don't want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4644.274s">I</a>  recently had hip replacement surgery. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4648.738s">And</a>  who were the people that were taking care of old people in this country but immigrants? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4654.161s">And</a>  believe me, I didn't ask them if they were documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4657.383s">I</a>  didn't care if they're documented or they're undocumented. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4661.365s">I'm</a>  glad they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4662.826s">I'm</a>  glad they're safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4664.367s">I'm</a>  glad they're contributing to our communities with their <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4669.19s">skills</a>  and their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4671.191s">I</a>  mean, right now, we've had an instance where down on the Cape, they had trouble staffing the hotels and the restaurants, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4680.416s">And</a>  people lost money down there because they didn't have enough immigrants like they used to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4687.14s">And</a>  in California, they're having trouble getting people picking the fruit and the vegetables, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4695.441s">You</a>  know, you may want to call them illegal or whatever you want to call them, but they've done a lot of work for our country, and they haven't been treated fairly a lot of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4706.705s">And</a>  I just want to stand and say, I support these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4710.526s">I</a>  think they contribute to our economy and to the richness of our culture, which isn't only white and Christian, but is multicultural. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4721.75s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hicks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4735.776s">Joanna</a>  Hicks, 15 Talbot Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4739.657s">I'm</a>  a fourth generation Japanese American and Filipino on my mother's side. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4745.478s">And</a>  some of you may know, during World War II, Japanese Americans were incarcerated, 120,000 of them, just on the basis of their national origin. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4759.2s">Some</a>  of the men of that generation went on to serve for the <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4763.14s">in</a>  the armed forces and became the most decorated unit in World War II, sent into some of the most dangerous missions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4770.483s">And</a>  I wanted to support safe communities in Medford and speak out that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, serve this country in the military as well as contributing to the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4787.651s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4799.218s">William</a>  graves, 69 Stanley Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4801.459s">Uh,</a>  I'm also a member of safe Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4805.0s">And,</a>  uh, in addition, I'm a, I'm an immigration lawyer and I've been practicing immigration law for about 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4811.641s">Um,</a>  I think that having Medford become a safe community and declaring itself a safe community is, is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4817.862s">And</a>  I think it promotes safety in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4820.203s">I</a>  don't think it subverts the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4821.663s">It</a>  certainly doesn't separate the federal law in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4824.824s">Um,</a>  immigration law, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4826.897s">isn't</a>  really constitutional law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4828.778s">It's</a>  statutory law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4830.319s">Congress</a>  basically has the power to make laws governing immigration, and it's enforced by the executive branch. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4839.485s">It's</a>  primarily civil law, as Kevin had pointed out earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4842.367s">Not</a>  much of it is criminal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4844.008s">So</a>  when people are here without documentation or expired documentation, they're here in a civil violation, not a criminal violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4853.715s">In,</a>  in recent months I think the climate of fear has greatly increased and I certainly see this in my practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4861.438s">I</a>  see, I get calls from parents who are afraid to send their kids, their US citizen kids to school because they're afraid that they may be questioned about the immigration status of one or both of their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4873.041s">And</a>  you know, I try to let them know that that's not the case and that won't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4877.863s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4878.953s">People</a>  are afraid to go out, and I think that people are afraid to call the police when they're a victim of a crime or if they witness a crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4885.897s">They're</a>  afraid to come to City Hall to complain about a landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4890.08s">And</a>  I think that creating a safe community and Medford declaring itself a safe community will make all residents, all members of our community, the people with whom we live, to feel welcome and to feel welcome to communicate with the police or with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4906.63s">That's</a>  all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4907.29s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4915.077s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4915.817s">Records,</a>  the meeting of October 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4924.161s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Tannenhouse]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4932.525s">Rachel</a>  Tannenhouse, 26 Pearl Street, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4936.126s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4938.427s">My</a>  name is Rachel and I am the granddaughter of refugees. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4945.279s">And</a>  yes, I am in favor of Medford being a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4950.26s">So</a>  you all can get a head start on snarking now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4954.161s">And</a>  my grandmother, who is 97, came here as a refugee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4961.143s">And</a>  I don't know, or I haven't really asked whether or not she got here legally, because I don't care, because I'm pretty happy to be alive, and also Hitler. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4975.04s">Frankly,</a>  if people are escaping genocide, I think that really that is a situation that I don't get to do a lot of judging about. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4984.722s">Now,</a>  I'm pretty sure that there are a number of people in the room who have studied their history. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4992.424s">So</a>  if you have done so, then you know that much of the rhetoric around immigrants today is <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=4998.089s">very,</a>  very similar to the rhetoric around Jewish refugees in the 1940s, late 1930s, early 1940s. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5007.672s">Really,</a>  really very similar, talking about crime rates, talking about loyalty to the country, talking about who are we really letting in, talking about who's a real American. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5017.856s">And</a>  I just want to make that really clear that a lot of people, some of whom are relatives of mine, died because of that sort of rhetoric. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5025.99s">I'm</a>  not really interested in a community where we let that happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5030.413s">One</a>  of the things we talk about, one of the things that we say is never again. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5034.696s">And</a>  I really feel that as a member of a community who, you know, every few years or so somebody pops up and tries to wipe us out, we've gotten really good at looking out for this kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5048.425s">Real</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5049.645s">We</a>  know it when we see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5052.6s">And</a>  I also feel like there have been some logical fallacies that have been going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5057.021s">For</a>  example, if you're really excited about the statement that all lives matter, then you have to believe that all lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5065.183s">And</a>  the question is, do they? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5068.324s">Or</a>  is it just the people that you decide matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5073.725s">You</a>  can't say, all lives matter, and then in the same breath say, but not yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5077.966s">Not</a>  these. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5079.267s">These</a>  do not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5081.434s">These</a>  can't be safe here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5083.376s">I</a>  also agree with the statement that, obviously, God forbid somebody in this room gets attacked or robbed or anything like that, and there's a witness who is undocumented. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5095.425s">You're</a>  on your own under these current circumstances because <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5100.326s">they're</a>  not going to get sent back to a place where somebody's trying to wipe them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5104.01s">And</a>  I should point out, by the way, that in my family, nobody ever asks my family if they are here legally because they pass because they're white and nobody cares and nobody stops and checks you if you're white. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5117.722s">So,</a>  you know, I think that when we also talk about who's here and who's getting checked and who's not, it's really clear that we only mean certain <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5126.474s">certain,</a>  even if you don't think you mean it, you really only mean certain subcategories of folks who are undocumented. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5134.55s">Also,</a>  I love how people who generally espouse small government are really okay with our police department being federalized and with the federal government telling our local police department what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5146.216s">That</a>  doesn't really follow logically. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5149.257s">What</a>  we are saying is that a federal agency cannot come in and commandeer our local police department and use their resources to do their work with a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5161.024s">And</a>  so my question again is, are you for small government or are you only for some small government? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5167.566s">And</a>  I also agree that I hear and I agree that our police department is severely overworked and under-resourced and not making a statement that the federal government can't come in and commandeer them and use them for their own purposes is simply adding to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5186.333s">And</a>  I hear a lot of people talking about how we have to make things easier <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5190.74s">for</a>  our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5192.341s">We</a>  have to hire more police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5193.961s">We</a>  need to build a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5195.882s">And</a>  if you believe those things, then why would you possibly believe that you would want to stretch their resources for things that aren't even being done by a local agency, that actually a federal agency is perfectly capable of doing themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5213.45s">I</a>  feel like this is a situation where we want to be on the right side of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5219.349s">Because</a>  my family has seen what the other side of history looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5223.931s">And</a>  it ain't pretty, and it killed a bunch of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5227.732s">And</a>  if you think anything different is going on in the countries that are specifically the numbers are being cut down on, if you think anything all that different is going on in Syria, if you think anything all that different is going on in Sudan, then maybe you haven't studied your history all that well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5246.16s">I</a>  hear Medford public schools are pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5247.901s">You</a>  should go take a class. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5252.046s">I</a>  just want to say that I can't see much, but I see you, Mr. Penta.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5260.609s">I</a>  see what people are doing.</p>

    <p>[Tannenhouse]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5265.95s">I</a>  see what the people who want to keep out immigrants are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5272.933s">And</a>  I know what was done to my family, and I know what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5277.774s">And</a>  I'm not going to sit here and let it happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5281.198s">So</a>  yeah, I am really, really in favor of all the candidates stating their position on this, because I want to know who to vote for and who not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5288.646s">And</a>  I think, actually, we're all in agreement about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5290.609s">We</a>  all want folks to make a statement on these things, because we know where we fall on this, and we want to know who to vote for. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5296.615s">So</a>  I think that's something we are all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5300.62s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5301.381s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5301.761s">Have</a>  a good evening.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5312.199s">My</a>  name is Anthony D'Antonio and I live on Yale street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5315.639s">And</a>  it's a pretty hot topic here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5319.08s">Um,</a>  but I'm going to tell you something right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5320.741s">You</a>  can take all the statistics, all the figures and everything, just throw them out the window because everybody skews statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5327.842s">But</a>  what's really aggravating is these people come up here and they say, well, my family did this and my family did this and I'm this and I'm that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5335.264s">We're</a>  all, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5336.257s">part</a>  of the same group. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5337.218s">We've</a>  all, in our families, every single one of us, have had people that have bled and died in fields far away from here, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5345.844s">But</a>  the thing that really aggravates me is if you notice the tone, it only took a matter of 10 minutes before we got into white privilege, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5353.931s">We're</a>  responsible for everything in this world that goes wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5356.873s">Well,</a>  I'm sick and tired of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5358.454s">You</a>  can't legislate behavior on somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5361.46s">Everybody,</a>  I don't understand this culture of fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5365.681s">I</a>  haven't seen that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5367.642s">This</a>  city, Medford, was more diverse than it is now when I was growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5372.684s">And</a>  everybody, that's right, they are immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5374.985s">We're</a>  all immigrants here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5376.645s">And</a>  there's all ways to come in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5378.486s">But</a>  what they're doing is they're making it very divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5381.187s">Because</a>  it's them against people that have a different point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5385.488s">So</a>  if you have a different point of view, you're on the wrong side of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5389.19s">Well,</a>  that's a bunch of baloney. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5391.539s">So</a>  I just want to tell you that nobody is saying you can't come here or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5398.221s">But</a>  if you take a real good look at it, we've had a botched up immigration system for years here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5404.282s">And</a>  now a certain political group has found out that by catering and offering to illegals that they've created their own voting block for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5416.546s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5417.186s">And</a>  I'm just sick and tired of everybody being blamed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5421.633s">When</a>  other people, you know, is this safe, Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5424.194s">You're</a>  insinuating that Medford is not safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5426.655s">Medford</a>  is safe, and the police should be commended for what they're doing with what they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5432.778s">So</a>  just think before they speak over here, because I'm getting really aggravated about this nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5437.621s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5437.861s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5849.278s">Okay,</a>  Eileen Lerner, 9 Adams Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5853.304s">When</a>  I talked about rich and privileged people, I wasn't talking about you, Mr. Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5858.505s">I</a>  was talking about the people that write the immigration laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5862.026s">I</a>  was talking about the people who decide to put Japanese people into concentration camps. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5868.828s">The</a>  people who decide whether people come in from certain countries and not from certain other countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5875.89s">I</a>  was not talking about you, Mr. Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5879.847s">But</a>  the fact is, you have to realize that white supremacy has been in control in this country, and that it is under attack now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5892.253s">And</a>  that is a fact, whether you want to face it or not.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5896.655s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5902.717s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5903.157s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Kroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5904.978s">My</a>  name is Shelly Kroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5906.199s">I</a>  live at 8 Boylston Terrace in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5909.295s">I've</a>  been a Medford resident for about 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5911.999s">I'm</a>  also a labor attorney in Boston and the granddaughter of immigrants, as probably most of us here are. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5920.11s">My</a>  grandparents were fortunate because when they fled violence in Russia, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5926.027s">immigration</a>  laws were much less restrictive than they are today, and they really didn't have to go through too much scrutiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5933.03s">Those</a>  of us who follow the law knows that laws change very frequently when political administrations change. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5941.053s">And</a>  with regard to immigration laws, when we talk about undocumented immigrants, many of the people who are undocumented were legal when they came to this country, but the status changes as the law changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5954.4s">We</a>  have Haitian immigrants who may be losing their protected status. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5958.382s">We</a>  have the DACA dreamers who were raised in this country and who had been promised a road to citizenship and who are now in peril. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5968.027s">So</a>  it's not only the immigrants that are fleeing violence, as our grandparents did, but immigrants who came here legally who can now find themselves undocumented and at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5978.993s">And</a>  that's just one point I want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5981.206s">Then</a>  secondly, I very much applaud the speaker who talked about having a business and working hard to establish a business that employs good immigrant workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5990.869s">Most</a>  of our grandparents worked very hard so that those of us who followed them could go to school, become professionals, pursue businesses, work with our hands, whatever it took. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6002.694s">But</a>  what I can tell you from my labor practice is that there are a lot of companies who are unscrupulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6009.232s">And</a>  they employ undocumented immigrants in order to keep wages low, in order to violate safety laws, and to imperil all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6017.519s">It's</a>  that kind of competition that lowers the bar in a community like Medford and other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6023.585s">And</a>  as long as you have immigrant workers who are in fear of complaining and reporting crimes or complaining about safety violations, you stand at risk that that <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6035.205s">is</a>  going to bring down the standard of living of everybody in our community.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6048.013s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6049.093s">Robert</a>  Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6050.834s">I'll</a>  try to be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6053.156s">I</a>  don't know anybody from my side of this issue <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6057.776s">who</a>  doesn't want to see Medford become a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6061.039s">I</a>  didn't hear a single one of them say they oppose immigration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6064.783s">In</a>  fact, I started out when I first spoke saying I encourage immigration, especially from other countries where there's oppression or just subpar standing living standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6082.819s">It's</a>  difficult to embrace this issue on so many levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6088.844s">But</a>  I really think it's, I mean, people want to come up here and say that, you know, just saying that the reasons why we're for honoring the law is somehow related to the Nazis or white privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6106.377s">And</a>  then they want to say that the statistics we bring up are fear-mongering. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6113.289s">It's</a>  just a little hypocritical, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6116.115s">I</a>  also want to address the point of <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6118.937s">being</a>  for limited government, but also being for a police force in Medford that's not a full force. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6129.246s">It</a>  has nothing to do with limited government. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6132.328s">It</a>  has everything to do with government's first duty, in my opinion, which is protection of the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6137.933s">We</a>  are about 30 officers insufficient on our police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6145.038s">In</a>  the current policy of not <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6147.521s">ask</a>  an immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6149.163s">If</a>  that's what the police department now deems fit, then that's what I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6154.77s">But</a>  make no mistake, what the policy for the Safe Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6161.36s">group</a>  is, is to actually put into law, taking away any possibility of police asking, should the question arise about immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6174.946s">You</a>  know, it was actually President Obama who put forward the secured community program <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6180.708s">which</a>  Massachusetts never actually signed on to, which automatically, if there was any question of immigration status, that fingerprints and mugshots had to be sent to ICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6195.298s">Massachusetts</a>  never <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6197.591s">joined</a>  on to the Secured Communities Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6200.692s">And</a>  I really don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6202.653s">And</a>  whether it's not constitutional law or state law, I mean, there's no skirting around with legal jargon the fact that there are laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6214.518s">that</a>  govern legal citizenship in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6218.46s">And</a>  my side of the argument is that we just honor these laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6223.102s">It</a>  has nothing to do with white supremacy or Nazism. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6227.344s">It's</a>  just a simple matter of respecting the law because we are, as the founding fathers said repeatedly, a nation of laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6235.227s">And</a>  those laws have to be respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6237.288s">Are</a>  you circumventing the very reason why it's a good country <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6241.963s">to</a>  come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6243.104s">And</a>  finally, one of the things that gets established when you establish a state or a city as a sanctuary city, you're creating a magnet for illegal residents to come to, which makes it pretty easy for ICE and for whoever is in power of immigration to know where to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6264.374s">So</a>  it's actually not a service to undocumented, illegal residents of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6272.88s">You're</a>  actually putting a target on their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6275.122s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6275.703s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6286.071s">Leo</a>  A. Sacco, Jr., 227 Elm Street, Medford, Chief of Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6292.236s">I'm</a>  sorry, I don't mean to belabor your meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6294.177s">I</a>  know you're almost ready to move on to the next topic, but a few things were mentioned tonight that I have to clear up. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6299.941s">I'm</a>  concerned about the people who are at home watching this and thinking that Medford is not a safe city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6305.884s">First</a>  and foremost, Medford is a very safe city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6309.426s">It's</a>  a very welcoming community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6311.888s">All</a>  you have to do is look at the real estate transfers and see what the prices are for the homes that are being sold in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6318.532s">People</a>  want to move to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6320.773s">People</a>  want to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6322.54s">people</a>  like this community because it is a safe community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6326.602s">I</a>  don't have the statistics with me this evening, but I can tell you this, that our crime rate in this, in this city is much lower than our surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6335.806s">And</a>  that's one of the reasons why people want to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6338.767s">The</a>  low crime rate is directly related to the hard work of the men and women of the Medford police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6345.029s">But</a>  beyond that, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6347.628s">It's</a>  due to the work of the residents that live in the city, all residents that live in the city that are willing to call and report a crime, report a suspicious activity, report that they've been involved in, they've been the victim of a crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6361.957s">And</a>  that's one of the things we're concerned about as a police department, that we don't want to stifle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6366.781s">We</a>  want everyone to feel comfortable to come forward to the police, to report being a victim of a crime, to report what they may have seen in other criminal actions, which will help us to keep the city safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6379.912s">Now</a>  it was said earlier by some members that were before this rail that the police department is being told what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6387.797s">Police</a>  department is not being told what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6390.138s">Police</a>  department is following the same practice and procedure that we've followed for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6395.642s">I've</a>  been a police officer 36 years in the city, 27 of them as chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6400.064s">Nothing</a>  has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6402.065s">We</a>  do the same thing today that we did pretty much 36 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6406.987s">So</a>  my entire career, we've been following the same practice and procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6411.509s">I</a>  can tell you that I very rarely asked anyone if they were a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6418.552s">But</a>  if I put the handcuffs on someone and arrested them, there's a procedure that we follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6424.455s">They</a>  come to the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6426.216s">They</a>  are booked. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6427.956s">In</a>  the booking, we get all their information. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6430.738s">They</a>  are fingerprinted. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6431.977s">The</a>  fingerprints go to the FBI. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6435.2s">FBI</a>  shares them with other entities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6436.941s">So</a>  it goes to the state, then it goes to the FBI and they share it with the other entities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6441.605s">And</a>  sometimes it can be 10 minutes, sometimes it can be two hours, sometimes it can be as much as a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6447.89s">We'll</a>  get something back saying that that person is not who they say they are because all arrests are backed up by fingerprints. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6456.693s">And</a>  that's the only time we really know when someone may be in this country illegally. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6461.717s">They</a>  may have been deported before and sent back. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6464.879s">And</a>  there isn't anyone in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6466.421s">There</a>  isn't anyone in the city, anyone in the state or anyone in the country that doesn't want to see violent criminals arrested and dealt with regardless of their status. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6475.268s">And</a>  I can assure you that they're not running loose because the Medford police are being sloppy or they're ignoring something. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6481.052s">If</a>  they're, if they're out there, there's maybe some other glitch in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6485.077s">but</a>  it isn't the part of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6486.718s">We</a>  make the arrests that need to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6489.38s">Sometimes</a>  I can tell you that it hasn't happened, at least in this past year, but I can tell you since probably November when the elections happened and January when that administration took office, the fear factor rose. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6508.235s">It's</a>  probably because of all of the rhetoric about immigration enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6512.469s">But</a>  nothing changed over the past several years or from the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6517.072s">Everything</a>  we do is the same as what we did before. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6520.975s">And</a>  we check everyone that we arrest and they go to Somerville District Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6527.819s">If</a>  ICE calls us and said, we have a detainer for the person that you have, we don't hold them based on that detainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6533.903s">We</a>  already had them under arrest for another charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6537.119s">If</a>  they make bail or they end up being transported to Somerville District Court in the morning, ICE is told where those people will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6544.905s">And</a>  that's the extent of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6546.085s">We</a>  do not serve as ICE agents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6549.348s">Civil</a>  immigration laws are primarily the responsibility of the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6553.811s">It's</a>  been said we're not, we don't have the resources to go knock on doors and check statuses, nor do we really have the interest to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6561.956s">We</a>  just, what will we do if we found them? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6564.653s">Would</a>  ICE be able to respond and help us? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6566.415s">They</a>  probably would not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6568.496s">By</a>  the same token, we're not being deputized to work as ICE agents, but if they call us because they're in the middle of something, if it's an officer safety issue, yes, we'll go help them to make sure that they don't get hurt or that no one else gets hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6582.668s">But</a>  I can tell you, we have not had a situation in the city of Medford that resulted at least in an ICE detainer that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6589.234s">We</a>  have made several arrests, major league drug dealers, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6593.652s">And</a>  we've sought information for mice and in a couple of cases that were detained as issued, but those are serious criminal criminals, criminal element that's bringing poison into our community and they had to be dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6606.457s">And</a>  I don't think anyone disagrees with that being done, but I don't want anyone in the public, anyone that's watching this or anyone in this room tonight to think that the Medford police are going easy on crime or easy on the immigration issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6619.142s">We</a>  work within the realm that we're dealt dealt with and uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6623.885s">We</a>  do the best that we can with what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6626.646s">No</a>  one is going to escape what needs to be done, but we're not going out there looking just for the civil violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6633.528s">That's</a>  not our focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6635.648s">I</a>  think everyone agrees that we have far more important things that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6639.869s">But</a>  getting back to the main issue, Medford is a safe city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6643.47s">Whatever</a>  you want to call it otherwise, this is a safe city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6647.291s">People</a>  come here and we have <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6649.775s">Great</a>  police officers out there doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6651.879s">We</a>  definitely need more. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6655.063s">but</a>  we're only as good as the information we receive from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6657.964s">So</a>  we want all segments of the, of the public, uh, documented, undocumented. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6662.484s">We</a>  want people coming forward to, uh, if they're a witness of a crime to come forward and tell us what they saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6668.205s">We</a>  don't want anyone to be quiet and we don't want a segment of the community to be victimized because they're in fear of coming forward that they'd be exposed that no doubt be a victim of robberies on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6681.188s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6682.322s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6683.202s">I</a>  just wanted to clear that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6684.422s">If</a>  you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6686.403s">Thank</a>  you, Chief, for keeping us safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6688.283s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6697.305s">Joe</a>  Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6701.325s">I</a>  have great respect for the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6703.486s">There</a>  are the majority are fine men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6707.106s">I</a>  was videotaping them up at Montvale Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6711.783s">But</a>  I respectfully disagree with our police chief, because I don't feel very safe in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6717.646s">Behind</a>  my house, a man was brutalized and murdered on Salem Street, his head beaten in so badly his brains were splattered. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6725.931s">I</a>  see so much traffic problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6728.992s">I've</a>  seen so many car accidents outside my window as I'm typing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6732.174s">I</a>  saw a guy in the street on Salem Street, and I've had to get two restraining orders on people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6737.817s">The</a>  police didn't help me at all, not the fine good men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6741.36s">But</a>  for political reasons, I had to go get a four-year restraining order on someone who was coming to my home and threatening me. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6748.006s">So</a>  no, when I read in the paper that an MBTA cop doesn't get a breathalyzer, but eight days later, I'm in criminal court because people are lying about me, or if I get assaulted outside of these doors by someone in this room, and the police don't do a proper investigation, but I have to spend thousands of dollars in court to find out that people lied about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6767.623s">No,</a>  this isn't a safe city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6769.365s">You</a>  have the haves and the have-nots. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6771.727s">And</a>  if you're outspoken, as I am, and you try to better your city, which I have tried to do, I have been beaten, I've been harassed, and I've been threatened. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6779.853s">And</a>  Police Chief Sacco has not helped me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6782.456s">So</a>  shame on you, Police Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6784.237s">I'm</a>  a victim, and you hung me out to dry, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6788.28s">And</a>  your own son didn't even get a breathalyzer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6799.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6802.846s">Records</a>  of the meeting of October 10, 2017 were passed to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6806.995s">Councilor</a>  Knight, how did you find those records? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6821.349s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight to accept the minutes as amended, although seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6827.858s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6829.32s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6831.503s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6834.807s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=6837.111s">Motion</a>  passes, meeting adjourned.</p>
