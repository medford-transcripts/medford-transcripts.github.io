20
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:43,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight for the request to suspend the rules.

21
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:48,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President, I request to suspend the rules to take paper 16701 off the table.

22
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:53,810
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight for the suspension of the rules for said purpose, all those in favor?

23
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:54,890
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

24
00:00:57,212 --> 00:01:01,273
[SPEAKER_09]: The rules are suspended for 16-701 appropriations.

25
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:02,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I get that right?

26
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

27
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:09,215
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-701 appropriation for $165,000 DPW Highway Traffic Commission.

28
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:10,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

29
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:11,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. President.

30
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:13,596
[SPEAKER_05]: This paper was brought before this body last week.

31
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:16,077
[SPEAKER_05]: It was tabled through some procedural action.

32
00:01:16,497 --> 00:01:24,539
[SPEAKER_05]: What it is, is it is an appropriation for $165,000 to do some immediate work in terms of stump repair, catch basins, some sidewalk repairs,

33
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:34,509
[SPEAKER_05]: um, as well as, uh, some tree planting in the fall and, um, to increase the stock that we have of street signs in our, uh, sign department over in the highway division, Mr. President.

34
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:35,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:54,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And this money was made available to the city as it is slowly but surely coming to us, uh, through requests and petitions to the federal emergency management authority, uh, due to the, uh, lizard, uh, expenses that we suffered, uh, nearly two years ago.

36
00:01:55,132 --> 00:02:00,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we didn't carry that debt in the city, we were able to pay down and not run a deficit.

37
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:16,856
[SPEAKER_08]: We now have this money that if we do not appropriate it towards certain purposes, it becomes in free cash, if we understood the discourse from the Commissioner correctly.

38
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:18,977
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Chair awaits a motion.

39
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:24,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

40
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:38,892
[SPEAKER_17]: I was the member that called for Rule 20 last week, which allows on any spending paper that comes before the council for the first time for the paper to be laid on the table for further review.

41
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:48,776
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I stated last week, and I still feel strongly, Mr. President, it was back, I believe, in June of this year when the administration came before the city council

42
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:59,036
[SPEAKER_17]: requesting $500,000 appropriation for the repair of sidewalks and tree stump removals, uh, throughout the entire community.

43
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:10,699
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, some four months later, uh, the bid went out and it came back at, I believe it was a 30 something thousand dollars above the $500,000.

44
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,619
[SPEAKER_17]: It was roughly around 30,000 above the 500,000.

45
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:11,899
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um,

46
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:33,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not quite sure the administration just didn't go back and request that the city receive $500,000 worth of tree stump and sidewalk rather than amending the original amount that came out.

47
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:41,754
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were told last week that there's roughly about three weeks left to pour cement and

48
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,143
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not quite sure what we're really gonna get right now.

49
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:49,424
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know it sounds like this needs to be done immediately.

50
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:58,548
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what we heard back in June, that the money was gonna be spent immediately to start replacing sidewalks and remove tree stumps in the community.

51
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:06,930
[SPEAKER_17]: And here we are four months later, and we haven't done, at least through this appropriation, haven't done one ounce of work yet.

52
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:11,432
[SPEAKER_17]: So based on that, Mr. President, based on the money that we did receive,

53
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:16,884
[SPEAKER_17]: is for an emergency snowstorm that happened two years ago.

54
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:26,347
[SPEAKER_17]: And as we all know, in the past 14 years, 13 years, we've been in a budget deficit with the snow and ice removal.

55
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:31,669
[SPEAKER_17]: So year after year, we severely underfund snow and ice and come out in a deficit.

56
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,051
[SPEAKER_17]: And here we had money that came back because of a snowstorm.

57
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:41,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And in my opinion, that money should go towards the snow and ice removal, which

58
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,582
[SPEAKER_17]: I can guarantee it will be in the deficit this year once again.

59
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:51,766
[SPEAKER_17]: So, for those reasons, Mr. President, I cannot support this additional money here tonight.

60
00:04:52,486 --> 00:05:04,994
[SPEAKER_17]: And I voted for the $500,000 for the original stump and sidewalk work four months ago and refused to add another penny to that at this particular point.

61
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:11,558
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe the appropriation should be taken from the Water and Sewer Enterprise account.

62
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:15,355
[SPEAKER_17]: or some other account within the city, Mr. President.

63
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,577
[SPEAKER_17]: We have over $8 million in the water and sewer account.

64
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:24,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And so for those reasons, Mr. President, I will not be supporting this motion tonight.

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

66
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a motion for approval from Councilor Knight?

67
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,222
[SPEAKER_09]: We sure do, Mr. President.

68
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,603
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, do we have a second?

69
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Second, Mr. President.

70
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:34,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Second by Councilor Caraviello.

71
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:37,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

72
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:38,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

73
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:38,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

74
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

75
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:40,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

76
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:41,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

77
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:41,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

78
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice-President Long-Term?

79
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:44,386
Yes.

80
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:45,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

81
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:46,347
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

82
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

83
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:48,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

84
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:49,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dello Russo?

85
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:50,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

86
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:54,811
[SPEAKER_09]: With a vote of six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the appropriation passes.

87
00:05:55,671 --> 00:06:00,493
[SPEAKER_09]: While we're on suspension, we have our brand new city auditor with us tonight.

88
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:03,055
[SPEAKER_09]: She's going to present on two papers from the mayor.

89
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:04,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

90
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:06,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have paper 16-715 and 16-716.

91
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:29,415
[SPEAKER_09]: on the motion of Councilor Knight, to the Honorable President and members of the Method City Council, City Hall, Method Masks, dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate $158,800 from the sale of Lots and Graves account to the Cemetery Department Salary Account, 0104915110.

92
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:40,482
[SPEAKER_09]: The Cemetery Department Salary Account is reduced each year in anticipation of appropriation from the sales

93
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:41,857
[SPEAKER_09]: of lots and graves.

94
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:45,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Sincerely yours, signature on file, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

95
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:47,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Auditor.

96
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Honorable Chair and City Councilors.

97
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,020
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a pleasure to be here tonight and to meet you all for the first time.

98
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,661
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason I'm here is for these two transfers that are before you that are not a part of the budget.

99
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:07,922
[SPEAKER_15]: The budget is voted in of these two transfers and they are needed to supplement the budget.

100
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:11,589
[SPEAKER_15]: which is currently right now in a deficit.

101
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,530
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to get these through as soon as I can.

102
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:28,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a, uh, this is something that's done every year, uh, with the cemetery monies that come in, uh, these monies from the, uh, sale of, uh, lots and graves are used to supplement the salary accounts.

103
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:37,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And money is withdrawn in the second paper we'll see from perpetual care, which is collected for that purpose of caring for the graves.

104
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:45,120
[SPEAKER_09]: And that money is appropriated towards the expenses of caring for the cemetery grounds.

105
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:45,861
Correct.

106
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:48,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Vice President.

107
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:50,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President De La Rousseau.

108
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,147
[SPEAKER_11]: So you said the account is in deficit.

109
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you mean perpetual care?

110
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:55,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

111
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:56,690
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's the deficit?

112
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,937
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not take the exact deficit.

113
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:04,839
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a large deficit, it's a small deficit, but usually when you have a vote of this kind, it would usually be done in July.

114
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:10,561
[SPEAKER_15]: It's now October, so they've been operating for a few months now with the anticipation of getting these funds.

115
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:18,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

116
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:25,925
[SPEAKER_17]: If we can also get an update on the cemetery board, where they stand with the mausoleum

117
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:36,450
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's been a lot of discussion and research done by the cemetery board of trustees, and I would ask if we can get it just an update to the council.

118
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,571
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could amend that paper, Mr. Clerk on Councilor Marks.

119
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:45,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion?

120
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:48,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by council.

121
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:53,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Caraviello is seconded by council and I counsel night move approval.

122
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,104
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

123
00:08:57,444 --> 00:08:57,724
Yes.

124
00:08:58,906 --> 00:08:59,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

125
00:08:59,186 --> 00:08:59,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

126
00:08:59,406 --> 00:08:59,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

127
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:00,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

128
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:00,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

129
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:04,272
[SPEAKER_06]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

130
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:27,120
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-716 to the Honorable President, members of the Metropolitan City Council, City Hall, MetroMassachusetts 155, and Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body transfer 185,849 from perpetual care to the fiscal year 17 cemetery budget 0104915292 for groundskeeping expenses.

131
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,493
[SPEAKER_09]: The Cemetery Department expense account is reduced each year in anticipation of appropriation from Perpetual Care.

132
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:45,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Sincerely yours, Stephanie M. Burke-Mayer, signature on file.

133
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:51,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, as far as I can tell, this is the companion paper to the one that we just voted on.

134
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:51,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd move for approval.

135
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:55,078
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

136
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Vice President.

137
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

138
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,381
[SPEAKER_11]: So the $185, will that cover us for the year?

139
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:00,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

140
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:02,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what we usually spend per year on that account?

141
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:05,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not, but I can get back to you on that.

142
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:16,629
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could just get an update on just what we are in deficit in that account and what we've spent year-to-date in that one account and what we spent in fiscal year 2016.

143
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:21,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

144
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,296
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may add, Chair?

145
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:30,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Through the chair, I am trying to get to you guys an expense, expenditure summary report, and that will be for the next meeting.

146
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:37,423
[SPEAKER_15]: I really wanted to have it this time, but I've been working on closing the year and this current year, so I'm hoping to have it to you guys by next meeting.

147
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:40,906
[SPEAKER_11]: So for every account, what we've spent and what we're, that'd be great.

148
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:41,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

149
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:43,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

150
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,489
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been asking for that for quite some time.

151
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

152
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,411
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to have you aboard.

153
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

154
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:57,745
Councilor Falco?

155
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:58,126
Yes.

156
00:10:58,546 --> 00:10:59,106
Councilor Knight?

157
00:10:59,146 --> 00:10:59,507
Yes.

158
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:00,988
Vice President Long of Kern?

159
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:01,368
Yes.

160
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:02,389
Councilor Monk?

161
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

162
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

163
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

164
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,651
[SPEAKER_09]: President Dolan?

165
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:06,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

166
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,333
[SPEAKER_09]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the transfer is adopted.

167
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:11,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

168
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:20,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

169
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:24,303
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

170
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:27,232
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed, the motion carries.

171
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,713
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-708, offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

172
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:39,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the building department update the Medford City Council with regards to how many code violations notices have been sent out within the last year.

173
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:48,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that the update include how many of those violations has the city initiated criminal actions on.

174
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:49,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Vice President.

175
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

176
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:53,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I request this

177
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:58,814
[SPEAKER_11]: With regards to code violations, I think it will help the council better understand a number of things.

178
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:03,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, um, we've, we asked for more code enforcement all the time.

179
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:20,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also, um, are reviewing a number of things, including ordinances that have to do with enforcement and the need for enforcement, such as the, um, Tufts university ordinance mandating that they give us the, their numbers on a by, by yearly basis.

180
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:32,656
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's important that we see how many code violations are sent out each year and which ones actually have criminal, you know, have been sent to the criminal court.

181
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:49,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the city of Somerville, after reading an article, obviously, not to compare ourselves to Somerville, but they hired a city solicitor to handle part of that job, I think it was an assistant, to handle all the code violations.

182
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And they, you know, within the article,

183
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:55,885
[SPEAKER_11]: they list the number of code violations since the beginning of the year.

184
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to see where Medford compares.

185
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:05,932
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, if we are doing what we need to do to make sure our codes are enforced and being complied with.

186
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:13,997
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could get a roll call vote on this, I think it will be very helpful moving forward with different ordinances that we have in the works.

187
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:14,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

188
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:16,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam vice president, councilor Caraviello.

189
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:17,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

190
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, if, if we, if we could amend that,

191
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:26,964
[SPEAKER_16]: to break down on what violations have been from building, you know, there's different types of violations.

192
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:27,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Type of violations.

193
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:33,847
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could have a breakdown, put that in the paper, Mr. President, I'd appreciate it.

194
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:39,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended.

195
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

196
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:44,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

197
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:45,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

198
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:46,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

199
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:46,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

200
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

201
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:47,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

202
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:49,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice-President Lungo-Koehn?

203
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:49,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

204
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:50,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Montz?

205
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:51,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

206
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Staffelli?

207
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:52,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

208
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,046
[SPEAKER_06]: President Dello Russo?

209
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:54,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

210
00:13:54,566 --> 00:14:00,091
[SPEAKER_09]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion carries.

211
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:01,752
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-709 offered by Vice-President Lungo-Koehn.

212
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:12,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Chief of Police provide the Medford City Council with an update regarding how many speeding tickets have been issued by month over the last 12 months.

213
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:13,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Vice-President.

214
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

215
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:34,008
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that the council has asked for before, and I believe the most recent time we've asked for this, and I could be corrected, stand corrected, but I believe we asked during budget hearings in June how many speeding tickets have been issued over the last year, and then another list of how many have been issued over the last two years.

216
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:45,855
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's important, as you'll see, the next, I believe, three or four resolutions after this have to do with what happened on Winthrop and High Street and Alston Street.

217
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, high in Austin Street with two accidents taking place.

218
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:59,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know there's been some work there, but I think overall speeding is one of the top five complaints that I get as a city Councilor.

219
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:13,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I've been really on top of the fact that we don't have a working speed monitoring sign, movable sign that we can put in different places depending on when we're getting complaints or where we see the need.

220
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,553
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really think it's important that we,

221
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,532
[SPEAKER_11]: and the administration make sure that we are doing some enforcement.

222
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:23,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we're low-staffed, but we need to be doing some enforcement.

223
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:25,874
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just really don't see it being done.

224
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:43,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know, you know, what we can do, but definitely keeping track of it and trying to push the administration to push for more enforcement in all areas, especially the speeding, is going to help reduce accidents and reduce God knows what could happen.

225
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to see if we could get that roll call vote please.

226
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

227
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:52,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yes, Mr. President.

228
00:15:53,332 --> 00:16:07,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President and request also a breakdown of the number of motor vehicle accidents that have occurred on locally controlled roadways, um, as well as a breakdown of the number of, uh, instances where the driver was cited for speed in relation to those motor vehicle accidents.

229
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,584
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caffiello.

230
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:11,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

231
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:16,910
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could also amend that to the areas where the tickets were given out also with locations.

232
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:26,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion for approval by Vice President Hunger-Curran as seconded by Councilor Knight and amended and further amended by Councilor Caraviello.

233
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:28,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

234
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:32,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

235
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:32,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

236
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:33,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

237
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:34,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

238
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:34,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

239
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:35,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

240
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Hunger-Curran?

241
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:36,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

242
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:37,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

243
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:38,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

244
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:39,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

245
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:39,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

246
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:44,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, with the vote of seven the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

247
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:48,487
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-710 offered by Councilor Marks.

248
00:16:49,348 --> 00:17:03,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that Maybrook establish a Medford Pedestrian Advisory Committee which will serve as a forum for citizens to become involved in establishing goals and policies surrounding pedestrian safety in the city of Medford.

249
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:09,421
[SPEAKER_09]: The mission of the committee is to act as advocates in setting priorities for pedestrian safety improvements

250
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:17,099
[SPEAKER_09]: by supporting education, community outreach, and developing policy and plans to make our streets safer.

251
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

252
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

253
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:35,609
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn that, you know, if I were to list the top calls that I receive, I would say that pedestrian safety and speeding are in the top five as well.

254
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,930
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a major concern.

255
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:52,362
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, you know, I'm not happy to say that over the many years that I've been on the council, that I have seen very little progress, uh, in, uh, traffic calming approaches in this community.

256
00:17:52,983 --> 00:18:04,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Although, uh, recently under this new minute, uh, administration, uh, the mayor signed a complete streets, uh, program that, uh, currently, uh, there's,

257
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:10,837
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, a complete street stakeholders committee that was set up, uh, I guess several months back.

258
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:24,325
[SPEAKER_17]: And it consists of a number of department heads as well as someone from the bicycle, um, advisory committee, which I believe is Bruce Kulik and someone from walk method.

259
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:30,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, Jack's, uh, Jeff Buxom, um, is on that committee also.

260
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,903
[SPEAKER_17]: And their mission is very similar to what I want to set up.

261
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:41,367
[SPEAKER_17]: A major difference is that I believe there should be more citizen input.

262
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:51,513
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe that in addition to a member of the Bicycle Advisory Committee and Walk Method, there should be a resident from every section of this community.

263
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:57,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Because who best knows their neighborhood than someone that lives in the neighborhood and experiences firsthand

264
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:05,519
[SPEAKER_17]: the situations of pedestrian safety and speeding and which streets may require traffic calming approaches.

265
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:16,227
[SPEAKER_17]: So my motion tonight, Mr. President, is not to replace by any means the stakeholders complete street committee.

266
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:26,115
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they're doing yeoman's work and bringing to the attention of the administration as well as the police department

267
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,832
[SPEAKER_17]: areas that are hot spots in this community that need to be addressed.

268
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:46,939
[SPEAKER_17]: With that being said, I believe there was 70 locations that this complete street committee sat down and looked at a number of spots throughout the community and said, you know, if we had a wish list, what needs to be attended to in this community?

269
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:48,700
[SPEAKER_17]: And they came out with 70.

270
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,941
[SPEAKER_17]: In my discussions with Jeff, I'd say

271
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:54,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I said to Jeff, Jeff, I could probably come up with 170.

272
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:59,057
[SPEAKER_17]: And he says, I agree, but it's a starting point.

273
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:01,219
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's a great starting point.

274
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:10,805
[SPEAKER_17]: What I'm hoping by this resolution tonight is to draw attention once again to public safety concerns in this community.

275
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:22,413
[SPEAKER_17]: And I attended last Wednesday night, as well as Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Falco, the police department's public safety meeting,

276
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:30,610
[SPEAKER_17]: which, due to Councilor Falco, is being held in neighborhoods throughout this community, and it was very well attended.

277
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:41,615
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to thank the chief, the officers that attended, as well as Councilor Falco for bringing up this very important issue and bringing it out to the community.

278
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:50,118
[SPEAKER_17]: But the Brooks School, as we know, is on a state highway, and that particular road

279
00:20:50,796 --> 00:21:01,942
[SPEAKER_17]: has been a concern for a number of years because the only true set of working lights from the square on down to West Medford Square is, I believe, in Medford Square.

280
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:08,665
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a blinking set of lights at Pedestrian Operated in front of St.

281
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:15,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Joe's Church, but there is no other light all the way down past West Medford Square.

282
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:17,189
[SPEAKER_17]: And the next set of lights is

283
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:23,096
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe, another pedestrian control light in front of St.

284
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:23,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Raphael's.

285
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:37,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a long stretch of road that really tends to pick up speed and cars, in my opinion, see this as a place where you can pick up speed.

286
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:45,297
[SPEAKER_17]: But I wanted to throw out some of the recommendations, Mr. President, just so for the edification of the general public.

287
00:21:45,740 --> 00:22:00,928
[SPEAKER_17]: things that are currently being worked on at High Street in front of the Brooks School, and things that will be addressed over time because they involve more engineering study and so forth.

288
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:13,575
[SPEAKER_17]: But the installation of two rectangular rapid flash beacons to be actuated by push button, the beacons have been audited and expect them to arrive this coming week.

289
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,602
[SPEAKER_17]: So that should be installed very shortly.

290
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:23,667
[SPEAKER_17]: They're also talking about shortening the crossing using painted curb extensions.

291
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:31,493
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's something that was mentioned at the council meeting a few weeks ago when residents and parents came from the Brooks School.

292
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:40,019
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to install a flexible pedestrian yield stop sign in the center of the crosswalk, along with striping to further narrow the road.

293
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,382
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to paint stripes to delineate the parking lanes

294
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:47,022
[SPEAKER_17]: on both sides serving to narrow the road and slow traffic.

295
00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:58,905
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're going to clarify much of the existing signage in the area to help with traffic control and pedestrian safety.

296
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:06,047
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the major recommendations that was made was to lower the speed limit on High Street.

297
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:11,508
[SPEAKER_17]: And I realize because it's a state road, and I think at the meeting that was brought up at the Brooks School,

298
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:17,684
[SPEAKER_17]: is the fact that it's a state road that we need the Department of Transportation to act on this request.

299
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:21,425
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not something we can do internally through our own traffic commission.

300
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:34,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's my understanding that is in the works to lower the speed limit to 25 miles an hour, and with the hopes that if you lower speed, streets become safer.

301
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:40,310
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it's been said here a thousand times, you can have all the signage,

302
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:48,891
[SPEAKER_17]: You can have all the traffic markings without enforcement, without strict, consistent enforcement.

303
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:52,553
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to move forward no matter what signage we put out there.

304
00:23:53,313 --> 00:24:09,081
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was a little dismayed to hear from the chief that when residents were concerned for the lack of enforcement, that the chief over and over again said, well, if I had a full complement of police officers, I'd be able to do some of the enforcement.

305
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:24,425
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can't see why, Mr. President, with the existing amount of manpower that we have in this community, that we can't provide basic enforcement from our current staffing as it is right now.

306
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:27,388
[SPEAKER_17]: And in my opinion, it's a matter of priorities.

307
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:37,837
[SPEAKER_17]: If pedestrian safety and taking back our streets is a priority in this community, the police department will find the manpower to accommodate that task.

308
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:44,824
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it was also mentioned that the Traffic Division only has four personnel right now.

309
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:47,825
[SPEAKER_17]: There are four officers in the Traffic Division.

310
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:52,586
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, to cover — don't forget, we're not open nine to five.

311
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:56,347
[SPEAKER_17]: We're open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, our streets.

312
00:24:57,007 --> 00:25:05,328
[SPEAKER_17]: And it requires a significant input of manpower, not only by the patrol, but also by a Traffic Division.

313
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,209
[SPEAKER_17]: And, in my opinion, we lack

314
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:13,944
[SPEAKER_17]: the proper personnel to provide the safety that's needed, Mr. President.

315
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:20,447
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, I would say that's a matter of priorities and shifting of personnel to accomplish that.

316
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:33,172
[SPEAKER_17]: During the budget, the chief asked, as one request, he asked for CAAS, which I'm hoping are going to come to fruition, which in the capital improvement plan the mayor is going to be offering.

317
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:36,653
[SPEAKER_17]: But he also asked for some additional civilian manpower.

318
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:45,537
[SPEAKER_17]: And part of that was to keep crime statistics in the city and also do some basic reporting.

319
00:25:46,097 --> 00:26:03,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if you go onto the police website, it's very difficult to get any information on any type of reporting that's been done regarding analysis, crime analysis, pedestrian safety, accidents within this community.

320
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,701
[SPEAKER_17]: And the chief asked for that particular position

321
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:09,396
[SPEAKER_17]: and it was denied by the administration.

322
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:20,900
[SPEAKER_17]: But I can tell you firsthand, without the proper reporting, because there were a lot of questions asked Wednesday night regarding how many accidents, where are these accidents located?

323
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they in this particular area or are they around the city?

324
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:28,563
[SPEAKER_17]: And we did get some information, but it was very limited.

325
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:33,825
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think a position of that would pay for itself 10 times over.

326
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:45,509
[SPEAKER_17]: in regards to a sense of confidence, a sense of peace of mind that it is being looked at, and that problem areas are being addressed.

327
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,191
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't know where the problem areas are, then you can't address them.

328
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:55,032
[SPEAKER_17]: So the first step is to identify and isolate the areas that need to be attended to.

329
00:26:55,673 --> 00:27:03,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And without someone that's gathering this data, I think it makes it that much more difficult for our police department to do its

330
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:04,308
[SPEAKER_17]: job.

331
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:13,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Then there was talk also about quicker response time when it comes to a neighborhood safety concerns.

332
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:26,955
[SPEAKER_17]: The Brooks Hobbs or the Brooks School, I should say, there was a quick turnaround, but I think residents expected to see a little more, a little quicker.

333
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:32,457
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of the quick things that were asked for to put out as maybe

334
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:41,858
[SPEAKER_17]: a couple of those orange safety barrels on High Street just to let people know that there's something there and something impeding them coming down the street.

335
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:51,301
[SPEAKER_17]: There was also talk about putting up the electronic speed sign that we have to let people know, hey, we're out here, we're present, we're looking.

336
00:27:51,941 --> 00:28:00,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Even to take a couple of our cars that have been sitting behind the police station unused for a period of time, they may not be in great condition,

337
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:08,294
[SPEAKER_17]: but they still say Method Police on them, and they still have a set of lights on top, and you park one of those out on High Street, let me tell you, that's gonna deter people.

338
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:11,275
[SPEAKER_17]: The minute they see it, they're gonna slow down.

339
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:28,482
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are the few quick things that could have been done, and I think residents were concerned that the response wasn't adequate enough after, first of all, the child was struck on High Street, and secondly, after the several accidents

340
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:32,628
[SPEAKER_17]: that happened, car accidents, right around the perimeter of the school.

341
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:45,837
[SPEAKER_17]: There was also mentioned that the lighting throughout the entire community, this is not just within the high street area, throughout our entire community is poor, Mr. President.

342
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:56,025
[SPEAKER_17]: There's been upgrades to the lighting here in Medford Square, but it's been, in my opinion, not adequate enough.

343
00:28:56,676 --> 00:29:02,498
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know they're doing a pilot, I believe, in front of the old movie theater on Salem Street.

344
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:08,621
[SPEAKER_17]: If you go by there, I believe they've put some different type of lighting in a few of the lights out there.

345
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:20,926
[SPEAKER_17]: And they do appear to give off more light, a greater distance, but I think more needs to be done to improve lighting within the community.

346
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:42,271
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could just briefly talk about the pedestrian advisory committee that maybe will roll up into the complete street committee that's already formed, or maybe it could be another committee comprised of just residents in this community that give input.

347
00:29:43,011 --> 00:29:49,094
[SPEAKER_17]: No different from a police advisory committee that would be set up

348
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:51,694
[SPEAKER_17]: within other communities.

349
00:29:52,435 --> 00:30:18,646
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would just ask Mr. President that, and I'm sure the mission statement from the Complete Streets is very similar, but I would ask that the mission statement consist of reviewing new projects that affect pedestrians to ensure they meet local and state design guidelines, advocating for safe access for pedestrians, supporting education, outreach, and advocacy of pedestrian issues,

350
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:22,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Developing policy and plans to better meet the needs of pedestrians.

351
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:27,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Advise city staff on issues related to promoting pedestrian safety and education.

352
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:32,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Promote walking as the most environmentally friendly form of transportation.

353
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:39,676
[SPEAKER_17]: Assist the Medford Traffic Commission, Mayor, City Council, and all city departments in setting priorities for pedestrian safety.

354
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:48,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Work with law enforcement and other city departments to promote enforcement and education about laws, policies, regulations pertaining to pedestrians.

355
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:57,284
[SPEAKER_17]: and review and make recommendations on capital improvement projects to ensure that pedestrian needs and pedestrian facilities are given full attention.

356
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:04,207
[SPEAKER_17]: So like I said, I know the stakeholder committee, Complete Streets, is very similar to this.

357
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:18,132
[SPEAKER_17]: If the mayor opts not to set up a separate advisory committee, I would ask that she expand the current stakeholders Complete Street committee to include residents, preferably one

358
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:20,773
[SPEAKER_17]: from every neighborhood and section of this community.

359
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:28,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said from the outset, what better to have the eyes and ears of someone that actually lives in a neighborhood to give direct input.

360
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:35,960
[SPEAKER_17]: And as far as I'm concerned, there are more than ample neighbors and residents that want to get actively involved.

361
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,981
[SPEAKER_17]: I receive a lot of calls from people saying, how do I get on a committee?

362
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:41,262
[SPEAKER_17]: How do I get active?

363
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:53,466
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd like to see, it's great to have department heads on these committees, and that's useful because they're the ones that you want to be your advocates when they approach DOT or when they approach other agencies.

364
00:31:53,947 --> 00:32:09,817
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's also helpful to have residents that are driving and living in the community and walking our streets, bicycling on our streets, and walking their children to school who best know the neighborhood and what needs to be done.

365
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:17,020
[SPEAKER_17]: I would ask Mr. President that, uh, this be approved, uh, based on, uh, the need, uh, throughout our community.

366
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:29,827
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, if so, if the mayor sees fit that the current advisory, uh, safe streets, uh, be included to, uh, include one resident from each neighborhood of this community.

367
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

368
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:34,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

369
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:35,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

370
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,271
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's a great suggestion by Councilor Marks.

371
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:49,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it's better to have people from every neighborhood rather than just one or two neighborhoods to have input.

372
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:58,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, I had asked some time ago about the police enforcing the distracted driving.

373
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:04,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Because again, a lot of these accidents and things are happening is because of distracted driving.

374
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:13,311
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've yet to see any action taken on this, other than the high school has a program for distracted driving.

375
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:23,199
[SPEAKER_16]: But also, Mr. President, along with distracted driving, distracted walking is also a big issue.

376
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,223
[SPEAKER_16]: People have their headphones on all the time, their heads are in their phones.

377
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:32,446
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's also an issue with safety for pedestrians.

378
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:39,487
[SPEAKER_16]: If the chief could look into starting something for this, uh, bringing back the distracted driving.

379
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:40,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I'd appreciate that.

380
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:41,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

381
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:43,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

382
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:45,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

383
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you to Councilor mocks.

384
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:54,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think that this council has gone on record multiple times supporting advisory councils and advisory committees that are comprised of citizens, uh, wholly or in part.

385
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. President, I think it's a great measure and that's something that I'm going to be supported supporting.

386
00:33:59,644 --> 00:34:03,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just asking, um, that we amend the paper to make a recommendation that, uh,

387
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:15,337
[SPEAKER_05]: a representative from the disability community, uh, the council on aging and the school department, uh, be considered as, um, advisory committee slots, I guess would be the appropriate term.

388
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:15,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

389
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:17,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

390
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:23,902
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended by council night, Mr. Uh, all those in favor, all those opposed.

391
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:25,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we have citizens that want to speak.

392
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:26,543
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies.

393
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:28,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

394
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:28,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

395
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:30,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Please take your name and address for the record.

396
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Pacora.

397
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:32,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi Joe.

398
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:34,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see all of you.

399
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Your address?

400
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,450
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 Adams Street.

401
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:37,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

402
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:42,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Really like that idea to put a car out on my street.

403
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,814
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable, unacceptable.

404
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:50,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a freeway all day long.

405
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:56,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Failure to stop at the stop sign, speeding, wrong way travel all day long.

406
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:04,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Adams, Capon, Emory, Hillsdale, Quincy, all the way up from North to Winthrop Street.

407
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:11,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one way they look, laugh, keep going.

408
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's going to come around Emory, going to come wrapping around.

409
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:16,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to just collide.

410
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:18,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad.

411
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:23,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's bad enough that I'm here at your suggestion today.

412
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:25,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

413
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:27,710
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really, really bad.

414
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:37,492
[SPEAKER_03]: You could literally put a lawn chair out there, grab a beer, and all day long you could just watch the cars just run the sign, speed, one way, go the wrong way.

415
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,553
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all day long.

416
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:41,714
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys could ticket there all day long.

417
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:43,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Unbelievable.

418
00:35:43,534 --> 00:35:45,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, Mr. Speaker.

419
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:46,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Max.

420
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:50,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Joe, just if I could, have you ever reported this to the police department?

421
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:53,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you ever made any C-click fix?

422
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:54,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you ever reported it?

423
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:55,089
[SPEAKER_17]: I have, yeah.

424
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,850
[SPEAKER_17]: And what response are you receiving?

425
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I go there?

426
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

427
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,291
[SPEAKER_17]: This is public safety.

428
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:01,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Not adequate.

429
00:36:02,651 --> 00:36:08,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it unprofessional, inadequate, not a priority.

430
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:09,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you hit on that.

431
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:14,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a suggestion that kind of inferred that the resources aren't there.

432
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:19,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you saw some of the emails.

433
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:24,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Just excuses.

434
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:28,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to throw any, you know, all the great work the police do.

435
00:36:29,018 --> 00:36:30,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supportive.

436
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:30,860
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not...

437
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:35,177
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they're shorthanded, these guys are shorthanded, they're shorthanded, I understand.

438
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:42,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But something has to be done about it, whether it's, you know, through enforcement or, I know, signs, these traffic studies.

439
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some overflow as well from Route 16.

440
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe getting the state involved somehow.

441
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:54,983
[SPEAKER_03]: The cars come up, Boston Ave, there's a major, major problem at that light in Boston Ave.

442
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:59,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Come up, they turn up north, they go up Capen,

443
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:03,218
[SPEAKER_03]: They take a left on Winthrop and go back down and cross Boston Ave.

444
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,320
[SPEAKER_03]: They're totally trying to avoid that whole intersection.

445
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,281
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it, I think, is spillover from overflow from Route 16 as well.

446
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:15,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a major problem, particularly the neighborhood is starting to see some more kids.

447
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:19,085
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't had kids for years, like really small kids, three, four, five.

448
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:22,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the neighbors are talking about it.

449
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:24,828
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, some of the neighbors went out and bought signs and put them on the street.

450
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:29,570
[SPEAKER_03]: If your kids lived here, drive like your kids lived here, that kind of thing.

451
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:42,072
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, from what I understand, some of the other neighbors have actually went to the Bedford Police Department and met at maybe some community meeting that the police have, I think, in the last several months.

452
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:44,833
[SPEAKER_03]: But continues to be a lack of enforcement.

453
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:48,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And I followed up with Officer Brooks the other day.

454
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:53,256
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he was explaining to me that he wasn't around on the weekend and so forth and so on.

455
00:37:53,276 --> 00:38:08,741
[SPEAKER_03]: He was off, you know, and I wasn't, if I found it to be defensive and not really helpful in that, not answering questions, not putting us in touch with, you know, the appropriate city officials to work together to deal with the situation.

456
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:10,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all great stuff that you guys are talking about.

457
00:38:10,862 --> 00:38:11,963
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys seem to be on it.

458
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:13,083
[SPEAKER_03]: You're aware of it.

459
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:15,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And the neighborhood would really appreciate it, I'm sure.

460
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:32,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also appreciate it, but it's a pretty rampant problem with, again, the speeding, the wrong way travel, failure to stop at all those Quincy, Adams, Hillsdale, all the way from North to Winthrop.

461
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:40,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's obviously most of it's happening during, you know, these rush hours, you know, in the morning, late in the afternoon, but it does happen all day long.

462
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:46,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened tonight on my way here, walking my dog before I came here, just cars going right through.

463
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:51,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw the biker coming down, coming down Adams the wrong way.

464
00:38:54,911 --> 00:39:10,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The car went up, barely stopped, did a rolling stop, the other car went the other direction down Capeman, went right through the sign, the bike was coming from Adams the other way, and then you had another car coming up Adams, going the right way, you know, going up Adams the way it's supposed to go.

465
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:24,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like to bring this issue to your attention and hopefully implore you to do something about it, whether it's through the enforcement or these studies or some other avenues that you have.

466
00:39:24,678 --> 00:39:26,839
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to have more signs in the meantime, striping.

467
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:32,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, some of these other ideas that came up with this curb, changing the curbs and so forth and so on.

468
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:39,589
[SPEAKER_03]: But we beg you guys to please have someone do something about it and have someone out there and start ticketing.

469
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:45,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Give the people this message that you can't be driving in this manner.

470
00:39:45,574 --> 00:39:49,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not perfect as a driver, but I'm far from it.

471
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:56,642
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just was hoping to bring that to your attention and hopefully you're able to do something about it.

472
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, not trying to

473
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,304
[SPEAKER_03]: make light of these great guys that do this tough work, policing the city.

474
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:13,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there are many other issues, but it would be nice to have something done about it.

475
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:14,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

476
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your time.

477
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

478
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:17,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

479
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:18,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

480
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:29,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Joe, I understand exactly where you're coming from because I live on a street that parallels Route 16 in High Street, and my house is right on a four-way stop sign, and I could sit there in any

481
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:35,566
[SPEAKER_16]: morning or afternoon, and before they would slow down a little bit, now they don't even slow down anymore.

482
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:45,129
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can see them coming from right in back of the Brooksville, coming down Prescott Street, they go right through Auburn Street sign, and without even slowing down, just keep going, right through it, you know what I mean?

483
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:54,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Without even slowing down, and the same thing, they come down, at the peak times of the day, they come down Mystic Street, stop sign right there, go through it like there's not even a sign there.

484
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:58,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said, if I sat there with a ticket book, I'd be famous.

485
00:40:59,632 --> 00:41:12,335
[SPEAKER_16]: And about eight or nine years ago, the chief did put an officer in my driveway, and I think he wrote up about 10 or 15 people within an hour.

486
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:28,679
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, you could, you know, if they want, you know, if they, again, it's, and it's also, it's due to all these, you know, these programs on your phone, Waze and Google, they're taking everybody off the streets, and, you know, so, you know, to get to your point maybe a minute or two earlier, and that's where all the traffic's coming from, and this is just our city,

487
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:31,403
[SPEAKER_16]: I hear it from every city that we go.

488
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:39,807
[SPEAKER_16]: The neighborhoods are all getting jammed with cars because these programs are taking people off the main roads and putting them on side roads to get to their destination quicker.

489
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:46,049
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, I fully sympathize with it because I see it every day.

490
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,570
[SPEAKER_16]: And my street is the street where the kids walk to school.

491
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:52,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and they don't even stop.

492
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:55,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Most mornings I get the Italian salute when I yell at them.

493
00:41:57,754 --> 00:41:59,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

494
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:00,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

495
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:02,886
[SPEAKER_10]: And, Joe, thank you for coming forward tonight.

496
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:09,447
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the big things that came out of the meeting at the Brooks School last week was just traffic in general.

497
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know each of us receive traffic calls.

498
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:13,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I get them on a weekly basis.

499
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:16,269
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't matter really what part of the city you live in.

500
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:23,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I know in North Medford, I mean, I live on Fulton Spring, and I see people fly down Fulton Street every day and go right through the stop sign.

501
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:24,671
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's happening everywhere.

502
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:25,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a major concern.

503
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:27,712
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, when I hear stories like this,

504
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,881
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, it really screams at the fact that we need to hire a traffic engineer.

505
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:35,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been saying this since March.

506
00:42:37,262 --> 00:42:44,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say a majority of the calls that I've received since I've been elected, and I'm a first term member of the council, I have received a ton of calls on traffic.

507
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:54,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have no one, and the chief even said it at a meeting last week, we have no one in the city that has a professional background in traffic, in analyzing traffic patterns.

508
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:58,094
[SPEAKER_10]: and seeing how the traffic flows throughout our community.

509
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:09,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And we really need to hire someone, bring someone on board that can look at the traffic throughout our community, because the issues that we have today are going to be even worse tomorrow and in the months and the years to come.

510
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,804
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look throughout our community, the amount of development that potentially could happen over the next few years is amazing.

511
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:23,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a look at North Medford, the potential development at the old Malden Hospital site.

512
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a look at Locust Street.

513
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:27,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a look down at Mystic Ave.

514
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:38,755
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are places where we're talking about major development that could potentially come into our city, and they are going to affect the quality of life that we have in our city.

515
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:41,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Traffic is a major concern.

516
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:44,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed now.

517
00:43:44,877 --> 00:43:48,919
[SPEAKER_10]: The traffic engineer, I asked the mayor if he could please reconsider Resolution 16-088.

518
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,380
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a resolution that I put out earlier this year.

519
00:43:52,976 --> 00:43:54,676
[SPEAKER_10]: to hire a traffic engineer.

520
00:43:54,696 --> 00:43:56,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's money well spent.

521
00:43:57,357 --> 00:43:58,937
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to take a look at this issue.

522
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:00,558
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to be addressed today.

523
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:01,638
[SPEAKER_10]: It's long overdue.

524
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:07,099
[SPEAKER_10]: This is affecting the quality of life in all neighborhoods throughout this community.

525
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,320
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to be addressed right away.

526
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank you for coming here tonight.

527
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,361
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important that we hear from residents on issues like this.

528
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:18,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I've received many phone calls, many emails, and I know my fellow colleagues have as well.

529
00:44:18,842 --> 00:44:22,143
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a major concern throughout our community, and it needs to be addressed right away.

530
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:22,863
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank you.

531
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:25,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

532
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:30,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

533
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:36,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have a number of great suggestions, depending on which area we're talking about, there's even more suggestions.

534
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:40,747
[SPEAKER_11]: But the bottom line is we need more enforcement.

535
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:51,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether we need to put more men and women on the police force just to do enforcement, or we need to ask the mayor to really push what we have now,

536
00:44:51,953 --> 00:44:57,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's time we have a meeting with the chief of police and request that the mayor be there as well.

537
00:44:57,598 --> 00:44:58,419
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the quota?

538
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:10,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And there must be a reason why we've asked for how many speeding tickets have been issued in the last year, the last two years, and we failed two or three times in the last year or two to get the answer.

539
00:45:11,149 --> 00:45:12,170
[SPEAKER_11]: There has to be a reason.

540
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,552
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to figure this out.

541
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:19,937
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't wait until there's an accident, or should I say two accidents where there's two people hit

542
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,691
[SPEAKER_11]: before we get to an area and do what needs to be done.

543
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:29,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Yellow, orange barrels should have been put out after that first accident, but they should have been put out prior to that accident.

544
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:30,715
[SPEAKER_11]: We know where the problems are.

545
00:45:31,035 --> 00:45:32,416
[SPEAKER_11]: We know where the people are speeding.

546
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:34,977
[SPEAKER_11]: We know, I mean, where there are kids or families.

547
00:45:34,997 --> 00:45:40,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just happening everywhere, so I really can't say we should, there just needs to be more enforcement.

548
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,981
[SPEAKER_11]: And I fail to see any anywhere.

549
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:48,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I never hear of anybody getting ticketed or anybody that complains to me about,

550
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,521
[SPEAKER_11]: speeding and lack of enforcement, nobody ever sees it being done.

551
00:45:52,701 --> 00:46:06,584
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something that we need to address and we need to do it sooner than later because somebody is, I'd hate for Joe or Cheryl or anybody to come before us and say, we spoke about this location six months ago and now somebody's dead.

552
00:46:07,685 --> 00:46:10,625
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the last thing we want and it needs to come from the administration.

553
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:16,407
[SPEAKER_11]: The administration needs to talk to the chief of police and whether we be in the room or not, it needs to happen.

554
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:17,967
[SPEAKER_11]: We need more enforcement in this city.

555
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,658
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to make it a priority.

556
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:23,319
[SPEAKER_11]: It's extremely important so somebody doesn't get seriously injured.

557
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:31,023
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

558
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:32,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

559
00:46:32,263 --> 00:46:33,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

560
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:36,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

561
00:46:36,665 --> 00:46:38,086
[SPEAKER_14]: I live at 281 Park Street.

562
00:46:38,726 --> 00:46:41,427
[SPEAKER_14]: I attended the meeting at the Brooks School.

563
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:50,061
[SPEAKER_14]: This is basically, this meeting started from a Facebook post, which seems to be our new way of doing things in this city.

564
00:46:50,861 --> 00:46:59,324
[SPEAKER_14]: And every parent in this city who's on Medford bombs knows that every September starts with, my child was trying to go to the school bus and almost got killed.

565
00:47:00,245 --> 00:47:03,006
[SPEAKER_14]: The first one posted was on the Felsway.

566
00:47:03,106 --> 00:47:04,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't get much traction.

567
00:47:04,347 --> 00:47:07,628
[SPEAKER_14]: The parents said, yeah, that's happened to me a million times and nothing happened.

568
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:11,632
[SPEAKER_14]: The one that happened on High Street got more traction.

569
00:47:11,672 --> 00:47:16,959
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a fabulous organization in West Medford that can really rally people to show up in a meeting.

570
00:47:17,613 --> 00:47:19,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And boy, am I jealous.

571
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:26,762
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I could have 70 people standing behind me today talking about the problems that we have on my side of the city, on other parts of the city.

572
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:34,549
[SPEAKER_14]: But the one thing that I got out of that meeting was one of the officers suggested that I go on to the mass.gov website.

573
00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:41,075
[SPEAKER_14]: He suggested that we all go on and that we could get a copy of all the accidents in the city of Medford for the past three years.

574
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:42,836
[SPEAKER_14]: So I went on this morning.

575
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:43,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I clicked it in.

576
00:47:44,057 --> 00:47:53,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Within five minutes, I had an email that had three years of accident statistics from Medford by date, had the intersections and everything.

577
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you that the hottest spots are not surprising to anyone.

578
00:47:57,627 --> 00:48:02,311
[SPEAKER_14]: The Felsway, Salem Street, Locust Street, I was a little bit surprised.

579
00:48:02,331 --> 00:48:03,732
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of accidents on Locust Street.

580
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:05,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Spring Street is a big hot issue.

581
00:48:05,713 --> 00:48:10,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone on Medford Moms knows that people are getting hit over there constantly.

582
00:48:11,903 --> 00:48:13,364
[SPEAKER_14]: What else was it?

583
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Mystic Ave wasn't too bad.

584
00:48:15,406 --> 00:48:17,488
[SPEAKER_14]: High Street had a lot of accidents as well.

585
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,569
[SPEAKER_14]: The Winthrop Street Circle had accidents.

586
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:23,712
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of hotspots in the city that are not just on High Street.

587
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:27,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I applaud that we had a meeting specifically for High Street.

588
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:31,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure all the other neighborhoods should have to wait the several months for their meetings.

589
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,041
[SPEAKER_14]: What if there were more issues on High Street?

590
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:39,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they not allowed to go to the community meeting because it's supposed to be focused only on their neighborhood?

591
00:48:39,345 --> 00:48:40,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's what's going around.

592
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:49,548
[SPEAKER_10]: That meeting was not geared specifically towards the West Medford neighborhood.

593
00:48:50,448 --> 00:48:54,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I made it entirely clear that it was geared to everyone.

594
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:57,792
[SPEAKER_10]: We're bringing the meeting to each neighborhood throughout the city.

595
00:48:57,992 --> 00:48:58,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's not the intention.

596
00:48:58,732 --> 00:48:59,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

597
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:04,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone can come, and anyone can talk about any problem they have.

598
00:49:04,135 --> 00:49:06,116
[SPEAKER_10]: There were people there that were not from West Medford.

599
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:07,036
[SPEAKER_10]: They were from Wellington.

600
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:08,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And they talked about issues that they had.

601
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:11,639
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't specifically about West Medford.

602
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:22,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was heavily involved with West Bedford questions about specific issues that were happening in that neighborhood.

603
00:49:23,718 --> 00:49:27,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, so the whole point of the thing is to

604
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:34,299
[SPEAKER_10]: is to bring the meetings to the neighborhoods and actually make it easily accessible for people to get to those meetings, which I think we did.

605
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:39,080
[SPEAKER_10]: We had 70 to 75, with all the police there too, I think probably close to 100 people in the room.

606
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,341
[SPEAKER_10]: And normally, and Bob, you would know this better than anyone, there's probably maybe 10 people.

607
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:44,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

608
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:48,382
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not that many people there on a monthly basis down at the police station.

609
00:49:48,422 --> 00:49:53,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyone could come to that meeting, and anyone could talk about any issue that they wanted to.

610
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:54,863
[SPEAKER_10]: The chief made that entirely clear.

611
00:49:55,384 --> 00:49:57,804
[SPEAKER_10]: The meeting happened to be in West Method next month.

612
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,265
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be at St.

613
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:00,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Francis Parish Center.

614
00:50:01,006 --> 00:50:03,566
[SPEAKER_10]: A month after that, it's going to be at the Andrews Middle School.

615
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:06,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend.

616
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,488
[SPEAKER_10]: The more people that attend, the better.

617
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:17,370
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what this is all about, getting people involved, engaging the residents, and having them come to the meeting and talk about the things that affect them in their neighborhood.

618
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,091
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not limited, no meeting is ever limited to just these residents.

619
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:22,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody and anybody can come.

620
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope everybody comes.

621
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:26,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we have big areas, big,

622
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:28,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the schools, St.

623
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:34,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Francis Parish Center, South Medford Fire Station, these are all big venues where we can see lots of people.

624
00:50:34,438 --> 00:50:36,219
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd love to fill the place.

625
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:43,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but I mean, everyone, and let me repeat this, everyone is welcome to come and talk about anything they want.

626
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:49,143
[SPEAKER_10]: The chief was, when he came and he opened up the meeting, he said that, you know, any questions, feel free to ask, we're here to help.

627
00:50:49,623 --> 00:50:55,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought it was a very good exchange, very good dialogue back and forth between the residents and the police.

628
00:50:56,246 --> 00:50:57,567
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought it was very productive.

629
00:50:57,607 --> 00:51:03,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, Council Marks just went through the plan that they're working on and I think it's a good start.

630
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:06,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, is it gonna solve the problem completely?

631
00:51:06,415 --> 00:51:09,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not, but it's a good start.

632
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:16,403
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think, you know, I just wanna just make clear that that meeting, it didn't really start on Facebook.

633
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:20,667
[SPEAKER_10]: That meeting was a resolution that I brought forward earlier in the year, back in the spring.

634
00:51:21,483 --> 00:51:28,651
[SPEAKER_10]: to basically bring these meetings out into the neighborhood, engage the residents, have them talk about what is going on in their neighborhoods.

635
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,773
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make that clear.

636
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:31,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Mr. President.

637
00:51:31,794 --> 00:51:32,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

638
00:51:32,635 --> 00:51:34,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Ma'am, if you could continue, please.

639
00:51:35,517 --> 00:51:38,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for making that clear, because I did attend that meeting.

640
00:51:38,118 --> 00:51:38,538
[SPEAKER_14]: I was late.

641
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:44,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I was at the South Medford Economic Development meeting, which I had to leave in the middle of the mayor's remarks to come to that meeting.

642
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:51,462
[SPEAKER_14]: But I did attend the meeting with that frame of mind.

643
00:51:51,502 --> 00:51:57,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I've since been told by others that they thought it was inappropriate to speak of anywhere but their neighborhood.

644
00:51:57,804 --> 00:51:59,505
[SPEAKER_14]: So I hope that people heard.

645
00:51:59,938 --> 00:52:01,799
[SPEAKER_14]: that this is supposed to be community-wide.

646
00:52:02,379 --> 00:52:13,103
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope that at the end of all these meetings that there'll be resolutions about all of these streets and all the neighborhoods, because I did speak about the Felsway, which I'm sure you're familiar with the Felsway.

647
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:18,905
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have a crossing guard at all, but I see a resolution on here to add an additional crossing guard to another street.

648
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:25,927
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not sure how many months people are gonna have to wait before they're gonna see this kind of rapid action.

649
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:26,908
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, 4 a.m.

650
00:52:26,968 --> 00:52:27,828
[SPEAKER_14]: street lining.

651
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:32,011
[SPEAKER_14]: and lights being ordered and grant money coming in January.

652
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:42,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to look at all these streets and we need to look at them quickly and not wait four or six months to get to other neighborhood meetings because there's danger now in other areas of the city.

653
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:48,386
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we're hyper-focused on one street and I hope that that is not going to continue to be the case.

654
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:50,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

655
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:53,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

656
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome.

657
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Please state your name and address for the record.

658
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:56,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

659
00:52:56,876 --> 00:52:58,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

660
00:52:59,297 --> 00:53:03,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this discussion to the table.

661
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I've attended many of those town meetings.

662
00:53:08,442 --> 00:53:12,505
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing these into the neighbourhoods.

663
00:53:12,545 --> 00:53:14,426
[SPEAKER_12]: That kind of a turnout is great.

664
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:20,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed the first two of this year because I just got a new puppy, but I usually regularly attend those meetings.

665
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,132
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what the city law is or the state law.

666
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:43,138
[SPEAKER_12]: But perhaps to alleviate some of these traffic and public safety issues, you know, with budgeting being as it is, perhaps Medford could incorporate an auxiliary police force or a special police force that reserves part-time.

667
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:46,099
[SPEAKER_12]: They could be armed or unarmed or unpaid.

668
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,360
[SPEAKER_12]: I briefly looked it up before I came up to speak.

669
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,882
[SPEAKER_12]: There's about 10 towns in Bristol County that

670
00:53:54,346 --> 00:54:04,493
[SPEAKER_12]: utilizes an auxiliary force that, you know, if they're youngsters, as Councilor Marks alluded to, there's a lot of people in this city that want to contribute, that want to volunteer.

671
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:12,699
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet you could find at least 20, 30 people that would be happy to volunteer their time on a part-time basis.

672
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,114
[SPEAKER_12]: to help alleviate some of these concerns.

673
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:22,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Mark said something earlier, with all due respect, about, you know, they'll find a way to make it.

674
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:29,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Haven't gone to these town meetings for pretty much regularly for about three or four years now.

675
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:31,466
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really difficult.

676
00:54:31,486 --> 00:54:36,069
[SPEAKER_12]: When Chief Sacco says that he needs the manpower, he really means it.

677
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:40,052
[SPEAKER_12]: You could have some officers that, you know, are working undercover.

678
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,198
[SPEAKER_12]: of others that work in phones.

679
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:44,480
[SPEAKER_12]: He's very understaffed.

680
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,482
[SPEAKER_12]: He needs about another 25 or 30 officers.

681
00:54:47,962 --> 00:54:55,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I know the mayor just freed up a few months ago about 10 dispatches so that they could offset that and hire 10 new police.

682
00:54:56,048 --> 00:54:58,349
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, they lost 10 police officers.

683
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:02,892
[SPEAKER_12]: So they really didn't gain one more officer from that move.

684
00:55:03,253 --> 00:55:05,254
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just up to offer a suggestion.

685
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:08,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the city council could, working with the mayor's office,

686
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:21,174
[SPEAKER_12]: get the advice, of course, of Chief Sacco, who would know more, consider an auxiliary reserve police force that would help ensure all of the concerns that were brought up tonight.

687
00:55:21,494 --> 00:55:22,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

688
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:23,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

689
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:25,576
[SPEAKER_09]: And one more.

690
00:55:28,118 --> 00:55:28,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

691
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:30,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

692
00:55:30,439 --> 00:55:30,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

693
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street.

694
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:39,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing these numbers tonight here in the hall regarding the understaffing of our police force,

695
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:42,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Troubles me greatly as a longtime resident.

696
00:55:44,463 --> 00:55:53,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember back in the day when we had a good presence and as children, you know, driving around the city on our bikes or whatever, there was always plenty of officers.

697
00:55:53,368 --> 00:55:54,268
[SPEAKER_00]: So this troubles me.

698
00:55:55,589 --> 00:56:02,292
[SPEAKER_00]: What troubles me even more is knowing that we're going to have 800 new units coming online that are already been approved by our zoning board.

699
00:56:03,103 --> 00:56:08,524
[SPEAKER_00]: They're underway at Wellington Circle and Wellington Woods and a few other areas.

700
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:28,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And to hear of this deficit of manpower, knowing that we're going to have another 800 some odd families coming online soon, I would really urge the council to include in their motion something that stresses the importance of getting some additional bandwidth for these folks.

701
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,561
[SPEAKER_00]: who work really hard to have them up to speed before these folks start arriving to our city.

702
00:56:35,421 --> 00:56:35,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

703
00:56:35,661 --> 00:56:35,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.

704
00:56:35,961 --> 00:56:51,424
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of the right of council, not Mars, which was on pedestrian safety, pedestrian safety, and motion for approval was by Councilor Mars, and it was seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

705
00:56:51,444 --> 00:56:53,364
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to take a vote on that now?

706
00:56:53,384 --> 00:56:54,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if I could.

707
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:55,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor.

708
00:56:56,565 --> 00:56:57,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Just if I could, because.

709
00:56:57,425 --> 00:56:57,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

710
00:56:58,837 --> 00:57:02,780
[SPEAKER_17]: I've asked for a public safety summit for the last five years.

711
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:03,641
[SPEAKER_17]: And we had it.

712
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:12,869
[SPEAKER_17]: And, well, we haven't had a summit that addresses the needs of the community.

713
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:16,092
[SPEAKER_17]: And I still believe a public safety summit.

714
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:21,036
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Councilor Lungo said that we should have the chief and the mayor and so forth.

715
00:57:22,497 --> 00:57:26,180
[SPEAKER_17]: That is well needed, Mr. President, and long, long overdue.

716
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,322
[SPEAKER_17]: The second point that I wanted to raise is I have a copy of Walk Method.

717
00:57:32,102 --> 00:57:32,662
[SPEAKER_17]: It's September 2015.

718
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:50,989
[SPEAKER_17]: And I had the opportunity to talk to a member of Walk Method, and they said back a few years ago under the McGlynn administration that the mayor gave the approval to erect pedestrian neon crossing signs.

719
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:55,644
[SPEAKER_17]: And for a period of time, we saw a few of them pop up here and there.

720
00:57:56,324 --> 00:57:57,424
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, wow, this is great.

721
00:57:57,444 --> 00:58:00,826
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some neon signs showing where Pedestrian Crossing is.

722
00:58:01,406 --> 00:58:08,829
[SPEAKER_17]: The only problem is that we got maybe one-fifth of what the mayor promised.

723
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:21,334
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think what we need to do, Mr. President, is, in addition to, you know, bringing forward the public safety concerns, we also have to hold people accountable in this community.

724
00:58:21,785 --> 00:58:34,747
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there's a commitment from the mayor saying he's gonna install 70 sets of pedestrian crossing signs, neon crossing signs, we as a council have to hold the mayor to that commitment.

725
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:41,208
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fact that a new administration comes in doesn't relieve all the commitments that were made.

726
00:58:41,608 --> 00:58:43,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are commitments that should be kept.

727
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:51,010
[SPEAKER_17]: We were promised back some four years ago when they created, after myself and many, many members of this council

728
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:59,898
[SPEAKER_17]: pushing for raised crosswalks in this community as a traffic calming approach, we were promised a pilot program by Mayor McGlynn.

729
00:59:00,398 --> 00:59:02,160
[SPEAKER_17]: He said, we're going to start off with three.

730
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:04,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, was I happy with three in a city this size?

731
00:59:05,103 --> 00:59:06,724
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but I said it's a starting point.

732
00:59:07,365 --> 00:59:10,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Four years later, we got one out of the three.

733
00:59:11,638 --> 00:59:12,779
[SPEAKER_17]: One out of the three.

734
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:23,405
[SPEAKER_17]: I've asked the administration a dozen times, this new administration, to give us a report on where we stand with the Harvard Street and the Central Ave raised crosswalk.

735
00:59:23,745 --> 00:59:26,767
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have yet to get a response, Mr. President.

736
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:28,527
[SPEAKER_17]: yet to get to a response.

737
00:59:28,848 --> 00:59:36,230
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I realize it wasn't this current mayor that created this pilot program, but this current mayor agrees with pedestrian safety.

738
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:44,252
[SPEAKER_17]: She sent her chief of staff at last Wednesday's public safety meeting, and it seems to be a priority of this mayor.

739
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:51,474
[SPEAKER_17]: And a priority to me is keeping forward the commitment that was made even by a previous administration.

740
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:55,875
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, so I would ask that this paper also be amended

741
00:59:56,285 --> 01:00:15,283
[SPEAKER_17]: to find out, Mr. President, if we could, these are important issues, find out where the commitment stands with the mayor, with this current mayor, regarding the commitment Mayor McGlynn made with neon pedestrian crossing signs that he made to walk Medford back some years ago, Mr. President.

742
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:18,746
[SPEAKER_17]: I also would ask again for the 22nd time

743
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:32,047
[SPEAKER_17]: that the current mayor give us an explanation why that the pilot program for raised crosswalks has only experienced one crosswalk on Winthrop Street.

744
01:00:32,387 --> 01:00:34,267
[SPEAKER_17]: In my opinion, it's been effective.

745
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:39,008
[SPEAKER_17]: It needs to be painted again because you can barely see it when you're driving upon it.

746
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:45,029
[SPEAKER_17]: I realize there's signs on both sides of the road, but it's not visible enough in my opinion.

747
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:48,070
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's an effective way of slowing down traffic.

748
01:00:49,118 --> 01:00:54,263
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know why, Mr. President, we were told, well, they're doing work on Central Ave.

749
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:59,768
[SPEAKER_17]: So as soon as that work's done — that was a year and a half ago — we'll move forward on the raised crosswalk.

750
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:02,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we were told on Harvard Street, oh, they're working on the bridge.

751
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:07,054
[SPEAKER_17]: When the bridge work gets done, we'll be able to — and nothing, Mr. President.

752
01:01:07,735 --> 01:01:08,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing.

753
01:01:08,135 --> 01:01:15,802
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I'm just tired of talking about the same issue over and over and over again.

754
01:01:16,597 --> 01:01:19,338
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm hoping we can move forward now with this new administration.

755
01:01:19,818 --> 01:01:24,580
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have to tie up the ends of the last administration, Mr. President.

756
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,681
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, people want to give a lot of accolades, this and that.

757
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:31,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, let's tie up what wasn't done, what wasn't completed.

758
01:01:32,405 --> 01:01:34,447
[SPEAKER_17]: And pedestrian safety is a major concern.

759
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:39,311
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I hear time and time again, oh, God forbid, wait till a major accident happens.

760
01:01:39,851 --> 01:01:47,958
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to tell anyone, but we've had a number of deaths on our street to date, pedestrian deaths on our street.

761
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, we've had

762
01:01:51,173 --> 01:01:53,495
[SPEAKER_17]: bicycle death on our street.

763
01:01:54,016 --> 01:01:57,559
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had a number of pedestrian accidents on our roads.

764
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,542
[SPEAKER_17]: So the horse is already out of the barn.

765
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:02,724
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't say, well, wait till something happens.

766
01:02:03,165 --> 01:02:03,845
[SPEAKER_17]: It's happening.

767
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:05,427
[SPEAKER_17]: It's happening now.

768
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:10,031
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's not funny when a loved one is lost, Mr. President.

769
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:13,213
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a woman that was struck and killed in front of St.

770
01:02:13,253 --> 01:02:14,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Joe's not too long ago.

771
01:02:15,015 --> 01:02:20,939
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not, you know, it's a very, very serious situation here.

772
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,763
[SPEAKER_17]: And that incident, Mr. President, as I explained with the poor lighting,

773
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,404
[SPEAKER_17]: If anyone's familiar, when you go by St.

774
01:02:29,444 --> 01:02:34,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Joseph's at night out there in front of the church, it's very dark out there.

775
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:36,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Very dark.

776
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:43,070
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've asked for National Grid to go out there and create some additional lighting, but that never happens.

777
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,931
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I don't know, Mr. President.

778
01:02:46,091 --> 01:02:54,075
[SPEAKER_17]: Until we take control of our streets, until we demand more from our police department in regards to enforcement,

779
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:57,260
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we know how to give out overtime.

780
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,003
[SPEAKER_17]: We know how to give out details.

781
01:03:00,383 --> 01:03:01,504
[SPEAKER_17]: We know how to give everything out.

782
01:03:02,285 --> 01:03:05,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's give out some public safety enforcement in this community.

783
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's provide some enforcement.

784
01:03:08,432 --> 01:03:10,094
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I'll rehash it over and over again.

785
01:03:10,394 --> 01:03:15,059
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a spotlight story on Channel 5 or 4 back some four or five years ago.

786
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,921
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a couple of spotlights.

787
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:28,570
[SPEAKER_17]: But one, they did 10 surrounding communities in this area, north of Boston, and they looked to see how many communities are writing moving infractions, speeding tickets, and so forth.

788
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:31,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Method was last on the list.

789
01:03:31,972 --> 01:03:33,032
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not me saying it.

790
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,353
[SPEAKER_17]: This was a spotlight investigation.

791
01:03:35,794 --> 01:03:38,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Method was last on the list, Mr. President.

792
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:46,540
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, I know you've asked for the number of tickets given, and I hope you get it someday, but in my opinion,

793
01:03:47,194 --> 01:03:54,718
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, that number could have been given to you very easily, uh, because I don't think there's many moving violation tickets going on in this community.

794
01:03:55,218 --> 01:03:56,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

795
01:03:56,198 --> 01:04:01,241
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by councilor Caraviello as amended by Councilor Marks twice.

796
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:02,901
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

797
01:04:03,182 --> 01:04:03,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote.

798
01:04:03,862 --> 01:04:04,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

799
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:06,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote has been requested.

800
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:07,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

801
01:04:08,864 --> 01:04:10,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

802
01:04:10,745 --> 01:04:10,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

803
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:11,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

804
01:04:11,966 --> 01:04:12,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

805
01:04:12,606 --> 01:04:13,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

806
01:04:13,026 --> 01:04:13,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

807
01:04:13,926 --> 01:04:14,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice president.

808
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:15,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

809
01:04:16,055 --> 01:04:16,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

810
01:04:16,556 --> 01:04:17,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

811
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:17,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

812
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:19,417
[SPEAKER_09]: President Del Rosario?

813
01:04:19,497 --> 01:04:19,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

814
01:04:19,978 --> 01:04:20,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Affirmative.

815
01:04:20,418 --> 01:04:21,018
[SPEAKER_09]: None of the negative.

816
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:23,240
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

817
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:45,153
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-711 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas High Street is a state road and one of the most heavily traveled roads in the city of Medford, whereas the Brooks Elementary School is located on High Street, whereas two pedestrians have recently been involved in car accidents, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send a letter to Stephanie Pollack, Secretary of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation,

818
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:49,804
[SPEAKER_09]: requesting that the speed limit on high street be low to 25 miles per hour.

819
01:04:50,144 --> 01:04:51,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

820
01:04:51,885 --> 01:04:52,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

821
01:04:53,006 --> 01:04:55,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and I apologize if this sounds a little repetitive.

822
01:04:55,687 --> 01:05:02,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but, uh, a few months ago I offered a resolution to bring the, uh, monthly meetings at the Medford police station into the neighborhoods.

823
01:05:02,752 --> 01:05:06,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Our first one was last Wednesday at the Brooke school.

824
01:05:06,594 --> 01:05:11,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, first of all, I'd like to thank chief Sacco for letting me bring those into the neighborhoods.

825
01:05:11,853 --> 01:05:14,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd also like to thank DPW Commissioner Brian Kerins.

826
01:05:15,035 --> 01:05:24,099
[SPEAKER_10]: He was there as well and he did a great job at outlining the improvements that they're going to be putting in place in front of the Brooks Elementary School.

827
01:05:24,339 --> 01:05:28,921
[SPEAKER_10]: And also like to thank my colleagues as well, Councilor Marks and Councilor Caraviello were there as well.

828
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:30,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a nice meeting.

829
01:05:30,642 --> 01:05:31,242
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good meeting.

830
01:05:31,722 --> 01:05:37,645
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a nice healthy exchange of ideas and possible solutions to what we can do in that area.

831
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:42,670
[SPEAKER_10]: There's about 75 to 100 residents, many members of the Medford Police Department.

832
01:05:43,851 --> 01:05:54,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And we talked about traffic, but we also talked about other issues, school safety, speeding, lighting was an issue, signage throughout the neighborhoods.

833
01:05:54,657 --> 01:06:01,722
[SPEAKER_10]: But as we had mentioned earlier, over the past few months, there have been two people that have been hit by cars.

834
01:06:01,802 --> 01:06:06,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe there was a car accident on the corner of Mystic and High Street within the past couple of weeks.

835
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:11,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are major problems in that area with regard to traffic.

836
01:06:11,653 --> 01:06:14,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you go from Medford Square down to St.

837
01:06:14,575 --> 01:06:18,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray's, as was mentioned earlier, it's a straight shot, and there's absolutely no lights.

838
01:06:19,398 --> 01:06:27,943
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we need to do is, it's kind of like a multi-pronged approach where we need to make improvements to that area, but one of the things we need to do is lower the speed limit.

839
01:06:28,504 --> 01:06:36,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, at the meeting, Representative Garbally was there as well, and he talked about, you know,

840
01:06:37,063 --> 01:06:39,985
[SPEAKER_10]: and the chief did as well, about how it's a state road.

841
01:06:40,646 --> 01:06:44,229
[SPEAKER_10]: And we really have limits as to what we can do regarding state roads.

842
01:06:44,389 --> 01:06:48,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the suggestions was to lower the speed limit to 25 miles per hour.

843
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:52,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a lot of people are in favor of that.

844
01:06:53,056 --> 01:07:01,543
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about pedestrians, bicyclists, that are just trying to get from point A to point B, and it's become very dangerous.

845
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:15,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Representative Garboly had encouraged residents to actually write letters to Stephanie Pollack, the director of the MassDOT.

846
01:07:15,695 --> 01:07:20,238
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think what we should do here is we should actually be part of this effort.

847
01:07:20,298 --> 01:07:23,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And we should stand behind our residents.

848
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:27,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And we should go on record as writing a letter to Stephanie Pollack as well.

849
01:07:28,263 --> 01:07:30,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is an issue that we can all unite behind.

850
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:43,034
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, in the best interest of many residents throughout this community and the people that pass through our community, that we take public safety serious, that we want to make sure that everyone is safe, getting to where they need to get to.

851
01:07:43,054 --> 01:07:45,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think 25 miles per hour will be appropriate.

852
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:57,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and, uh, uh, you know, I'm hoping that my councils, uh, support this resolution tonight and, uh, move approval on the motion for approval by councilor Falco chair recognizes councilor night.

853
01:07:58,193 --> 01:08:01,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing this resolution up.

854
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:07,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up on a stretch of road between the Winthrop Street Rotary and the Brooks School, and I wasn't allowed to cross the street until I was 18.

855
01:08:08,616 --> 01:08:13,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I can tell you right now that it was certainly quite a speedy thoroughfare.

856
01:08:14,297 --> 01:08:16,378
[SPEAKER_05]: But Councilor Falco brings up a good point, Mr. President.

857
01:08:16,418 --> 01:08:18,138
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a roadway that's state-controlled.

858
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:25,860
[SPEAKER_05]: There's dual jurisdiction, and where there's dual jurisdiction in terms of the operations of the roadway, I think there should also be a commitment from our state police

859
01:08:26,563 --> 01:08:31,446
[SPEAKER_05]: um, for a dual jurisdiction and the enforcement of our traffic control laws that are in place here as well.

860
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:35,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I'm in full support of Councilor, uh, Falco's resolution.

861
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:54,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's very important to note, Mr. President, that, um, we have a detour right now that is directing traffic down route 16 and up onto high street right now with the closure of the credit bridge and that's creating traffic and that traffic is causing vehicles that are trying to get through the Winthrop street rotary to get through West Medford square and pass that stretch as fast as they can.

862
01:08:55,308 --> 01:08:56,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I think this is a great resolution.

863
01:08:56,789 --> 01:09:09,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd ask, um, Councilor Falco if he doesn't mind that I amend it to request that the state police also, uh, kick up their police presence in the area to enforce, um, the speed limit, especially during the hours before and after school.

864
01:09:11,559 --> 01:09:11,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

865
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:16,903
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion for approval as amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.

866
01:09:17,763 --> 01:09:18,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

867
01:09:18,544 --> 01:09:21,786
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank councilor Falco for offering this resolution.

868
01:09:21,806 --> 01:09:25,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, at that meeting also rep gob Ali mentioned,

869
01:09:25,485 --> 01:09:42,727
[SPEAKER_17]: a piece of legislation that he co-sponsored, I believe, regarding having local municipalities take local control of roads, and in particular roads that may be dual jurisdiction, as Councilor Knight mentioned.

870
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:55,738
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess it made it as far as the governor's desk, and the governor either vetoed it or sent it back, removing state roads from the language.

871
01:09:56,418 --> 01:10:01,660
[SPEAKER_17]: So it really did nothing to accomplish what we were trying to get after.

872
01:10:02,381 --> 01:10:07,563
[SPEAKER_17]: But needless to say, Mr. President, you know, I come from a different train of thought.

873
01:10:08,234 --> 01:10:35,793
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and I've offered resolutions like this for the last probably 10 years, that there's no reason why any road in this city — I don't care if it's state or city road, Mr. President — that when a resident comes to us and say, I have a concern of a sidewalk on this road, and the road happens to be under state jurisdiction, but we can't touch the sidewalk, we can't trim the tree, but that taxpayer is paying thousands of dollars

874
01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:40,357
[SPEAKER_17]: to this community and property tax, to me, is ridiculous.

875
01:10:40,978 --> 01:10:43,139
[SPEAKER_17]: It's absolutely ridiculous, Mr. President.

876
01:10:43,499 --> 01:10:53,607
[SPEAKER_17]: So, in my opinion, if I were chief, I'd go out, I'd take DPW, I'd change all the speeding signs on High Street to 25 miles an hour.

877
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:58,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Knowing how the state works, it'll take them about 10 years to catch up with it.

878
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:00,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, Mr. President?

879
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:03,995
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll have public safety for the next 10 years on our streets.

880
01:11:04,755 --> 01:11:11,800
[SPEAKER_17]: So the fact that the state says, oh, don't go ahead and move forward with that, to me, public safety should supersede that, Mr. President.

881
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:12,741
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're not doing it.

882
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:14,162
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not putting tollbooths up.

883
01:11:14,422 --> 01:11:15,623
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not putting gates up.

884
01:11:16,003 --> 01:11:23,349
[SPEAKER_17]: We're saying that we need to reduce speed based on reported data of accidents, pedestrian safety in our community.

885
01:11:24,189 --> 01:11:32,015
[SPEAKER_17]: And in my opinion, that should take priority and wait for the ramifications down the line with the state someday, Mr. President.

886
01:11:32,616 --> 01:11:34,517
[SPEAKER_17]: But I thank Councilor Falco for offering this.

887
01:11:35,953 --> 01:11:36,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

888
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:41,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of approval, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended.

889
01:11:41,574 --> 01:11:43,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

890
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:46,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

891
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:47,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

892
01:11:47,395 --> 01:11:48,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

893
01:11:48,135 --> 01:11:48,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

894
01:11:48,775 --> 01:11:49,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

895
01:11:49,396 --> 01:11:49,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

896
01:11:50,236 --> 01:11:51,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice-President Lionel Kern?

897
01:11:51,316 --> 01:11:51,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

898
01:11:51,696 --> 01:11:52,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marksley?

899
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:52,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

900
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:53,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

901
01:11:54,036 --> 01:11:54,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

902
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:55,877
[SPEAKER_06]: President Dello Russo?

903
01:11:56,097 --> 01:11:56,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

904
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,517
[SPEAKER_09]: The vote is seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

905
01:11:58,537 --> 01:11:59,317
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

906
01:11:59,337 --> 01:12:00,638
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-712 offered by Councilor Falco.

907
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:19,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the bus stop for middle school students is located on High Street, whereas the traffic on High Street poses a major safety concern to anyone who crosses High Street, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that Chief Sacco and Mayor Muccini-Burke sign an additional crossing guard to cross middle school students.

908
01:12:20,535 --> 01:12:21,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

909
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:23,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

910
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:32,061
[SPEAKER_10]: So these resolutions, these three resolutions, the one that I offered earlier and these upcoming resolutions, and these are all from

911
01:12:33,277 --> 01:12:35,438
[SPEAKER_10]: basically the product of the meeting that we had the other night.

912
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:50,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, you know, I received many calls from residents, uh, from in particular for middle school, uh, parents that have kids that need to catch the bus in the morning and they just have a tough time navigating high street.

913
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,281
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been talking about it for the past, probably half an hour.

914
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:56,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's tough to cross.

915
01:12:56,381 --> 01:13:00,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, I'd like to see, um, if we could, uh, add another,

916
01:13:00,582 --> 01:13:09,646
[SPEAKER_10]: crossing guard during the, we already have one during the elementary hours, but it'd be nice to have one, uh, for the middle school students as well when they, um, get ready to go to school in the morning.

917
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:14,268
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could add a crossing guard to that, uh, intersection, um, that'd be great.

918
01:13:14,529 --> 01:13:15,169
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

919
01:13:15,489 --> 01:13:20,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good on the motion for approval by councilor, uh, Falco councilor night.

920
01:13:20,992 --> 01:13:22,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

921
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:28,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'd like to amend the resolution and request that, um, the traffic commission look at the location of the crosswalk and whether,

922
01:13:28,749 --> 01:13:40,442
[SPEAKER_05]: or not the crosswalk at the Brooks School would be best located on the corner of Alston and High and the corner of Auburn and High, or if it would be better off if they moved it off the intersection.

923
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: and almost like into the 50 odd line.

924
01:13:42,664 --> 01:13:44,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would line up right with the front doors of the school.

925
01:13:44,706 --> 01:13:53,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, that way vehicles that are turning left or right off of those side streets have a longer sight line so that they can see if there are people that are in the crosswalk.

926
01:13:53,672 --> 01:14:04,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would also provide, um, the queuing up of cars to those corners so that pulling out and into onto high street would be a little bit more difficult because it would be much more congested.

927
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good on that.

928
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:09,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, motion of councilor Falco as amended.

929
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:12,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, chair recognizes council Scarpelli.

930
01:14:12,819 --> 01:14:13,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

931
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:14,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, thank you.

932
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:17,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, council Falco for all your suggestions.

933
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:31,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, one of the few phone calls I did receive is if we could, uh, if we could amend this paper to ask the chief to look at, uh, the traffic commission to look at stop signs on Austin street at Irving street.

934
01:14:31,145 --> 01:14:34,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that is a major area of concerns where kids are crossing.

935
01:14:35,606 --> 01:14:38,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, if we can amend that, if that's okay.

936
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,671
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's amended by councilor Scarpelli.

937
01:14:41,692 --> 01:14:43,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, chair recognizes councilor Falco.

938
01:14:44,494 --> 01:14:51,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And another, uh, so, so this is, um, this resolution here is basically to add a crossing guard.

939
01:14:51,398 --> 01:14:56,422
[SPEAKER_10]: What, one of the things that they're actually looking at is actually placing the bus stops.

940
01:14:56,482 --> 01:15:05,308
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so what they've done, and I know this came up earlier from what I've been told is on the fellows way, officer Brooks worked, uh, the bus route, reworked the bus route.

941
01:15:05,328 --> 01:15:07,489
[SPEAKER_10]: So no one has to cross the street.

942
01:15:07,805 --> 01:15:11,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So all the stops are on one side of high and the stops on the other side of high.

943
01:15:11,746 --> 01:15:14,307
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think they're working through that now trying to readjust that.

944
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:18,888
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is kind of a stop gap measure until we get that resolution.

945
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:27,090
[SPEAKER_10]: From what I've been told, Officer Brooks has worked with the schools to actually look at those way bus stops.

946
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:31,351
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe they've already done that where they have stops on one side and stops on the other side.

947
01:15:31,371 --> 01:15:32,591
[SPEAKER_10]: So no one actually has to cross.

948
01:15:33,531 --> 01:15:37,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's just a little piece of information for my colleagues.

949
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:37,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

950
01:15:38,157 --> 01:15:38,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

951
01:15:38,537 --> 01:15:46,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion for approval as amended, all those in favor, all those, the motion carries.

952
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:47,719
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-713 offered by councilor Falco.

953
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the Winthrop street rotary has been the scene of many automobile accidents.

954
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:56,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the Winthrop street rotary is extremely congested.

955
01:15:57,002 --> 01:16:05,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the city administration conduct a study to redesign the Winthrop street rotary in a regular intersection with street lights.

956
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:06,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

957
01:16:06,814 --> 01:16:07,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

958
01:16:09,195 --> 01:16:14,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I mentioned earlier, during the monthly community meeting, this came up as well, the Winthrop Street Rotary.

959
01:16:14,177 --> 01:16:19,099
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the Rotary is definitely a public safety concern.

960
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:24,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Over the past few years, there have been many accidents at that Rotary on a daily basis.

961
01:16:25,742 --> 01:16:30,104
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you have five streets that run right into that one Rotary.

962
01:16:30,144 --> 01:16:34,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And years ago, when there were probably fewer cars on the road, maybe this made sense.

963
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:40,161
[SPEAKER_10]: But these days, the days that we live in, everyone owns a car.

964
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:45,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And some houses have three, four, five cars.

965
01:16:45,703 --> 01:16:46,763
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a major concern.

966
01:16:46,783 --> 01:16:54,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we have all kinds of traffic coming in from Methodist residents, from residents in Winchester, Estonia.

967
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:58,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you name it, all surrounding communities that are coming through this one area.

968
01:16:58,486 --> 01:17:00,186
[SPEAKER_10]: The traffic is really bad in the morning.

969
01:17:00,206 --> 01:17:02,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I've received calls on this as well.

970
01:17:03,088 --> 01:17:06,829
[SPEAKER_10]: The cars are backed up on Winthrop Street, High Street, you name it.

971
01:17:07,149 --> 01:17:08,910
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a major concern.

972
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:15,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in the matter, just looking at public safety, this is something that the city needs to address.

973
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:19,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to see them have some sort of a study to look at this intersection.

974
01:17:20,113 --> 01:17:26,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the chief had mentioned that the way it presently is today, it's just not good.

975
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:30,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is not good for the community to have a rotary like this.

976
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:33,296
[SPEAKER_10]: roads flowing in.

977
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:44,301
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to have the city have a study that actually looks at that intersection and making it into a regular intersection with streetlights.

978
01:17:45,401 --> 01:17:46,962
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, just research it, study it.

979
01:17:47,642 --> 01:17:49,223
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a matter of public safety.

980
01:17:49,263 --> 01:17:50,603
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to make sure that people are safe.

981
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:53,805
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a major safety concern and I move approval.

982
01:17:54,405 --> 01:17:57,506
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, Councilor Caraviello.

983
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:58,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

984
01:17:59,995 --> 01:18:04,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Being a resident of that area, I see that rotary every morning.

985
01:18:05,259 --> 01:18:08,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

986
01:18:09,823 --> 01:18:16,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Being a resident of that area, like Councilor Knight, I see that every single morning, every single day.

987
01:18:17,089 --> 01:18:25,036
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, traffic is backed up because of that rotary all the way down past the school and it just doesn't move.

988
01:18:25,797 --> 01:18:27,098
[SPEAKER_16]: I think part of the reason is because

989
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:36,120
[SPEAKER_16]: There's not a separation of the lane for the cars that want to turn right versus the cars that are going straight, and they back up all over the place.

990
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:43,542
[SPEAKER_16]: The timing of the light, that's a short light there also on Route 16 for the left-hand turn.

991
01:18:44,102 --> 01:18:49,744
[SPEAKER_16]: So eight or 10 cars go by, and then the light changes, and the traffic just backs up forever.

992
01:18:49,964 --> 01:18:51,904
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a bad spot.

993
01:18:52,264 --> 01:18:53,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I've seen many accidents there.

994
01:18:56,647 --> 01:18:58,889
[SPEAKER_16]: I seen the pole get knocked down not too long ago.

995
01:18:59,329 --> 01:19:02,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Almost, almost, almost hit a guy walking down, walking down the street.

996
01:19:03,393 --> 01:19:06,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Because again, somebody, somebody tried to go, go over the sidewalk and hit the pole.

997
01:19:07,636 --> 01:19:08,597
[SPEAKER_16]: It is, it is.

998
01:19:09,138 --> 01:19:13,962
[SPEAKER_16]: And as the chief mentioned that night, he'd like to see the rotary taken out altogether if he had his way.

999
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:20,988
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I support that councilor Falco's resolution and hope that the chief can get the, the rotary taken out altogether.

1000
01:19:22,173 --> 01:19:37,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the city engineer reported to us last week when she was here or the week before that, uh, that's being considered under the complete streets program and examination of that and the topographical difficulties that, uh, that area of Medford, uh, presents.

1001
01:19:37,723 --> 01:19:38,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1002
01:19:38,703 --> 01:19:40,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1003
01:19:40,204 --> 01:19:40,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you.

1004
01:19:40,644 --> 01:19:42,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco for bringing this issue up.

1005
01:19:42,726 --> 01:19:47,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I look out my window every day and see that rotary and, uh, some days are worse than others.

1006
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the days are worse than others.

1007
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:49,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

1008
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:57,029
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be certain periods of time when there's no traffic at the rotary, but during the rush hour times, it is absolutely brutal.

1009
01:19:57,469 --> 01:19:59,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think councilor Caraviello hit the nail on the head.

1010
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:02,631
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a lot to do with the lights that are timing, the timing of the lights down at route 16.

1011
01:20:02,751 --> 01:20:08,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it has a lot to do with the backups at route 16 queuing up, but also has a lot to do with the backups on Boston Ave and Winthrop street.

1012
01:20:08,974 --> 01:20:12,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I certainly can appreciate councilor Falco's resolution.

1013
01:20:12,816 --> 01:20:16,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, however, I don't want to see us limit our options.

1014
01:20:17,742 --> 01:20:20,784
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're gonna study the intersection, let's study the intersection and let's see what works best.

1015
01:20:20,824 --> 01:20:22,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a bigger rotary works best.

1016
01:20:22,746 --> 01:20:29,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe changing traffic patterns through right-hand and left-hand lane, only turn lanes works best.

1017
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:35,874
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am reluctant to support a measure that's just going to say, take out the rotary and put in a set of traffic lights.

1018
01:20:35,894 --> 01:20:45,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's what the language says, but in Councilor Falco's presentation, what he'd like to see, and correct me if I'm wrong, Councilor, is someone to take a look at this intersection and make recommendations into the design thereof.

1019
01:20:45,497 --> 01:20:54,861
[SPEAKER_05]: and see what we can do to put some traffic calming measures in there to slow cars down, but to also prevent queuing and backing up through the intersection during these rush hour periods of time.

1020
01:20:56,861 --> 01:21:11,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'd be very supportive of the resolution, Mr. President, if we didn't limit our options into creating a regular intersection with lights, but rather exploring and examining all options that are before the council and before the engineer, I think would probably make sense.

1021
01:21:11,527 --> 01:21:14,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something I could support if the gentleman would be willing to amend the paper.

1022
01:21:14,812 --> 01:21:15,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he will.

1023
01:21:16,473 --> 01:21:19,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1024
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:20,695
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be brief.

1025
01:21:20,735 --> 01:21:21,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1026
01:21:22,015 --> 01:21:24,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on the same page as Councilor Knight.

1027
01:21:24,697 --> 01:21:30,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree not to limit, but to ask, I was going to ask if we could just change the wording in the last sentence.

1028
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:38,403
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's what Councilor Knight is reaching, getting at so that we don't come out saying we want a redesign.

1029
01:21:38,443 --> 01:21:44,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there may be other ways we can fix the problem rather than, you know, reconfiguring the whole intersection.

1030
01:21:44,891 --> 01:21:57,562
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could create some language where we're just asking for, you know, whether it be a traffic study or conduct a study to research the possibilities at Winthrop Circle, I would be supportive.

1031
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:00,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1032
01:22:00,324 --> 01:22:01,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1033
01:22:01,345 --> 01:22:04,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I am definitely in favor of the amendments.

1034
01:22:04,828 --> 01:22:05,408
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

1035
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:06,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we need to be flexible.

1036
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:12,034
[SPEAKER_10]: So the bottom line for me is it just needs to be studied.

1037
01:22:12,114 --> 01:22:13,115
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to take a look at this.

1038
01:22:13,657 --> 01:22:18,659
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a matter of public safety, so I'm fine with the amendments, and I thank my colleagues for bringing them forward.

1039
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:23,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion for approval as amended, Councilor Marks.

1040
01:22:24,081 --> 01:22:24,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1041
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:29,743
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would also be helpful to find out who has ownership of that particular rotary.

1042
01:22:30,743 --> 01:22:42,467
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we refer to it as a Winthrop Street Rotary, but High Street runs right along it too, and if that's a state road, you know, so I would ask that we also find out

1043
01:22:43,185 --> 01:22:47,328
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, what jurisdiction the city of method has on that complete rotary in that area.

1044
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:51,752
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we were going to make changes, do we need to involve D O T?

1045
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, can we get them to pay for it?

1046
01:22:55,174 --> 01:22:58,717
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be better as amended by Councilor Marks Councilor Knight.

1047
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:11,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Mr. President, I wanted to thank Councilor Falco for his flexibility and I move for approval for approval by Councilor Falco seconded by Councilor, uh, Knight as amended by Councilors Falco and Marks.

1048
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:13,155
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

1049
01:23:14,295 --> 01:23:15,056
[SPEAKER_09]: He amended himself.

1050
01:23:16,457 --> 01:23:18,638
[SPEAKER_09]: All roll call vote has been requested.

1051
01:23:18,679 --> 01:23:20,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

1052
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:21,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1053
01:23:21,821 --> 01:23:22,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1054
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:22,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1055
01:23:22,341 --> 01:23:22,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1056
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:22,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1057
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:26,264
[SPEAKER_06]: On the vote of seven, the affirmative.

1058
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:26,404
[SPEAKER_06]: None.

1059
01:23:26,424 --> 01:23:28,185
[SPEAKER_06]: The negative motion passes.

1060
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:45,553
[SPEAKER_09]: 16-714 petitioned by Jean M. Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, Massachusetts, to address the council about police, police personnel, policy, and numbers.

1061
01:23:46,074 --> 01:23:46,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, ma'am.

1062
01:23:47,234 --> 01:23:49,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1063
01:23:50,235 --> 01:23:50,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

1064
01:23:51,155 --> 01:23:52,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1065
01:23:55,657 --> 01:23:56,137
[SPEAKER_01]: The macro

1066
01:23:59,348 --> 01:24:06,893
[SPEAKER_01]: The macro picture of this is that it starts from the top, and it starts from the mayor's office on policing.

1067
01:24:07,854 --> 01:24:11,257
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't talk about policing without talking about the government structure, including you guys.

1068
01:24:12,197 --> 01:24:21,944
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not gonna like this, but with no accountability at the top, with no term limits, simple things like term limits, no turnover, there's no incentive to do things.

1069
01:24:22,805 --> 01:24:25,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the top, that's just the macro view.

1070
01:24:25,507 --> 01:24:26,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we have 58,000 people in this city,

1071
01:24:28,749 --> 01:24:29,650
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow even more.

1072
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait until this casino comes in.

1073
01:24:32,493 --> 01:24:34,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait until some of these developments in Malden come in.

1074
01:24:35,556 --> 01:24:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find out how many cars we have because everybody pays an excise tax.

1075
01:24:41,021 --> 01:24:42,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is registered in the city of Medford.

1076
01:24:42,783 --> 01:24:46,006
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find out literally how many cars are on the city streets.

1077
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:51,952
[SPEAKER_01]: We need, Mr. Falco's right,

1078
01:24:52,409 --> 01:24:54,833
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a traffic engineer.

1079
01:24:55,034 --> 01:24:58,219
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't put in a traffic engineer, it doesn't matter, because you're just doing this.

1080
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,722
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just plugging this hole.

1081
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:00,523
[SPEAKER_01]: You're plugging that hole.

1082
01:25:00,543 --> 01:25:01,325
[SPEAKER_01]: You're plugging that hole.

1083
01:25:01,365 --> 01:25:02,126
[SPEAKER_01]: You're plugging that hole.

1084
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:05,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just going crazy, just playing whack-a-mole.

1085
01:25:06,641 --> 01:25:07,741
[SPEAKER_01]: stop them here, stop them there.

1086
01:25:08,101 --> 01:25:10,422
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no flow pattern to the city.

1087
01:25:10,942 --> 01:25:15,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And this includes, and before you talk about policing, you really do need to look at the macro picture.

1088
01:25:15,864 --> 01:25:23,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And the macro picture is, is that we, we have been, we have no regular scheduled street sweeping.

1089
01:25:24,347 --> 01:25:26,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Cars are up on sidewalks, seriously.

1090
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:30,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Drive around, you'll see them parked up on sidewalks, half on sidewalks.

1091
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:32,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Fulton Street, places where you can't get through.

1092
01:25:32,869 --> 01:25:34,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Riverside Ave, where you can't get through.

1093
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:35,490
[SPEAKER_01]: These are two lane,

1094
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:39,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Highways with the two yellow lines, these are not like little side streets.

1095
01:25:40,563 --> 01:25:42,064
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to look at the big picture.

1096
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:46,006
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't look at the big picture, then you're just throwing good money after bad.

1097
01:25:46,466 --> 01:25:47,086
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you're doing.

1098
01:25:48,067 --> 01:25:52,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, priorities.

1099
01:25:52,389 --> 01:25:56,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna get to the facts about what the police are up to, but you have to talk about priorities.

1100
01:25:58,692 --> 01:26:03,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it when people say, well, we should ask the people what they want out of their government locally.

1101
01:26:03,709 --> 01:26:04,109
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't.

1102
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:15,575
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain mandates that a government, a local government, a state government, or a federal government must provide before you get into any of the offshoots, any of the luxuries.

1103
01:26:17,096 --> 01:26:21,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't get in, and if you don't provide those basics, then you have no luxury.

1104
01:26:21,599 --> 01:26:23,340
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have all the cupcakes you want.

1105
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, if you don't have any spinach, you're going to die.

1106
01:26:26,861 --> 01:26:27,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that simple.

1107
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you really need to look at,

1108
01:26:30,973 --> 01:26:33,618
[SPEAKER_01]: what the city needs as opposed to what the city wants.

1109
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:36,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't like the idea of sending out a survey.

1110
01:26:36,945 --> 01:26:38,387
[SPEAKER_01]: They want this, they want that, they want that.

1111
01:26:38,748 --> 01:26:43,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, they want the sky, but they can't have the sky, because there's only so much money in the bank.

1112
01:26:44,344 --> 01:26:49,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to put that out there, because if you don't look at the macro, then you can't even get to the policing issues.

1113
01:26:50,432 --> 01:26:53,837
[SPEAKER_01]: The police, we have a total of 103 budgeted.

1114
01:26:54,718 --> 01:26:57,181
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have four more come online to 107.

1115
01:26:57,221 --> 01:26:57,842
[SPEAKER_01]: We're budgeted for 107.

1116
01:26:57,882 --> 01:26:58,383
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a city of 58.

1117
01:27:02,528 --> 01:27:02,828
[SPEAKER_01]: 8,000 people.

1118
01:27:03,349 --> 01:27:04,730
[SPEAKER_01]: We are close to Logan Airport.

1119
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:07,272
[SPEAKER_01]: They put on seven new lines, airlines.

1120
01:27:07,753 --> 01:27:08,934
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Somerville.

1121
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:10,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I just talked to a guy.

1122
01:27:10,595 --> 01:27:13,137
[SPEAKER_01]: They have gangs, official organized gangs in Somerville.

1123
01:27:13,638 --> 01:27:15,820
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take much to come over here, folks, okay?

1124
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,762
[SPEAKER_01]: The city ourselves have social ills.

1125
01:27:19,323 --> 01:27:23,927
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people who they call the police because their son is acting out.

1126
01:27:24,267 --> 01:27:27,290
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't take care of their son, so they call the police on their son to get him

1127
01:27:27,783 --> 01:27:28,664
[SPEAKER_01]: hauled out of the house.

1128
01:27:29,405 --> 01:27:32,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're not just doing, they're doing fraud, right?

1129
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:35,530
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing social, they're doing stupidity.

1130
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:42,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody puts a pizza box in their oven to heat up the pizza, sets it on fire.

1131
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:52,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they deal with stupidity, they deal with real crimes, they deal with murder, they deal with rape, they deal with all of the ugly issues that we don't want to deal with.

1132
01:27:54,052 --> 01:27:54,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

1133
01:27:55,353 --> 01:28:00,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk pros and I'm going to talk cons because, you know, it needs to be talked about.

1134
01:28:02,498 --> 01:28:05,961
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two civilian clerks and one halftime clerk.

1135
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:22,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things the chief told me is that he used to have more civilians working for him, but when the budget cuts came and they had to delete and they had to delete, they deleted from the civilian population because they needed the officers.

1136
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,001
[SPEAKER_01]: They need the officers.

1137
01:28:26,603 --> 01:28:27,704
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also need the civilians.

1138
01:28:27,984 --> 01:28:30,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're farming out everything else.

1139
01:28:30,767 --> 01:28:32,089
[SPEAKER_01]: We're farming out DPW.

1140
01:28:32,129 --> 01:28:32,890
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely gone.

1141
01:28:34,071 --> 01:28:36,914
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not farm out some clerical, too?

1142
01:28:38,937 --> 01:28:41,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to increase the budget for the police department.

1143
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,562
[SPEAKER_01]: In so many ways, it's not even funny.

1144
01:28:44,805 --> 01:28:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: The DPW used to do snow removal, used to do garbage removal.

1145
01:28:49,067 --> 01:28:52,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they don't even do a stupid sidewalk, cement, little square.

1146
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:54,491
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't even do that.

1147
01:28:56,652 --> 01:28:58,093
[SPEAKER_01]: What else are we going to farm out?

1148
01:28:58,753 --> 01:28:59,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Where else?

1149
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:03,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does it end where we farm out?

1150
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:05,177
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a government.

1151
01:29:05,297 --> 01:29:06,397
[SPEAKER_01]: You need an elected body.

1152
01:29:07,038 --> 01:29:10,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you need a police force to enforce the laws.

1153
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:13,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you need a DPW, even before a fire station.

1154
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:14,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

1155
01:29:15,012 --> 01:29:20,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you can't get down that street, because there is no street, no access through the street, you can't get to the house on fire.

1156
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:22,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is exactly what's happening.

1157
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:25,361
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not looking at the priorities in this city.

1158
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:29,864
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to like me, but you have to listen to me.

1159
01:29:30,225 --> 01:29:30,785
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my right.

1160
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:32,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the First Amendment, and God bless it.

1161
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:38,331
[SPEAKER_01]: 911 dispatches, we have nine with backups.

1162
01:29:38,872 --> 01:29:39,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Patrol officers, 75.

1163
01:29:42,313 --> 01:29:47,315
[SPEAKER_01]: 75, now this is three, this is around the clock, people.

1164
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:50,156
[SPEAKER_01]: This is around the clock, seven days a week.

1165
01:29:50,976 --> 01:29:54,077
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Monday through Friday, seven days a week, 75 patrol officers.

1166
01:29:54,918 --> 01:30:00,540
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the math and tell me if that's enough for a city this size with as many problems as we have.

1167
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:05,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So close to Boston, I know, I'm lecturing, I know, but it makes me feel good.

1168
01:30:06,502 --> 01:30:07,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it off my chest.

1169
01:30:07,242 --> 01:30:08,803
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 14 detectives.

1170
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:15,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Computer crimes are up, in case you hadn't noticed.

1171
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:16,832
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of cyber crimes.

1172
01:30:19,393 --> 01:30:20,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Sergeants, 16.

1173
01:30:20,613 --> 01:30:21,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Lieutenants, nine.

1174
01:30:22,254 --> 01:30:22,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Captains, three.

1175
01:30:25,435 --> 01:30:30,137
[SPEAKER_01]: The recommendation, be a minimum by the chief, is 115, which I think is way too low.

1176
01:30:31,757 --> 01:30:38,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely think 115 cops, and that's like a huge, they would be excited to get that many.

1177
01:30:38,914 --> 01:30:46,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for 58,000, this close, we've got a six-mile radius of people congested.

1178
01:30:47,038 --> 01:30:52,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Some certain neighborhoods aren't congested, and others are loaded down, absolutely loaded down.

1179
01:30:56,101 --> 01:31:02,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Total vehicles in the department, including unmarked of 45, suburbans have 50,000 to 60,000 miles on average.

1180
01:31:07,318 --> 01:31:09,519
[SPEAKER_01]: The Crown Vics have 100,000 on average.

1181
01:31:11,601 --> 01:31:15,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked him what recommended, if he had a Christmas list, what would it be?

1182
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:16,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, he said a new building.

1183
01:31:17,424 --> 01:31:20,346
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely pie in the sky at this point.

1184
01:31:22,547 --> 01:31:26,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the city has not recognized that the police should come first.

1185
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,231
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not recognized that the police has come first.

1186
01:31:29,671 --> 01:31:32,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes from the top, and that comes from you.

1187
01:31:32,152 --> 01:31:32,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys say it.

1188
01:31:34,028 --> 01:31:35,770
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people also need to talk.

1189
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:39,654
[SPEAKER_01]: The people out there need to demand that police come first.

1190
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:49,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And as bad as it is, if it wasn't for these accidents, especially in the neighborhoods that they were in, we wouldn't be talking about this tonight.

1191
01:31:49,506 --> 01:31:54,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so grateful that people that actually have political pull in this city are coming forward and talking.

1192
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:01,731
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as training, they need to be doing training.

1193
01:32:02,331 --> 01:32:03,872
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to build up their self-esteem.

1194
01:32:04,072 --> 01:32:05,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I have issues with the police.

1195
01:32:05,552 --> 01:32:06,853
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that, OK?

1196
01:32:06,953 --> 01:32:07,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're perfect.

1197
01:32:08,514 --> 01:32:12,876
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will tell you that if you want a better police force, you have to train them.

1198
01:32:13,816 --> 01:32:15,957
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to give them respect, and you have to train them.

1199
01:32:16,257 --> 01:32:19,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the overtimes, yeah, you have to do overtime.

1200
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:24,320
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as those details, we are all culpable.

1201
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Every last one of us are culpable.

1202
01:32:26,821 --> 01:32:27,862
[SPEAKER_01]: We make a kickback.

1203
01:32:28,658 --> 01:32:34,720
[SPEAKER_01]: We make this salary, they don't make a good base salary in this city, but where they make their money is on those details.

1204
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:42,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have to pay it out, so we are happy, because then we get another little cupcake someplace else from not paying them out.

1205
01:32:43,905 --> 01:32:45,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get a kickback, which makes it worse.

1206
01:32:46,307 --> 01:32:57,573
[SPEAKER_01]: We get, not only do we rent out our cops to agencies like National Grid, that's what we're doing, we're renting them out for pay, and then we get money for renting them out on top of that.

1207
01:32:57,593 --> 01:33:05,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only do they pay us, pay our officers their actual real pay, their really hefty pay,

1208
01:33:06,374 --> 01:33:07,515
[SPEAKER_01]: We also get a kickback.

1209
01:33:07,535 --> 01:33:08,816
[SPEAKER_01]: We get 15% on that.

1210
01:33:09,157 --> 01:33:10,338
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get rid of that 15%.

1211
01:33:10,558 --> 01:33:12,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something you guys can vote on.

1212
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:16,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you're not going to because it's not politically to your advantage.

1213
01:33:17,164 --> 01:33:19,266
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to find that money someplace else.

1214
01:33:19,286 --> 01:33:20,307
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a minute and a half.

1215
01:33:20,508 --> 01:33:21,088
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thank you.

1216
01:33:21,949 --> 01:33:23,791
[SPEAKER_01]: But training, they need to train.

1217
01:33:24,964 --> 01:33:25,945
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get them trained.

1218
01:33:26,665 --> 01:33:33,851
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get them trained for active shootings, bombings, everything else under the sun, because they're not ready.

1219
01:33:34,371 --> 01:33:35,192
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to equip them.

1220
01:33:35,732 --> 01:33:38,495
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get them ready, because the world is changing.

1221
01:33:38,855 --> 01:33:46,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And standing out over a hole is a waste of their time, unless it's on Riverside Ave or, you know, some major thoroughfare.

1222
01:33:46,841 --> 01:33:47,702
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a waste of their time.

1223
01:33:48,442 --> 01:33:49,843
[SPEAKER_01]: They can love me or hate me.

1224
01:33:49,983 --> 01:33:50,544
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

1225
01:33:51,044 --> 01:33:51,945
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really believe

1226
01:33:52,305 --> 01:33:54,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here because I want a Christmas card from these people.

1227
01:33:54,446 --> 01:33:55,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here because I believe in this.

1228
01:33:56,126 --> 01:33:58,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is the center issue of the city today.

1229
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:02,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And until you get this right, you can't get anything else right.

1230
01:34:03,109 --> 01:34:04,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can make some people happy.

1231
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:05,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people.

1232
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:08,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, other people will be getting hit by cars.

1233
01:34:08,491 --> 01:34:09,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people will be getting mugged.

1234
01:34:10,092 --> 01:34:13,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people won't be able to kick out their son out of their house.

1235
01:34:13,673 --> 01:34:17,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, unfortunately, the police officer turns into the discipline.

1236
01:34:18,475 --> 01:34:20,977
[SPEAKER_01]: The disciplinarian in a family, single mother.

1237
01:34:21,417 --> 01:34:23,599
[SPEAKER_01]: She can't control her kid, she calls the cop on him.

1238
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,121
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going on.

1239
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:26,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for a fact.

1240
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:32,146
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, until you deal with that reality, good luck to you.

1241
01:34:32,987 --> 01:34:34,088

[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to listen to me.

1243
01:34:35,769 --> 01:34:38,932
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it hits, I'll be there to say, I told you so.

1254
01:35:20,969 --> 01:35:21,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1255
01:35:21,929 --> 01:35:36,558
[SPEAKER_16]: President, I drive on Route 16 every single day to go home, and I've been noticing from the stretch where, from the Meadow Glen Mall, we turn on the Route 16 that goes along the river all the way down to the overpass to the Craddock Bridge.

1256
01:35:37,519 --> 01:35:39,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Every single light is out, Mr. President.

1257
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,602
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they come back on as soon as we get to the Armory.

1258
01:35:43,082 --> 01:35:44,443
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where they run again.

1259
01:35:44,847 --> 01:35:50,732
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we could contact somebody from the DCR to get that whole stretch of light put on, that would be appreciated.

1260
01:35:50,772 --> 01:35:55,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Route 16 is a dark road, especially with the early darkness now.

1261
01:35:56,177 --> 01:35:57,378
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes it more of a safety hazard.

1263
01:35:58,498 --> 01:35:58,719

1272
01:36:19,766 --> 01:36:25,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you look at Mary Ann and Tom, you'd never believe they've been married 50 years because they look like they're about 50 years old.

1273
01:36:25,128 --> 01:36:28,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, they've had a wonderful and very happy marriage.

1275
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:37,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Growing up, running around Placedead Park, the Howells and the Caratis were very welcoming to the kids in the neighborhood.

1276
01:36:37,472 --> 01:36:39,113
[SPEAKER_05]: They opened their backyards and their home to us.

1277
01:36:39,907 --> 01:36:44,849

1278
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:57,294
[SPEAKER_05]: On a side note, one of the first jobs I had as a young kid was working for the Howells at Chisholm's Motel on Route 1 in Saugus, where they used to manage and administer the day-to-day operations there, Mr. President.

1279
01:36:57,334 --> 01:37:03,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's with great happiness for the Howells and for the Karate family that I stand here this evening and congratulate them.

[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that my council colleagues join me

1286
01:37:17,602 --> 01:37:27,107
[SPEAKER_17]: You couldn't meet two gentler, kinder people, in my opinion, and in this day and age to celebrate 50 years of anything is an accomplishment.

01:37:27,848 --> 01:37:29,669

[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, pursuant to state statute and our zoning ordinances here in the city of Medford, we have 90 days from the closing of our public hearing to make a final determination as to whether or not we are going to approve or deny the keynote to go monitor license.

01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:53,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the city solicitor is on a scheduled vacation until the end of next week, Mr. President, I'd ask that this matter remain on the table.

[SPEAKER_05]: However, I did want to have Attorney Biegun have the opportunity to come up here and present the case for his client, and also have this written to the record that we will be willing to take this matter up.

[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion.

1356
01:42:16,114 --> 01:42:18,536
[SPEAKER_04]: of the city at 362 Lawrence Road.

1357
01:42:19,797 --> 01:42:25,661
[SPEAKER_04]: This, as Councilor Knight stated, is a matter that was tabled on September 20th.

1358
01:42:25,701 --> 01:42:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: It is before this council for a special permit pursuant to article four, section 94-148D, subsection 56B, which allows for a special permit for Keno facility within the city of Medford

1359
01:42:43,428 --> 01:42:59,871
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is that back in March of this year, March 8th to be specific, the council did vote in favor of not objecting to Keno to go with a monitor for my client's convenience store subject to the special permit.

1360
01:43:00,511 --> 01:43:07,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that the paperwork for the special permit was filed pro se by my client and it is waiting approval.

1361
01:43:08,873 --> 01:43:10,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure as the council is aware,

1362
01:43:11,562 --> 01:43:17,265
[SPEAKER_04]: only certain very specific reasons for that permit to be denied.

1363
01:43:18,345 --> 01:43:20,466
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, none of which would apply in this case.

1364
01:43:21,287 --> 01:43:21,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1365
01:43:22,527 --> 01:43:22,848

1371
01:43:31,392 --> 01:43:35,714
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could just go through what the city solicitor is reviewing for us, I think it has to do.

1372
01:43:36,714 --> 01:43:40,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't recall the vote of what we asked the solicitor.

1373
01:43:40,300 --> 01:44:05,019
