00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Medford Bites listeners, today will be the last episode until the fall.

2
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:12,448

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,316

[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy the episode and the rest of your summer.

10
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:55,279
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thanks so much for joining me today.

11
00:00:55,319 --> 00:01:00,423
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind just starting by introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a word or two about who you are.

12
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:03,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.

13
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:05,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure to be here.

14
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:08,070
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Nicole Masalam, she and her.

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:17,217
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess you could say, you know, I'm just a hardworking mom who cares about the community and do my best to help as many as I can.

16
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:18,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

17
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:18,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

18
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:19,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

19
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:28,474
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that you aren't a resident of Medford, but a question that I always ask every guest is what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

20
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:41,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so we, you know, since we've been campaigning and door knocking, you know, where we've been trying out all the different, you know, cafes and hidden gems of Medford.

21
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:49,433
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to say, we stumbled across one called Neighborhood Kitchen, which they have really great ethnic food.

22
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:52,375
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to pick a favorite on their menu.

23
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, they're that good.

24
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about their red velvet waffles.

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had their mac and cheese before.

26
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:01,061
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.

27
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:02,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

28
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:03,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good choice.

29
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to introduce your, uh, your, uh,

30
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:12,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my little helper slash campaign intern, Yara.

31
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:17,336
[SPEAKER_00]: She's five years old and she's mommy's big helper.

32
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:18,776
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to say hi, Yara?

33
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:19,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

34
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:21,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad to have you here, Yara.

35
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:24,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always important to have a helper.

36
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:25,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

37
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was hoping we could talk a little bit about your campaign.

38
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:33,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could just sort of name what you're running for, kind of what is prompting you to run.

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

40
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:40,865
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running for state representative of the 35th Middlesex District.

41
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:52,595
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, you know, I've always had, you know, a passion for community service, as well as, you know, building bridges and of understanding within our community.

42
00:02:53,275 --> 00:03:06,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have to say what really started me to understand the motivation for running for this particular office, you kind of have to understand what got me interested in politics in the first place.

43
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:11,223
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come from, my day job is being a mosque director.

44
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:16,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of interfaith work and community aid work because of that.

45
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:20,266
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been doing that here in Massachusetts since we moved here in 2013.

46
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:34,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, you know, I've done work with, you know, government relations, law enforcement relations, media, as well as, you know, like I mentioned, interfaith.

47
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:43,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always been a passion because I view it as helping to create and build a world that my children will be accepted in.

48
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,664
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're mixed.

49
00:03:48,206 --> 00:04:12,059
[SPEAKER_00]: my husband's from Egypt, so I have, you know, one child who's, you know, really light-skinned, blonde hair, blue eyes, and I have another son who's really dark-skinned, dark hair, dark eyes, and so coming from that type of mixed family, I really want my children to, you know, be accepted for who they are, for their faith and their cultural identity, so

50
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:17,462
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's, that was the driving motivation for all of that.

51
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:39,669
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, 2016 happened, and we kind of know what, you know, all of the tension was heightened, the rhetoric that was used, and all of a sudden, instead of viewing each other as neighbors and community members, many people, especially from different faith communities, racial and ethnic communities were otherized.

52
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:41,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And they,

53
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,535
[SPEAKER_00]: they were blamed for things that were beyond their control, or that they had absolutely nothing to do with.

54
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:54,921
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was during all of that time, that my then eight year old son came home crying, very upset.

55
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:01,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we had, obviously, I wanted to know what was bothering him.

56
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:01,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And

57
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:13,021
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after a little bit of digging, he finally explained to me that he was crying because some kids at school told him that they didn't like Muslims.

58
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:19,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Trump were elected, he was going to get rid of all the Muslims.

59
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:25,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And my son who was born here, raised here.

60
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:28,969
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm someone who's very involved in the community.

61
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,711
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes to, like, I bring my children with me everywhere.

62
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:34,072
[SPEAKER_00]: We're part of the fabric of this community.

63
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:41,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And for him to suddenly feel like he didn't belong, that he wasn't welcome, it broke my heart.

64
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:44,379
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suddenly knew that

65
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:59,823
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as much work as I've been doing in the community, it wasn't enough because we had been completely forgetting one very important sphere of influence, which is politics, where policies are made.

66
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:04,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was our political leaders at that time that were creating this mess.

67
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them were hearing our voices.

68
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:12,969
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them understood our experiences because they

69
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:17,506
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't take the time or the effort to do so.

70
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:32,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was really faced with this area of, I guess, negligence that we had been neglecting.

71
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:44,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when I really started on this process of learning more about issues and advocacy and activism and getting involved in politics.

72
00:06:46,248 --> 00:07:02,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really started, you know, diving in, initially beginning with Our Revolution Massachusetts, becoming one of the very first co-chairs of that organization, helping to build a structure that nurtured and created a welcoming environment for activists

73
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:03,775
[SPEAKER_00]: of all backgrounds.

74
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:19,700
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, looking into running for office I ran for school committee here in Malden, and I began learning in that process, so much of our government because up until that point, I was like most of, you know,

75
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans, we just really didn't think about how our elected representatives really impact our lives.

76
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:31,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And so during that process of running for school committee, I learned about the school budget.

77
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:39,224
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned about, you know, other issues that are voted upon in the State House and in City Council.

78
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:41,365
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really began

79
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:47,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning, you know how opaque our state houses.

80
00:07:49,432 --> 00:08:02,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned about the funding formula for our schools that the legislature knew about it, that, you know, in here in Malden, they really were trying to do the best with the budget with what they were given, but they weren't given enough.

81
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And our state legislature knew this.

82
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:09,492
[SPEAKER_00]: They had already done a study on the funding formula and still refused to take action.

83
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:14,877
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was before the Student Opportunity Act, by the way, which didn't even go far enough, in my opinion.

84
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's compounded every year.

85
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:26,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Every class that goes through our schools, we are failing because we haven't invested enough in their futures.

86
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:33,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I suddenly learned it wasn't the school committee that I needed to go to or city council that I needed to go to.

87
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:52,296
[SPEAKER_00]: If I really wanted to make a lasting impact for our community and be able to help change the process so that people knew about it, knew what was going on, knew how votes were being carried out, especially in committees where most legislation, you know, dies pretty much.

88
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:55,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go to the state house.

89
00:08:56,401 --> 00:09:00,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had the, you know, a lot of people start reaching out to me and saying like, look,

90
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:10,300
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't feel represented, we don't feel heard because our voices aren't getting through, especially members of the LGBTQ community.

91
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:24,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's pretty well known that in our district we have a representative who has voted time and time again against the rights, the basic dignity of our LGBTQ brothers and sisters.

92
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,612
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, among various other things.

93
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:43,779
[SPEAKER_00]: So just hearing that, that hurt, and hearing how they also had the same motivation that I had, you know, that we're not seen, we're not heard, we're screaming, but nobody's listening.

94
00:09:44,553 --> 00:10:07,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you bring up a really good point that's very relatable when you're talking about how like our national politics trickle down even to like a state that we, I think, consider ourselves like pretty liberal in Massachusetts, right, but that these national attitudes about Islamophobia, homophobia, racism, when they're, I think what I heard a lot was like,

95
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:33,018
[SPEAKER_02]: you know we know those feelings always existed here but there was more permission to express them after the 2016 election right and and I wonder too about that with the changes that we're seeing now so like threats to Roe v. Wade and how that would change just basic civil rights that we all have including same-sex marriage right and so how do you think about that as you're running like what is what are your sort of ideas or priorities there?

96
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:40,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, regarding basic human rights and dignity, we have to protect it.

97
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:49,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people, as you mentioned, Roe v. Wade doesn't just impact access to abortion and complete reproductive health care.

98
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,711
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects, as you were saying, marriage equality, birth control, and various other things that we take for granted.

99
00:10:57,171 --> 00:11:01,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the concept, the legal precedent that is set

100
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:13,795
[SPEAKER_00]: was the right to privacy, which, you know, and, and we've had a lot of debate about this in my household, because my husband is currently in law school.

101
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:17,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just took a constitutional law class.

102
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,836
[SPEAKER_00]: So Roe v. Wade was one of the cases that he studied.

103
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:23,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about it, you know, pretty in depth.

104
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:29,458
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the right to privacy is not specifically enumerated in

105
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:31,486
[SPEAKER_00]: our Constitution.

106
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:37,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And Roe v. Wade was what established and enshrined that and codified it in our legal system.

107
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:45,059
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overturn Roe v. Wade, like you're affecting your basically everybody's right to privacy.

108
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,464
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there are many people even who are more conservatively minded, who are like,

109
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:52,697
[SPEAKER_00]: they wouldn't want that.

110
00:11:52,917 --> 00:12:01,202
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really need to look beyond like the trigger and to the actual like meat and potatoes of the situation.

111
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:06,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is something we do, we need to protect.

112
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:14,463
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we do need somebody who's elected, who's going to represent us, who will fight for those rights.

113
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:17,426
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not someone who would just fight for our rights.

114
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,630
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we're a whole community and we're surrounded by other states.

115
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:24,892
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be different states, but we're one nation.

116
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I believe we need to offer those protections.

117
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:43,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're seeing other states come up with sanctuary laws, basically, stating that they won't extradite individuals or that they'll offer them these health care services that are vitally important.

118
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:46,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about folks who are undocumented.

119
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Undocumented as well, yes.

120
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here's the thing.

121
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:56,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Nationally, like at the federal level, they're the ones who deal with immigration.

122
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:58,998
[SPEAKER_00]: And the immigration system is broken.

123
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:01,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult.

124
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,860
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people realize how difficult it is to come here legally.

125
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,321
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had to, I've been through it.

126
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:10,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it firsthand.

127
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:14,703
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for my husband, I had to sponsor him.

128
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,164
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've helped other individuals.

129
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:20,364
[SPEAKER_00]: with immigration.

130
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:25,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the fees are absolutely exorbitantly high, the waiting periods are high.

131
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:32,649
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give the people, you know, when you do apply, they don't give you the opportunity to work.

132
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:38,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the processing takes so long, it's almost six months before you can get a work permit.

133
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:42,132
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet they're saying you can't have any public assistance.

134
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:59,039
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are literally forced into a situation where you have to rely upon other people, which, you know, I was raised, you do whatever you can to support yourself, you know, relying on others is your last resort, basically.

135
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people have that same value system.

136
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:11,163
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we do need to open ourselves up to take a critical look at what we've

137
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:12,715
[SPEAKER_00]: taken for granted.

138
00:14:14,098 --> 00:14:18,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is not how it was when my grandparents first came to this country.

139
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:20,708
[SPEAKER_00]: when they were children.

140
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:28,311
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not how it was when our parents and our grandparents were growing up here.

141
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:33,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the home costs are exorbitantly high.

142
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:45,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Rent, housing in particular, when it's taking up, I think in some people's instances, almost two thirds of their income.

143
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,360
[SPEAKER_00]: When we know it shouldn't be more than half,

144
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And even that's really high.

145
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,459
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's struggle.

146
00:14:55,502 --> 00:14:57,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Wages aren't keeping up.

147
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:00,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost of living is soaring.

148
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:03,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm seeing it firsthand with the families that I help.

149
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,629
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I believe there is that disconnect.

150
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:11,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we do need someone who understands the realities that working families are facing right now.

151
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:14,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still, you know, our family is still paying student loans.

152
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:16,996
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband and I were still paying our student loans.

153
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,317
[SPEAKER_00]: My oldest just turned 14.

154
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going into high school next year.

155
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:33,226
[SPEAKER_00]: While still paying student loans and now paying a mortgage and trying to raise our three children, we have to worry about saving up for his college now too.

156
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,729
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a cycle that's just going to repeat itself.

157
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, how can we break this?

158
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,273
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very blessed.

159
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:44,674
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I told you my husband's in law school.

160
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,394
[SPEAKER_00]: We work very, very hard.

161
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:50,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are definitely blessed more than most.

162
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,196
[SPEAKER_00]: But and we struggle.

163
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:56,116
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we live paycheck to paycheck.

164
00:15:56,677 --> 00:16:01,858
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't imagine, you know, how it is for other families, especially during COVID.

165
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:12,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And you met you mentioned the person that you're running against Paul Donato right he's been yes his position for like I want to say like 20 plus years.

166
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Representative Donato is currently serving his 22nd year in office.

167
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:18,195
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

168
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:25,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think maybe 20 something years ago, he was somebody who reflected the needs of our community.

169
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:32,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was a he he maybe represented a majority of maybe his people in his neighborhood.

170
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:34,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's changing.

171
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can see that power of having somebody who

172
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:59,585
[SPEAKER_02]: at least like resembles their constituents right and like can speak to the needs of like the varied needs of the community actually had the chance to go to a fundraiser for Sonia Chang Diaz, and she was talking about like really similar issues right talking about the cost of living right the cost of mortgages rents, paying student loans that caught like having to worry about college and how there's

173
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:06,668
[SPEAKER_02]: she was saying that, like, there's just this message from Beacon Hill of, like, you just need to wait on those things.

174
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:15,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And her real, like, immediacy around, no, we need to, like, close this sort of the racial wage gap.

175
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,770
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to think about free education.

176
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:23,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you call a school like UMass a public school when you pay $30,000-plus a year for it, right?

177
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of sounds similar to what you're saying.

178
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:27,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to hear it.

179
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:33,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering about any reflections on the last time that you ran.

180
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:36,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you thinking about anything differently?

181
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:39,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there things that surprised you about that process?

182
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:52,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, the first time I ran, I was just surprised by the outpouring of support and how ready people were, you know, and saying, we do need someone who's

183
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,715
[SPEAKER_00]: who's going to raise our concerns at the state house.

184
00:17:57,356 --> 00:18:01,038
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the most difficult thing was COVID hit during that time.

185
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:12,385
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I've loved the most about this process is meeting all of our neighbors and in doing anti-racism work and equity work and, you know, community building work.

186
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:15,467
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the very first things that I learned, you know,

187
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:20,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an advisory board member for CARE, the Council on American Islamic Relations.

188
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:25,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, you know, part of that mission is to combat Islamophobia.

189
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:33,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we learned that the best way to do that in study after study is just one-on-one interaction.

190
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:34,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Like meeting your neighbors.

191
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:36,987
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same in the campaign world.

192
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:45,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one thing that I've learned about campaigning, the ground game, the canvassing, door knocking, is the end all be all of a campaign.

193
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:47,257
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes or breaks it.

194
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:50,921
[SPEAKER_00]: And we weren't able to do that in 2020 because of COVID.

195
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:58,998
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm very perceptively different.

196
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:03,060
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wear a scarf on my head and I look very ethnic.

197
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:11,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I joke sometimes that I'm an ethnic chameleon at times because someone will come up to me and they'll start talking in their language, assuming I'm from their country.

198
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:15,406
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like, what?

199
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:17,988
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because of that,

200
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:25,830
[SPEAKER_00]: perception, you know, people have misconceptions or stereotypes that go with that.

201
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:36,432
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I wasn't able to go and meet them on the doors or have these very important conversations to break down those barriers, you know, that's what made 2020 difficult.

202
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:39,373
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew, and I was

203
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:49,677
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very humbled that even without those conversations that 45% of the district still voted for me.

204
00:19:51,852 --> 00:20:00,216
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just, I think, spoke volumes of how much our district felt, you know, about their current representation.

205
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:09,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just that, but I mean, it was record breaking voter turnout that year, which was very surprising.

206
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:16,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, looking back at previous voter turnout for this type of race, we're looking at a maximum of 44 to 5000 people voting total.

207
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:16,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

208
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:21,948
[SPEAKER_00]: in the primary, and we had almost 10,000.

209
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:24,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's great.

210
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:30,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, the turnout was almost double than what it had been previously.

211
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:39,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you mentioned that you noticed that because of the lack of ability to see people face-to-face, there were some maybe assumptions that they made about you.

212
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:41,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you share what some of those might have been?

213
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:45,547
[SPEAKER_00]: I received death threats.

214
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:49,109
[SPEAKER_00]: My car was vandalized.

215
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:56,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, it is what it is and the type of work that I do.

216
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:59,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, I've experienced it before.

217
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,463
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, again, you know, people make assumptions.

218
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:09,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it, you know, facing that part of it is hard.

219
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:14,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what makes it worthwhile for me though, is that, um,

220
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:36,412
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the community for so long, and I have great relationships, friends and allies from, you know, across the spectrum, that, and I even have like very conservatively minded individuals, you know, neighbors.

221
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:39,853
[SPEAKER_00]: who support me, we have great relationships.

222
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:53,939
[SPEAKER_00]: And they saw some of these comments, and they called these people out and said, like, look, you, you know, what you're saying is incorrect, you need to, like, if you want to say something, you know, say something, but do it respectfully or reach out to her.

223
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,480
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, don't

224
00:21:56,408 --> 00:21:58,629
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, say these awful things, don't be that angry.

225
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, in some instances, I've actually had individuals who will come to me and apologize.

226
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:09,216
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be like, you know what, thank you for your apology.

227
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:12,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what can we do to, you know, overcome this barrier?

228
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we now, you know, maybe have a conversation about for coffee, you know, something like that.

229
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,902
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them end up becoming friends.

230
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:21,747
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

231
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:30,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say that's probably one of the things that I hear about Representative Donato is like that people can go to him and he can help solve problems that he has like those connections.

232
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:40,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like that's what you're sort of naming for yourself to write building those connections with community members, being able to sort of get things done and be open and available for people who need to reach out to you.

233
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:46,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I respect that network too, as you were saying, Representative Donato, you know, has that.

234
00:22:46,718 --> 00:22:49,461
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm starting to get community members reaching out to me.

235
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:57,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I had someone who, you know, is prominent in the Asian community and was saying, I have this program that I really want to do.

236
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:58,149
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?

237
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have network and connection for me?

238
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I was like, yeah, I do.

239
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, here's, here's what I have for you.

240
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:14,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you know what, but I think for the type of work that you're doing, why don't you reach out to rep Donato and, you know, and see, because he might have more connections.

241
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,987
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a broader community maybe.

242
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:22,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and she was like, no, I, I did reach out to him and he had nothing for me.

243
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:26,796
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been far more helpful and.

244
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:38,463
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so to me, I think, you know, as you were saying, what you mentioned earlier, like when he was first elected, maybe he, and I don't doubt that he had good intentions.

245
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:41,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't doubt that he worked hard for the community or anything like that.

246
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:46,709
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the true test isn't our age or how long we've been in an office.

247
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:50,892
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is our adaptability and our responsiveness to the community.

248
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:58,098
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great that he's maintained relationships, but there are always new relationships or improvements to be had.

249
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:25,280
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is where we're beginning to see the disconnect, to be able to keep up with the new community, the new neighbors, new families that are coming in and helping them to feel welcome and making sure that you proactively reach out to them and adapt to the changes that we're seeing within our community while maintaining your relationships.

250
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

251
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:34,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I know that initially, when I moved to Medford, I would get a birthday card from Representative Donato on my birthday.

252
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:36,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I knew about him was like, oh, he's a Democrat.

253
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:36,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

254
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:41,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's an importance to thinking about that.

255
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:43,185
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, he's a Democrat, but what does that mean?

256
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:45,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And I assume you're running as a Democrat as well.

257
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:48,647
[SPEAKER_02]: there are different types of Democrats.

258
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:55,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that information that you provided about, like, how is he voted for for basic civil rights, right?

259
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:58,333
[SPEAKER_02]: How is he voted for in support of gay marriage, things like that?

260
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't think people commonly know those things.

261
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:01,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

262
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:04,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important to be explicit about there's differences.

263
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:07,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Those differences exist even among Democratic candidates.

264
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,041
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.

265
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:12,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the thing, you know,

266
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:21,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a lot about the Democratic Party here in Massachusetts in recent years, since 2016.

267
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:24,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined our Democratic City Committee here in Malden.

268
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:28,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I became the chair of the Ward 7 Dems.

269
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, I joined the Democratic State Committee.

270
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:37,495
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you that there is a rising

271
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:46,043
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, movement of, you know, people who want to see Democrats live up to our ideals.

272
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:49,706
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every year we have this big convention.

273
00:25:49,846 --> 00:26:02,278
[SPEAKER_00]: And every so often, we go through and we create this document of things that we stand for things that we're willing to fight for, you know, for our communities to for their improvement and betterment.

274
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:08,137
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are not holding anybody accountable to that.

275
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:21,543
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Democrats, and I say that very loosely, that are elected to office who vote more Republican than Republicans do.

276
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:46,890
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can take a look at the voting records and we have everything in between, you know, people who vote for almost every single democratic value that we have according to, you know, our, as we've outlined as a convention and as Democrats across Massachusetts, across the Commonwealth have voted upon and said, these are what we find important.

277
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:52,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some elected officials who will vote for everything.

278
00:26:53,213 --> 00:27:17,656
[SPEAKER_00]: um you have some who vote for none of it vote against it and you know everything in between and I believe Donato falls in in the in between phase you know um but here's the thing I there are some things that we just cannot compromise on and like I said those are human rights basic human dignity and

279
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:32,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great to show up for the community and show up at events to support individuals when wrongs are being committed, like we're seeing with mass evictions recently in Medford and in Malden.

280
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:41,230
[SPEAKER_00]: We have predatory developers and realtors buying up rentals, our rental stock, and then jacking it up exorbitantly high.

281
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,752
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing, it's great to show up, but what really counts is your vote.

282
00:27:46,793 --> 00:28:05,328
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you vote against, you know, common sense legislation to lift the, um, the ban on, uh, uh, uh, rent control, it doesn't matter if you, if you're showing up at events, you, you haven't taken concrete action.

283
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:05,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

284
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:07,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like performative.

285
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:08,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

286
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:15,037
[SPEAKER_00]: To create a better outcome when you're voting against marriage equality, basic

287
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:22,161
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, rights and dignities for individuals to love who they love and build a relationship.

288
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:33,916
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've spoken with Representative Donato and I respect his beliefs, just, you know, I share similar beliefs when it comes to my faith, but I can't legislate that on people.

289
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,474
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can't force that.

290
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:47,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest with you, I would rather people be able to openly love who they love in a committed relationship than to have to hide it.

291
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,323
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, not being able to be committed to each other or engage in

292
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:57,850
[SPEAKER_00]: risky behaviors, you know?

293
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have legal protection as well.

294
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal protection too.

295
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:06,094
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my sister married her wife in Utah.

296
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:10,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what I mean.

297
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:16,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I see firsthand how it impacts people and why it is basic dignity.

298
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:23,902
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Utah at the time, there was a law in the state constitution that said if two people were married,

299
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:36,732
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though the mom maybe became pregnant outside of marriage, even if it was a different father, that once you were married and the child was born in the marriage, the presumptive father was the one she married.

300
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:40,515
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would go on the birth certificate and they would have full parental rights.

301
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:44,118
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what happened with my sister.

302
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:45,119
[SPEAKER_00]: She married her wife.

303
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Her wife was actually pregnant as a result of a non-consensual encounter.

304
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,522
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they put my sister's name on the birth certificate.

305
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:58,465
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted her to have full parental rights.

306
00:29:59,146 --> 00:30:07,796
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the biological donor, sperm donor, as I'd like to say, came into the picture and tried to sue for parental rights.

307
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:10,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And my sister, who was the one who

308
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:14,597
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, loved her wife, loved her son.

309
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:15,798
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my nephew.

310
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:25,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Had worked to keep a roof over their head, food in their mouth, health care services, you know, everything.

311
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:32,192
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a parent in every sense of the word, including love, which is the most important.

312
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:46,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were family and they were going to give him parental rights because here's the clincher in the lot said presumptive father, not presumptive parent.

313
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:46,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

314
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:53,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my sister, God bless her, fought so hard.

315
00:30:54,701 --> 00:31:00,663
[SPEAKER_00]: for custody, for full parental rights, and had to hire an attorney.

316
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:07,424
[SPEAKER_00]: And the judge didn't want to rule because he was so scared because if he did it, it was going to change the Utah Constitution.

317
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:10,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was going to change the law.

318
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:12,686
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I don't want to do this.

319
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:16,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to legislate from the bench, as we hear so often.

320
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,368
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and it was pricey.

321
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:22,209
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of our family, we pulled together.

322
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:28,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid a hefty chunk and gave as much as we could from our family budget to pay for the attorney fees.

323
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:33,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And they changed the law.

324
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:33,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

325
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:42,540
[SPEAKER_00]: My sister's case made it so that everybody has equal opportunity for parental rights.

326
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,961
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the law doesn't state presumptive father anymore.

327
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:46,102
[SPEAKER_00]: It says presumptive parent.

328
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this in Utah or is this- In Utah.

329
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:49,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

330
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:53,114
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most conservative states, you know, very Republican.

331
00:31:53,314 --> 00:31:53,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

332
00:31:54,975 --> 00:32:01,440
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm like, when you, it's an experience.

333
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,904
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, it doesn't matter that my sister has a wife versus a husband.

334
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:15,929
[SPEAKER_00]: What matters to me is that she loves someone, she committed to them, and that there was a child

335
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:28,884
[SPEAKER_00]: who was being, you know, maybe he wasn't conceived in ideal circumstances, but he was born into love, into a very loving relationship.

336
00:32:28,924 --> 00:32:34,629
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't matter that they were two men or two women, a man and a woman.

337
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:35,430
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.

338
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:39,413
[SPEAKER_00]: They were his parents.

339
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:41,475
[SPEAKER_00]: My sister was his mom.

340
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:46,705
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain things where labels don't matter.

341
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:53,270
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the love and the values that are underneath it all that matter.

342
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,212
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's my nephew, I love him.

343
00:32:57,272 --> 00:33:11,482
[SPEAKER_00]: And while my sister and her wife are no longer together, which was also a precedent-setting case in Utah, when they dissolved their marriage, they got divorced, and she still has custody of her son.

344
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:24,981
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like the first case in Utah, again, where, you know, a same-sex parent, you know, who was not the birth parent still has custody of her son.

345
00:33:25,321 --> 00:33:39,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really important thing to think about too, because I think we think about, oh, well, like if the pressure for same-sex couples to have marriages that last forever and divorce, like, you know, we also deserve those same options of like, okay, well, we want to get married.

346
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't work out, we also want to have the rights to get divorced, right?

347
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:44,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have rights to our children still.

348
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,651
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all like neighbors.

349
00:33:48,691 --> 00:33:49,933
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all human beings.

350
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:51,254
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.

351
00:33:51,274 --> 00:33:54,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we all should be protected equally under the law.

352
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:56,619
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what our constitution says.

353
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,022
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have equal rights.

354
00:33:59,182 --> 00:34:01,665
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need someone who's going to stand up for that.

355
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:03,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to say, you know what?

356
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:18,589
[SPEAKER_00]: equal protection under the law, whether it comes to marriage equality, whether it comes to the ability of trans individuals to exist in public spaces according to their gender identity, you know, they

357
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,471
[SPEAKER_00]: deserve respect and dignity.

358
00:34:23,572 --> 00:34:30,813
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just the LGBTQ plus community, as you were saying, now we're seeing Roe v. Wade and we're seeing the right to privacy under attack.

359
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:40,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many things that we've taken for granted over the years, you know, and so many people use it as validation to just, I don't need to go vote.

360
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:41,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?

361
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:46,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Your vote matters because now everything that we've taken for granted, we're about to lose.

362
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,482
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have friends who are saying they've never had to encounter this in their lifetime.

363
00:34:53,782 --> 00:34:55,062
[SPEAKER_00]: They never thought they would.

364
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:00,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's, it's mind boggling.

365
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:07,787
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, I'm like, we live in such unprecedented and dangerous times where we can't take anything for granted.

366
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:15,500
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't take it for granted that someone's gonna vote for us when they have a track record of not.

367
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there should be no doubt.

368
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:18,922
[SPEAKER_00]: We need someone in there.

369
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:22,829
[SPEAKER_00]: who's going to respect that and who's going to vote accordingly.

370
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:24,869
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we don't.

371
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:26,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only speak to recorded votes.

372
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:35,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I know vote after vote against the rights of individuals, against affordability for our housing on record, mind you.

373
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:38,613
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many other things.

374
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:39,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, part of

375
00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:44,477
[SPEAKER_00]: were in one of the most regressive tax systems in the U.S.

376
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:45,498
[SPEAKER_00]: is Massachusetts.

377
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we hear Taxachusetts, but that's no longer the case.

378
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:58,012
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, those of us who are in the bottom income brackets, studies have shown through, I believe, the Mass Budget Policy Center.

379
00:35:58,632 --> 00:36:02,156
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, I always get the acronyms wrong, but

380
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:23,055
[SPEAKER_00]: But the study shows that those of us in the bottom income brackets, we're paying, in effect, almost 10% of our annual income in taxes, while those who are at the top, who can afford it, mind you, like our millionaires, are paying, in effect, 6% of their annual income.

381
00:36:24,023 --> 00:36:37,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And so can you, if we were all paying exactly the same percentage of our annual income, which is what the state constitution says, we were all paying our fair share, we would be able to fund our schools and invest in the future of our children.

382
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:51,963
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be able to, you know, take care of our lead pipes that are over a hundred years old that are currently poisoning our water supply or pave our roads so that I don't have to go and realign my car like three times in one year.

383
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,567
[SPEAKER_00]: and pay exorbitant prices to the mechanic.

384
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:06,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Even just the smallest things like the state of our roads end up costing our families more money when they're already on a strained budget.

385
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,451
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all great points.

386
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:19,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if, so one question I like to ask people that are like political candidates is just sort of a more personal question.

387
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:27,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I appreciate you told us a lot of personal reflections, but is there something that you want to share that like might surprise us?

388
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:31,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So something about us that you wouldn't typically share or like is like a fun fact.

389
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:33,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

390
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:42,458
[SPEAKER_00]: So, despite how I look now, I was actually raised Roman Catholic, and I have, I come from a very musical family.

391
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:52,329
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love to sing together, so I am a trained singer, and I sang for Pope John Paul the second and saying mass at the Vatican Sunday mass.

392
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:55,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, those are surprising facts about you.

393
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:57,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for sharing that.

394
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:58,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Nicole, thank you.

395
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:05,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you'd want to share or anything else you think is important for us to know?

396
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:14,759
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I have a passion for for helping people and win or lose.

397
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still going to continue to do that.

398
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,682
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if what I've said, you know, resonates with anybody who's listening.

399
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,762
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't.

400
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:29,902
[SPEAKER_00]: do this without you.

401
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:37,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it takes a lot, and we really want to reach every single voter in a meaningful relationship building way.

402
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:42,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need volunteers to come and help us knock on doors, and I am.

403
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:46,023
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and this takes money, too.

404
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,024
[SPEAKER_00]: We need resources.

405
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:50,787
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not taking any special interest money.

406
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:57,232
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking any money from these, you know, big PACs or special interest groups of any means.

410
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:20,307
