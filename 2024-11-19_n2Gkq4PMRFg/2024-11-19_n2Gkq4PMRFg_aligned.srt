00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,539
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

72
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,099
Yes.

73
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,741
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

74
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:35,147
Yes.

75
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:37,149
Yes.

76
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,252
He says yes.

77
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,374
Yes.

78
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:44,195
Yes.

79
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:46,957
He says yes also.

80
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:48,799
Yes.

81
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,922
So in the affirmative motion passes.

82
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:53,603
Public participation.

83
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,626
Does anyone want to speak in public participation?

84
00:03:58,727 --> 00:03:59,228
Good evening.

85
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:00,989
Name and address of the record please.

86
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:13,473
I wanna speak about the traffic concerns that we had at the intersection of Carding West, North, and Auburn Street.

87
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:23,218
The city traffic engineer has done two designs, and I have taken those designs around the neighborhood.

88
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:26,800
I've showed them to over 200 residents.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,003
The residents that have seen this say both, they reject both of them.

90
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,717
They said that the cause is not being addressed.

91
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:44,019
The cause of all these traffic problems stem from Route 16.

92
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:45,059
What?

93
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,122
Route 16 is the source of all these traffic violations.

94
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:59,200
The Auburn's, the Cotting Street residents say that the residents, drivers are going down the wrong way.

95
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:05,265
But there's also wrong way drivers on West Street, on Norton Ave, on Marshall Street.

96
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,367
So this is what I'm hearing from residents.

97
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:10,429
So they say, you're gonna close off Cotting Street.

98
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:14,292
What about Norton Ave, West Street, Marshall Street?

99
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:15,653
You're gonna close those off too?

100
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:21,598
You're not solving any problems by the designs that we have presented to us thus far.

101
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:31,396
I have called the mayor's office and I told the mayor I want to meet with her in person because I want to relay to her what I'm hearing from the residents.

102
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:34,218
She's going to get back to me.

103
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:36,540
I talked to her before Thanksgiving.

104
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,381
She's going to get back to me after Thanksgiving.

105
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:43,285
So I'm hoping that we can arrange for an in-person meeting at the site.

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,574
that I can explain the concerns of these over 200 residents that I've spoken to.

107
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:57,179
And we're not gonna have a huge meeting there because it would just be too cumbersome, but I can, I'm just gonna have- You can do it on a Saturday morning again.

108
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,501
No, no, I don't wanna have a big to-do.

109
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:02,923
I just wanna have a quiet little thing so that she can observe.

110
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:08,227
I'm gonna have one resident from each one of the streets who sees what happened on their streets there.

111
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,643
And it would be a public meeting.

112
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:13,104
So anyone who wanted to attend could come.

113
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:16,065
So we'd have to advertise it.

114
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:19,325
No, I want to see her instead of meeting in her office.

115
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:26,587
I could explain all this to her in office, but I think for her to see it in person would, I'm not expecting all the counselors to be there.

116
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:32,129
It sounds like a meeting between the mayor and the council.

117
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:33,669
That's fine.

118
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,650
I'm just updating the council on what's transpired since,

119
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:42,681
The traffic design was made and the traffic commission meeting was held.

120
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:49,866
The traffic commission meeting, I was the only one that showed up because I hounded Todd when the meeting was gonna be.

121
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:51,667
It was not advertised.

122
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:56,830
I was the only resident that showed up that said that they were opposed to the designs that were presented.

123
00:06:57,511 --> 00:07:02,734
So the traffic commission decided to postpone any decision on the designs until the next meeting.

124
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:06,497
And they said that they were gonna advertise it, whatever.

125
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,864
But again, I'm gonna back up here.

126
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,804
The real crux of the problem is Route 16.

127
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:22,187
Back about 10 years ago when they first did the study for the Green Line, back then they put a meter across the road right near Boston Ave.

128
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:26,628
Then there were 12,000 cars a day that crossed Route 16.

129
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:28,369
I don't know what it is today.

130
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:32,610
But the traffic that goes down Route 16, for the most part, is pass-through traffic.

131
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,271
It's not local traffic because the locals avoid it.

132
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:46,396
And I know that it's a state road, so the city would have to negotiate with the state, but there was green space to the side of the road.

133
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:52,561
If they had to widen the road, you would not be displacing people or taking any eminent domain.

134
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,062
It's already state land there.

135
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:59,407
And I think it would go a long way to improve the neighborhood situation.

136
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:06,733
If you could just have the flow through traffic leave on Route 16 without trying to take detours through the side streets.

137
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:12,768
So I just wanted to update the council on what's transpired in the last two or three weeks.

138
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:19,331
All right, I don't expect you to respond to anything here because I have a calling to the mayor here.

139
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:23,413
I'm gonna be meeting with the mayor at some point to update her and see where we can go.

140
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:28,015
If you could let us know when you're meeting with the mayor is at the same, if anyone wants to attend.

141
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:33,144
she'll come to the site, but we're not moving on.

142
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:33,904
I don't know.

143
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:37,606
If you could let us know, we'd be, whoever wants to attend, we'd be happy to attend.

144
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:41,008
Well, it may be during the week when it's probably not convenient for all of you.

145
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:41,968
I'm around during the day.

146
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:43,129
So if you want, I can come.

147
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:43,829
All right.

148
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:44,449
Okay.

149
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:45,430
Well, that's just an update.

150
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,030
Thank you very much for coming.

151
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,411
Thank you.

152
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:51,452
Hey, any further business?

153
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:55,134

154
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,635
The records.

155
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,477
Records of the meeting of November 9th.

156
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:02,717
We'll pass to Councilor Falco.

157
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:04,298
Councilor Falco, how did you find those records?

158
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,178
I read the records.

159
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:07,778
They appear to be in order and I move approval.

160
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:09,338
Second.

161
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:13,159

166
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:23,821

Vice President Mack.

168
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:26,602
Yes.

170
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:29,042
Yes.
