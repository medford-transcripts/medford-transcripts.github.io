00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:08,053
Medford City Council, Administration and Finance Committee, January 30th, 2024.

2
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:09,314
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:10,776
Vice President Collins.

4
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:12,397
Present.

5
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:14,178
Councilor Lozano.

6
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:15,079
Present.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,540
Councilor Lemming.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,321
Present.

9
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:18,762
Councilor Sands.

10
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:19,482
Present.

11
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,024
President Behrs.

12
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:21,764
Present.

13
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,307
Five present, yes.

14
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:26,508
Councilor Keohokalole.

15
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:29,564
Yes, five present, none absent.

16
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:41,885
Meeting is called to order and we welcome Councillor Callaghan, as all Councillors are welcome at all committee meetings, as they are technically all committees of the whole, but the voting members are the ones who were called, the role was called for.

17
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:46,114
So this is our administration finance committee meeting.

18
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:49,217
It's our first standing committee meeting under the new committee meeting structure.

19
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:51,780
So it's exciting time.

20
00:00:53,062 --> 00:01:03,193
The action and discussion items for tonight are the same as for our other committees, which is the governing agenda document that was amended at the

21
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:11,476
January 24, 2024 committee of the whole meeting, taking a look at that and more detail and more depth looking at each of the.

22
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:18,859
Uh, items projects, major projects, ordinances, and other oversight engagement items on the governing agenda.

23
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:24,141
And also some papers and committee have made it on to the agendas for these meetings.

24
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,262
Mostly these are the ones from.

25
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:42,433
2022 and prior there may be papers and committee from 2023 that haven't made it on here yet and then there's also items on the governing agenda document that may have not made it onto papers and committee yet.

26
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:52,619
Hopefully committee chairs can work with folks in the clerk's office and over the next meeting or two as the standing committees start to meet we can

27
00:01:54,184 --> 00:02:11,677
flesh this out, get all of the different papers that have been referred to all of the different committees onto the agendas, and then both the agenda and the tracking document in the clerk's office will be a great place for folks to look and see what has been referred to committee, what is kind of sitting on the table in committee for future discussion.

28
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:14,479
So that's the intent here to start.

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,065
I am hoping this will be somewhat of a model for tomorrow night's meetings and for meetings in two weeks for standing committee chairs

30
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:34,170
It's really just to get our feet wet, start with the committee, look at everything that's been referred out to us, or that the council has said, hey, we think the committee is going to be working on this, and then we can go from there.

31
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:44,914
But as the subcommittee on licensing, permitting, and signs will probably soon be aware, there are some things that are going to come up a little faster than that.

32
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:49,496
So we'll be getting our feet wet and doing substantive business at the same time.

33
00:02:52,478 --> 00:03:00,306
So on action discussion items 24-006 resolution that each council committee review the 2024-2025 council governing agenda as amended at the January 24th, 2024 committee of the whole meetings.

34
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:01,707
So I have here and I'll share my screen.

35
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:23,514
Copy of that document, and if folks looked at the digital packets for this meeting, you'd see there's like, kind of a lot of supporting materials.

36
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:25,456
We'll figure out exactly.

37
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:36,589
The format in which these agendas are going to look like, or the packets are going to look like in the future, because right now they're including all of the supporting materials, even for items that are that are just on the table and the papers and committee and.

38
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,073
that has created some pretty long agendas, so we may not want to have the packets look like that.

39
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:49,778
But for this document, we're here in the Administration and Finance Committee, and we had a few items that we discussed.

40
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:58,084
We had major projects, the annual budget process, revenue generation slash Proposition 2 1⁄2, classification and compensation study implementation.

41
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:03,968
We had ordinances, budget ordinance, commercial vacancy tax, good landlord tax credit, local option.

42
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:12,012
Community Benefits Agreement Ordinance, Percent for Art Ordinance, Paid Family Medical Leave, Extended Illness Leave Bank.

43
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:22,478
And we also had some oversight and engagement around financial review and long-term budget planning and forecasting, and reviewing relevant city ordinances and regulations.

44
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:25,728
So we have that from the governing agenda.

45
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:26,909
We can take a look at it in a minute.

46
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:31,891
We also had some papers in committee from previous councils.

47
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:37,274
We had a paper from 2017 about a municipal mini bonds program.

48
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:45,118
There's a paper from 2019, a recommendation to accept the provisions of general law, chapter 71, section 37 M, which is about

49
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:54,058
school committee, school department, and city side sharing different financial and other staff.

50
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:59,840
There's a resolution from 2020 that the council hire additional legal services.

51
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:17,946
One of my resolutions to create a draft ordinance for a pilot commission is on payment in lieu of taxes, a draft ordinance around the extended illness leave bank, that's in the governing agenda, resolution on state paid family medical leave program, and a resolution to draft a budget ordinance for the city of Medford.

52
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,874
So that was just some of the stuff from the papers and committee as well.

53
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:29,620
But that, I think, is a general scope of everything that this committee is planning to take a look at this term.

54
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:46,932
And I'm interested in folks, new members may have questions about some of these papers and committee from prior councils, or really just what folks are thinking, first glance, first thought, looking at the governing agenda and the agenda for this meeting.

55
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:49,993
What are our questions?

56
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:51,674
What are things we need to dig in deeper for?

57
00:05:52,314 --> 00:06:02,921
Are there, you know, requests for additional information or records from prior meetings that we want to kind of get on the table and make sure that everyone has all the information they need as we move forward?

58
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:04,242
Councilor Zara.

59
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:17,871
As far as the papers that are in committee from prior councils, prior years, how do they come forward to be discussed as part of this committee?

60
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:23,026
So anything that's on here, someone could motion right now to kind of bring up one of these items.

61
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:30,873
And if we wanted to take some sort of formal action on it, I think even just the fact that they're on the agenda that we're, you know, we're able to just talk about them.

62
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:36,878
That's kind of the idea around this is committees could take up items that are on the table as needed.

63
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:44,225
But also, you know, you could, as we've done on some of our regular meeting agendas already,

64
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:50,918
The chair of the committee can say, hey, okay, I want to talk about the budget ordinance this this meeting this month.

65
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:57,365
So I'm taking that from the papers and committee, and I'm moving that to the action and discussion item section of the agenda.

66
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:02,090
And, you know, you could kind of have that ready to be discussed in a meeting.

67
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:15,763
There is sort of an idea around the timing of things though, right, with the conversations we've been having about spreading stuff out.

68
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:26,390
So do you have a thought in mind about how we should structure our kind of priorities for bringing up the

69
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:36,435
What I'm getting at is I would like to see the background on all of this stuff, all of the stuff from the stuff that's tabled or in committee.

70
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:38,516
I'd like to see all the background on this.

71
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:50,700
But I don't want to try to see everything immediately, especially as we have these, especially like the extended leave with illness bank.

72
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,401
I know at the family medical leave being something that we're going to sort of think about talking about 2025, right?

73
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:55,521
Yeah.

74
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:01,307
Those are things that I think are important.

75
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:02,750
So, yes.

76
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,478
Yeah, I think, no, I get what you're saying.

77
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,980
I think like there's kind of two pieces of it.

78
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:15,143
Asking for the background information, pulling the records, et cetera.

79
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:16,424
That's one thing.

80
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:20,947
Once it's done, that can then be held for when it will be discussed.

81
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,988
So like we can kind of get folks up to speed.

82
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:27,371
And then, you know, actually saying, oh, I want to discuss this.

83
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,834
I think the chairs would probably follow in some sense, these timelines that we've come up with.

84
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:40,720
But I think it's good to get out there like earlier rather than later, rather than like, you know, we're two weeks ahead of the meeting when we want to talk about paid family medical leave.

85
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,582
And it's like, oh, when did the council discuss this?

86
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:54,070
What if, you know, put out those requests for information maybe, and we can work through the clerk's office or even make requests to the administrative staff to provide input if they have it.

87
00:08:55,131 --> 00:09:00,995
And then we have this paper record that builds up and then is available once we actually get into the discussion.

88
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:12,232
I think we're also just going to figure this out as we move along, because it's definitely, you know, usually what would happen is be like, oh, OK, we're going to talk about this in a week or two.

89
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:22,140
Let's immediately ask everyone to drop everything and start pulling research and papers from or asking for opinions and stuff like that.

90
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,224
So I think, you know, we're kind of trying to figure that one out a little bit, too, at least from my standing.

91
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:30,767
I don't know if other counselors have thoughts on that or have thought about that.

92
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,391
how they're gonna handle that for their own committees.

93
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:39,797
Not seeing any right now.

94
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:52,026
So yeah, I think going through this, we're going to be looking at the budget ordinance relatively soon.

95
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:57,590
That's something I'm working with the administration to schedule for next month's meeting on February 27th.

96
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,557
So that's one of the top priorities.

97
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:08,587
We also had some stuff around revenue generation, classification and compensation study, annual budget process, kind of the start of the year.

98
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:09,849
Councillor Lemming.

99
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:21,906
Justin, from what you can remember in previous terms on council, do you know the, would you be able to offer the reason that some of these were left in committee so long?

100
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:31,173
So if there's anything that, if there's anything specific comes to mind just to offer the historic context for that or a reason it just kind of dwindled.

101
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:35,436
Is there anything that you know about personally?

102
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:43,214
Yeah, and counselors Collins and saying, feel free to chime in here.

103
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:48,656
So, for some of these, you can kind of see the in city council is the date that it was submitted.

104
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:56,438
You know, what regular meeting so you could, and I tried to pull the records for most of these as best as I could and attach them in the digital packet.

105
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:08,625
But in city council is when it was proposed initially, and then in committee is whenever a committee meeting was held on those issues, or if it was referenced or discussed in a committee meeting.

106
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:16,650
So you can see that some ideas, you know, to be honest, I think some of this is purely organizing like things.

107
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,011
There's just been stuff going back.

108
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:24,750
All the way to 2016, 2017 papers and committee that had never had a committee meeting on them.

109
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:26,532
Um, hadn't really been discussed.

110
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:29,655
I know this municipal mini bonds program is, uh.

111
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:34,680
Was proposed by counselor care of yellow, but even from the resolution, I'm not 100% sure what its intent was.

112
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,323
And at this point, it's 7 years old, but some of the other ones.

113
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:38,583
Um.

114
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:43,109
We're mine and I can certainly provide context on that the pilot commission.

115
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,450
We had some early meetings on it.

116
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,253
There is a draft ordinance somewhere, but just hasn't been made a priority in the last 2 councils to advance that ball.

117
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,874
So it's just 1 of those things that's sitting with.

118
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:58,936
some amount of work done, and if we want to pick it up, we could move it forward.

119
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:07,002
Paid family medical leave, we had a discussion with the finance department in November 2022 about what the cost would look like.

120
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:10,025
It's in the $500,000 to $600,000 a year range.

121
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:14,388
And that's to cover all city and school employees.

122
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:23,155
And then there's a range of, does the city just do the minimum that's required by the state program, or does it,

123
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,888
pay 100% of the premium, et cetera.

124
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:28,509
And there's just kind of a budget range there.

125
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:33,775
But we basically got the cost estimate, and we haven't met on it since then.

126
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:42,523
I think some of the reason for that is, is there $600,000 in the budget to start that program or not?

127
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:44,345
Or would the mayor want to appropriate that?

128
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:51,167
There's some bigger questions there, because technically, the way the law is written, the council could just enter the program.

129
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:57,828
It's within our authority to adopt, to enter the state family medical leave program under Mass General Law.

130
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:07,170
But then, of course, that creates a cascading impact on, I think, under my reading of it, and I don't know if council's reading would be the same, we could join it.

131
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,650
The city would have to program it.

132
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,511
It would have to enter the program and then

133
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,474
Would the money be there?

134
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:18,416
Would there have to be cuts in other parts of the budget to fund that program?

135
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:18,996
I don't know.

136
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:24,518
So there wasn't like a general consensus agreement that this is something we should do in the short term with the administration.

137
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:25,199
So it kind of.

138
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:28,286
sat in committee.

139
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:32,089
And then the budget ordinance, you can see here, we met on five times in 2023.

140
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:37,793
And there's committee reports attached to the agenda, as well as, I think, the latest track changes.

141
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:47,099
Versions of the ordinance were attached to the agenda packet digitally, not in print, because this was a 74-page print packet.

142
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,881
I figured maybe we don't all want that anymore.

143
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:53,063
But if you look at the PDF, it's in there.

144
00:13:55,523 --> 00:14:04,089
And the administration is the last thing we left out in December as we're waiting for the response from the administration, which they're planning to send over to us in the next couple of weeks.

145
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:10,133
And then we can meet on that as one item for our February meeting.

146
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,000
Councilor Seng.

147
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:22,508
Yeah, I mean, I think that pretty much runs through most of the things that at least we dealt with on our council term last time.

148
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:31,655
There are two of the papers in committee I've done a little bit of looking into in terms of what they are.

149
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:37,920
So the mini bonds program that Councilor Kerrio-Viello introduced, the intention behind that was essentially

150
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:59,398
Some of them in Cambridge have these programs where they work with a company called Neighborly to provide $1,000 bonds for residents to borrow money, basically partake in buying those bonds and essentially use that money for home repairs, sidewalk repairs, infrastructure related stuff mostly.

151
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:13,887
Theoretically, you could use it for other things, but the company that they do it through, so the precedent that is set in Massachusetts is basically very much focused on small repairs along that scale.

152
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:21,612
The second paper listed, Accepting the Provisions of Mass General Loss, 71, Section 37M, that one is about consolidating

153
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:34,678
giving the city option to consolidate administration across the school side of things, the Bedford public schools and the city side of things.

154
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:41,379
That one would require a vote of the school committee, the city council and the mayor's approval on it.

155
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:51,221
So that one's much more involved and would require, essentially would require us to work with the school committee on the issue and to get everyone to a place where we agree.

156
00:15:52,301 --> 00:16:02,168
It was introduced back then because there was a desire to essentially make, to have the security director of the public schools the same as the security director of the city.

157
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:07,692
So essentially to combine, like, kind of building security administration.

158
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:17,539
Obviously, it just never got moved forward, maybe because of how involved the idea is, but that's just a bit of context on those two, on these two points.

159
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,201
And I think Zach, or President Behr has covered the rest pretty well.

160
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:37,699
I guess I'll continue talking to my president bears a little bit more time.

161
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,299
Sorry.

162
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,319
Sorry.

163
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,201
The clerk is informing me on how these were disposed of in the meeting in 2019.

164
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:48,183
Um, yeah, so this, this, this was not advanced out of committee.

165
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:54,946
The proposal, this was a proposal by the mayor, mayor Burke, um, to do the security director thing.

166
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:55,006
Um,

167
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:07,052
Slight kind of moving on very slightly, but still tied to an item in this list of papers committee.

168
00:17:08,113 --> 00:17:15,256
Your proposal for draft ordinance for the pilot commission is an idea that I think would be is very compelling for city.

169
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:20,458
It's definitely a need, especially when we think about how our pilot.

170
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:26,703
number one, how our pilot negotiations have historically turned out, and number two, how they're carried out in execution.

171
00:17:26,723 --> 00:17:34,989
I think it pairs really well with Councillor Collins and my idea on the Community Benefits Agreement Ordinance.

172
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:47,279
I think there's a lot of overlap there, but also the Community Benefits Agreement Ordinance talks a little bit more about how to basically spend the benefits that we receive through those pilot agreements.

173
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,260
And so,

174
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,772
I think moving forward, it would be nice to pair those two efforts together.

175
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:55,614
Great.

176
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:56,455
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

177
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:02,019
So that's some good context.

178
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,642
And I did try to pull and figure out how to better distribute this information.

179
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:15,969
And you can see here, this is hoping soon to be able to use this online portal for agenda and records.

180
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,291
You can see kind of how convenient it is.

181
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:22,942
get a meeting overview and see the attachments for each item.

182
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:31,606
Lots of attachments for the budget ordinance, but it does help organize some of these files, at least for me.

183
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:38,388
So yeah, as noted, budget ordinance, that's something we're looking at for our February 27th meeting.

184
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:52,747
The other 3 items that we're looking at early here are the fiscal 25 annual budget process classification and compensation study and implementation revenue generation and prop 2 and a half planning.

185
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,528
So, you know.

186
00:18:56,098 --> 00:19:02,042
for the FY25 annual budget process, I think it would be good for folks to look at the draft budget ordinances.

187
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:09,206
I think we're relatively close on the timing of each spring, what the budget process will look like.

188
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:15,951
The lingering questions on the budget ordinance more have to do with longer term financial planning.

189
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:22,575
I don't know if Councilor Collins or Councilor Seng, if you wanna add more specifics having been on that subcommittee as to what's outstanding around the budget ordinance.

190
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,301
Councilor Calderon, Vice President Calderon.

191
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,743
Thank you.

192
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:48,421
Yeah, I think that looking over the kind of the evolution of the draft ordinances will be most instructive for the newer councilors, but the original form of the ordinance spoke to both the annual budget process and also laid out a fairly prescribed structure for long-term budget planning, kind of revisiting

193
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:59,936
five-year financial forecast regular intervals with the administration the same way as it creates a structure for looking at the annual operating budget with the administration every year.

194
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:17,009
The administration has told us a lot about the various reasons why that is a difficult thing for them to operationalize at this point, but we still think that there's value in creating a kind of starter structure for how to begin to have those conversations in a

195
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,656
regular way, even if we are not being as ambitious as the original form of the ordinance laid out.

196
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:40,090
So to me, that is the most unfinished part of the ordinance, trying to figure out what can we start so that we are planting a seed for that kind of structure, while not legislating a process that the administration right now doesn't have the capacity to do every year.

197
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:47,938
Great, yeah, so I think that'll be something for us to take a look at.

198
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:52,402
The track changes versions is part of the digital packet.

199
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:59,889
When we get a response from the administration that week, the clerk will forward that along to the council.

200
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:08,136
And then we will be able to start probably in, I believe the first dates in that are in March.

201
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:15,189
in March for us to start looking at the fiscal 23, sorry, fiscal 25 budget.

202
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:27,918
Probably get some initial financial updates from the finance department and start having meetings with departments around what we're looking at in terms of the fiscal 25 budget.

203
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:30,780
So that'll be one item off the top of the list.

204
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,004
And I think the goal is also to pass the budget ordinance around the same time that that process will start.

205
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:37,245
Councilor Zaro.

206
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:39,509
Just a procedural question.

207
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:46,374
So do we need to do anything about the budget ordinance from this committee before it can go to the regular meeting on the 27th?

208
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:48,916
So it'll be in this meeting on the 27th.

209
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:50,717
So it'll be the... Oh, this meeting?

210
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:50,957
Yes.

211
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:59,784
This is going to happen on February 27th again, and we'll talk about the budget ordinance, and then move it out, and then we'll talk about it in the regular meeting in March, probably.

212
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:04,528
Yeah, and this is where we... I think we have red lines.

213
00:22:04,568 --> 00:22:07,270
So you can see in here there's some pretty significant edits to the...

214
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:09,509
to the initial proposal.

215
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,171
But we get city council.

216
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:28,058
So we'll have some stuff that we need to start doing in March to get recommendations out to the administration.

217
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:35,901
We're going to be getting a schedule of preliminary budget meetings April 15 to May 15 with department heads.

218
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,715
Mayor and the finance director are gonna provide an estimated budget allocation to the Medford Public Schools by March 1st.

219
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:47,599
And so there's gonna need to be kind of a shot clock checklist here.

220
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:54,947
And it may well be that we're gonna be, we may well be discussing now that I'm reading this, some of our budget recommendations on the, at the 20th, on the 27th as well.

221
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:55,407
So, and this is,

222
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:07,920
I was hoping we'd be done in December so that we'd have a kind of clear locked in timeline, but we're still negotiating some final details.

223
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:17,424
But then we will get the comprehensive budget proposal by May 31st, and that will contain some additional information that we are.

224
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:20,686
We're hoping for.

225
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:30,001
One of the things that we really were discussing would be a huge benefit, I think, to the Council and the public is to see in each department budget just a top line number.

226
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:34,443
Let's say that the fire department budget is increasing by $1 million.

227
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:39,906
How much of that is because of fixed cost growth and how much of that is actually something new?

228
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:44,609
Is it just contracts have gone up and the cost of X has gone up and Y has gone up?

229
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:48,476
and that million dollar increase is really just paying for something that we already have?

230
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:55,481
Or is there actually a new position or a new program or something else that is being funded in the budget?

231
00:23:55,522 --> 00:24:02,947
Because I think when we talk about biggest budget ever every year, I mean, yes, it's the biggest budget every year because inflation is going up every year.

232
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:11,253
So, you know, is it really historic or is it actually just keeping up with inflation?

233
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:20,026
Um, so that's we're going to have some budget related stuff hitting us relatively soon in February, at least the budget ordinance and maybe some.

234
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:30,149
Some additional stuff beyond that, but there'll be fair warning to the committee and 2 counselors who aren't on the voting members of the committee as well.

235
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:37,732
The classification and compensation study, I don't know if, um.

236
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,632
Councilor Collins, Councilor Seng, if you want to speak to that at all.

237
00:24:45,452 --> 00:24:45,653
No.

238
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:48,814
Basically, Vice President Collins.

239
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:59,339
Well, I know that this is something I was actually going to ask about President Beers, which is why I grimaced after I touched my microphone.

240
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:19,441
The classification and compensation study is a project that the administration initiated with the Collins Center, if I have that right to take a look at how we are compensating the various roles in City Hall to try to get context on if things are roughly right, you know, and this is

241
00:25:21,926 --> 00:25:28,548
would inform the types of salaries that we're putting out in our attempt to keep positions filled by competitive candidates.

242
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:34,229
So a question that I have is the status on how complete that study is.

243
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:51,473
And then I believe that the implementation for this council would be in, because pay rates to an extent live in our code of ordinances, personnel ordinances, that would be something for us to take out of the study and implement through our personnel ordinances.

244
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:56,764
Yeah, that's pretty much my understanding.

245
00:25:56,784 --> 00:26:05,108
I think, you know, something that might be valuable would be to put out a motion to just request an update on when we can expect the study from the call-in center.

246
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:20,435
And then we could get, you know, we could start reviewing that in earnest and how we can assist in the implementation process of updating the personnel ordinance and kind of what the timeline is on the administration side for when we can do that, Councilor Lemming.

247
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:38,077
I was just going to comment that the city's had a couple of new hires even ever since January for a number of positions that I thought they were waiting to hear back on that compensation study before they move forward with hiring them.

248
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:41,798
I mean, is it possible that some portion of it was already complete?

249
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:50,860
There are just a lot of new hires for senior level positions and just across City Hall that we've been informed about.

250
00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:01,428
recently, so clearly some compensation, some agreement about compensation must have been reached with or without the study.

251
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:04,490
Yeah, so the positions are paid.

252
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,332
There's a thing called a CAF.

253
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:12,096
CAF is an acronym for something.

254
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,218
It is not an acronym.

255
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:14,878
Nobody knows.

256
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,099
Nobody knows.

257
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:18,661
Right.

258
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:27,078
Right, yes, it's the CAF does not line up with compensation and classification, but that's basically.

259
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,427
Yeah, something in any case.

260
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:45,308
The CAFs, and they're not just CAFs, CAFs are one of the, actually several structures, are the tiers that the jobs sit in for what their compensation can be.

261
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:47,248
And those are technically ordinances.

262
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:56,852
So whatever the jobs were posted at, whatever CAF that they're in, CAF 13 being X amount of dollars to X amount of dollars, there's ranges and steps within them.

263
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:04,937
Those people are basically what I'm saying is the people who were hired for those positions are working at whatever the CAF says, whatever CAF that position is in right now.

264
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:12,982
And there's not really a lot of room for negotiation, other than maybe people can come in at a higher step of a CAF, for example.

265
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,825
So I don't know what the administration, I actually don't know what

266
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:25,495
For example, what step of what calf the economic development director was hired at, but it's not kind of an open negotiation.

267
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:26,636
So that's basically what this is.

268
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:31,304
My understanding is it's looking at the, the calf structure for city employees.

269
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:32,906
There's also public works.

270
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:37,329
set of classifications and compensation tiers for public works employees.

271
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,011
And there's a couple of other ones as well.

272
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:44,253
And looking at those and saying, are these competitive?

273
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:53,338
Are we going to be able to bring in, are there positions that are sitting empty because their compensation is too low or they're at too low of a CAF level?

274
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,640
That used to be available on MuniCode.

275
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,782
If you go back to the 2017 MuniCode, you can see what the CAFs were in 2017.

276
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:10,078
We've been working to try to get that back on MuniCode so that you can see that part of the ordinance online.

277
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:19,760
And the administration has basically said, what we have now and what is existing is not in a condition that we'd want to upload it to MuniCode.

278
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,481
So we want to do the study and create the new CAF structure.

279
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:26,821
And then that's when we'll put that back onto the city ordinances.

280
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:31,742
And I believe you have to go to the HR department to request the CAF

281
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:39,197
Yeah, that's one ordinance that's not maintained in the clerk's office right now.

282
00:29:39,297 --> 00:29:42,501
So the only one, the clerk reminds me.

283
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,643
So that's kind of how that is all working.

284
00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:51,510
And basically, that's why it's so important that we know when we get a timeline back from the administration.

285
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,431
This has been going on for

286
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:56,353
I think the first time we heard about this study was a couple of years ago.

287
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:58,934
We may have even been before the last term.

288
00:29:59,535 --> 00:30:03,257
I kind of remember Chief of Staff, former Chief of Staff, Dave Rodriguez, mentioning it.

289
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:05,139
So sometime in 2021.

290
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:13,925
Motion to request an update on the classification and compensation study.

291
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:19,228
Motion by Councilor Lemming to request an update on the classification and compensation study.

292
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:23,171
Do we want to put a time when we would like that?

293
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:25,721
March.

294
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:30,846
I see like four different ideas.

295
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:33,708
I'm gonna go to Councilor Zaro, Vice President Collins, Councilor Sagan.

296
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,490
I was just seconding.

297
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,732
Okay, just seconding Vice President Collins.

298
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:45,439
I was going to suggest perhaps to request the update come in a week before our next scheduled meeting of this committee.

299
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:46,179
Okay.

300
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,100
Which would be...

301
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:53,221
by February 20th, if we go that route.

302
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:55,924
Yeah, I was gonna advise similarly.

303
00:30:56,525 --> 00:31:07,456
Okay, so on the motion of Council, let me request an update on the classification and compensation study seconded by Councilor Zaro, as amended by Councilor Collins, that that update come by February 20th.

304
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:33,238
Great, and we'll hold that till the end of the meeting.

305
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,040
Okay, all those in favor?

306
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:39,061
All those opposed?

307
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,523
Motion passes as amended.

308
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:47,605
So okay, great.

309
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,706
So we'll get an update on that.

310
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,927
We'll have budget ordinance update for the next meeting.

311
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,989
In terms of revenue generation, proposition two and a half planning,

312
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:06,894
And I'm happy to go over it in more detail if requested, but there was an agreement budget agreement reached by President Morrell and I with the mayor for the fiscal 24 budget.

313
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:09,378
It included a variety of outcomes.

314
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:13,504
1 being we'll talk about the budget ordinance, which we've been doing another 1 being.

315
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:24,672
the creation of a financial task force which would consist of members of the city council and the school committee and the city's finance administration.

316
00:32:25,493 --> 00:32:33,419
There have been two or three preliminary meetings of that task force and further meetings are immediately forthcoming to

317
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:41,457
essentially say, this is the group, this is what its charge is, this is what its timeline is.

318
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:51,649
So I'm a member of that task force, the vice president, the vice chair of the school committee, the finance director, the mayor.

319
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,854
And so essentially, that's the group that's been meeting right now.

320
00:32:57,145 --> 00:33:03,092
We're going to figure out an announcement of that group in a more formal way with specific deadlines and timelines and thoughts.

321
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:07,237
So, when it comes to the revenue generation and prop two and a half planning.

322
00:33:07,257 --> 00:33:14,026
The initial phase of that, I know that's an 18 month project on this agenda, but the initial phase.

323
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,327
is stemming from that budget agreement, and there should be some more public information about that in the next month or so, I would say.

324
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:34,382
And then that can kind of start to inform discussions that we need to have in this committee, discussions that the school committee is going to need to have around what's looking like right now.

325
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:50,061
the MSBA process for the high school, what are our urgent operating budget needs, what are other major capital projects, and how do we wanna fund those looking at debt exclusions or operating budget overrides.

326
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:52,182
So more to come on that.

327
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:58,025
Once that release is out, I'm sure there'll be lots of questions and discussion.

328
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:05,869
If folks do wanna talk about that in more detail, I'm happy to answer some more questions about the budget agreement, Councilor Zaro.

329
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:14,411
I would just say that it feels like everything follows from whatever that announcement is going to be.

330
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:30,839
Like, none of the rest of this stuff can happen until we have a clear timeline on a clear description of all of the larger amounts of money that may be coming down the pike for us.

331
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:41,748
I think the greater transparency and the greater clarity we can have to share with the public, the sooner the better.

332
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:43,689
I don't, I feel like I don't know.

333
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,554
So I feel like people, just general Medford residents aren't, don't know anything.

334
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:54,678
So I'm eager, I'm excited and eager to hear more about that.

335
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:57,060
When do you think that announcement will be made?

336
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,762
I am hopeful by mid February.

337
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:01,470
Great.

338
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,692
It won't be like, this is what we're doing announcement as much as it does.

339
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:09,235
This is what we're talking about doing announcement, but that's something.

340
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:09,775
Yeah.

341
00:35:10,716 --> 00:35:10,916
Okay.

342
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:12,297
Awesome.

343
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:28,108
And I think too, it's probably fair to say it would not be likely would not be impactful on the fiscal 25 budget discussion, just given the timelines that would be needed to pass an override vote, for example.

344
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:33,967
at least a good chunk of fiscal 25.

345
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:50,949
So we have a number of other items on here that are not starting until next year or looking at, you know, a May start, but

346
00:35:52,304 --> 00:35:57,571
Any discussion on finance review, forecasting, commercial vacancy tax, good landlord tax credit?

347
00:35:58,352 --> 00:36:05,822
Has anyone taken a look at the ordinances relevant to this committee and said they're seeing something that they really want to update?

348
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:07,024
I'll go to Councilor Lemming.

349
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:20,314
Yeah, just it just seems like in general with a lot of a lot of the larger projects, those are those can be a little bit more difficult to pass forward in themselves without because, like, they're affected by outside factors.

350
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:25,796
But for some of the some of the smaller things on this that are going to be pushed ahead by.

351
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:55,950
uh individual counselors so i know it was counselor collins that proposed the good landlord tax credit the last meeting and i submitted uh for consideration at the upcoming meeting a resolution on the commercial vacancy tax um those seem like they can be pushed ahead sort of whenever uh there is time to do so at the admin and at these meetings um

352
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:03,195
Barring progress on some of the, uh, some of the need to do, um.

353
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:10,141
Things like the annual budget process and revenue generation property to an F planning.

354
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:15,325
So, I'm talking to with regards to the.

355
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:24,012
Vacancy tax specifically, um, I'm talking to some folks at the planning office about sort of best practices for doing that.

356
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:29,353
But of course, that also does need that would also need to be voted on at the next regular meeting.

357
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,874
Should, uh, should it pass there?

358
00:37:32,774 --> 00:37:34,694
So to be referred to.

359
00:37:35,674 --> 00:37:35,854
Yeah.

360
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:40,255
Great.

361
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:44,376
And I want to throw out just 1 other idea and it just kind of has been percolating in my head.

362
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:59,641
the vacancy tax, the good landlord credit, looking at the residential exemption, looking at potentially expanded exemptions and the Municipal Empowerment Act that the governor just filed and how much of that will pass.

363
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:14,304
It might be worth having kind of a, you know, this question around the financial task force and revenue generation is a full scope discussion around the scale of additional revenue needs, I think,

364
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:27,105
The questions around the landlord tax credit residential exemption, maybe even commercial vacancy tax, depending on how we can do that are kind of distributional questions about like, how should the burden be shouldered?

365
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:28,446
And how should that be changed?

366
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:32,608
So there might be kind of like 2 big bucket conversations around.

367
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:46,870
We know we need more, this is what we're prioritizing for larger new revenue, but also there's a bunch of ideas floating around about using the tax system, the structure generally around the property tax to incentivize different behaviors and to distribute burdens differently.

368
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:53,734
So that could be kind of one of those discussions as you were noting that since they all kind of impact each other and yeah.

369
00:38:57,392 --> 00:39:01,215
Yeah, just to just add a question coming from a very new counselor.

370
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:10,743
So, how long what would you I know that I'm seeing the timelines on this on the, uh, the actual calendar there, but.

371
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:33,107
So how long just taking the commercial vacancy tax, the landlord tax credit, which are two very new proposals, would you estimate it takes from going to that first resolution to somebody potentially paying that tax or receiving a tax benefit from that on the ground in real life and actually putting that into the budget?

372
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:41,089
Yeah, I mean, I think there's and I think that's why it might be good to bring in the assessor as well and have some conversations there.

373
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,614
I don't know what the mechanism of the vacancy tax would be and if it's some sort of.

374
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:50,973
charge on your two and a half levy bill or something.

375
00:39:51,594 --> 00:40:00,499
Basically, if there's anything that's related to rate setting of the property tax levy, those discussions need to happen well in advance of the December rate setting discussion.

376
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,221
Like we just had one in December.

377
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:07,463
I think several folks were there, councilors elected at the time were there.

378
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:09,585
But I think, you know,

379
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:18,501
for residential exemption, Ted and Ellen before Ted has said, you know, I need two extra assessors and I need six to 12 months to set that up.

380
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:19,862
So that's a big one.

381
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:25,984
I don't know if good landlord is maybe a little more targeted or if you want to do those both at the same time.

382
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:35,308
So you might be looking at certainly the next rate setting in December 2025 for some of the simpler stuff, like if there's a bigger exemption for seniors.

383
00:40:36,496 --> 00:40:38,357
you know, that's an easier one to kind of work out.

384
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,018
Cause we already have that in existence.

385
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:54,008
Um, I would guess if we're talking about like the residential exemption combined with a good landlord tax credit, just like trying to tweak the whole distributional structure of the levy, probably December, 2020, uh,

386
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:04,653
2025, sorry, I'm getting my years, I'm ahead a year, I'm getting my fiscal years and calendar years confused, but December 24 and December 2025, depending on the scale.

387
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:09,157
And then again, the vacancy tax, I'm not as sure on because I don't know what the mechanism is.

388
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:17,182
If it's like, it's something separate, maybe it's something that can move faster because it's outside of all of the complexities of rate setting for Proposition 2.5.

389
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,244
for how Prop 2.5 requires us to set the levy?

390
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:36,981
With the commercial vacancy tax, I don't think it would be, if it were implemented, it would specifically apply to vacant or effectively closed storefronts.

391
00:41:39,824 --> 00:41:52,695
the number of businesses that that would apply to would be very, very small compared to the number that would be applied to the good landlord tax credit, which could be hundreds of people around town.

392
00:41:52,815 --> 00:42:02,924
It would be much more targeted and it wouldn't be enough to significantly affect the total tax levy.

393
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:07,408
It's more of an incentive and not a revenue generating mechanism.

394
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:15,466
We have a member of the public.

395
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,635
You might need to press yeah.

396
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:22,504
William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

397
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:44,036
I just wanted to chime in about the commercial vacancy tax and say one thing about that, and that is that I do not think that Prop 2 1⁄2 would affect that because Prop 2 1⁄2 is a limit on ad valorem taxes, whereas a vacancy tax, I suspect, would not be an ad valorem tax based on the assessment, but rather something else.

398
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:46,277
So I just wanted to say that.

399
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:54,980
That's the way Prop 2.5 is structured, it's based on an ad valorem tax, a tax upon the value.

400
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:55,600
Thank you.

401
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:57,521
Thanks, William.

402
00:43:02,803 --> 00:43:03,103
Great.

403
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:13,806
So, although I'm not sure how much we're able to discuss something that hasn't been referred to committee, so if there's a... just, yeah, just pointing that out.

404
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:20,224
Yeah, I mean, it's on it's in the governing agenda document, which so and that's what we're supposed to be doing.

405
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:28,211
But yeah, we can we can hold the details until it's formally been referred and until we have some people other than us doing our best.

406
00:43:28,331 --> 00:43:28,591
Yes.

407
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:32,474
Vice President Collins, first time I've gotten that right.

408
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:33,759
Thank you.

409
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:35,520
Yeah, I think it's an important point to make.

410
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:52,667
I mean, in general, I think the point of these initial meetings and committees, the point of the governing agenda is to try to budget our work over this term to be manageable for counselors and for projects to occur in the right order to be most effective.

411
00:43:52,687 --> 00:43:58,330
I think that the way that the various

412
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:22,632
commercial vacancy tax, for example, these various exemptions that we've considered in the past, the new ones that we're considering, the way that those will intersect with a potential override or debt exclusion is kind of an interesting problem, kind of to the overall topic of like, then what order do we do things in, especially with the exemptions, which we know, the assessor's office requires like a fairly long runway.

413
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,572
to be able to implement.

414
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:41,958
I think that, I mean for myself, for the Good Lord and Lord Tax Credit, as that's a paper that I introduced, I think that the approach may be to study the issue, try to do the research, have the conversations, get our ducks in a row, perhaps like create some scenarios, and then as the conversations about

415
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:52,105
revenue forecasting potential changes to property tax because of a debt exclusion or override, kind of have some scenarios ready to go.

416
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:57,148
And of course, I think in some cases, we might want to deploy several strategies at the same time.

417
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:09,176
If, for example, say we're doing a debt exclusion for a new high school, hypothetically, it occurs to me that that might be a thing that our finance department might say.

418
00:45:10,638 --> 00:45:19,760
let's sit down and consider these three to four financial mechanisms together instead of doing these very related things in separate channels.

419
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:33,464
But I think that we can certainly pursue all of these projects in committee and really get our arms around the issue and study, could maybe create a set of if-then conditions for these various exemptions and new mechanisms.

420
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:37,385
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

421
00:45:41,636 --> 00:45:48,361
Any other further thoughts or discussion on what this committee is going to be looking at over the next 23 months?

422
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:50,183
Can you put the screen to Rebecca?

423
00:45:50,743 --> 00:45:51,023
Sure.

424
00:45:51,104 --> 00:45:51,584
For just a sec.

425
00:45:56,598 --> 00:45:57,118
Councilor Sands?

426
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:08,506
I think the only thing I would maybe want to add to this timeline at this point is to make sure that the draft pilot ordinance gets some time in there as well.

427
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:21,334
We can talk about whether we talk kind of, as you were saying, you know, we have these buckets of work to work on that, you know, ideas are different, but possibly very similar genres of work.

428
00:46:22,515 --> 00:46:27,021
look at the Community Benefits Ordinance not being—putting up a pilot or something.

429
00:46:29,744 --> 00:46:30,985
Thank you, Councillor Sands.

430
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:33,728
Give me one second here.

431
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,653
You want to look at the draft timeline again?

432
00:46:47,483 --> 00:46:50,404
It sounds like there's a motion from Councillor Saint to add.

433
00:46:50,464 --> 00:46:53,925
Motion to add the pilot ordinance to the governing agenda.

434
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:54,586
Got it.

435
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:09,071
On the motion of Councillor Saint to add the pilot ordinance to the governing agenda, seconded by Vice President Collins.

436
00:47:15,424 --> 00:47:16,105
All those in favor?

437
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:16,905
Aye.

438
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:17,526
Opposed?

439
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,367
Motion passes.

440
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:23,451
And Councillor Collins, you wanted this back up?

441
00:47:26,173 --> 00:47:28,575
Yeah, I just wanted to take a look, see if there's anything I was forgetting.

442
00:47:36,162 --> 00:47:40,125
I think in general, I feel pretty happy with the draft timeline.

443
00:47:40,745 --> 00:47:43,006
that we're looking at here in the governing agenda.

444
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:53,372
I think that this, for the most part, organizes our projects in what I would consider a list of priority and also a list of urgency.

445
00:47:53,392 --> 00:48:01,356
It's very important to start implementing the classification and compensation study as soon as that data becomes available.

446
00:48:01,456 --> 00:48:04,657
It's, of course, the annual budget process.

447
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,200
is fixed in the first half of each year.

448
00:48:09,981 --> 00:48:23,589
I think for the reasons we just discussed, it'll be important to discuss the commercial vacancy tax and the good landlord tax credit earlier rather than later, so that if those are things that we do want to deploy, we can do that.

449
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,112
at a time that makes sense because they take a long time to implement.

450
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:37,300
I think that that will set us up well for these other projects that we currently have slated for 2025, which of course are also very important.

451
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,100
That's why they're up there.

452
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:43,565
That's why they've been suggested by current counselors, former counselors, members of the community.

453
00:48:44,265 --> 00:48:47,268
But I think that this roughly follows order of need.

454
00:48:52,452 --> 00:48:52,712
Great.

455
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:55,343
Any further discussion?

456
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:02,428
Any questions, any thoughts?

457
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:11,454
Any comments from members of the public in the chamber or on Zoom?

458
00:49:17,178 --> 00:49:21,502
Seeing no one in the chamber, two standing at the podium and seeing no hands on Zoom.

459
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,218
I think we are at an end.

460
00:49:26,038 --> 00:49:26,639
Motion to adjourn?

461
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:27,139
Second.

462
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,520
Motion by Vice President Collins to adjourn.

463
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,921
Seconded by Councillor Lemming.

464
00:49:32,242 --> 00:49:32,923
All those in favour?

465
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:34,444
All those opposed?

466
00:49:36,745 --> 00:49:38,006
Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
