1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:04,650
[SPEAKER_07]: resident services and public engagement committee, April 23rd, 2024.

2
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk, would you please call the roll?

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:10,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Kelly?

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:11,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

5
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:12,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazzaro?

6
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:13,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

7
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:14,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scripp-Helly?

8
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:18,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

9
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:21,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng is absent.

10
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:25,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so.

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:35,136
[SPEAKER_07]: First paper on the agenda to 4015 resolution to discuss modernizing council communications and outreach strategy.

12
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:36,417
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

13
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:45,704
[SPEAKER_07]: The so on the current agenda packet, um, pursuant to the motions that were

14
00:00:50,367 --> 00:01:01,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I. Asked Councilors if they be willing to draft or if they were willing to get on a schedule to draft a, um.

15
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:21,964
[SPEAKER_07]: ended up creating a schedule of those who had who replied if there are any proposed changes tonight that any Councilors would like to make more than willing to hear them.

16
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:38,918
[SPEAKER_07]: We also, I also submitted a draft of the Medford City Council newsletter, which once it is approved in committee, we will be able to then circulate it around.

17
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:49,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, Council Vice President Collins submitted some recommendations to me after the release of the agenda, which I placed in

18
00:01:50,828 --> 00:02:09,709
[SPEAKER_07]: this year and this year draft of the document essentially just asking for some more consistent language as well as links to the website for some of the for some of the ordinances projects that were mentioned in the draft as well as

19
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:19,132
[SPEAKER_07]: just smaller things like use of the word committee, to be clear, and use of, and the addition of dates to each of the items that were worked on.

20
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:29,855
[SPEAKER_07]: If any councillors have recommendations or anything that they would like to add to the newsletter, I would be more than willing to hear it.

21
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:30,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

22
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like I can't really read all that on the screen.

23
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of these may have already been covered by Vice President Collins.

24
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:46,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say like the leaf flow ordinance, for example, doesn't need to be covered both in the general business as well as in the planning and permitting committee.

25
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:54,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It just might be confusing because it says, like if they only read one, they'll say, they'll think it's a second reading.

26
00:02:55,242 --> 00:03:01,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And then under sent to committee, a home rule petition for a real estate transfer fee, that to me is a little too,

27
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,521
[SPEAKER_02]: strong sounding, right?

28
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like we sent a home rule petition to commit, like, if I didn't know much about the city council, I would think that there was one completely written up and this language was all finalized.

29
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:19,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the phrasing should be different.

30
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:21,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Open day discussion or something like that.

31
00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:27,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Gave a number to, same also with like developing a home rule petition.

32
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:28,899
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I don't know,

33
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:51,506
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what to do with that one, but I think in the same way that governance committee has just a one-liner, we also could put in public works committee as just a one-liner of like currently discussing roads and sidewalks, renovations as, you know, according to the assessment studies, something like that.

34
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:58,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be a nice simple way of just saying that, hey, this committee is looking at those things, so people care about that.

35
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:08,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently discussing road and sidewalk renovations.

36
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:24,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have perfect language for this, but according to the pavement and sidewalk assessment studies.

37
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

38
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

39
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:33,962
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

40
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,743
[SPEAKER_07]: So just, okay.

41
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:38,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other two you had mentioned, I'm writing this down.

42
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:41,247
[SPEAKER_07]: We're take out the second mention of leaf flower ordinance.

43
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:42,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Under planning and permitting.

44
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:43,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I would just remove it.

45
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell if Councilor Collins did that already.

46
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:52,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Planning and permitting, page 12.

47
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Discussion on disability notification.

48
00:04:57,205 --> 00:05:00,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I think, yeah, so that was removed.

49
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:11,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And making the language about the... Yeah, the sent to committee a home rule petition for real estate transfer fee, that one, it just, I think it's a little misleading to put it that way.

50
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:12,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

51
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:19,624
[SPEAKER_05]: We sent a paper to this committee to discuss the creation of a home rule petition.

52
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:21,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, something like that, yeah.

53
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:31,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also suggest a, I tried to suggest language for the rent stabilization home repetition that we might be able to create a template that works for both.

54
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:31,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

55
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:33,259
Yep.

56
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:34,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

57
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, okay.

58
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:47,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So how an initial meeting about, okay, let me just, just kind of thinking here, um, send a paper to committee.

59
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:47,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

60
00:05:50,987 --> 00:06:17,220
[SPEAKER_05]: petition for a real estate transfer fee to discuss the before let's sort of about set a paper to committee to discuss the creation of paper committee to discuss and then you can delete the second there's two committee twice in there

61
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:41,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I think similarly under the rent stabilization, would ask the state to give the city of Method the permission to... Wait, would ask the state to... Instead of the word for, just to give the city of Method the...

62
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:49,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

63
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:50,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

64
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:52,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

65
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:54,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro.

66
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I have more of a broad question.

67
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:15,240
[SPEAKER_01]: This being the newsletter draft for April and us having another week of April left and there being the possibility that we could pass a number of other

68
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:19,750
[SPEAKER_01]: items in the next few days.

69
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:26,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I am wondering, like, we have a regular meeting on the 30th.

70
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:33,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering how we want to organize when these go out, month over month.

71
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:37,106
[SPEAKER_07]: My thoughts on that are, I mean, we would call it

72
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:50,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So this first newsletter, first up, is going to be a bit odd because it is the first one, but I'm sort of trying to mention the key points that we've done since the beginning of the term.

73
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:54,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Future newsletters, I wouldn't really imagine, would have

74
00:07:55,595 --> 00:08:21,429
[SPEAKER_07]: quite as much as this they would just cover the last month but I don't I don't I also don't really think that we would need to necessarily stick to the calendar month that we're going it would like my in my perception would just be like what have we done since the last newsletter so we would be like writing it in that month but it would be for like since the last newsletter these are the things that happened yeah I mean that's that's just kind of my initial thinking I mean we could

75
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,634
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, be strict as to only covering the events that happened in April or May and so on.

76
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:36,739
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, I also don't really see why we can't be a little bit more flexible about it.

77
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:40,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see a hand raised.

78
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that, is the iPhone Councilor Scarpelli?

79
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:44,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

80
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:47,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Council, thank you so much.

81
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:52,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I've been I've been getting phone calls and people asking that they don't see my name.

82
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I still haven't got my answers.

83
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And this process as a subcommittee, as you've already moved forward with this, but we still haven't answered.

84
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:05,898
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we going to get this information to the community?

85
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:10,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there was bantering back and forth about, well, at least getting it started.

86
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,242
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's exactly the message that I didn't want to send that I've been answering questions on.

87
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:18,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It's who is getting this information?

88
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:20,544
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, there's nothing set up.

89
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:29,170
[SPEAKER_03]: We've still yet to hear anything from the communication director to see how we can get it out to undisturbing communities, parts of a community that's underserved.

90
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,831
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get them the messages?

91
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:36,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the truth of the matter is what I'm hearing so far and the understanding of what we're sending out

92
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:43,437
[SPEAKER_03]: is something that our city clerk does at a pretty high level in our meeting minutes.

93
00:09:44,138 --> 00:10:01,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that people understand, for the record, I'm not being included in this for a few reasons, and one being that we have still found out, we have still not vetted out the process of where this information is going.

94
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a newsletter to do what?

95
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:04,786
[SPEAKER_03]: To go where?

96
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:15,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Now again, if it's hitting, if it's, if we put a plan in place to get everybody, especially the underserved in our community, to make sure they're getting the information, because that's who's not getting the information.

97
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,340
[SPEAKER_03]: But again,

98
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want you to know optics are a lot, are pretty big here.

99
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:30,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're bulldozing this with six Councilors and one left on the outside, I want it to be noted.

100
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:36,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still have, I put a motion in to ask where these are going.

101
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:37,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked for

102
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:43,052
[SPEAKER_03]: communication from the communications department that didn't send anything of any substance.

103
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:48,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have still yet to know where we're handing these out because that's all I've heard.

104
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hand them out.

105
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,139
[SPEAKER_03]: To who?

106
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,482
[SPEAKER_03]: To your Lister?

107
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,568
[SPEAKER_03]: to your groups?

108
00:10:55,308 --> 00:11:00,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's that we're using city funds to to send a message out to one organization.

109
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:02,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think that's wrong.

110
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to share my not like it'll go anywhere.

111
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:08,077
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to make sure that I was heard.

112
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:12,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's on the record that I've stated that if I can Mr. Mr.

113
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:22,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, that I'm not a part of this process because I don't feel that this process is serving the whole community.

114
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:33,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It's serving people that can be reached and nothing is being done or designed to reach that underserved part of our community.

115
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:33,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

116
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:43,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of this was discussed at the last resident services and public engagement committee, which you were not present at, so.

117
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:46,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I read the minutes, still no answers.

118
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:55,226
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going out to the city listserv, so it's going out to the same listserv that all the mayor's communications go out to.

119
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:11,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's the other again that there is a standard set of city listservs that would go out to We could investigate other Potential listservs that go out to so we're talking with the senior center about theirs.

120
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:22,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean the you know, the point is that we do we do need to have a product to send to different outlets if we are going to Communicate what City Council is doing.

121
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So any other questions?

122
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:25,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro.

123
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:35,729
[SPEAKER_01]: At the last meeting we also discussed texting options, WhatsApp options, paper options, and translation options.

124
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:43,530
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was discussed extensively at the last meeting that we would make sure to prioritize serving underserved communities.

125
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,531
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big priority of this process.

126
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:48,444
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can.

127
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:52,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

128
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:56,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I appreciate that, but it was discussed.

129
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:57,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It was discussed.

130
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:06,017
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we're doing is we're putting something out there before we even came to a resolution.

131
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:10,281
[SPEAKER_03]: You've come to a resolution, but everything is being discussed.

132
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,402
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what the subcommittees are for.

133
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:15,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're putting out a product that's actually going out to print.

134
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,771
[SPEAKER_03]: we haven't even we at least that's what I'm hearing right now.

135
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:26,693
[SPEAKER_03]: With everything was being discussed in subcommittee, nothing's gone out to the regular floor, nothing's been voted.

136
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:39,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And then nothing has been approved to move this this paper to go out to the public and making sure that did we look at we can just we can say that we're serving we're looking into serving the the underserved in our community.

137
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:44,061
[SPEAKER_03]: But just by saying it, just because you check a box doesn't mean we're doing it.

138
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:55,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, my recommendation is let's slow this down and make sure that we get the answers that we want, or else you're gonna leave a group of people in this community, again, feeling like they're not being listened to.

139
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:06,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's things that are coming out in the city in the next couple of weeks that is directly showing that this council is saying things but doing something totally different.

140
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:11,277
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, believe me, I don't want to be the negative.

141
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:17,941
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's usually in the last couple of years, it's never been my nature, but it's right in front of us.

142
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:19,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's black and white what we're seeing.

143
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:26,987
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, to my fellow council, understand, you saying things and just putting them through, that doesn't mean that it was vetted properly.

144
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:27,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

145
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

146
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:36,936
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a newsletter that City Council is trying to circulate through the community.

147
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:37,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what this is.

148
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:41,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, sorry, Councilor Bears.

149
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:42,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

150
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a couple of edits under the general business.

151
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:51,082
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could scroll up just so we could see that.

152
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:58,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you make the committee structure a separate bullet?

153
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: So after that first sentence, and then it should be, can we just say that it was technically two different papers.

154
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:22,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So we also, we voted to establish a new committee structure with the following seven committees.

155
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:24,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

156
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,360
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

157
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So we also didn't even have to say also, we just, we voted.

158
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:36,532
[SPEAKER_05]: to establish a... Oh, what is that?

159
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:39,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's editing the stuff I've deleted.

160
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:42,176
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just click before the created to see and create it.

161
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:42,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

162
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, we voted to establish.

163
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:48,862
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get rid of created.

164
00:15:53,245 --> 00:16:00,391
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we could change it to committee structure with the following seven committees.

165
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:02,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

166
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:18,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we could alphabetize, I think if you just copy administration and finance, then it should be administration and finance would be first, then education and culture.

167
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:26,747
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw it first.

168
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:30,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I am prone to make

169
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:34,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And then resident services and public engagement will be at the end.

170
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:34,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

171
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Last but certainly not least.

172
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

173
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:56,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my only other comment, I think this is really great.

174
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:00,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, which section?

175
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:02,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I have two.

176
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:02,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have two.

177
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:07,209
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like NSAssociates just said twice.

178
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:12,894
[SPEAKER_05]: End NS, OK.

179
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:15,736
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that comma should be a period.

180
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:18,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Associates, wait.

181
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:26,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Or after ltd, it should be which has worked, something, comma, which has worked, or who have worked.

182
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:41,309
[SPEAKER_07]: in the process of updating and vetting our zoning ordinances with the city's zoning consultant and associates, which has worked with the city of Metro previously, including on our comprehensive plan, could be linked to.

183
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

184
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:50,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I forwarded you just right as this meeting was starting, an email for the very beginning.

185
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:55,519
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that I, in my former career as a writer,

186
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting with the lead is always important.

187
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:08,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And I emailed you a suggested- I'm a scientist, so you could see that I just- It's technical.

188
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,541
[SPEAKER_05]: It's technical.

189
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:11,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It is technical.

190
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:22,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I emailed you and the clerk a suggested change to that paragraph, that whole paragraph.

191
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

192
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:23,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

193
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:34,434
[SPEAKER_07]: just stop share for a moment so I can check my email without it being broadcast.

194
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:40,336
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

195
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:45,898
All right.

196
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:14,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and I'm seeing also additional in my email, additional recommendations from Council Vice President Collins.

197
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

198
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:24,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that last lead changes all I have.

199
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:36,237
[SPEAKER_05]: My only other suggestion that I will stop impinging on your meeting is I think it might be valuable if the committees also went in alphabetical order, like the sections.

200
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

201
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:41,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Vice President Collins.

202
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chair Leming, while you're hearing from non-voting members.

203
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:56,778
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to, before I leave you to your deliberations, I think that this is a really great start, a really great framework.

204
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:57,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about this.

205
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:04,422
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I hear from people all the time, like in my first term as well as recently, is it's so hard to know what the city council is doing.

206
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:08,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is of course not a perfect solution, but I think anything that we add

207
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:15,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty of essentially an e-list is that people can always be added to it, and that content can be used in other channels as well.

208
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,612
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this is a worthwhile endeavor that is only additive.

209
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:22,314
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really take away from anything except for our time.

210
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:28,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in general, it could be helpful for us to just have standard language for how we talk about certain things.

211
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:38,386
[SPEAKER_00]: In my email that I sent over to you earlier today, just kind of a standard sentence structure for at our XYZ meeting, we passed a resolution commemorating

212
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:46,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to run through these really quickly.

213
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:52,634
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my comments did just kind of trying to get into the trying to get into the mindset of the average resident who doesn't know what we do.

214
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:55,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the comments that I sent to you, um.

215
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:59,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the passage of the leaf blower ordinance.

216
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:00,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested

217
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:11,114
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to we approved completely the new leaf blower ordinance, sending it to the mayor for the final approval.

218
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:16,916
[SPEAKER_00]: This ordinance will phase out gas-powered leaf blowers in favor of electric ones over a four-year period.

219
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:32,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to emphasize, I think it's helpful to not assume that people know what it means to pass an ordinance completely or incompletely, just to sort of use kind of specific language for what we mean by that, to kind of imply that there's two votes, rather than to use general language.

220
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,673
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of our ordinances are, of course, are very complicated.

221
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:42,577
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard to boil down into one or two sentences.

222
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:45,202
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that

223
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:59,090
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be great for us to include hyperlinks wherever we can so that, you know, to sort of help people with their inevitable questions of what do you mean, what do you mean specifically, where can I read more about this, so that people can click to immediately get their specific questions answered to read more about it.

224
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:07,594
[SPEAKER_00]: But wherever possible, I would love to use language like giving the final vote of approval so that it's more clear what we mean by that.

225
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:11,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, in the planning and permitting committee section,

226
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:20,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to use language of this committee began the process of updating and amending our zoning ordinances.

227
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:24,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that's a little bit more specific than I know I've been using the word overhaul a lot.

228
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:28,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's like a little more precise when we say we're amending the ordinances.

229
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,368
[SPEAKER_00]: We're updating the ordinances.

230
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:31,429
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that that will

231
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:35,130
[SPEAKER_00]: better signal for more people what that process actually looks like.

232
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:40,133
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do think it might be helpful for people to include that second line that I suggested.

233
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:50,019
[SPEAKER_00]: NS Associates has worked with the city of Method previously, including on our comprehensive plan, just to give that context that this is a known contractor that we've collaborated with before.

234
00:22:51,139 --> 00:23:04,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and last thing, sorry, um, if this hasn't already been mentioned, um, under the administration finance committee section, I thought it would be helpful to add some context to the draft budget ordinance.

235
00:23:04,744 --> 00:23:17,868
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested, and this I emailed to you earlier, this committee is finalizing the draft budget ordinance, which for the first time creates a timeline and meeting schedules for updates and communications between the city council and mayor's office during the annual budget development.

236
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:28,797
[SPEAKER_00]: process, and I just wanted to include some sort of implication there that we're at the final stage of this, something that was begun in the previous term, and more specifically what that means.

237
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:36,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking at what you just emailed me, and I just copied and pasted that into my draft document.

238
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:42,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So is everything you just mentioned in that email, or could you forward the recommendations to me?

239
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:46,418
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was just referencing was the email that I sent to you before.

240
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:46,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

241
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:56,184
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did, so I did, I did include everything in that in the meantime, but you also sent, um, I was just noticing some language discrepancies from what I sent you and what I saw on the doc.

242
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:58,525
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make sure that you have the specific language.

243
00:23:59,045 --> 00:23:59,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

244
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:05,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause cause yeah, I, I don't want to use like all the meeting time while everybody watches me edit.

245
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,171
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just do one, but that's a great idea.

246
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:08,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

247
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:11,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I did just like copy and paste.

248
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:13,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I did just copy and paste those in there.

249
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:15,700
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, Councilor Callahan.

250
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

251
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:25,808
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, you have the toughest job of doing the first one, getting all of these edits, so I really appreciate all your hard work doing that.

252
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:35,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to mention that if we are going to use email, if we are going to use anything that uses people's phones, which includes text messaging, which includes WhatsApp, which includes Signal,

253
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:37,497
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to have opt-in.

254
00:24:37,877 --> 00:25:04,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea that we can't start anything until we somehow have a way to reach everyone, the way that we reach everyone is by producing something, and including, I want to make sure that we have something near the top that says, please forward this information to your friends, or here is how your friends can get on this email list, so that people will send this information to people that they know, and it will be very easy for them once they receive something from a friend or colleague,

255
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:09,310
[SPEAKER_02]: for them to get on the email list or on a mobile list or something.

256
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting folks to spread the word about this.

257
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two other things.

258
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:24,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that with the real estate transfer fee that I think the wording that we chose was really great.

259
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:28,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I think also for the rent stabilization ordinance

260
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:32,157
[SPEAKER_02]: both of those because they are very hot button issues.

261
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:39,423
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to make sure that the language is accurate to what has happened, which is we're simply opening the discussion.

262
00:25:39,764 --> 00:25:46,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever language we're using for the real estate transfer fee, we should use a similar language for the rent stabilization.

263
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:51,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is a general question, something to think about maybe for next time.

264
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:58,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love it if in our newsletters we can include not only what has happened in the past, but what is upcoming.

265
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:20,000
[SPEAKER_02]: so that maybe even if it's only just that very next week, if we know, so that people can make a plan to come, or even if it just includes maybe a link to the events page that shows people what is upcoming and a thing at the bottom that says if you want to know what we will be discussing in the City Council and in the committee meetings, go to this link.

266
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:32,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I think that we don't have to have the exact draft 100% figured out, like the exact formatting 100% figured out for the first one.

267
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:41,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I just like to focus on timeliness for this particular draft, just to make sure that we have something out.

268
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:48,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in future ones, as we kind of get into the swing of things, we can come up with a more standardized format as we see what people like.

269
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:50,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do agree that that is,

270
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:54,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I do agree that having upcoming projects in there would be great.

271
00:26:56,318 --> 00:27:05,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I also heard another recommendation from Council Vice President Collins, for instance, that we include the paper numbers in there just so that people can cross-reference it.

272
00:27:05,485 --> 00:27:16,233
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that I got a lot of very last-minute input here, so researching all the paper numbers personally takes a bit of time.

273
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro?

274
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:30,016
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a lot of back and forth right now, and I just want you to know that I see you having to do these updates at this moment, and it could be a little bit stressful.

275
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:41,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think maybe in an effort to not have perfect be the enemy of good, and that, I think, can also extend to not

276
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:54,093
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing the baby out with the bathwater, as far as the newsletter, and being afraid to try something because you're not sure it could reach everybody in town.

277
00:27:55,894 --> 00:28:06,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that even if this version is not the very final, most perfect version, and as we keep learning and as we get feedback from residents,

278
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:10,683
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we keep making it better as time goes on.

279
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:27,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to, I'm not sure if I can, if I would make this as a motion, but I think I would like to speak with our DEI director and City Hall about how best to make sure we're, you know, I don't know why the sound is being weird.

280
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:39,379
[SPEAKER_01]: how best to, you know, for the purposes of this first newsletter or going forward, you know, how best to make sure we're trying to access as many people as possible.

281
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:47,209
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be happy to do that, but I guess I would motion to speak with Director Nwaje about that.

282
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,573
[SPEAKER_01]: as we work to distribute the newsletter.

283
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:54,479
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one motion that I have.

284
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:03,152
[SPEAKER_01]: A second motion is I would like to say this for me, clerk, as a motion.

285
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:04,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it sound

286
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:04,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

287
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:14,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we should bring it to the regular meeting or at our next meeting, potentially, so that we can approve it as part of the regular meeting.

288
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:20,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we have it in like a final form for this version.

289
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:23,929
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it not having to be perfect, perfect, 100%.

290
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:29,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nothing's ever perfect when you're writing stuff.

291
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:31,776
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a work in progress.

292
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:56,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, that being said, I also would confirm for, uh, or agree or back up what Councilor Colin Callahan was saying about, um, I'm not sure if you were saying this exactly, but, um, maybe we can use some of our city council language, but maybe we can simplify some of it.

293
00:29:57,618 --> 00:30:01,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's some terms that I think are confusing to a lot of our residents.

294
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:04,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I think home rule petition is confusing.

295
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:07,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even paper number can be confusing.

296
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:09,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people don't even know what a paper is.

297
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:11,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that

298
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Sending something to committee can even be confusing.

299
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:19,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes maybe there could be maybe there could be a glossary section.

300
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:24,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this isn't something that we do for the first newsletter, but maybe down the road.

301
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:31,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's like a layman's terms version or like a like a quick summary version.

302
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:35,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are the what are the need to knows in the beginning?

303
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:36,529
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the TLDR?

304
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:42,914
[SPEAKER_01]: in the beginning of the newsletter, or maybe that's just an event section that's like, what do you need to know?

305
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:45,416
[SPEAKER_01]: When are the regular meetings this month?

306
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:47,538
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the committee meetings?

307
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:49,140
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to try to get to?

308
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:57,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we don't know, but we could at least let people know the really critical information so they don't have to know all the terminology.

309
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:02,609
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the draft schedule, you're assigned to do the next one.

310
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:03,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.

311
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:05,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving myself kind of a lot of work.

312
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm realizing as the more I talk, the more work I'm giving myself.

313
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:10,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to your draft.

314
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:11,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to it.

315
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:13,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much brainstorming.

316
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:14,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there are some bad ideas.

317
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:19,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to emphasize, this is the first newsletter.

318
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:21,955
[SPEAKER_07]: We really don't need to overthink it.

319
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:29,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I, but it's like you said, perfect can't be the enemy of of good in this case.

320
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:30,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm hearing.

321
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:38,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think that there's a reasonable amount of work I could I could do on this draft prior to going to the to the regular meeting.

322
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:43,475
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think a good part of having it rotated and again, we did have I.

323
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:55,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Send an invitation for all Councilors to, uh, who wanted to volunteer to draft a newsletter for a given month and have it be edited by everyone else.

324
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:58,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And those who volunteer are currently on the schedule.

325
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:03,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a opportunity for people to kind of, like, put their own practices into it.

326
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

327
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:05,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

328
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,440
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things.

329
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:13,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, I will second your motion to have you reach out to Mr. Nwaje to do that.

330
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:18,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, you also partially answered my question, which is going to be, what is the schedule?

331
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:22,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I said I would do whatever was free, so I have no idea what month I'm on, but at least I'm not next month.

332
00:32:23,387 --> 00:32:24,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be in the agenda.

333
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:25,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

334
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:26,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the agenda.

335
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:26,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed it.

336
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:32,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third thing is, I'm curious why I would love to avoid having these

337
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:42,694
[SPEAKER_02]: unless there's a reason having the wording of the newsletters go to the full city council meeting, it seems like really this should just be in this committee.

338
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why we would want to send it to the full city council.

339
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:57,699
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that I would want to is just mainly because Councilor Scarpelli didn't feel comfortable approving it in committee and saying that it had not been on the regular meeting schedule.

340
00:32:58,328 --> 00:33:03,890
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, if it doesn't pass our, I mean, we're here now, if it doesn't pass, it doesn't pass.

341
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:04,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand.

342
00:33:08,132 --> 00:33:10,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't imagine having the, you know,

343
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,303
[SPEAKER_02]: a 200, 300 word document be edited in a city?

344
00:33:14,463 --> 00:33:18,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally think that's the wrong place for like that is that is not the place.

345
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:22,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a just a communication from the city council.

346
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,632
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the only other person here that can second one.

347
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,493
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's up to you.

348
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:28,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seconding that one.

349
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:36,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So

350
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:40,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so do we have any other.

351
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:48,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the first off there was, there are some additional edits as you can see on the screen from Councilor Collins.

352
00:33:50,472 --> 00:33:56,936
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I, again, I don't want to use this entire time to just to just do that considering also we have another item on the agenda to get to.

353
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:16,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so she sent me some edits earlier and this is just some different phrasing of, and I could also, you know, but yeah, yeah, this is just some different phrasing that she wanted when I incorporated her edits earlier.

354
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:18,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just, it's just wording issues.

355
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:19,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

356
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:23,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want us to forget.

357
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:28,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So anywhere you can just put this so that we don't forget.

358
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:32,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put it in that document and then we'll look at it next time.

359
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:37,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that we should really have a way for people to forward this to others so they can get on the list.

360
00:34:38,805 --> 00:34:44,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the idea of putting upcoming, like even just a link to the upcoming meetings would be great.

361
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two things I think we should include in every newsletter.

362
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

363
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:52,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so a link to upcoming meetings.

364
00:34:52,844 --> 00:35:16,558
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think what I'm going to do is if this is motion to be approved out of this committee directly to be sent out, then I'll just incorporate these edits on my own time and then send it out in addition to the other edits, obviously, that are in the suggestions right here.

365
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So meetings is one.

366
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:25,148
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one is a way for people if they forward it for people to get on the list.

367
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:37,002
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so just like email for the clerk something, whatever, whatever is, you know.

368
00:35:37,557 --> 00:35:39,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you guys can work together to figure it out.

369
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:41,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it doesn't end up in this newsletter, that's fine.

370
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,401
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the future, I think we should keep it.

371
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:53,769
[SPEAKER_07]: So my understanding is that the links to the upcoming meetings for Zoom, and the clerk could correct me on this, is that they're basically only generated a week beforehand, and there are technical reasons for this.

372
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:57,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So if this is a monthly newsletter, I don't know if we'd be able to put all of the links.

373
00:35:57,532 --> 00:35:59,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But isn't there a link that has all of them?

374
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:07,641
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a link where you can see the upcoming meeting agenda.

375
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:17,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a calendar that's maintained on the city website that has the calendar for the month that Steve Smerdy and his team put together.

376
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:30,802
[SPEAKER_06]: The email distribution list that we run on our office with the council agenda and the committee agendas, that's a fully opt-in list, except that it also goes to all city employees.

377
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:44,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And it goes to all city employees as a matter of course, but all of the residents who are on that list have opted in, have requested to be on the list.

378
00:36:45,891 --> 00:36:48,234
[SPEAKER_06]: You had another portion of the question.

379
00:36:48,254 --> 00:36:49,876
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, how can people opt in?

380
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:50,817
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

381
00:36:51,037 --> 00:36:58,106
[SPEAKER_06]: They generally call me, or it's very low tech, they call me or they email me and ask me to include them on that list.

382
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:08,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple of minor concerns because this newsletter would have to basically start from scratch in terms of the opting in because that's a completely separate newsletter.

383
00:37:08,803 --> 00:37:17,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to make sure because you're putting out some really good information, which I think is a really great idea, but what we want to make sure is that people understand that

384
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:23,968
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the distribution list for the council agendas and the committee agendas.

385
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,571
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also going to be this distribution list for the newsletter.

386
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:31,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to make sure that those are people signing up for separate things.

387
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:32,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

388
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:39,999
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think for the initial one, probably the best we could do is just like, here's the clerk's email if you would like to opt in.

389
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:41,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, OK.

390
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

391
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:46,464
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, cool.

392
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

393
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:52,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Any?

394
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:55,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a motion.

395
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:57,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two motions.

396
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:59,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

397
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:01,460
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are prepared to receive them.

398
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two from you already.

399
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:10,843
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we didn't get a second on my motion to send it to the regular meeting.

400
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:12,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll just reflect that.

401
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:12,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

402
00:38:13,284 --> 00:38:14,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I have two more.

403
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:15,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

404
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:21,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another motion to approve this.

405
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:26,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So by approving it, you'd mean send it, yeah, send it.

406
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:27,589
[SPEAKER_07]: With the edit as amended.

407
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,090
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?

408
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:31,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I missed the motion.

409
00:38:31,952 --> 00:38:40,098
[SPEAKER_01]: To approve the newsletter written by Matt for May, April 2024 as amended.

410
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:41,659
[SPEAKER_06]: As edited or as amended?

411
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:42,560
[SPEAKER_01]: As edited.

412
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:42,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

413
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,502
[SPEAKER_01]: And to approve the draft schedule.

414
00:38:48,271 --> 00:38:49,211
[SPEAKER_01]: That's included in the packet.

415
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:51,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we put that in one motion.

416
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:52,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that work for you Anna?

417
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:53,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

418
00:38:53,153 --> 00:39:00,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we have a motion, two motions on the floor.

419
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:02,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk.

420
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:03,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

421
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:04,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

422
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, sorry.

423
00:39:05,317 --> 00:39:05,417
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

424
00:39:08,322 --> 00:39:16,344
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a motion to speak with Director Nwaje, then there was the one that failed for lack of a second, and then there's a, and then the last one is a two-parter.

425
00:39:16,464 --> 00:39:21,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I count it as one motion to approve the newsletter as edited and to approve the draft schedule.

426
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:22,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

427
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:37,189
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion, Councilor Lazzaro, to approve the drafting schedule and approve the newsletter to be sent out,

428
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:40,714
[SPEAKER_07]: as edited during this meeting.

429
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:41,515
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

430
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:42,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

431
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:43,557
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

432
00:39:44,238 --> 00:39:45,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

433
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:54,088
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Lazzaro to get feedback from DPI.

434
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:54,829
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

435
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:00,693
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

436
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:01,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

437
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Okie dokie.

438
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:09,959
[SPEAKER_07]: These late night meetings with three people.

439
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:10,339
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

440
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:11,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

441
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:24,448
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is that 24-073 offered by Councilors Callahan, Councilor Tseng and Councilor Lazzaro resolution to establish city council listening sessions.

442
00:40:25,385 --> 00:40:28,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion on the floor regarding this one?

443
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

444
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:31,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

445
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:34,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this can be quick and exciting.

446
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:44,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure which of these should actually be motions and which should just be that we plan to keep this paper in committee and move forward.

447
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:52,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we should, I would like to make a motion that we form a subcommittee that includes

448
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,903
[SPEAKER_02]: me, Councilor Tseng, and Chair Leming.

449
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that's okay.

450
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:02,945
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my emotion.

451
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:08,509
[SPEAKER_02]: About the listening sessions to ensure that these listening sessions happen.

452
00:41:09,324 --> 00:41:14,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, besides that motion, I want to open up two ideas for discussion.

453
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,111
[SPEAKER_02]: One, that we try and hold approximately one per month.

454
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:21,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try and hold maybe nine, you know, eight or nine this year.

455
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:30,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would love to have a quick brainstorming session about which groups to reach out to

456
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all part of your motion?

457
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:33,405
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

458
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:33,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, sorry.

459
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:36,387
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion was only about a subcommittee.

460
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:39,067
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest is just- Councilor Callahan, Councilor Tseng, and Chair Leming.

461
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:39,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

462
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:40,508
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the motion.

463
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:42,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is just for discussion.

464
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:45,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we do, you know, one a month, seven or eight this year.

465
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Councilor Tseng and I already came up with a short list.

466
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:55,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can very quickly, I think, you know, brainstorm a list of groups to reach out to this year.

467
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:56,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

468
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:58,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a second on those?

469
00:41:59,175 --> 00:41:59,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

470
00:42:00,095 --> 00:42:00,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

471
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:10,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a motion by Councilor Calhan to form a subcommittee to establish listening sessions.

472
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any discussion from Councilors?

473
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that sounds awesome.

474
00:42:15,305 --> 00:42:16,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one a month is great.

475
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:20,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just ask, are all Councilors invited to attend?

476
00:42:21,627 --> 00:42:27,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Would there be input from other Councilors on location and time and things like that?

477
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:29,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would it be just the subcommittee that would establish that?

478
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:32,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great question.

479
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:34,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll meet as a subcommittee.

480
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:38,592
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to, you know, discuss exactly the logistics of how that's going to work.

481
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: But we certainly can.

482
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:45,227
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we can make the subcommittee.

483
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:48,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can make a subcommittee open to as many people as our.

484
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:50,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there are three person.

485
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:54,551
[SPEAKER_07]: There are three people subcommittees with only three voting members.

486
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:01,774
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think any is pretty much as long as long as it's an open meeting that anybody can attend.

487
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:02,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

488
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:03,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

489
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:04,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

490
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:12,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically it will be a lot of it is just going to be doing the logistics of, you know, when to have these meetings set up and who's going to be there, that kind of thing.

491
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:25,155
[SPEAKER_01]: probably talking to people about what space is available and who can get a conference room and what building at what time, that kind of thing.

492
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:41,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that I think part of the idea is not to use conference rooms and buildings, but to really go to the place where these less represented folks feel comfortable, sort of go on their turf rather than our turf.

493
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:43,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be something that we're doing.

494
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:48,165
[SPEAKER_02]: May I open the discussion of some possible groups to reach out to?

495
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:50,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

496
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:53,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to vote on your motion first?

497
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:59,452
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

498
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:00,232
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

499
00:44:00,252 --> 00:44:00,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

500
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:01,693
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

501
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:02,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

502
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:08,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so what are the groups you'd like to reach out to?

503
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:09,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

504
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So first we thought there are five community liaisons.

505
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:16,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are, you know, five groups that we would love to begin with.

506
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:33,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also thought that high school students would be a really fantastic group and we could do potentially either have just have one group or we could have separate groups for the vocational school and the other half of the school.

507
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:37,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we thought the senior center would also be great.

508
00:44:38,204 --> 00:44:38,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And

509
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:44,083
[SPEAKER_02]: reaching out maybe to some tough student groups.

510
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:51,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And that right there is like, let's see, five for the community liaisons, one or two for the high schools.

511
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:52,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's nine.

512
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:53,168
[SPEAKER_02]: That's this year.

513
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:54,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

514
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:59,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are the, what are the five community liaisons?

515
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:02,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that, do you know them off the top of your head?

516
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:08,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the names of the liaisons themselves, but the, you know,

517
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:22,766
[SPEAKER_02]: The groups that they represent are the Haitian community, the Arab community, the Portuguese-speaking community, Spanish-speaking, and I believe the fifth one is black residents in Medford.

518
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that's accurate.

519
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:28,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

520
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:36,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I guess the other question I had is just open meeting considerations with the listening sessions.

521
00:45:37,188 --> 00:45:43,053
[SPEAKER_07]: So the listening sessions, would they be here or would they be?

522
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:43,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

523
00:45:44,234 --> 00:45:46,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is something that we should discuss in the subcommittee.

524
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:53,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be a little bit of trying to figure out exactly how that's going to work.

525
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:56,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll do a little bit of brainstorming to sort of

526
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,531
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, understand the possibilities.

527
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:02,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's just a longer discussion that we probably want to have to make this already pretty late.

528
00:46:02,454 --> 00:46:02,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

529
00:46:02,914 --> 00:46:03,134
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

530
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:04,015
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

531
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:07,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

532
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

533
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:21,607
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are other groups that folks want to reach out to, uh, you know, now is great or don't hesitate to, you know,

534
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:24,033
[SPEAKER_02]: There's zillions of groups we could reach out to, of course.

535
00:46:24,613 --> 00:46:28,474
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want anybody to feel excluded, but we thought this would be a good starter set.

536
00:46:30,615 --> 00:46:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any public participation?

537
00:46:33,736 --> 00:46:34,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

538
00:46:34,357 --> 00:46:35,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant to include veterans.

539
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Veterans?

540
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:37,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

541
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:41,479
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

542
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:43,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Any public participation?

543
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,361
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

544
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:47,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, do we have any other motions on the floor?

545
00:46:49,022 --> 00:46:49,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Move to adjourn.

546
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:53,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, motion to adjourn.

547
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:54,900
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

548
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

549
00:46:55,823 --> 00:46:56,605
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

550
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:58,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

551
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:58,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
