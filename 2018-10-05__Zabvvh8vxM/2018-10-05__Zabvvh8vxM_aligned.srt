1
00:00:00,591 --> 00:00:08,156
All right, so it is 633 we're gonna try to get started on time this evening.

2
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:09,396
Oh, she is here.

3
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:26,806
Hi So I'm going to call the meeting to order the Community Preservation Committee we are having the second evening of presentations of Applications for our second round of funding and

4
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:40,220
Just as to let people know before we get started, we accept comments from anyone on any of the applications.

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,445
The format is going to be that we're going to ask applicants to give a brief presentation.

6
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:52,267
about their project and then we'll entertain questions from the committee members.

7
00:00:53,208 --> 00:01:00,369
And then if there are any questions from the audience, we'll take questions from the audience as well.

8
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:15,553
And if anyone would like to submit comments about any of the projects, whether they are the projects that are under discussion being presented this evening or the other projects that were presented in our previous evening of presentations.

9
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:27,618
We have posters in the lobby that you can sign your name to or put some notes, and we also have note cards that you can leave in the comment box in the lobby.

10
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:43,946
And if people are watching this on a recording and are not at the media center this evening, they can send their comments to the CPA administrator, Danielle Evans, at Town Hall.

11
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:52,233
and her email address can be found on the Community Preservation Committee's website.

12
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:57,778
So with that, I would like to invite our first applicant to come forward.

13
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:01,362
That is the City of Medford Office of Community Development.

14
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:07,818
Good evening, my name is Clodagh Stoker-Long.

15
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,480
I'm a planner with the Office of Community Development.

16
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:18,305
My application today is for design funding for phase two of Harris Park.

17
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:28,050
I'm sure you recall that back last Christmas I came for an out of order application for phase one for the design and construction of

18
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:32,794
Harris Park, which is located on Middlesex Avenue between 2nd and 3rd Street.

19
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:34,315
It's a 2.5 acre park.

20
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:39,600
Phase one was awarded $300,000 from Federal Land and Water.

21
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,922
You also gave $300,000 and the remaining $217,000 has been appropriated by the city.

22
00:02:54,512 --> 00:03:04,316
We've just recently executed the MOU with Danielle for this work, and the design has just started.

23
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:19,822
We were hoping that the design will take a few months, maybe go out a bit about Christmas to get into construction at the beginning of the construction season next year, probably April, and probably go probably four or five months, so be finished in

24
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:21,963
end of July, early August.

25
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:27,267
That would be the hoped for trajectory.

26
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:39,055
So I have brought some extra little mini grant applications, you know, with the essence if anyone needs one, if anyone wants to look at them.

27
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:46,200
You may recall phase one was a very highly active area with playgrounds and swings and all that kind of thing.

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,282
Phase two is a much larger area.

29
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:54,024
It's made up of the fields area, and as you see in your application,

30
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:15,115
It involves redoing of the fields to have a softball field, but to make it possible to use the space for, for instance, at a tournament, junior soccer fields, or a farmer's market, or some community use that might be desired.

31
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:20,736
It also involves the creation of a rain garden along Third Street.

32
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:22,317
We're trying to be,

33
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:30,127
progressive and environmentally conscious with our work now and when we have an opportunity.

34
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:40,992
And then it also involves some accessibility improvements, just some extra paths around the field, and also involves street edge improvements along Middlesex Avenue.

35
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:51,275
The design costs, which has been submitted as a proposal, the initial design cost is, I think, $106,000.

36
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:59,002
And I have asked for the proposal plus 15% contingency.

37
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:01,164
I mean, it always happens.

38
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:05,468
For instance, I had an initial proposal for phase one for $100,000, and it turns out to be

39
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,491
So I'm already at the very beginning and I'm already into contingency.

40
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,992
But it always happens that you need it.

41
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:18,314
And of course, if we didn't use it, you get it back anyway.

42
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,157
So with that, I'm happy to take any questions.

43
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:24,458
I think you've all seen the proposal.

44
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,639
I've given a very brief outline of what it is.

45
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,480
Thank you.

46
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:31,382
Are there questions from the committee?

47
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:32,122
Sure.

48
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:32,282
Yes.

49
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:40,063
It was the first project as you mentioned was out of sequence.

50
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:44,469
I think this board collectively thought it was a good project.

51
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:46,091
Obviously they awarded $300,000.

52
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:51,800
To be honest we took a little bit of heat from that because it was the first thing we had ever done.

53
00:05:53,081 --> 00:06:13,458
And it would seem to set a tone that That this was just going to be something the city of Medford kind of had as right and I don't think that was the intent but I want to kind of assure that the approaches that he takes for not only phase two but for a future project going forward is something that is

54
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:33,414
the spirit in the letter of our goals and guidelines, which is obviously that it's not just, it's not maintenance, it's meant to do a certain, above, go above and beyond what the city should normally be doing on a yearly, annual basis for all its 26, 27 parks across the city.

55
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:40,800
Could you address those issues in the, maybe in the context of a master plan for all the open space in the city and how this fits into that as well?

56
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:48,787
Well, it just happens that we're just about to start the new open space plan update.

57
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:52,831
We have literally just executed a contract with MAPC.

58
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:53,251
We went out.

59
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:53,551
We did an RFP.

60
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:58,581
We had just two applicants, we interviewed both.

61
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:06,069
And MAPC seemed to be best able to address the things we wanted.

62
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,875
This particular open space plan is also, we got funding from

63
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:18,662
EOEA for also to build in some climate action components into it.

64
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:30,912
So it's going to be a bigger, a more sort of broadly focused open space plan than in the past, which was totally focused on really rehabilitating parks.

65
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,473
And what year was the last full plan?

66
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:37,394
The last full plan was 2011.

67
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,977
Every seven years, you need to do a plan to be eligible for funding.

68
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,121
So we're just about to start that process.

69
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:45,864
They're going to just start doing their research.

70
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:48,287
They'll do a lot of outreach.

71
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:50,590
There will be also three public meetings.

72
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:58,975
We'll be getting input onto what people want, so what's necessary.

73
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:02,716
As you can see with this plan, it's a complete rehab.

74
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:06,337
I mean, it's not maintenance, it's not maintenance of fields, it's not maintenance, of course.

75
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:19,822
It's tearing it down and starting from scratch in both components, and then making a totally new state-of-the-art park which has the components that people wanted, that people have asked for.

76
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:25,818
And we're aware when we do grant applications what the criteria are.

77
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:28,920
And that's why we've come for a new park.

78
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,481
It's essentially a new park.

79
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:36,546
It's not like the Crystal Campbell Park or Riverside Avenue, which we created from scratch, from nothing.

80
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:40,209
But it is a total rehab in two particular phases.

81
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:47,295
And do you anticipate doing this every year, a different park of this scale and magnitude, or something different?

82
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:58,501
Well, I wouldn't be surprised, but the open space plan and what the people define will inform that.

83
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:07,126
I mean, we'll go through this process, which I anticipate taking about six months, and that will inform the next plan.

84
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:12,269
And we generally try and follow the plan.

85
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:16,712
There's a seven-year plan, which is part of the open space plan, and you have to identify

86
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:21,578
what you want to do, and how much we will cost.

87
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:27,986
Sometimes an opportunity comes up, and something different happens.

88
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:28,466
For instance.

89
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:30,596
Most of it, we did several.

90
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:36,198
We completed several of the projects that we hadn't originally in the 2011 plan.

91
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:40,561
But for instance, the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden had not been envisioned in that plan.

92
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:43,902
And then you had the bombings and all that kind of thing.

93
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:45,123
And so that changed that.

94
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:47,424
And we were able to go after this funding and that funding.

95
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:51,546
And there was very strong support from a lot of different sources for that.

96
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:54,108
So that happened, which it wasn't in the plan.

97
00:09:55,068 --> 00:10:02,057
But in general, we will be trying to follow the plan which has been informed by what the public and their participation has asked for.

98
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:11,569
Is there a metric we can use from the last seven year plan to see what percentage of projects the city did complete in that time period?

99
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,132
I haven't analysed that.

100
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,542
But we have certainly done four or five large projects.

101
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:25,983
And of course, you never know whether you'll get them funded.

102
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:28,603
I mean, we've been very successful in getting funding.

103
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:36,246
Years ago, when the city was poorer, we were able to use HUD funding for this kind of thing.

104
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:40,707
But there are very, very few places now where HUD funding can be used for a park.

105
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:43,988
So we have to try and get funding from other sources.

106
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:53,791
I always go after whatever I can, and for every single source.

107
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:55,552
And that's the way.

108
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,133
You're just trying to do the best you can with what you can get.

109
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:02,035
Thank you.

110
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:02,835
Other questions?

111
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,004
All right, I have a couple of questions.

112
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:16,129
My first was, will there be a process for providing neighborhood input into the design of the park?

113
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:16,869
Yes.

114
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:27,975
Now, there was, the initial grant application, which was done, which was for the land and water funding, there was a public process for that.

115
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:32,497
And so there were concept plans drawn up, they're just concept plans.

116
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:43,427
We're working on phase one now, just started, but there will be, and we're working on the basic pieces that are in the concept plan, because that's what's been funded.

117
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:58,437
But we will go to the public with, at some stage, before we finalise the plans, we'll go, but we'll have a neighbourhood meeting, and we'll get input, and we will do some tweaking, and as then when we get,

118
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:14,518
When we go forward and we get nearer and nearer to actually getting final drawings, when the real cost estimates are done, it may be that things have to be tweaked there because we may not have enough money for this.

119
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:24,643
downgrade something or put in alternates or something so that, yes, there will be an opportunity and there may be changes to get minor changes.

120
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:35,326
Because when you're grant-funded, and it's the same with the grant that you've given us, you have, you know, we've said we want to do blah, blah, blah, and you have said, yes, we're funding blah, blah, blah, blah.

121
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:40,968
So we cannot, you know, stray from that very much, but we will be getting input and they will be.

122
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:47,095
people always have things to say and there are tweaks depending on what the public want.

123
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:58,876
And the other question was whether shade trees would be incorporated into the park design, particularly for both the play areas and along the sidewalk.

124
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:02,917
We're not at that stage because we're at the concept stage.

125
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:07,739
There are quite a lot of trees in the phase one area.

126
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,040
They happen to exist, a lot of trees, so I don't know there'll be some plantings.

127
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,441
You know, at the moment in the budget we have

128
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:14,721
plantings.

129
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,862
We don't have the design.

130
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:23,663
There'll be a preliminary concept design, which will be a slight development of what you see.

131
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,504
Then there'll be sort of a 25% plan.

132
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:38,367
And then eventually, after our public meeting and after we've tweaked everything, there'll be a final plan, which will be developed into plans and specs and go out to bid.

133
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:40,285
Thank you.

134
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:41,327
Are there questions?

135
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:41,527
Yes.

136
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,595
At the time, you know, we were understanding that it was a girls baseball or softball field that was necessary.

137
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:13,164
I think that if we say we go out, that there's, you know, when we, with the open space plan during the period, that there's a need to change it or there's, you know,

138
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,951
And if it's possible, I don't know.

139
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:20,993
That is not completely out of the question.

140
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:24,415
However, we would have to get permission to change it.

141
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:27,797
And the reason I say this is because the last three PACs that were done

142
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,901
But you know what this is the reason that when you see especially the first one when you see the

143
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:05,528
The notices for the open space plan need to come and need to make your case.

144
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:08,490
It's going to be the plan for the next seven years.

145
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:21,157
Everything we do, it has to be.

146
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:27,381
Sure, so even with the stadium seating too as well, are we going to have bleachers?

147
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,503
I know we're not at that stage, I doubt it.

148
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:30,283
Yeah.

149
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,004
But we're at the concept phase.

150
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:37,288
We're at exactly, if you've seen this, have you seen the... No, I can take one.

151
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:38,529
Please do.

152
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,271
This is just a very quick version of the...

153
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:45,896
That is what we're looking at right now.

154
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:47,976
It's a very, very basic ideas phase.

155
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:48,277
Sure.

156
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:51,938
I'll definitely email you on some of the other things, too, as well, in terms of the speakers.

157
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,619
All our parks, none of them basically meet that standard.

158
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,781
The other thing I just wanted to basically bring up, a concession stand.

159
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,422
That would be something that we couldn't deal with.

160
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:06,364
I think that would be maybe something that might be done afterwards by the city or with the city.

161
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:08,005
That's not the kind of thing we could deal with.

162
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:10,866
Well, one of those things that you definitely want to consider

163
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:17,231
Because the way meth is evolving right now, we have so many new people moving into method.

164
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:35,444
That's how you build that camaraderie, the partnership, and it's one of those investments where you're basically recycling community money, where the PTOs or some other organization, civic or otherwise, can utilize that, not only for branding of method product, but also just basically for 5G.

165
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:39,967
resources for adaptive students because of the culinary arts programs that are available.

166
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:48,873
So there's something to look at that I think would be beneficial when we start to look at these open spaces in order to basically give access and opportunity for everybody to basically participate.

167
00:16:48,913 --> 00:17:00,241
But I appreciate- That's a good thing, and even if a grant application couldn't provide for a concession stand, it is conceivable that a space might be identified.

168
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:01,262
Yes, exactly.

169
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:03,003
And that's just one of those things in terms of

170
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:06,845
when you start to build that stuff out in terms of a big picture.

171
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:07,585
Thank you, yes.

172
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,426
So just a couple of questions about the project.

173
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,007
Is it going to be natural grass?

174
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:11,987
Yes.

175
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:13,508
Is it lights?

176
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:14,328
No.

177
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,389
No lights, so just daylight.

178
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,110
I'm sorry, can you give us your name?

179
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,011
Oh, I'm sorry, John D'Orazio.

180
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,592
If you'd like to take it again, it's- I'm also a benefit, really.

181
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,341
You must remember, these are just conceptual plans.

182
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,363
And it's just a, yes, sure.

183
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:32,725
These are a very quick little synopsis.

184
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:45,275
for the parks in our community.

185
00:17:45,595 --> 00:18:01,779
We have a lot of parks in our community that, you know what I mean, the return on the value in terms of the car parks, you know what I mean, the Tufts parks, having this type of design, conceptualizing this, will only engage kids in the community a lot more to be active.

186
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,400
So we'd appreciate any type of information on it forward.

187
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,561
I'll send you my information.

188
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:10,502
But I think this is a great start, and I think to build on that in terms of

189
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,891
If I could just chime in on that, thank you Mr. O'Keefe, that's helpful.

190
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:44,677
I think there's obviously with 26 parks across the city, it seems like there needs to be a more comprehensive plan in terms of funding beyond grants for both CPA, federal, I mean you can do a lot with grants and I appreciate, I'm sure the taxpayers appreciate that their monies are being leveraged as much as possible with as much.

191
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:55,040
but just doing what seems to me to be a fundamental investment for the city by majority grant doesn't seem like the right solution.

192
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:12,126
We were lucky on phase one that we were able to fund every single project that came before us, including yours out of sequence, which I was pleased with, because that means that we didn't have to say no to anybody on phase one, and I'm hoping we do the same thing on phase two, but I'm sure there'll come a time where that won't happen,

193
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:14,367
the tough choices will have to be made.

194
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:24,412
And I just want to see the city have a longer term plan and vision for how to fund the infinite needs of the parks across the city for all sports.

195
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:26,994
And this neighborhood in Wellington is well deserving.

196
00:19:27,014 --> 00:19:28,514
This is underutilized, this park.

197
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,015
We know that.

198
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:31,536
That's why we supported it in phase one.

199
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:40,921
We realized that, as you mentioned in the proposal, it did hit many of the requirements, many of the goals from the preservation plan that was put together by this committee.

200
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:58,870
I just think if we can understand the larger context and vision going forward, not tonight obviously, but how you're going to tackle the other 26 going forward over the next 10, 15 years, whatever it is, I think that would be useful to this committee and to everyone in the city.

201
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,011
Thank you.

202
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:03,971
Thank you.

203
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:05,972
So thank you very much.

204
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:06,792
Thank you.

205
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:13,246
And we'll ask the next applicant, which is the Brooks Estate Land Trust to come forward.

206
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,967
Good evening, Tom Lincoln, President Medford, Brooks Estate Land Trust.

207
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:21,568
We have three applications here.

208
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,549
You can tell me which one you want to talk about first.

209
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:26,509
We have first on the agenda the trail restoration.

210
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:27,129
Oh, OK.

211
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,070
I didn't see the agenda.

212
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,770
My apologies.

213
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,052
The Brooks Estate, as you know, is 50 acres of conserved and protected open space on the northwest corner

214
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:37,972
of Medford.

215
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:48,518
The CPA committee and the CPA folks have been kind enough to fund three grants in the round one, which we're hoping to get started on soon.

216
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,659
We need to get the grant agreement, et cetera.

217
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:58,383
And this is, these grants here, including the trails grant, are a continuation of our overall vision for the Brooks estate.

218
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:02,444
which has been worked on for a long time.

219
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,384
Pieces have been done, but not all of it.

220
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,125
It's a very large project.

221
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:14,926
The trails restoration project, basically fairly simple.

222
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:22,908
There are some core trails, walking trails that are heavily utilized by dog walkers, joggers, birders.

223
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:34,098
My favorite statistic in the last few years is that bird watching is the second fastest growing hobby in the United States, and I bet you didn't know genealogy is the first.

224
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:46,391
So, anyway, we want to make these key portions of the trails more aesthetically pleasing, more sustainable.

225
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,113
more user-friendly.

226
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:54,997
And this also, I think, has some other benefits, collateral benefits, as we've described the project.

227
00:21:55,517 --> 00:22:07,885
So we want to remove, on a volunteer basis, there's some asphalt, probably dating from as far back as Brooks Village, after World War II, on some short portions of the trails.

228
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:10,627
We want to use wood chips.

229
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:18,492
to, in a standard way, used in many, many open space projects to enhance the trails.

230
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:23,276
This is better for people's legs running, et cetera.

231
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:25,797
It looks better and it's more sustainable.

232
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:30,681
That's about 1,300 linear feet, as we've estimated it.

233
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:38,346
On the base of this area, near the, what we call the boardwalk,

234
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:54,282
The parking area, which has been provided for a long time since the boardwalk was installed in 1994, we want to provide a simple and tasteful informational kiosk with a reference map.

235
00:22:54,662 --> 00:22:58,605
You've seen these things if you've walked on DCR properties, et cetera.

236
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:09,793
to help users orient themselves, also provide a place to put up interstitial information.

237
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:19,281
We also want to use the graphic basis from that to provide both an online and perhaps hard copy trail map and guide.

238
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:26,427
We've used a variety of informal publications to date, but we'd like to up our game here for the

239
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:32,071
There are a couple of interesting possibilities here, too.

240
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:40,316
The general thinking is that the initial wood chips will be purchased but installed by volunteers.

241
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:49,062
Warren on our board has had extensive experience with this, working with the Appalachian Mountain Club.

242
00:23:50,363 --> 00:24:01,250
But we think there's an opportunity to help the city out on a mutual basis in later maintenance, I guess is the right word, of the trails.

243
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:05,633
The DPW produces a certain amount of wood chips.

244
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:08,955
In fact, they have a large pile of it down at the DPW.

245
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,636
I've talked with Brian Cairns about this.

246
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:12,137
That's number one.

247
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:31,308
More interestingly, there is a huge mass of tree trunks, et cetera, in the so-called stump dump area in the middle of the Brooks Estate, which is ripe, is that the right word, ripe for conversion perhaps to wood chips.

248
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:35,931
And the beauty of that, of course, is literally a couple hundred yards from where it would need to be.

249
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:37,571
applied.

250
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:51,995
And that, frankly, the amount of wood there has built up greatly in the last three or four years, and it would be a win-win situation to reduce that biomass to some extent.

251
00:24:53,196 --> 00:25:00,438
But certainly the wood chips, as I understand it from Mr. Cairns, are available pretty much now at the

252
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:01,938
at the DPOW.

253
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:19,923
The DPOW has always had, at least the time I've been in med for the last 30 years, has had a shortage of space for stockpiling and that kind of thing, you know, wood chips, mulch, et cetera, so that, you know, things that can be removed from the DPWR, which I think will help them also in that respect.

254
00:25:20,743 --> 00:25:26,925
Our intention is to contribute 25% of the grant.

255
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,906
We're asking for 6,500 and the total cost is 8,655.

256
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:37,107
Probably a more specific number than might otherwise be possible.

257
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:41,988
So that's what we got here for this.

258
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:43,648
Thank you.

259
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,789
Questions from board members?

260
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,991
I have a couple of questions.

261
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:51,172
Okay, good, go ahead.

262
00:25:51,792 --> 00:26:06,244
The number one question that we discussed before and we've been continuing to try to do some research on this question is whether wood chips are actually ADA compliant for a trail surface.

263
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:19,556
And as we continue to try to get a solid answer on that question, do you see an alternative at the moment?

264
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:22,078
Or do you consider alternatives for trail surfaces?

265
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:23,859
The basic design for what we're

266
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:39,955
here is based on what's been done at Habitat in Belmont, which is owned by Mass Audubon, who is certainly an organization that's entirely cognizant of these sorts of issues.

267
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:50,520
And again, I'm not an expert, and there are probably a number of alternative services, depending on how naturalistic you want this to look, and we want this to look naturalistic.

268
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,541
The other thing about wood chips is as they decay, they return to the environment nicely.

269
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:08,305
But I think what I would suggest is that we get back, I certainly can do this, get back with Mass Audubon and see, you know, how they've addressed this issue.

270
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:11,789
Because they have multiple properties, and they're certainly going to be.

271
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:19,675
Actually, an appropriate place to get the information might be the Massachusetts Access Board.

272
00:27:19,915 --> 00:27:20,215
Oh, sure.

273
00:27:20,316 --> 00:27:21,396
Oh, sure.

274
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:29,803
Because Mass Audubon may not themselves be doing things in the way that they ought to be for ADA accessibility.

275
00:27:29,863 --> 00:27:31,464
So I wouldn't.

276
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,365
I can talk to MAAB.

277
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:43,528
Yeah, so it would be, that's I think our greatest concern about this is the use of wood chips and whether that will be a problem.

278
00:27:44,308 --> 00:28:00,833
And then what follows from that is if the answer is not wood chips and we need to look at another surface, whether that might dramatically change the cost of the project, the estimate for carrying out this.

279
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:01,553
It's certainly possible.

280
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:14,195
If I could ask on that, the MBOW board has dealt with the MAB, obviously, on the accessible lift in the manor in the past, so we know them, I suppose I could say.

281
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:29,778
But one of the challenges here, as opposed to just about any park in Medford, is that the geography here and the grading, there's like a 50-foot change from the part of the estate in the northwest corner closest to the Winchester Grove Street

282
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:39,107
ADA requires 2% slope, and there are places in this state where it's probably 10%, 12%, or anything in between.

283
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,271
So it's a real challenge.

284
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:52,802
There's limited accessibility, but I think our goal, the goal that Tom has always had is to make the entire state as accessible as possible wherever we can, and I think that's

285
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:56,623
certainly a good point to pursue this further to understand what is possible.

286
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:09,587
Unfortunately, we may not be able to get an answer on that before we officially end this funding cycle.

287
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:14,168
However, I think maybe it might be possible to extend

288
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:35,825
especially given that we have flexibility with the funding requests that we have this time, that we might be able to give an extension to answer that question so that we can fund the project the way it ought to be completed rather than rushing to give an up-down answer before we know really what it's going to take to do this project.

289
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:37,106
That's excellent.

290
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,034
Sorry, I don't have the second one you want is maybe the other questions.

291
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:47,978
I'm just checking my notes to see if I have any further questions on this

292
00:29:50,762 --> 00:30:05,696
The only other question or suggestion that I might have for this is that you're the second applicant to come to us this round with a request for placing a kiosk in a park.

293
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:12,242
And this is a valid accessory to passive recreation.

294
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:25,990
But I wonder whether if we're building two kiosks at the same time, especially if we're going to be asking the city to provide the labor to do those kiosks, whether we can coordinate.

295
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,852
It's also the historical commission, I believe.

296
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:31,154
Yeah, exactly.

297
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:35,836
Good point.

298
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:36,997
That's what I was going to bring up.

299
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:38,457
I thought Tom, that was a great idea.

300
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:40,398
The garden club has $1 garden club.

301
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:45,700
I worked with the garden club back in 2015 in terms of that whole kiosk mindset.

302
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:57,404
That would be ideal, not only for branding and for parks, but also advertising in terms of what the money's going to in terms of, hey, it's that whole project scope.

303
00:30:57,424 --> 00:31:01,585
What they do with every other project, and it becomes a community door too as well.

304
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:04,226
So that's just something I'm just bringing up because I thought

305
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:17,968
That's a very good point because once we get a couple of these built, obviously we'll know exactly the cost.

306
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:21,090
The design can be replicated, can be adapted to any park.

307
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,191
I think it's a really good idea.

308
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:29,336
And if I can too, you have the top of your department here for the vocational school.

309
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:37,582
They're the ones that are building concession stands and doing a whole host of other things that they're able to replicate into that community.

310
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:52,164
Okay.

311
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:20,210
It should be noted that the first kiosk we funded is in the same geographic area at the Oak Grove Cemetery.

312
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,271
We haven't actually funded it yet.

313
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:21,751
That's right.

314
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:22,031
I'm sorry.

315
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:23,353
We've just considered it.

316
00:32:23,373 --> 00:32:24,153
That we've heard.

317
00:32:24,173 --> 00:32:24,494
Thank you.

318
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:25,755
Jumping ahead.

319
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:28,378
Thank you.

320
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:32,582
So your second project on the agenda.

321
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:33,142
I'm sorry.

322
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:33,583
Yes.

323
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:35,685
I'd just like to make a comment on that.

324
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:44,207
As Mr. Carr pointed out, the 2% slope, my name's David from Methodability.

325
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:46,248
David Wheeler, okay.

326
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:49,588
30 years in construction, done a lot of projects with DCR.

327
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:56,170
They basically flatten anything out to make it handicapped accessible and do a gravel base.

328
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:03,532
When you go into a walking trail or something like that, they just run the grade as it is, there's no way

329
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:11,263
to flatten a mountain out and that's how they handle it, that it's a natural terrain and they do the best they can to it.

330
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:26,271
Their attitude on some projects is that you can't destroy nature to get into nature and there's all kinds of products but they tend to go with gravel and sand which isn't really

331
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:33,396
woodsy, but it's a flat level surface that can sustain ADA.

332
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:37,498
Woodchips are their next choice, so I think he's heading in the right direction.

333
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:42,700
I don't think you're going to get anyone to give you an official stamped answer because there is none.

334
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:52,365
As Mr. Cowe pointed out, the law is the 2% slope, so they can't deviate from that in making something accessible.

335
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:53,253
All right, thank you.

336
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:59,315
All right, so the next project on the agenda for you is the stone wall restoration.

337
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:14,018
Okay, there is a 1,475 foot, by our estimates or our measurement, stone wall along Grove Street put in, we believe, by the Brooks family in the 19th century.

338
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:17,299
This is a major design element defining the

339
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,880
edge of the property.

340
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,920
It's very visible.

341
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,862
Grove Street gets a remarkable amount of traffic.

342
00:34:25,622 --> 00:34:27,743
And we've been studying this.

343
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:33,905
We've been working to think about, you know, what would a restoration look like?

344
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:36,426
How would it be accomplished?

345
00:34:37,086 --> 00:34:37,507
Some of the

346
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:39,498
some of the issues.

347
00:34:40,118 --> 00:35:03,445
And what we did back in October, back in February, when the vegetation is less, is basically divide working with Dana Gallop, who is our volunteer consultant, years and years of experience as a landscape designer and architect and landscape contractor.

348
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:13,090
divide, you know, what needs to be done into some categories, ranging from there's no wall left to they're all, you know, virtually intact.

349
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:21,594
And assign some linear lengths to that, did some bottoms-up cost estimating for a dry

350
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:26,017
dry stone wall construction.

351
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:35,944
We know the historic size of the wall based on about 40 percent of the walls left, more or less, what's left.

352
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:45,213
But the proposal here, this is a very large wall, obviously, 1,475 feet.

353
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:59,306
The proposal here is to really call this phase one, and to work from south to north from the historic entrance where the blue sign is, as we call it, along the right side of the building.

354
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:01,328
of Grove Street.

355
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:14,397
And using the analysis that we conducted earlier, we've also applied, since it was February and now it's, you know, not February, applied a

356
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:18,721
An inflation increase of, I think, 9%.

357
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:31,613
We've reached a total project budget of $50,750, in which we were asking for $45,000, and we'll pay the balance.

358
00:36:31,994 --> 00:36:34,476
And we always want to contribute to the bottom line here.

359
00:36:36,718 --> 00:36:37,938
This is a pretty simple wall.

360
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,379
I'm not a mason, obviously.

361
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:44,441
It's about two feet high, about two and a half feet deep.

362
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:54,184
Basically, it's built on gravel or several inches of gravel, at least modern construction.

363
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:56,785
I'm not sure they did that in the 19th century.

364
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:05,228
And really, it's a matter of materials and labor per foot based on existing.

365
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:06,992
conditions.

366
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:13,015
We're going to contribute $5,750 to the project or estimate at 11.3%.

367
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:17,258
So a wall is a wall.

368
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:24,663
And we think this will give us a very good start on the overall project.

369
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:29,646
We didn't want to come and say how about funding a 1,475-foot wall or 60% of it, that sort of thing.

370
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:36,027
Thank you.

371
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,562
Are there questions from the committee members?

372
00:37:42,522 --> 00:37:43,582
Okay, I have a question.

373
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:50,184
How much vegetation removal do you anticipate is going to be required for this?

374
00:37:50,724 --> 00:37:53,464
Well, it varies depending where you are along the wall.

375
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:58,005
There's a certain amount of vegetation on top of the wall, mostly a vine.

376
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:07,907
There's one portion actually in this 300 feet, I'd say it's about 20 feet long, where there's some

377
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:13,552
weed, trees, or sumacs, I guess you'd call it, that sort of thing.

378
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:20,719
The land actually, the general topography kind of slopes away back from it, in back of the wall.

379
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,782
And it's actually fairly clear.

380
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:27,386
There's a few, maybe some larger bushes here and there.

381
00:38:29,428 --> 00:38:37,217
But it's also the kind of thing, you know, you clear it once, bang on it periodically.

382
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:45,146
I mean, this vegetation's had a long, long time to establish itself there.

383
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:54,953
My question was inspired by the recent controversy along Boston Avenue of the removal of all the trees.

384
00:38:55,514 --> 00:39:07,942
And so I just want to anticipate whether there's going to be a similar shock if there's an area where trees, even if they're weeds.

385
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:08,863
I can't envision that.

386
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:15,568
Most of the vegetation is growing on the wall or is bush-like vegetation.

387
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:27,809
What happens is a wall, organic material decays, it gets in between the stones and plants can get a foothold.

388
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:35,476
There are a couple of dead trees, smaller dead trees that are very close to the wall that would have to be removed.

389
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:41,857
But it's basically, the idea here is this is a defining historic and aesthetic element.

390
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:51,299
You have basically understory, an open area there, and then the woods kind of moves in there and then starts going uphill to the east.

391
00:39:52,102 --> 00:40:02,427
I would just want to know ahead of time and be able for the neighbors to know ahead of time if there's going to be a really stark difference in the landscape outside their door.

392
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:10,811
Of course, the interesting thing is if you drive up Grove Street and you look at the color of the stone on the wall and look across the street at the other stones.

393
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,574
But you're not going to raid people's yards, do you?

394
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:20,015
We're not quarrying from the neighbors.

395
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:24,779
Yeah.

396
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:25,820
All right.

397
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,240
Thank you.

398
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,581
Question?

399
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:34,091
The southern portion which is actually closest to the entrance where you want the aesthetic effect most immediately is also the place where

400
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:56,545
Anything that is going to be done, as you know, people access over that wall all the time so they are basically climbing over it.

401
00:41:06,057 --> 00:41:17,206
So my whole thing is if there'd be an opportunity to make an egress, something that'll allow people instead of going over the wall, there's an entrance way or a pathway that allows them to go behind it.

402
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:22,510
Both from a safety standpoint with the winter that comes, as well as just the whole aesthetic.

403
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,811
If you go behind it, you're not accessing the trails.

404
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:30,993
No, but they walk behind it instead of walking in the street at night because of the lighting and stuff like that.

405
00:41:31,013 --> 00:41:36,936
But maybe that's on a different phase or something like that where the lighting can accentuate both.

406
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:40,757
The first guiding principle is there's an historic wall there in terms of that.

407
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:52,504
There is a serious wide opening at the northern end and there's one final piece that takes you to the Winchester line.

408
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:56,006
There's about a 50 foot gap there.

409
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:58,488
Yeah, it's more towards the restoration.

410
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:04,992
The other thing this will help with, it will certainly improve the aesthetics of the entrance itself.

411
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:10,174
In our long-term plan, this entrance never had a gate, as far as we can tell historically.

412
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:17,998
In fact, the two big stone things were moved, I believe, by the city probably 70 years ago from the Winchester.

413
00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:28,603
And I'm sure when the design scheme's done, lighting will emulate it, so I'm sure that'll be spoken for when that phase comes in, too, as well.

414
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:30,638
Okay.

415
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:31,038
Thank you.

416
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:31,939
There is a lot of stuff.

417
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:35,421
We did a historic landscape analysis working with Harvard some time ago.

418
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:37,102
These are pieces of the master plan.

419
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:40,023
The thing about the Brooks Estate is the

420
00:42:57,752 --> 00:43:04,138
The historic core with the manor and the carriage houses, that's where the built environment was.

421
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:08,342
This is not something where there were scattered farm buildings across the landscape.

422
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:21,454
So you basically have the historic core, the hand-built road access drive from Grove Street, this wall along Grove Street, completely naturalistic ponds.

423
00:43:23,503 --> 00:43:25,265
I mean, the landscape's changed a lot.

424
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:29,350
I mean, you have a forest succession that's taken place over the last seven years.

425
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,933
We're not cutting down 40 acres of forest.

426
00:43:32,294 --> 00:43:42,485
I guess my question is, of all of the historic restoration or renovation projects that the Berkson State has to do, how is this identified as being historic?

427
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:53,198
Well, it's something, starting with our thinking about the entrance and moving from there.

428
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:57,540
And I think, frankly, it's the visibility that's important.

429
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:04,803
It's not an attractive face for the Brooks Estate in terms of a major naturalistic built

430
00:44:05,868 --> 00:44:06,988
historic built thing.

431
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:13,551
It's hard to think of nobody built a wall or a patio along the pond, et cetera, historically.

432
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:20,814
So you basically have the manor, the manor yard, that historic core landscape there, the access drive.

433
00:44:21,674 --> 00:44:24,656
But most of the trails at the Brooks Estate were not there in the 19th century either.

434
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:29,842
In fact, there's a certain number of social trails, I think.

435
00:44:30,263 --> 00:44:34,987
Tom, if people are interested, they can get the master plan.

436
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:42,733
It's probably 200, 300 pages long, but there's probably 50 or 60 or 70 pages on a landscape that would be part of that.

437
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:48,859
So if anyone's interested, they can certainly plug in, I think, through the MBEL website

438
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:55,801
The whole plan or whatever piece they want to see I think I think I you know earlier around I provided

439
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:59,755
The entire plan on disk, I'm pretty sure.

440
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:01,395
I'm happy to give you a CD.

441
00:45:01,455 --> 00:45:04,396
We don't have, print versions cost a fortune to make.

442
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:05,656
I still remember, yes.

443
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:08,077
And of course, that part of the plan actually is fairly timeless.

444
00:45:08,097 --> 00:45:09,438
Some of the other aspects.

445
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:31,703
It might be helpful if the plan was entirely available on the Brooks Estate website, is it?

446
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:33,024
And maybe in sections?

447
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:34,144
I think it is.

448
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,504
I think there's a PDF per chapter.

449
00:45:36,564 --> 00:45:39,065
It's a very large document.

450
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:41,265
I'll double check on that.

451
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:44,946
We can certainly get a hard copy for this group, I think.

452
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:50,427
Particularly as it looks like we're getting multiple projects, which is great.

453
00:45:54,408 --> 00:45:59,411
I mean, the thing is, it's an historic landscape, but it's really an historic naturalistic landscape.

454
00:46:02,323 --> 00:46:14,965
vicissitudes of time from a open field farm like gentleman's farm, I don't know quite what the right word is, to a mixed oak and maple forest.

455
00:46:16,705 --> 00:46:20,086
The pond looks remarkably like it does in the 1880 photographs.

456
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:22,966
It's a good hockey rink.

457
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:24,387
What's that?

458
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:27,727
It's a good hockey rink.

459
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:28,948
All you need is ice.

460
00:46:32,028 --> 00:46:36,095
Yeah, I think last year, I don't know, I remember going by and seeing about four pickup games.

461
00:46:37,497 --> 00:46:38,839
It's a wonderful scene, actually.

462
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,941
It is, it is.

463
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:42,044
I mean, I couldn't skate to save my life.

464
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:47,871
And now we'll have someplace warm to go.

465
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:49,112
Thank you, Tom.

466
00:46:49,312 --> 00:46:54,115
All right, thank you.

467
00:46:54,155 --> 00:46:57,357
So we'd like to move on to your last project.

468
00:46:57,477 --> 00:47:00,058
I'm sorry I'm taking so much of your time here.

469
00:47:00,138 --> 00:47:08,904
This is the restoration of, for lack of a better term, the third floor wood trim and associated elements on the manor, as we've talked about.

470
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:18,627
Earlier we've made, starting way behind the eight ball, made tremendous progress and historic restoration of the manor, both the interior and the exterior.

471
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:21,508
This is a tall building.

472
00:47:21,668 --> 00:47:22,529
It's a large building.

473
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:25,610
It's, I think, almost 70 feet from top to bottom in the back.

474
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:33,453
And the third floor trim, including the size of the dormers and associated elements, needs

475
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:39,377
scraping, painting, repairs, that sort of thing.

476
00:47:40,058 --> 00:47:50,247
So the application has a lot of detailed photos, I believe, and drawings.

477
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:50,868
This is

478
00:47:51,308 --> 00:47:59,491
pure historic restoration of existing architectural fabric.

479
00:48:00,852 --> 00:48:09,876
Again, we're proposing we provide 10% of the funding, basically pay for the drawings, detailed drawings of the building.

480
00:48:11,011 --> 00:48:11,652
of the project.

481
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:18,517
This, and I think I'm probably anticipating a question, this kind of work requires MHC approval.

482
00:48:18,537 --> 00:48:28,004
I think we have an excellent relationship with Mass Historical Commission in terms of all the other projects that we've either managed or funded ourselves.

483
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:33,008
Thank you.

484
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:35,089
Are there any questions from committee members?

485
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:42,965
Just curious, how much of the manor is restored to this point?

486
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:51,291
Basically, on the interior, the rooms are all serviceable.

487
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:57,395
We're missing some historic elements, restored historic elements, like chandeliers, a couple of chandeliers.

488
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,097
It's very difficult to find a perfect chandelier, apparently.

489
00:49:01,117 --> 00:49:02,138
I've joked about that before.

490
00:49:05,832 --> 00:49:11,394
I don't want to take your whole day here, but they worked on the electrical.

491
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:14,295
We provided a new caretaker's kitchen.

492
00:49:14,335 --> 00:49:16,256
We provided an EDA bathroom.

493
00:49:17,076 --> 00:49:18,837
We've done a new boiler.

494
00:49:18,857 --> 00:49:31,742
I mean, it's not brand new, but put a new boiler, a new electrical panel, and some associated wiring over the years, 70 new windows and shutters, slate roof.

495
00:49:34,783 --> 00:49:39,686
Related elements, the west porch, which is a two-story Victorian porch on the west.

496
00:49:39,706 --> 00:49:41,247
It's actually the back of the building.

497
00:49:42,227 --> 00:49:44,769
The veranda, the south veranda.

498
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:51,292
Restored some historic elements that had been turned into doors over the years.

499
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:54,974
Refinished the floors.

500
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:56,615
Not a lot of painting.

501
00:49:58,296 --> 00:49:59,797
Provided new door hardware.

502
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:01,358
We've upgraded the alarm system.

503
00:50:02,451 --> 00:50:06,252
You know, we've spent a lot of money and a lot of time working on this.

504
00:50:06,993 --> 00:50:10,034
The first floor, as somebody mentioned, the first floor is handicap accessible.

505
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:11,294
We have a handicap entrance.

506
00:50:12,895 --> 00:50:24,359
On the north end of the building, we have a lift that will take people to the second floor so they can access the very nice second floor back west porch.

507
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,320
And the room is on that end.

508
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,461
of the building.

509
00:50:29,101 --> 00:50:33,063
The vision here has always been this is not a museum.

510
00:50:33,924 --> 00:50:40,407
It's not the kind of place where you're going to have a red velvet rope and look at a room full of Victorian furniture.

511
00:50:41,928 --> 00:50:45,530
It's really designed to be used.

512
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,951
We provided a certain amount of

513
00:50:47,971 --> 00:50:52,217
Function furniture, tables and chairs, that sort of thing.

514
00:50:52,617 --> 00:51:01,248
And as we've said in round one, the major impediment to a lot of use of the building at this point is the condition of the access drive.

515
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:07,258
Thank you.

516
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:23,646
I realize that you have a tremendous amount of experience in doing restoration work on the building, so I just wanted to see if you can comment on the estimate that you included in this proposal.

517
00:51:24,026 --> 00:51:25,447
Well, this is the bottom-up.

518
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:39,211
estimate based on standard measurements in terms of the type of work, linear footage, that kind of thing.

519
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:47,793
We have measured drawings of the exterior that allows us to do this of the building.

520
00:51:48,693 --> 00:51:50,313
This is pretty straightforward work.

521
00:51:50,353 --> 00:51:56,275
It's scraping and painting, some replacement of cedar shakes, that sort of thing.

522
00:51:57,995 --> 00:52:04,758
you know, if you look at Appendix B here on the cost estimate, it's almost all scraping and painting.

523
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:18,123
Part of the cost, the higher cost, I think, compared to, you know, a ranch house or something, is the height and the accessibility for the work.

524
00:52:18,523 --> 00:52:20,904
The good thing is, is this place was beautifully built.

525
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:21,704
I mean, it's 139 years old, 138 years old.

526
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,769
We've made a lot of improvements, we hope to finish.

527
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,972
This will really, I think, pretty much finish off the exterior restoration.

528
00:52:34,913 --> 00:52:41,217
The other thing I forgot to mention, we rebuilt five chimneys, which have a 55 foot draw, I will have you know.

529
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,560
Thank you.

530
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,201
Thank you very much.

531
00:52:47,462 --> 00:52:48,283
Okay, thank you.

532
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:58,847
So then we would like to call the next applicant, which is the City of Medford Mayor's Office and the Housing Authority.

533
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:20,807
My name is Allie Fisk and I am the business and cultural liaison in Mayor Burke's office and I'm here to present the application for two bocce courts to be installed on Medford Housing Authority property, an initiative led by the City of Medford.

534
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:33,033
So just to start very quickly, for those of you who aren't familiar, bocce is a social competitive pastime where people toss or roll balls and displace one another's balls to score points.

535
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:38,096
In a court that's typically 60 feet long by 15 feet, 12 feet,

536
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,685
wide that's covered with gravel and sand.

537
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:44,947
And so that's kind of the scene that we're talking about here.

538
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:58,095
So the location that we've been discussing, as you can see here, is behind the Medford Senior Center and adjacent to a gazebo that's on Medford Housing Authority property behind the senior housing.

539
00:53:58,355 --> 00:53:59,776
So this is on Riverside Ave.

540
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:02,278
The reason that this site has been selected is

541
00:54:03,426 --> 00:54:10,770
because of the proximity to the seniors who are already active in that area, both at the senior center as well as in the apartments.

542
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:17,613
The other reason that this particular location was selected is that there are already amenities available in that space.

543
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:27,278
So the gazebo has seating, there's lighting, there's parking, and it is already prime for the type of activity that BOCCE would be promoting.

544
00:54:29,196 --> 00:54:38,871
The proposed location as I had said is is next to the senior center the bocce courts will be at the South and the West this is a little bit

545
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:41,995
switched with the south and the west of the gazebo there.

546
00:54:43,276 --> 00:54:59,828
The proposal for the Bocce Court is really important because it's gonna provide an opportunity for the community to be able to take advantage of the court recreationally at their own leisure, but it also gives the Medford Recreation Department a facility to utilize for senior programming.

547
00:54:59,848 --> 00:55:08,454
It's something that they've been really prioritizing lately, and this will be another opportunity for them to utilize an amenity for both formal and informal recreational activities.

548
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:19,833
The Medford Senior Center, Pam Kelly couldn't be here today, but she has written a letter in support and has done a tremendous amount of research on her end to see if the senior community, how they would respond to this.

549
00:55:20,273 --> 00:55:24,536
The senior center themselves will also be utilizing the botchy courts for their own programming.

550
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:33,543
They have tremendous indoor programming, but they do not have a lot of outdoor recreation programming, in part due to a lack of facilities, particularly in close proximity.

551
00:55:34,483 --> 00:55:45,231
The Bocce Court is gonna complete or participate in an ongoing network of recreational spaces in Medford Square, so the Riverside Plaza has been newly renovated.

552
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:58,500
There's the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden in front of the Senior Center, and the soon-to-be-constructed Clippership Connector actually is going to travel right next to those Bocce Courts, so it's going to complement everything else that's happening in that area.

553
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:04,399
The project is going to proceed in close partnership between the City of Medford and the Medford Housing Authority.

554
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:16,045
We're going to be engaging a designer to, we have some concepts that are based on conversations with the housing authority and particularly the director of modernization who did do

555
00:56:16,492 --> 00:56:27,076
some initial plans to see if this would fit, which we've determined that it will, but we will be engaging a designer to actually fine tune the plans, look at them and see how it's gonna fit into the landscape that's there.

556
00:56:27,376 --> 00:56:41,041
There will be some landscaping to accommodate it, but for the most part, the amenities that exist already will stay there, and there will be ADA upgrades as well to make sure that the space is ADA accessible, especially considering the audience and the population that's gonna be using the botchy court.

557
00:56:42,253 --> 00:56:54,322
So the partnership between the Housing Authority and the City of Medford will be, the City of Medford's gonna manage the contracts with the designer and the contractors who are selected to do the project.

558
00:56:54,362 --> 00:56:56,023
They will be handling all procurement.

559
00:56:56,644 --> 00:57:00,486
The Medford Housing Authority will actually be overseeing the construction of the project.

560
00:57:00,526 --> 00:57:09,373
It's on their property and their director of modernization is on site and will be overseeing the property, the project during the time that it's being constructed.

561
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:20,127
The actual maintenance itself will be performed by the housing authority, but the costs for maintenance and repairs will be shared by the city and the housing authority in agreements to be determined.

562
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:31,433
So the total estimate for the project is $69,100, which covers the cost of design, landscaping, the actual installation of the botchy courts.

563
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:41,492
infrastructure changes to accommodate the ADA accessibility needs, as well as the actual tools of maintenance and bocce court sets themselves.

564
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:52,255
The Medford Housing Authority will be providing $6,000 in in-kind services in the form of the Director of Modernization, who's going to be the project overseer.

565
00:57:53,355 --> 00:57:56,295
The amount being requested from the Community Preservation Commission is $51,825.

566
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:01,798
which is 75% of the total cost of the project.

567
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,181
The city will be covering the remaining costs, which is budgeted at this moment to be $11,275.

568
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:12,586
The quote for the bocce court was actually secured in April of 2017.

569
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:23,554
We had originally selected a site for these bocce courts then at the intersection of Clipper Ship Drive and Riverside Ave, where the farmer's market used to formally be.

570
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:27,997
We determined it was not a safe or adequate location, and at that point,

571
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:34,453
went to the Medford Housing Authority to see if they would be open to allowing us to put the bocce courts on their property, and of course they agreed.

572
00:58:35,154 --> 00:58:44,082
So the quote at that time that was for the Riverside Out Clippership Drive bocce courts is largely transferable to this new site.

573
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:50,628
It's the same thing, it's construction, it's prepping the site, it's the cost of the fill that's going in there.

574
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:55,652
So we used that quote and we adapted a little bit with some additional quotes from the Medford Housing Authority.

575
00:58:56,186 --> 00:58:59,889
and the Department of Public Works for the additional work that's gonna need to be done in the area.

576
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:09,517
In regards to additional funding, we did seek a grant from the AARP Livable Communities grant and we were not selected as a funding recipient at that time.

577
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:24,729
The work is estimated to take about four weeks and will commence probably in April or May of next spring, making it so that it's ready by the late spring, summer, and fall for when that is most likely going to be its usable time period.

578
00:59:26,405 --> 00:59:30,686
We are very confident that the project is going to serve a very important community need.

579
00:59:30,706 --> 00:59:39,608
It aligns completely with what the Community Preservation Commission has outlined in its plan, particularly the goals related to recreation funding.

580
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:44,669
For instance, goal three, provide diverse recreation opportunities serving residents of all ages.

581
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:51,471
And then within the second priority, create additional amenities, specifically create outdoor recreation gathering spaces for seniors.

582
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:53,972
This is essentially what that is.

583
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:55,752
This will be a gathering space for seniors

584
00:59:56,295 --> 01:00:01,803
on property where seniors are already living and playing, so we feel confident this will serve a very important need in Medford.

585
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:09,013
So I'm available to answer any questions, but Jeffrey Driscoll, the Executive Director of the Housing Authority is also here as well, and he can answer some questions for you.

586
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:09,694
Thank you.

587
01:00:11,696 --> 01:00:12,097
Questions?

588
01:00:14,762 --> 01:00:19,466
Could you repeat who you said did the design or figured that out?

589
01:00:19,707 --> 01:00:21,328
We couldn't hear that.

590
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:27,093
And also, you know, our concern when we were looking at this was for the south location.

591
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:31,297
It seems very tight between the parking and the existing

592
01:00:32,317 --> 01:00:35,159
landscaping there, and there's two light poles in the middle.

593
01:00:35,379 --> 01:00:43,405
So it's not clear to me how that would work and whether it might not be better to have both of them side by side in the other location.

594
01:00:43,505 --> 01:00:44,646
Would you like to speak to that, Jeffrey?

595
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:44,966
Sure.

596
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,627
I'm sorry.

597
01:00:46,707 --> 01:00:51,051
Could you actually step up to the microphone so that you're recorded?

598
01:00:52,031 --> 01:00:52,352
Thank you.

599
01:00:55,475 --> 01:00:58,498
My preference is to have the bocce courts side by side.

600
01:00:59,398 --> 01:01:03,141
And right now they're designed one on the south and I think one on the east.

601
01:01:03,842 --> 01:01:08,666
And so that at this point in time, actually I think that's the west.

602
01:01:09,467 --> 01:01:10,528
At this point in time,

603
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:27,338
uh... what my anticipation is is that if we can somehow put those side by side that would be the preference and i think the socialization would be better for the participants insofar as the closeness to the parking lot one of the ways we could address that is

604
01:01:28,058 --> 01:01:32,382
there's a perimeter around the Jezebo of shrubbery.

605
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:41,769
And more than likely, if we are to put it on the parking lot side, we would take that shrubbery out, and that would open up a significant amount of area.

606
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:46,954
And then people would be able to walk from the Jezebo directly to the courts.

607
01:01:47,054 --> 01:01:49,196
So there is sufficient space, I believe.

608
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,958
It's a matter of what's going to fit best.

609
01:01:52,422 --> 01:01:55,323
If we put it on the side, we end up cutting down some trees.

610
01:01:55,523 --> 01:02:05,945
If we put it on the back, then I think that there'll be sufficient amount of room, but we would lose the shrubbery, which isn't really of great importance, and that would open up the Gazebo directly.

611
01:02:05,965 --> 01:02:18,828
The main concern with a side-by-side is there's one particular tree on that property, which is valuable shade, and we really don't want to do away with that, which is why this was the plan that was being presented, but the designer that will be brought in to look at this will help us confirm the best option.

612
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:25,029
Yeah, and as I said, my preference is to have, whether it be on the side or in the back, the two are together.

613
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:28,270
But the initial design was brought forth with this.

614
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:29,510
So that's still being considered?

615
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,270
Yes, yes.

616
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:31,170
Okay, thank you.

617
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:31,830
You're welcome.

618
01:02:31,991 --> 01:02:44,133
The shrubbery is kind of creating a wall around the gazebo, and with the design of the clipper ship connector and this, it seems like we're trying to open up and make this more lively and activated.

619
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:54,541
So it seems like the shrubbery should just come down and which would open things up visually because that gazebo feels like it's a fort right now.

620
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:55,382
It does.

621
01:02:55,742 --> 01:02:57,303
It does to some extent.

622
01:02:57,724 --> 01:02:59,985
One of the things too that hasn't been mentioned yet is

623
01:03:00,866 --> 01:03:11,737
that this will allow the community to integrate themselves with the residents who live at this public housing site and will allow the residents to participate with members of the community to be a nice mix.

624
01:03:12,097 --> 01:03:17,902
And what we're anticipating is that hopefully this will be a drawer for folks who will come to play bocce and say, well, you know what?

625
01:03:17,942 --> 01:03:19,164
This is a pretty good place to live.

626
01:03:19,244 --> 01:03:20,044
I might want to live here.

627
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:25,770
Whereas they wouldn't have had that opportunity before and the bocce court would afford us that opportunity.

628
01:03:26,045 --> 01:03:32,107
That was going to be one of my questions because I think exactly that there would somebody know that they can play here signage wise.

629
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:33,928
I guess that's important.

630
01:03:33,948 --> 01:03:43,252
I think there will be signage that's talked about how we so meant for recreation getting involved means that there's going to be a lot of marketing about this as a public facility that the public can use.

631
01:03:43,312 --> 01:03:47,693
So the recreation guide our website the city has a lot of ways to get the word out.

632
01:03:47,753 --> 01:03:50,714
So it would be there will be a sign but the sign is only going to go so far.

633
01:03:50,774 --> 01:03:51,875
It's really going to have to be about

634
01:03:52,315 --> 01:03:54,417
There are 200 units in that building and the disabled and elderly folks.

635
01:03:54,437 --> 01:03:58,380
I have not gotten one negative comment from the residents who are thrilled to have possibly the opportunity to use this.

636
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:16,553
And the bocce balls themselves will be made available?

637
01:04:17,694 --> 01:04:22,756
Yes, so people are going to be able to take them from either the senior center or the recreation department.

638
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:29,798
We have to work out the logistics of how that's going to work, but they will be available to people during obvious operating hours.

639
01:04:29,918 --> 01:04:35,901
If there's other ways that we can find some creative way to have a lockbox or another way that they could be accessible, we are looking into it.

640
01:04:36,461 --> 01:04:39,342
Is there parking allotted for this facility?

641
01:04:39,954 --> 01:04:41,555
there is sufficient parking in the back.

642
01:04:42,076 --> 01:04:49,582
We are actually reviewing our parking needs there, and I believe there will be sufficient parking toward the back.

643
01:04:50,022 --> 01:04:53,786
One side is resident parking, the other side will be open parking also.

644
01:04:54,586 --> 01:04:59,711
It's one of the things that we're actually contemplating some additional parking there for this.

645
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:05,535
The one thing I can't commit to, but I am going to propose to my board is additional monies.

646
01:05:06,476 --> 01:05:10,339
for any needs that may come up, whether it be parking, whether it be lighting.

647
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,582
One of the things that has been raised is security.

648
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:20,447
We want to make sure that there's sufficient lighting there, not only on the immediate site, but also to and from the site.

649
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,831
So I just want to echo everything.

650
01:05:24,871 --> 01:05:26,752
I had every one of these questions and comments.

651
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:27,793
So thank you, everybody.

652
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:29,854
I just, I didn't even know it was back here.

653
01:05:30,054 --> 01:05:31,495
It's very buried in back.

654
01:05:31,555 --> 01:05:33,896
You can't see it from the Clippership Drive or Riverside.

655
01:05:34,396 --> 01:05:37,298
So the signage is important to get people back there.

656
01:05:37,598 --> 01:05:39,679
I just pulled it up on Google Maps.

657
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:43,641
And now I know where it is.

658
01:05:45,562 --> 01:05:47,843
What is the gazebo actually used for today?

659
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:50,865
To what extent is it being utilized by people?

660
01:05:52,422 --> 01:05:53,782
It's used for planned events.

661
01:05:55,123 --> 01:05:57,183
It is used by the residents at times.

662
01:05:58,264 --> 01:06:02,805
Is the utilization what I would consider to be significant?

663
01:06:02,845 --> 01:06:03,265
Not at all.

664
01:06:04,145 --> 01:06:05,006
Could it be used more?

665
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:05,306
Yes.

666
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:10,007
Would it be accessible for folks who are going to be playing bocce?

667
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:10,467
Certainly.

668
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:15,289
It's a huge Jezebo.

669
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:16,509
Very, very big.

670
01:06:16,529 --> 01:06:18,450
It's a nice quiet spot.

671
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:19,530
It is, it is.

672
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:21,015
Thank you.

673
01:06:21,836 --> 01:06:22,957
Yes, a question, Tom?

674
01:06:23,197 --> 01:06:26,280
I'm just curious how you reached the conclusion that you need two courts.

675
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:33,666
I've been around Medford long enough to remember that they built a court when they built the fire station in South Medford.

676
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:39,831
And if I recall correctly, I may be wrong here, it was actually made the wrong length.

677
01:06:40,191 --> 01:06:42,974
But I don't think it exists there anymore.

678
01:06:43,014 --> 01:06:47,958
I mean, was some sort of survey done in terms of potential demand here?

679
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:52,160
The idea with bocce and how we want to use it we do want it to be a

680
01:07:05,728 --> 01:07:08,430
possible to have coordinated community tournaments there as well.

681
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:11,852
One bocce court is going to limit your ability to do those larger community events.

682
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:13,973
So that was a big piece behind it.

683
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:16,275
I don't know whether you have anything else to add.

684
01:07:17,155 --> 01:07:22,578
Yeah, I will say that in a number of communities where I've seen bocce courts, I've not seen a single court.

685
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:26,441
I've usually seen two or four courts.

686
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:30,183
For whatever, I'm not a bocce player, so for whatever reason

687
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,929
For whatever reason, I've seen mostly two.

688
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:36,971
That was a discussion that we had from the very beginning.

689
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:38,193
I'm sorry, one other question.

690
01:07:38,413 --> 01:07:41,376
I'm just curious.

691
01:07:41,396 --> 01:07:43,678
How is the sign up going to work?

692
01:07:43,698 --> 01:07:46,801
When you go to a tennis court, you have to sign up somehow.

693
01:07:50,526 --> 01:08:02,763
It would have to I think that we're gonna have to work out those logistics I spoke with Medford Recreation They did say that they would manage the reservations of the bocce court like with a lot of the other parks you do need to reserve them in advance and there is an online system to do that and

694
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:11,372
So we'll work out the logistics with them, and we'll make it as smooth as possible, understanding that not everyone has access to the internet as well.

695
01:08:11,392 --> 01:08:12,773
So we will work out those logistics.

696
01:08:12,793 --> 01:08:15,476
Do you have a preference for people that live within 100 feet?

697
01:08:16,537 --> 01:08:17,538
I'm just joking.

698
01:08:17,578 --> 01:08:24,926
I'm just curious, because this is being, it's on our public housing site, it's next to the senior housing.

699
01:08:25,586 --> 01:08:31,969
We also need to see what the demand is also and how we manage it will depend a little bit on who's using it.

700
01:08:46,485 --> 01:08:48,306
Yes, so there's actually three bocce leagues.

701
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:52,127
There's one in Medford, there's one in Malden, and they have one in Everett, too, as well.

702
01:08:52,147 --> 01:08:57,388
Where there's over 200 players, you need the two courts because what you have is you have couples bocces.

703
01:08:57,788 --> 01:09:01,529
So you don't want to bog them down in terms of having three-hour events.

704
01:09:01,849 --> 01:09:08,310
So that's why they have the dual courts in order to basically standardize the competition as well as to increase the volume of play.

705
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:14,692
What you're probably going to end up doing to the rec department is setting up a league where it runs for eight, six, even 12 weeks.

706
01:09:16,012 --> 01:09:19,717
And then you have certain divisions and then there's rankings, so on and so forth.

707
01:09:20,037 --> 01:09:21,218
That's similar to what it does.

708
01:09:21,318 --> 01:09:25,383
So, I mean, what you're doing in terms of a scope is ideal.

709
01:09:25,763 --> 01:09:28,226
I mean, you definitely need the two courts.

710
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:31,830
If you're looking to parlay in terms of having some more information about it,

711
01:09:33,512 --> 01:09:36,513
They just built them down the Method Boat Club, they designed them.

712
01:09:37,054 --> 01:09:42,616
I mean, they had someone come in and basically scope it all out, so there's a template for them to basically utilize.

713
01:09:42,696 --> 01:09:47,618
Joe Casey, who's with the Method Police, he'd be a great person to contact with regards to it, so.

714
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:48,198
Thank you.

715
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:49,959
That would be the value add.

716
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:52,260
This is just kind of a joke.

717
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,741
I'm sorry, can I have your name for the record?

718
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:55,522
Edward Messina, I'm with the Method League.

719
01:09:55,722 --> 01:09:56,022
Thank you.

720
01:09:57,123 --> 01:09:59,946
This is kind of a joke because I'm part of the oldest one here.

721
01:10:01,248 --> 01:10:01,768
I'm 72 today.

722
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:01,889
I'm 87.

723
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,281
Fantastic.

724
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:15,963
When I was a kid in East Boston, we used to have party courts.

725
01:10:16,363 --> 01:10:19,986
You're going to have the grape, grape vines so we can make the wine?

726
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:23,909
I don't think that's in the budget.

727
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:24,349
Thank you.

728
01:10:24,409 --> 01:10:25,310
Any more questions, comments?

729
01:10:31,781 --> 01:10:36,104
Well, just actually, I think that's really helpful information about the league.

730
01:10:36,124 --> 01:10:41,949
I mean, I think I was going to make a comment about whether Medford Recreation was going to start a league.

731
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:49,374
So we'd certainly encourage them to do that so that there's some to help with the programming and utilization of it.

732
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:54,078
I'm interested to learn that there's already some bocce courts in Medford.

733
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:55,139
So I'm just curious.

734
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,583
I'd like to know whether they know that and whether there's any

735
01:11:01,283 --> 01:11:02,205
you know, coordination.

736
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:04,809
Is the Wellington Yacht Club one, are they new?

737
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:07,835
I'm not sure if the Wellington Yacht Club has it.

738
01:11:07,855 --> 01:11:09,356
I know the Method Boat Club has it.

739
01:11:09,376 --> 01:11:09,756
Oh, sorry.

740
01:11:09,777 --> 01:11:10,857
That's what I meant to say.

741
01:11:10,937 --> 01:11:11,237
Excuse me.

742
01:11:11,257 --> 01:11:12,118
It's seasonal.

743
01:11:12,498 --> 01:11:14,740
So, you know what I mean?

744
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:18,142
It's just one of those things where, you know what I mean?

745
01:11:18,302 --> 01:11:20,083
They have the teams and stuff like that.

746
01:11:20,123 --> 01:11:20,564
That's only.

747
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,405
That's membership though, right?

748
01:11:22,465 --> 01:11:23,265
Is that member only?

749
01:11:23,426 --> 01:11:24,346
Member only, yeah.

750
01:11:24,386 --> 01:11:33,873
So what you have here is you're going to have the seniors and the kids and they'll be able to basically parlay with each other in terms of just that whole mentorship stuff.

751
01:11:33,893 --> 01:11:34,433
So it'll be great.

752
01:11:34,633 --> 01:11:42,582
Medford Recreation, I think, really specializes in seeing what the community that already exists that's doing this, trying to figure out where the gaps are.

753
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:46,447
I think that creating a league would totally be something that they would be interested in.

754
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:49,210
I haven't had the opportunity to speak with them in detail about that.

755
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:50,892
But we'll also have to look to see.

756
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,654
I didn't realize there was a Medford League as well.

757
01:11:52,714 --> 01:11:55,157
So there's more research to be done on the logistics of that.

758
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,801
the operations of the court.

759
01:11:56,861 --> 01:11:59,203
Yeah, Malden has one too.

760
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:04,987
There's a couple hundred people and a lot of them are from Memphis too.

761
01:12:05,307 --> 01:12:07,789
I'm sure they'll be excited to see this.

762
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,111
You know it's all cash prizes too, right?

763
01:12:14,172 --> 01:12:15,213
Thank you for coming, Mr. O'Keefe.

764
01:12:15,233 --> 01:12:19,316
You've been very helpful tonight on multiple projects, so we appreciate it.

765
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:26,941
You have an encyclopedia knowledge of many of the Medford parks, so we appreciate the information and the insight.

766
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:29,002
Thank you.

767
01:12:29,062 --> 01:12:29,723
Thank you very much.

768
01:12:30,143 --> 01:12:31,084
Thank you.

769
01:12:32,084 --> 01:12:38,629
And our next applicant this evening is Friends of Wrights Pond and the City of Medford Parks Department.

770
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,012
I just see the Friends of Wrights Pond.

771
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:45,933
Good evening, my name is John Bob 80.

772
01:12:45,973 --> 01:13:02,661
I live at 79 Equavia Road and I'm here with the representing the friends of Wrights Pond who are in partnership with the City of Medford Park Department to help beautify the area around the bandstand at Wrights Pond.

773
01:13:02,681 --> 01:13:06,723
It's an area that has been

774
01:13:08,803 --> 01:13:11,484
neglected by the Friends of Rice Pond.

775
01:13:13,124 --> 01:13:21,206
We have done an awful lot of work over the past 30 years of volunteering with the grit work of planting trees.

776
01:13:21,886 --> 01:13:32,309
I don't want to get into that, but if you've been up there, you can see the visuals yourself that the area has become a beautiful site.

777
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:35,450
This is the area, I'm not,

778
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:43,855
talking about this area, but the other areas have really enhanced the beauty of the pond area.

779
01:13:44,696 --> 01:13:47,999
So we're here for a proposal of approximately $5,000.

780
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:53,823
Actually, we got an estimate of $4,845 to at least get us started in the project that we're interested in.

781
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:25,258
We we intend to plant a flowering dogwood trees a couple couple of flowering crabs for rhododendrons a couple of Japanese use some hydrangeas various types of perennials And ground cover etc.

782
01:14:25,978 --> 01:14:30,099
It's an area right Surrounding the bandstand.

783
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,500
I'm gonna guess

784
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:40,035
it might be a half an acre, I didn't measure it, but it's an area that really needs help.

785
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:57,886
And it would serve as a, I think, a beautiful welcoming area for those coming from the parking lot, which this site is adjacent to the cut-through part of the parking lot, and I think it would just enhance the area tremendously.

786
01:14:58,867 --> 01:15:12,214
In the past, some of you may be new to Medford, I could just go back a little ways, maybe 30, 35 years, Wright's Pond wasn't a welcoming area.

787
01:15:13,599 --> 01:15:25,104
Today, if you go there in the summer or in the spring or in the fall, you see many, many seniors who use it as a reading area.

788
01:15:25,804 --> 01:15:29,006
You see the bathers, you see the family network.

789
01:15:29,506 --> 01:15:34,148
It's a busy, I don't know the numbers they charge, I don't know, I think $25 to park for the year.

790
01:15:36,249 --> 01:15:40,232
But it takes in an awful lot of people, maybe 1,000.

791
01:15:41,373 --> 01:15:41,753
I don't know.

792
01:15:41,813 --> 01:15:42,774
The city would know that.

793
01:15:43,094 --> 01:15:44,395
We don't get involved in that.

794
01:15:45,216 --> 01:15:49,439
But like I say, we would like a grant.

795
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:58,406
Most of the people who have worked there in the past have either died off or live in assisted living and things of that nature.

796
01:16:01,272 --> 01:16:02,093
I'm still around.

797
01:16:02,913 --> 01:16:03,694
I'm one of the few.

798
01:16:04,535 --> 01:16:19,007
And I still go out and volunteer in the off-season, and I pick up the trash, et cetera, et cetera, because the pond is only open for a couple of months, from, I think, June 25th to about Labor Day.

799
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:25,752
And so, you know, I will call the park department when the barrels have to be emptied and so forth.

800
01:16:25,912 --> 01:16:29,976
Just a small task, and it helps me to get my walking in.

801
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:32,734
So anyway, that's what we're looking for.

802
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:36,456
We would appreciate this very much.

803
01:16:37,136 --> 01:16:43,180
In the future, we're gonna be coming back looking for irrigation.

804
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:51,825
I've been doing it for 30 years with a hose, and carrying a hose around 100 feet is not easy.

805
01:16:52,345 --> 01:16:57,748
I try to educate the workers, you know, the park workers, the young ladies and the young kids.

806
01:16:59,075 --> 01:17:00,676
And they do a great job for me.

807
01:17:01,756 --> 01:17:03,897
And they cooperate tremendously.

808
01:17:04,357 --> 01:17:05,597
But it's a lot to ask.

809
01:17:06,417 --> 01:17:13,500
And I think the irrigation next year, I think we got a quote for about $11,000 to do that.

810
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:22,743
And it's our vision and our purpose to make the area beautiful and welcoming.

811
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,204
And most of the people that go there truly appreciate it.

812
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:32,814
Any questions?

813
01:17:33,394 --> 01:17:36,396
Thank you.

814
01:17:36,437 --> 01:17:39,719
The cut-through path that you mentioned, I'm familiar with it.

815
01:17:39,819 --> 01:17:43,302
Is that going to be improved at all as part of this?

816
01:17:43,522 --> 01:17:47,245
Well, not as part of this project.

817
01:17:47,886 --> 01:17:48,786
Maybe in the future.

818
01:17:48,806 --> 01:17:52,830
I expect, as long as I'm around, I'll be here looking for money.

819
01:17:53,610 --> 01:18:15,306
uh to beautify the area and we understand that this year we were a little bit late and there was only a minimal amount of money available so we just came in with this small project but we want to add to this each year in different parts of the park you know winter kill of plants and things they need to be

820
01:18:17,143 --> 01:18:17,983
you know, restore it.

821
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:28,167
And so every year would be a great help if this board would help us to preserve the area.

822
01:18:30,948 --> 01:18:31,308
Thank you.

823
01:18:31,368 --> 01:18:32,149
Hold on one moment.

824
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:46,334
You answered one of the questions that I wanted to ask, but I also wanted to ask whether, you know, this is a very well-loved park in the area.

825
01:18:47,075 --> 01:19:00,266
And, you know, it's kind of beyond the scope of the request that you're making for this project, which sounds like it's going to be a really cost-effective way to beautify a section of the park that really needs attention.

826
01:19:03,048 --> 01:19:20,721
it would be, it's kind of difficult to imagine that you're the only person or there's only a small group of people who have an interest in improving and beautifying and leading the stewardship of this park.

827
01:19:21,202 --> 01:19:26,586
And so I'd really love to see how it's possible to expand that group of people.

828
01:19:26,686 --> 01:19:28,067
Well, it won't take much.

829
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:28,547
Yeah.

830
01:19:29,008 --> 01:19:31,549
Because the Grace Episcopal Church

831
01:19:33,431 --> 01:19:53,492
uh their members and we had hundreds every year we whenever we put out a flyer or the information that we need volunteers we get many many volunteers and we have uh we discontinued doing this uh probably when uh

832
01:19:54,704 --> 01:19:55,965
Vin Giovinelli died.

833
01:19:56,025 --> 01:20:03,592
I don't know if those of you who know Vinny, he spearheaded this along with Claire Domenico and others.

834
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:05,694
Excuse me.

835
01:20:08,256 --> 01:20:11,239
But anyway, I'm sorry.

836
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:17,464
But Vinny spearheaded it and we got all kinds of donations.

837
01:20:17,784 --> 01:20:21,367
Every single penny was from donations.

838
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:29,520
And the volunteers, I mean, would get, on a Saturday or mostly Saturday, would get 100.

839
01:20:29,861 --> 01:20:37,467
And they would, with their shovels and with their rakes, clean up, planting, et cetera, et cetera.

840
01:20:38,308 --> 01:20:42,372
And we haven't done it for a while because there aren't too many of us left.

841
01:20:43,363 --> 01:20:51,853
And all we had to do, all we have to do was set out a message that we need help, and they'd come over the mountains.

842
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:53,615
Thank you.

843
01:20:53,876 --> 01:20:54,436
You're welcome.

844
01:20:54,496 --> 01:20:55,217
Thank you very much.

845
01:20:55,377 --> 01:20:57,280
Are there any, just one quick question, sorry.

846
01:21:04,885 --> 01:21:09,226
I see that there's a component to remove invasive species.

847
01:21:09,787 --> 01:21:10,047
Yes.

848
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:10,827
Which is great.

849
01:21:11,307 --> 01:21:16,389
Yeah, there's poison ivy back there and there's bittersweet and there are other things.

850
01:21:16,429 --> 01:21:22,452
Yeah, I just, the young kids go in there.

851
01:21:23,595 --> 01:21:26,117
you know, when they come with the family network.

852
01:21:27,158 --> 01:21:29,560
And that blows my mind when I see that.

853
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:31,982
So we've got to get rid of it.

854
01:21:32,462 --> 01:21:34,904
So you'll be coordinating with Alicia Hunt?

855
01:21:35,384 --> 01:21:37,126
Yes, I've already spoken with Alicia.

856
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:37,826
Yes.

857
01:21:39,067 --> 01:21:44,992
And so the plants that you're going to be planting, I hope that they're going to be native species for the most part?

858
01:21:45,397 --> 01:21:47,197
You're asking the wrong person on that.

859
01:21:48,458 --> 01:22:10,502
I told Mike Nesta, the director of the parks, what we would like, and he has spoken with ground masters, whom the city employs, and I don't know if they're native, but I know they're from the north and maybe Canadian or whatever in this region.

860
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:14,770
Native, as opposed to strictly landscaping plants.

861
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:23,337
But one of the incentives for planting native plants is that it's actually exempt from filing before the Conservation Commission.

862
01:22:23,637 --> 01:22:23,997
I see.

863
01:22:24,438 --> 01:22:25,158
I didn't know that.

864
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:26,919
Thank you.

865
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,461
We can look into that.

866
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:43,205
One thing I would ask, if you're going to be coming here every year for a small or medium-sized product, that sounds great because I can see that over time you would obviously redo the whole thing, but I think what would be helpful for us to see is

867
01:22:45,647 --> 01:22:54,393
kind of a measured master plan drawing that could be something that we could adapt and show how it's going to all come together over the many years.

868
01:22:55,134 --> 01:23:00,778
And, you know, that's something that I would hope that all the improvements that were done a couple decades ago with your group

869
01:23:01,358 --> 01:23:20,747
there should be some kind of drawing that we could adapt or find a way to have a little bit more documentation so we can see, you know, the trails and just improvements as they're made because, you know, the hand-drawn, unless you know the park really well, the hand-drawn diagrams are tough to read.

870
01:23:21,688 --> 01:23:26,190
So with that, there might be some volunteers, either a civil engineer.

871
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,291
I think there was something in the open space plan.

872
01:23:28,311 --> 01:23:28,451
Okay.

873
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:29,811
Something that would be...

874
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:32,072
Okay, that's good.

875
01:23:32,112 --> 01:23:37,173
I didn't see that, so I think that would be, it would help us understand it better.

876
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:39,174
But I think it's a great start.

877
01:23:39,674 --> 01:23:44,415
Right now, we think we have a tremendous foundation up there.

878
01:23:45,115 --> 01:23:52,176
And there really isn't too much more that is necessary, except for this patch behind the bandstand.

879
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:57,077
You know, except for, like I said, Winterkill and things of that nature.

880
01:23:58,118 --> 01:24:05,648
But unless they want to expand, there's certainly other areas up around the parking lot that could be improved.

881
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:09,133
Right now, they're just trees and it's kind of a rough area.

882
01:24:09,694 --> 01:24:15,401
But if in the future, if they wanted to beautify that area, that could be done as well.

883
01:24:16,682 --> 01:24:18,944
But it's got great, great potential.

884
01:24:19,324 --> 01:24:24,889
And I think those of you who have been up there understand what I'm talking about.

885
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:28,272
It is a tremendous asset to the city of Medford.

886
01:24:29,133 --> 01:24:30,894
Thank you for your work over many decades.

887
01:24:30,914 --> 01:24:31,254
Thank you.

888
01:24:34,124 --> 01:24:39,186
Yeah, if you want, I can just add, I know we've worked with him, I do the Boy Scouts too as well.

889
01:24:40,046 --> 01:24:49,170
Yes, so a lot of the Eagle Scout projects we partner with the friends of Rice Pond in order for them to basically enhance some of the pathways.

890
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:53,012
We actually do overnight camping trips there, that's what we do for onboarding.

891
01:24:53,772 --> 01:25:01,215
One of the first things we do when we have kids transition from the Cub Scouts to the Boy Scouts, instead of taking them to Maine to camp,

892
01:25:01,875 --> 01:25:15,209
We take them up to Wright's Pond and then we bring someone from the Friends of the Fells to basically teach them in order for them to earn their Bartonist badge and then they basically diagram and they mark off all these paths.

893
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:20,434
So that's the partnership that the Boy Scouts do work with the Friends of the Fells.

894
01:25:21,555 --> 01:25:25,057
the Wrights Pond, and they've been a great group for the past 10 years.

895
01:25:26,057 --> 01:25:31,779
I was actually one of the first people to have an overnight camping trip up there, and unfortunately I horrified him.

896
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:36,961
I think about 5.30 in the morning, he was coming to basically do his morning chores.

897
01:25:37,241 --> 01:25:47,185
But to give you an idea of the historic value that happens here, Wrights Pond was one of the first ponds that basically established the city of Boston to come out and visit.

898
01:25:47,465 --> 01:25:49,726
There's still a bus that comes out of Haymarket.

899
01:25:50,386 --> 01:25:55,830
that drives up and drops them off at the bottom of the ramp, and these people walk up.

900
01:25:55,911 --> 01:26:01,195
It goes through Haymarket, through Chilestown, and drops off right at the bottom of Elm Street.

901
01:26:01,575 --> 01:26:13,985
That bus is still serviceable today, and the folks and the senior citizens still utilize it in order to come up from the north end, from Chilestown, and from those inner communities in order for them to access

902
01:26:14,665 --> 01:26:17,108
the country living, you know what I mean?

903
01:26:17,168 --> 01:26:21,131
So they come up and they fish, they come up and they walk those paths.

904
01:26:21,432 --> 01:26:28,738
There's a lot of seniors that are from outside of Medford that have used this as a historic perspective for the past 50 plus years.

905
01:26:29,099 --> 01:26:36,966
When you see a lot of the homes up in that north Medford area, a lot of those homes were cottages for the folks in the north end and the child stock.

906
01:26:37,408 --> 01:26:42,949
And then they became full season homes as the children grew up and needed a place to live.

907
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:48,450
And they moved up into North Method because that's where they used to have their cottage to go to Wright's Palm.

908
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:57,372
So that bus still exists, just to give you an idea of the historical perspective of Wright's Palm, the value added that it provides to both seniors and our community groups.

909
01:26:57,672 --> 01:26:59,392
In addition, historically,

910
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:11,323
Rudd's Pond area was the scene of one of the first silent movie colonies in America.

911
01:27:12,104 --> 01:27:17,105
I don't know how many of you know that, but you could look that up in the Medford Historical Society.

912
01:27:18,186 --> 01:27:28,969
And it was in the 1920s, and I don't know, because of funding or whatever, I'm not positive, it was discontinued.

913
01:27:30,469 --> 01:27:39,033
Along with that, one of the first ice houses in the area was at Wright's Pond, at the mouth of the pond.

914
01:27:39,874 --> 01:27:43,235
And they had an ice house there for commercial reasons.

915
01:27:44,336 --> 01:27:51,019
They used to sell the ice, I don't know where, but probably to Florida and other places.

916
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,461
That's part of the Medford history.

917
01:27:56,312 --> 01:28:03,734
And it's intriguing, it really is intriguing, of the history that's up in that area.

918
01:28:03,974 --> 01:28:04,235
Thank you.

919
01:28:04,275 --> 01:28:13,317
Actually, that raises a question that maybe either you or Tom Lincoln could answer, which is, does anyone know when Wright's, it was a man-made pond, when it was made?

920
01:28:13,337 --> 01:28:18,079
I'm not sure when it was made, but I know that we have pictures

921
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:22,407
of, it was a brook at one time, it was a farm.

922
01:28:23,067 --> 01:28:44,322
And the lifeguards tell me that there's a stone wall under the water that still exists, a wall separating the farm, however, and I don't know the rest of the history about it, but they dammed it up, it's a man-made dam,

923
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:48,127
And they dammed it up, I think, for the ice.

924
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:49,147
I'm not sure.

925
01:28:49,447 --> 01:28:49,947
OK, thank you.

926
01:28:49,967 --> 01:28:51,308
Did you, Ivan?

927
01:28:51,328 --> 01:28:59,570
It's also tied in somehow to, as I saw Fred Lasky's talk, tied into the broader water system in Boston.

928
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:05,272
At one time, they used some of the ponds up in that area for water supply.

929
01:29:06,854 --> 01:29:11,839
I just wanted to comment on the movie thing because that's a great story.

930
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:19,586
The movie business actually disappeared there right about the end of World War I because they discovered that the light

931
01:29:28,497 --> 01:29:32,199
And the constancy of light and the quality of light was better in California.

932
01:29:32,559 --> 01:29:36,101
But if you go up Elm Street, there's a house there with a big broad porch.

933
01:29:36,181 --> 01:29:39,563
And that's where the movie stars of the day would live.

934
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:47,387
And if they would take the raw footage and show it in Medford Square at the movie theater, it used to be there.

935
01:29:47,407 --> 01:29:52,630
But it all kind of disappeared probably by about 1920.

936
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:54,531
But that house really sticks out.

937
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:55,992
It's got a big, beautiful porch.

938
01:29:56,052 --> 01:29:57,713
And they had pretty good parties there.

939
01:29:59,584 --> 01:30:08,046
Also, if I may, the children's playground area, for those of you who are familiar.

940
01:30:09,006 --> 01:30:13,707
At one time, a house sat there, owned by Mrs. Morrow.

941
01:30:15,488 --> 01:30:18,148
And I knew Mrs. Morrow, she raised collies.

942
01:30:19,249 --> 01:30:23,610
And they claim she raised Rintintin.

943
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:25,770
I don't know if that's true or not.

944
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:27,251
But when Mrs. Morrow died,

945
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:43,831
She willed that home to the city and with exclusive rights to the Medford Fire Department to burn it down and use the area for Medford residents.

946
01:30:45,693 --> 01:30:47,534
That's Mrs. Morrow is her name.

947
01:30:48,475 --> 01:30:50,437
I don't know if you know anything about that.

948
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:52,559
Thank you.

949
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,442
Actually, that's very helpful.

950
01:30:54,462 --> 01:30:56,284
That answers a question that I've been thinking about.

951
01:30:58,907 --> 01:30:59,268
All right.

952
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:00,269
Thank you very much.

953
01:31:00,329 --> 01:31:06,617
With that, I think that we'll move on to our last applicant of today, which is the Medford Little League.

954
01:31:07,558 --> 01:31:07,938
Thank you.

955
01:31:08,539 --> 01:31:09,000
I'll be brief.

956
01:31:10,161 --> 01:31:10,582
Yeah, right.

957
01:31:10,602 --> 01:31:16,051
My name is Bill O'Keefe, I'm with Method Little League.

958
01:31:16,131 --> 01:31:18,896
I've played in Method Little League since 1977.

959
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,769
in the art of baseball.

960
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,551
We have a lot of board of directors members here.

961
01:31:30,191 --> 01:31:31,812
I can introduce them if need be.

962
01:31:31,832 --> 01:31:37,616
But what I think we can do is just put a quick video together in order for you to see some of the highlights of our season.

963
01:31:37,896 --> 01:31:46,942
We're an all-volunteer group that basically relies heavily on civic organizations and donations from the business community in order to do what we do.

964
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:53,606
This year alone, we actually... We can do that from opening day, just to give you an idea.

965
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:18,348
So we start every year, basically, putting everybody together as a community.

966
01:32:18,488 --> 01:32:20,690
I'm sorry, could you actually speak to the mic?

967
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:22,731
Thank you.

968
01:32:23,552 --> 01:32:24,752
So this is our opening day.

969
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:33,418
We normally do a parade, but because of how the weather's been so off and on every year, we now just walk the whole mouth track.

970
01:32:34,019 --> 01:32:40,003
So it's a lot safer, and we just basically bring everybody over to a trained field.

971
01:32:42,175 --> 01:32:43,636
and have an opening day event.

972
01:32:44,136 --> 01:32:46,557
So we have over 400 kids that participate.

973
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:50,079
Our program basically averages about 600 kids.

974
01:32:50,099 --> 01:32:52,320
We have a lot of travel teams.

975
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,541
We play three seasons.

976
01:32:53,561 --> 01:32:59,544
To give you a historical perspective in terms of Little League, we had to merge all the city teams.

977
01:33:00,084 --> 01:33:02,506
There was a number of reasons for them, and one of them was financing.

978
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:05,711
This is Gillis Park.

979
01:33:05,751 --> 01:33:08,832
Gillis Park is one of the oldest fields.

980
01:33:09,413 --> 01:33:14,235
This used to be the old high school field before 93.

981
01:33:14,275 --> 01:33:22,219
This was a football field prior to it becoming a baseball field, but they also used it as a baseball field too as well.

982
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:25,181
We'll provide some photos so you can see that.

983
01:33:25,301 --> 01:33:32,585
This is where Amelia Earhart gave her maiden voyage speech right when the football tower was here.

984
01:33:33,045 --> 01:33:45,510
before she made her... This is one of these areas that has great improvements and opportunities for so many, so many community groups in the city of Method.

985
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:50,012
Whether it's the garden club, the art club, or the recreation group.

986
01:33:50,532 --> 01:33:54,314
There's so many equal opportunities and visions that can be seen with this field.

987
01:33:54,674 --> 01:33:57,175
But it has to be done so safely.

988
01:33:57,555 --> 01:33:58,295
This was done in 2014.

989
01:34:00,436 --> 01:34:02,038
in terms of what you're looking to accomplish.

990
01:34:02,579 --> 01:34:04,361
Behind us we have the Heckner Center.

991
01:34:04,381 --> 01:34:10,510
It's just one of those locations that's been used as a non-profit for a very long time.

992
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:12,552
Non-profits have consolidated.

993
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:14,575
Those resources are available.

994
01:34:15,031 --> 01:34:34,865
It's up to us in the community to bring that back in order to have that return on the investment for our North Memphis neighborhood, as well as for our kids, as well as many of our civic organization groups, in order for us to pop in together in order to basically not only enjoy the winter and the fall, but the spring and the summer months here at Gillis Park.

995
01:34:35,726 --> 01:34:39,048
But in order to do those things, we have to look at our baseball field.

996
01:34:39,448 --> 01:34:46,410
This is a baseball field where the community has spent numerous amounts of money basically preserving and maintaining for capital improvements.

997
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:57,553
What we're looking to do is basically put a little shine on this park with these capital improvements so that we have our fencing, as you can see, that's been deteriorating.

998
01:34:57,593 --> 01:35:03,614
We have bars up there that aren't welded in that you potentially have the chance of falling.

999
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:05,415
We've had them fall before.

1000
01:35:06,035 --> 01:35:09,178
We've tried working to get them welded and put together.

1001
01:35:09,738 --> 01:35:11,159
Obviously, it's a cost factor.

1002
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:16,824
These are some of the capital improvements that can be done in order to basically accommodate it.

1003
01:35:17,385 --> 01:35:22,189
I mean, we've been upgrading strides in terms of basically putting the batten cages in the back.

1004
01:35:22,669 --> 01:35:27,053
We've landscaped this and we've upgraded this whole field and spent

1005
01:35:27,693 --> 01:35:35,317
close to $40,000, $50,000 in the past four years, basically upgrading this so the kids can have the opportunity access.

1006
01:35:35,677 --> 01:35:40,759
And again, we have communities from outside our city coming in here.

1007
01:35:40,799 --> 01:35:43,060
We have lots of people that gather.

1008
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,641
They can patronize our businesses.

1009
01:35:45,117 --> 01:35:46,158
which basically generates revenue.

1010
01:35:46,178 --> 01:35:50,440
So there's a return on this investment and that's what we're looking to accomplish here.

1011
01:35:50,460 --> 01:36:02,106
I mean reinvesting our own money, recycling our own money by having resources and tools not only for the kids but for some other programs that could be available in the city.

1012
01:36:02,146 --> 01:36:12,832
So when we look at some of the things that we're looking to do, we have our upfield wall here that had a hockey rink put in during the winter and a result of some of those

1013
01:36:14,473 --> 01:36:17,415
flooding and other things with that hockey rink.

1014
01:36:17,455 --> 01:36:19,317
It impacted our wall out there.

1015
01:36:19,717 --> 01:36:22,319
So our parents are concerned about the safety of their kids.

1016
01:36:22,839 --> 01:36:26,302
Some of the other coaches from the other teams have brought that up too as well.

1017
01:36:26,802 --> 01:36:30,986
So we have a quote in order to have that basically refurbished and painted.

1018
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:39,732
We also have a quote in order to basically paint our backs off and have all these fences restored and welded so that they're done safely.

1019
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:42,895
So there isn't an opportunity to impact our kids.

1020
01:36:43,315 --> 01:36:57,365
So again, hopefully with your support we can partner together short term to make these fixes and then long term to basically put a vision together in order to build up this whole area for the many groups that we have here on Neptune.

1021
01:36:57,385 --> 01:36:59,206
I think it will be a positive experience for everybody.

1022
01:36:59,643 --> 01:37:06,045
I will set a culture of respect for rules, opponents, officials, teammates, and self roots.

1023
01:37:06,845 --> 01:37:08,425
I will look for teachable moments.

1024
01:37:09,066 --> 01:37:24,730
I will keep my players emotionally, emotional tanks built, look for opportunities to give truthful, specific encouragement, expressing appreciation, listening, exhibiting positive body language.

1025
01:37:26,351 --> 01:37:29,132
Coach University and the Positive Coaching Alliance.

1026
01:37:29,652 --> 01:37:39,896
We work with them pretty closely in terms of training the coaches, but just basically working with kids and just making sure they have access and opportunities to positive reinforcements.

1027
01:37:40,276 --> 01:37:46,818
So that's one of the opportunities that we're trying to provide as a community for the kids in the Memphis Little League program.

1028
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,960
What I'd like to do is just provide this opportunity for Mayor Burke to come up and just have to say a couple of words.

1029
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,621
We're kind of in turn with the

1030
01:37:53,961 --> 01:37:56,647
So I'll just give her an opportunity to say hello.

1031
01:38:04,383 --> 01:38:04,863
Thank you, Bill.

1032
01:38:05,563 --> 01:38:07,484
Thank you everyone for being here today.

1033
01:38:07,544 --> 01:38:11,045
It's a great fight out there to see this rainbow of colors in our field.

1034
01:38:11,585 --> 01:38:13,865
And as Tyler said, always do your best.

1035
01:38:13,905 --> 01:38:14,825
That's all that matters.

1036
01:38:14,985 --> 01:38:18,726
Always just do the best you can and be a great teammate because it's so important.

1037
01:38:18,746 --> 01:38:22,687
You learn these lessons now and they carry through your entire life.

1038
01:38:22,707 --> 01:38:31,589
So to all the parents that are helping out and the parents that are at home throwing balls and take balls and everything else, thank you so much for being a part of this great community.

1039
01:38:31,809 --> 01:38:32,430
Have fun.

1040
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:33,250
Play ball.

1041
01:38:37,053 --> 01:38:40,816
So what we're going to do now is we're going to ask the kids to come up with their gloves.

1042
01:38:40,856 --> 01:38:48,824
We're going to ask, we have City Council, Michael Marks, City Council, John Falco, and we have Mia McStone, who's also a coach.

1043
01:38:48,884 --> 01:38:52,967
Congratulations, Mia, for stepping up, joining better coach Michael Marks.

1044
01:38:53,007 --> 01:38:54,189
She just found that out, I know.

1045
01:38:54,209 --> 01:38:55,910
So it's been a great opportunity.

1046
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:59,874
Here we are, welcome to Love Fields, which is still at Gillis Park.

1047
01:39:00,432 --> 01:39:07,915
I mean, we have the opportunity, as you can see, the lights that were put in, those were put in by community volunteers in order for us to have a night game.

1048
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:10,477
As you can see, they're working real well.

1049
01:39:11,897 --> 01:39:17,520
It's just a good tribute to Little League when you can play games at night.

1050
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:24,803
There's nothing better than playing a game at night, whether it's youth baseball or adult baseball.

1051
01:39:24,823 --> 01:39:29,045
I mean, some of the things that we brought up before is some of these benches here,

1052
01:39:29,598 --> 01:39:39,021
As you can see, for safety concerns, I mean, there's different standards that you need in order to basically have sitting apparatus at fields.

1053
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:45,783
And obviously, a capital improvement need is obviously required in this opportunity.

1054
01:39:46,243 --> 01:39:52,985
I mean, as we pan along here, too, we're just basically taking a look at the fence here that we're looking to basically get fixed.

1055
01:39:53,705 --> 01:39:58,247
As you can see, some of the damage that was done and some of the damage that you continue to see

1056
01:39:59,011 --> 01:40:01,813
even just wear and tear with the weather and stuff like that.

1057
01:40:03,433 --> 01:40:06,615
We had the opportunity to put a new school board up last year.

1058
01:40:07,756 --> 01:40:12,098
We have the sponsorships of Memphis Little League as well as Ronnie's Place.

1059
01:40:13,018 --> 01:40:19,742
So it's a great opportunity for the kids to basically see the schools and even work down there at the concession stand.

1060
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:37,495
you basically upgrade and update that stuff so uh it's a good feeling when you have a night game under the lights and you see the schools and stuff like that in the back we were able to add two batting cages which came out real nice uh they've been over there for a couple of years right now and you have basically a bunch of the uh

1061
01:40:38,259 --> 01:40:45,363
the senior pay-per-view kids coming over and high school kids during the summer partaking and utilizing them.

1062
01:40:45,383 --> 01:40:47,285
It's a good shade, a good opportunity.

1063
01:40:47,805 --> 01:40:52,828
As we further go along, we're just looking to basically address some of the issues here in terms of access.

1064
01:40:53,268 --> 01:40:56,971
I mean, the access point that's over there, it's just not ADA accessible.

1065
01:40:57,411 --> 01:41:02,414
So our goal in this debate is to find a grant through the Community Preservation Act.

1066
01:41:02,794 --> 01:41:16,866
in order to basically look to have this as the gateway to the park and do something in order to basically make it accessible for all kids, for all parents, and basically for all seniors that come to watch the game.

1067
01:41:17,367 --> 01:41:24,213
As you'll find on some nights, they won't come into the park because of the ledge at the mouth of the park.

1068
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:27,155
It's just not accessible.

1069
01:41:30,262 --> 01:41:32,962
So just to give you an idea, I can talk to you about the EDA thing.

1070
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:37,283
I mean, we had a player that got injured and broke his leg the first game of the year.

1071
01:41:37,423 --> 01:41:38,643
He was in a wheelchair.

1072
01:41:38,703 --> 01:41:40,424
He couldn't attend any of the games.

1073
01:41:40,444 --> 01:41:42,504
We had to watch him basically from the sidewalk.

1074
01:41:42,604 --> 01:41:54,326
So with the help that was provided, we're looking at an accessibility study done in order to basically determine how to best approach making the park accessible.

1075
01:41:55,326 --> 01:41:59,947
I mean, everything that's done here, there was an issue in terms of ownership of the park.

1076
01:42:00,502 --> 01:42:03,926
which basically goes to whether it's maintenance or restoration.

1077
01:42:05,488 --> 01:42:11,716
There was some Indian folklore that said that the park was left to Little League, so it's Little League's responsibility.

1078
01:42:12,177 --> 01:42:14,159
We had to get the city solicitor involved.

1079
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:15,441
I'm actually an attorney.

1080
01:42:15,461 --> 01:42:16,843
We had to get the registry of deeds.

1081
01:42:17,478 --> 01:42:23,041
prove that Little League does not own the field, that it's the city's responsibility.

1082
01:42:23,141 --> 01:42:36,029
I believe being a new board yourself, you found that out too as well, where Gillis Park wasn't even listed as one of the parks that was presented to this commission in terms of an open space item.

1083
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:42,453
So it's just one of those things that an urban legend took a life of its own with regards to this.

1084
01:42:42,933 --> 01:42:45,475
So no city's money has ever been put into this park.

1085
01:42:46,508 --> 01:42:54,013
It's all been done by donating donations and volunteers There's a need to restore this area in order to bring it up.

1086
01:42:54,053 --> 01:43:06,241
So basically, I mean a standard that's being Consistent with other communities when these kids as well as us as coaches travels other cities and towns There's a certain minimum standard that's that being met.

1087
01:43:06,941 --> 01:43:08,442
We're not meeting that standard

1088
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:17,497
We actually, in 2016, we hosted the sectional championship where Medford ironically ended up being in the finals.

1089
01:43:18,117 --> 01:43:21,700
They challenged the field because it was not ADA accessible.

1090
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,583
That 2016 team had to go play in Melrose and they lost.

1091
01:43:27,604 --> 01:43:32,327
I mean, we had the opportunity and Craig Moody and a few of the other people's kids were on the team this year.

1092
01:43:32,825 --> 01:43:37,086
We ended up making it to the final four and we played out in Millbury, Mass.

1093
01:43:37,246 --> 01:43:40,267
This has only happened four times in the history of Memphis baseball.

1094
01:43:40,607 --> 01:43:43,388
And this is Little League, this is what kids dream about.

1095
01:43:43,408 --> 01:43:47,128
Having the opportunity to have that chance to play on TV.

1096
01:43:47,609 --> 01:43:52,530
We were one game away from playing on ESPN on Sunday night against New Hampshire.

1097
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:57,371
Unfortunately, there's a Little League inning in everybody's life and Memphis had that Little League inning.

1098
01:43:57,985 --> 01:44:09,410
But we're looking to basically bring those opportunities back here to Medford, and in order to do those, we need funding in order to basically enhance and restore some of these areas.

1099
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:19,435
As the board knows, I put in four applications to basically restore these parks, and all of them basically fall on the guidelines of safety and accessibility.

1100
01:44:19,966 --> 01:44:22,488
I mean, only one of them was signed off, which was Gillis Park.

1101
01:44:22,928 --> 01:44:31,995
I have no idea why the other ones weren't signed off, but there's some significant issues with safety out of these ball fields that need to be addressed.

1102
01:44:32,175 --> 01:44:32,996
Kids are getting hurt.

1103
01:44:33,787 --> 01:44:40,851
And it's one of those things where it's like, I can show you the policy that I pull for Little League.

1104
01:44:40,951 --> 01:44:49,936
I indemnify the city, I indemnify basically Tufts University and the Method Public Schools because we also play down a drain field too as well.

1105
01:44:50,556 --> 01:44:55,159
It's just one of those things where there is no maintenance budget, you know what I mean?

1106
01:44:55,239 --> 01:44:57,200
So this is left to us.

1107
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:00,482
When we go up to the civic organizations in order to ask them for money,

1108
01:45:00,955 --> 01:45:06,398
I mean, they'll give certain things, but they're not going to give towards, you know what I mean, fences.

1109
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:09,299
They're not going to give towards walls.

1110
01:45:09,399 --> 01:45:15,462
Like I said, I've met with the vocational school in order to see if we can leverage them.

1111
01:45:15,702 --> 01:45:18,383
We've had Dave Will and a few other of his contractors come in.

1112
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:26,162
and they've actually restored some of the things that needed to get done, you know what I mean, that wouldn't impact a lot of the kids' day-to-day operations.

1113
01:45:26,582 --> 01:45:30,624
But some of the things that we're looking to do here, I think, is a win-win for everybody.

1114
01:45:30,664 --> 01:45:32,004
We partnered with Sheryl Williams.

1115
01:45:32,724 --> 01:45:34,305
They're looking to donate all the paint.

1116
01:45:34,785 --> 01:45:39,547
Ironically, I had the Little League team recognized at Fenway Park on August 28th.

1117
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:41,167
I had them have their photos.

1118
01:45:41,187 --> 01:45:44,128
Basically, they took the national anthem with the Red Sox on the field.

1119
01:45:44,628 --> 01:45:47,209
And who was basically throwing off the first pitch at the same time?

1120
01:45:47,687 --> 01:45:50,533
The CEO from Sherwin-Williams was donating the paint to us.

1121
01:45:50,813 --> 01:45:53,619
He actually thought we scheduled and coordinated this, you know what I mean?

1122
01:45:53,659 --> 01:45:56,004
Because he was making the donation on the paint.

1123
01:45:56,431 --> 01:45:59,454
And he thought we had the Method Little League kids on the field to thank him.

1124
01:45:59,794 --> 01:46:01,676
It just so happened to be the same night.

1125
01:46:01,876 --> 01:46:02,717
There was no planning.

1126
01:46:03,197 --> 01:46:08,683
I wish I could say we were planning it, but it just looked great for him in terms of his spirit.

1127
01:46:08,963 --> 01:46:10,284
He was throwing off the first pitch.

1128
01:46:10,785 --> 01:46:16,270
But in terms of the accessibility study, there's a lot of people in the community that are really looking to have this done.

1129
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:18,352
Unfortunately, what happened was,

1130
01:46:19,853 --> 01:46:27,395
Someone went and put that step in, in July, and they basically assumed that was the fix for accessibility.

1131
01:46:28,175 --> 01:46:36,597
So they kind of, you know what I mean, sent a few people off the wrong way in terms of, you know what I mean, geez, this is what the city's going to do in order to address accessibility.

1132
01:46:36,957 --> 01:46:38,697
They put a step instead of a slope.

1133
01:46:39,457 --> 01:46:42,098
So, you know what I mean, the study that we have, it's $2,800.

1134
01:46:44,219 --> 01:46:45,700
I think it's a value add.

1135
01:46:45,781 --> 01:46:56,293
Some of the things that we're looking to get done, you know what I mean, pretty much will help enhance the area and just basically provide a good experience for all parties involved.

1136
01:46:56,613 --> 01:47:00,838
Again, this is just one of the first phases in terms of this park here.

1137
01:47:01,319 --> 01:47:03,702
I think as soon as that gets addressed,

1138
01:47:04,162 --> 01:47:07,506
and the accessibility gets addressed.

1139
01:47:07,526 --> 01:47:11,931
We'll be looking at something that's ideal and just basically big picture.

1140
01:47:12,271 --> 01:47:15,214
I bring up the Heckner Center because it's one of those locations.

1141
01:47:15,234 --> 01:47:17,096
I grew up at the Heckner Center.

1142
01:47:17,116 --> 01:47:18,278
My father was the postman.

1143
01:47:18,798 --> 01:47:19,699
So I know all about it.

1144
01:47:19,739 --> 01:47:21,061
I know there's an apartment above it.

1145
01:47:22,142 --> 01:47:26,046
The gentleman from the cemetery used to live up there.

1146
01:47:26,392 --> 01:47:34,897
and he'd work at the cemetery, and his responsibility was basically paying all the utilities for that house, and that was his cost for basically living there for free.

1147
01:47:35,437 --> 01:47:36,898
So that was the offset.

1148
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:39,780
I mean, the space in there is absolutely phenomenal.

1149
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,161
I mean, I know they're talking about the arts department.

1150
01:47:42,562 --> 01:47:47,245
I mean, I'd love to see something with Bistro with a 479.

1151
01:47:47,445 --> 01:47:51,927
I'd love to see some sort of culinary arts program, basically be in there for seasonal.

1152
01:47:52,248 --> 01:47:54,689
That North Medford area is just one of those areas

1153
01:47:55,147 --> 01:47:58,551
that it just needs a little bit of a kiss.

1154
01:47:59,692 --> 01:48:10,064
So if you have something like an ice cream parlor or something where these kids can work at, and just so everybody understands in terms of how we do it for Little League, we have these concession stands.

1155
01:48:10,164 --> 01:48:13,308
We do a buddy program where we have kids that are basically special needs.

1156
01:48:13,715 --> 01:48:19,317
on the autism spectrum are disabled, we have them work in these concession stands in order for them to learn life skills.

1157
01:48:19,957 --> 01:48:22,659
We're not looking to make money, we're looking to recycle our own money.

1158
01:48:22,999 --> 01:48:29,641
And by giving these kids the opportunity to do those things, that's basically the return on investment that we get as a group, you know what I mean?

1159
01:48:29,661 --> 01:48:32,823
So that's why we basically maintain these concession stands.

1160
01:48:33,143 --> 01:48:36,364
A lot of people question the value that we bring to them.

1161
01:48:36,384 --> 01:48:38,285
We're not looking to make money.

1162
01:48:38,305 --> 01:48:41,566
We're not in the business of making money, we're in the business of making memories.

1163
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:43,961
I mean, that's kind of how, you know what I mean?

1164
01:48:44,301 --> 01:48:46,923
I've always presented Little League as, you know what I mean?

1165
01:48:46,963 --> 01:48:50,125
There was some things that you guys don't want to know about that happened.

1166
01:48:50,265 --> 01:48:53,947
There was indictments and people stealing money, and it was a goddamn shame.

1167
01:48:54,387 --> 01:48:58,549
But the people that knew about it and did nothing, those are the people that I worry about the most.

1168
01:48:58,569 --> 01:48:59,510
You know what I mean?

1169
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:00,511
Because it went on for years.

1170
01:49:00,571 --> 01:49:04,653
We lost a quarter of a million dollars because people willfully turned their eyes.

1171
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:10,268
away from basically these people stealing all this money, and this is what we get left with.

1172
01:49:10,489 --> 01:49:13,613
Can I ask if there are any questions from the committee members?

1173
01:49:15,377 --> 01:49:15,857
I have a couple.

1174
01:49:16,398 --> 01:49:21,281
I was looking at the application and I have some questions just in terms of what I see.

1175
01:49:21,441 --> 01:49:21,781
Sure.

1176
01:49:21,921 --> 01:49:28,666
So on the page where you've got the three areas, A, B, and C, the different scopes of work.

1177
01:49:28,826 --> 01:49:29,106
Yes.

1178
01:49:29,226 --> 01:49:37,931
There's a section that talks about the accessibility study for the 3,500, but then if I go down, I see a quote from KMA for 2,800.

1179
01:49:38,052 --> 01:49:38,272
Yes.

1180
01:49:40,554 --> 01:49:41,557
So it's $2,800 worth of quote.

1181
01:49:41,597 --> 01:49:43,945
I had $3,500 in there as a placeholder until I got the quote.

1182
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:50,370
So we received the quote, and the quote came in at $2,800.

1183
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:54,151
And what is the Institute for Human-Centered Design?

1184
01:49:55,071 --> 01:49:59,732
That's the second quote that Mike Nestor got from a firm that does similar work.

1185
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:00,412
OK.

1186
01:50:00,592 --> 01:50:02,753
Yeah, they're a good job.

1187
01:50:02,953 --> 01:50:04,293
They're not in here anyway.

1188
01:50:04,333 --> 01:50:05,113
That's why I'm asking.

1189
01:50:05,413 --> 01:50:06,513
That dollar amount is not anywhere.

1190
01:50:06,533 --> 01:50:08,134
This was all added.

1191
01:50:08,414 --> 01:50:09,114
OK.

1192
01:50:09,294 --> 01:50:12,794
When Mike Nestor was trying to scope it out a bit.

1193
01:50:13,115 --> 01:50:15,055
So just in terms of the three.

1194
01:50:16,458 --> 01:50:17,359
things that you want to do.

1195
01:50:17,399 --> 01:50:26,465
So as a committee, the thing that we need to do is make sure that we, as we spend the money, it's to, it keeps to the CPA law.

1196
01:50:27,526 --> 01:50:31,509
And so the CPA law says that we can't spend CPA money on maintenance.

1197
01:50:32,546 --> 01:50:34,848
So I'm looking at these three.

1198
01:50:35,048 --> 01:50:37,871
Obviously the accessibility study is not maintenance.

1199
01:50:38,552 --> 01:50:41,875
So can you talk a little bit about A and B and tell me?

1200
01:50:41,895 --> 01:50:45,619
Yeah, we're restoring basically the original features of the box.

1201
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:48,762
So are you completely, like let's just talk about the window.

1202
01:50:49,182 --> 01:50:52,105
Are you completely replacing that or are you fixing it?

1203
01:50:52,625 --> 01:50:53,446
Completely replacement.

1204
01:50:53,726 --> 01:51:05,456
Okay, and so the part a this looks like you're not really I can't tell if you're replacing if you're just I mean you talked a lot about beautification Yeah, that kind of a thing so that to me sounds like maintenance.

1205
01:51:05,696 --> 01:51:08,698
Can you talk a little bit about why this is in maintenance?

1206
01:51:09,539 --> 01:51:14,743
versus capital Because it's not being maintained

1207
01:51:16,265 --> 01:51:22,712
Right, so we're looking to restore it to its original condition and then have them maintain it.

1208
01:51:23,432 --> 01:51:31,922
So again, like I spoke to, this park hasn't been touched in over 30, 40 years because the city said they didn't own it.

1209
01:51:32,621 --> 01:51:37,425
So it just has been dilapidated to the point where, I mean, no one's taking ownership of it.

1210
01:51:37,445 --> 01:51:39,768
It's similar to what we have with the Hegnesson.

1211
01:51:40,028 --> 01:51:48,996
I mean, it's just dilapidating because the city said they didn't own it and they had it up for sale for $739,000 because they didn't own it.

1212
01:51:49,697 --> 01:51:53,400
And then we had to show them the title and the deed to show that they did own it.

1213
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:57,629
And then they had to remove it basically from being sold.

1214
01:51:58,330 --> 01:52:01,411
It's similar to the patio where nothing's been maintained.

1215
01:52:01,731 --> 01:52:08,933
So our goal is to restore it back to its original features and then basically have the city maintain it.

1216
01:52:10,874 --> 01:52:11,754
Have they made a commitment?

1217
01:52:12,695 --> 01:52:13,055
The city?

1218
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:23,602
Well, you said, Bill, you said that the city, you got clarity for the first time in decades about the ownership of the property.

1219
01:52:24,922 --> 01:52:26,243
No, I don't need that.

1220
01:52:26,263 --> 01:52:27,723
I completely understand.

1221
01:52:28,483 --> 01:52:34,564
And I played Little League in Medford in my youth, believe me, and this is of my life experience in West Bedford Hillside.

1222
01:52:35,285 --> 01:52:39,085
So I know this field, we mostly played.

1223
01:52:39,346 --> 01:52:40,686
He reminds me of that every Thanksgiving.

1224
01:52:46,588 --> 01:52:57,293
But I think part of the open space plan that Clodagh mentioned earlier, you guys obviously need to get in that game long term.

1225
01:52:57,897 --> 01:53:02,638
and get a commitment to do what needs to be done here.

1226
01:53:02,658 --> 01:53:07,759
If you haven't had any maintenance for the city in three decades, that's ridiculous, obviously.

1227
01:53:08,379 --> 01:53:14,981
And they need to step up and make this a priority because they've left you behind for two generations.

1228
01:53:15,481 --> 01:53:17,622
And again, sorry, I didn't want to interrupt you.

1229
01:53:17,702 --> 01:53:18,142
No, it's okay.

1230
01:53:18,422 --> 01:53:24,103
Because similar to them presenting Harris Park, presenting Harris Park is a softball field.

1231
01:53:24,143 --> 01:53:25,864
Do you know how many girls play softball?

1232
01:53:26,584 --> 01:53:26,924
Less than 200.

1233
01:53:28,219 --> 01:53:34,791
They've already refurbished three of their fields, okay, and spent a significant amount of money on those fields.

1234
01:53:35,672 --> 01:53:38,798
And we haven't had one dime spent.

1235
01:53:39,372 --> 01:53:43,454
on any of the baseball fields, and now they're looking to take some of our baseball fields away.

1236
01:53:43,834 --> 01:53:54,060
We gave up Victory Park, which was fine, to Sarka, because at Sarka's numbers, they were significantly higher at the time, and that was years ago, which it was basically a high school field.

1237
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:54,860
Sorry, go ahead.

1238
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,862
I wanna make sure that we stick to the questions about this.

1239
01:53:57,902 --> 01:54:02,564
But again, it goes to his point in terms of, I'm a volunteer.

1240
01:54:02,724 --> 01:54:04,005
We're all volunteers here.

1241
01:54:04,505 --> 01:54:07,427
Us to hold the city accountable for doing things

1242
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:08,620
You know what I mean?

1243
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:09,881
That's a feat in its own.

1244
01:54:10,261 --> 01:54:12,761
Like, I have a full-time job and four kids.

1245
01:54:12,781 --> 01:54:13,802
You know what I mean?

1246
01:54:13,822 --> 01:54:24,685
So for me to basically hold someone's foot to the fire, I can show you 50, 60 emails that go back 10 years that talk about everything that you wanna know about these parks.

1247
01:54:25,805 --> 01:54:26,885
Nothing's getting done.

1248
01:54:28,065 --> 01:54:28,986
You know what I mean?

1249
01:54:29,126 --> 01:54:30,946
It's a community credibility issue.

1250
01:54:31,346 --> 01:54:37,208
And I can't blame it all on the DPW, because they don't have the numbers to maintain this, okay?

1251
01:54:37,477 --> 01:54:39,818
We're in a whole new stage here in Memphis.

1252
01:54:40,118 --> 01:54:43,620
We're at the pioneering stages in terms of what we're going to look like.

1253
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:44,740
You know what I mean?

1254
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:48,942
So how we present ourselves is similar to basically everybody coming to this park.

1255
01:54:49,408 --> 01:54:59,735
We had four different cities come to this park and question the significance of it, both from a safety standpoint and just a basic upgrade.

1256
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:11,142
So that actually leads to a question that I had, which is that clearly the park appears to be in need of an upgrade and the improvements that are on the scope for this

1257
01:55:11,883 --> 01:55:13,585
ask from the CPA.

1258
01:55:14,927 --> 01:55:24,101
My question is whether those improvements are things that are going to be made obsolete if a couple of years from now the park gets a bigger overhaul.

1259
01:55:25,771 --> 01:55:27,973
I can't answer that question.

1260
01:55:28,074 --> 01:55:31,437
It's the same thing with the Brooks Estates.

1261
01:55:31,977 --> 01:55:44,690
Well the question is in this park if you are making improvements to the wall or the fencing are those things going to then a couple years from now be replaced again?

1262
01:55:46,562 --> 01:55:58,504
Or are we, are you asking for improvements that, you know, say you need to make other, what we anticipate might need to be changed in the park in the next few years.

1263
01:55:58,524 --> 01:56:01,465
Are those changes?

1264
01:56:01,665 --> 01:56:01,885
Right.

1265
01:56:02,625 --> 01:56:11,427
Are the changes that, right, but there's more than these couple of projects that you've asked for this year that need to be done in order to meet the standards, I imagine.

1266
01:56:12,313 --> 01:56:15,135
Only one is before you right now because the other ones didn't get approved.

1267
01:56:16,216 --> 01:56:16,876
Of this park?

1268
01:56:17,377 --> 01:56:19,618
Of this park.

1269
01:56:19,638 --> 01:56:31,827
So the question is whether the things that are on the scope right now are going to be overwritten if there are further changes to the park.

1270
01:56:32,007 --> 01:56:33,208
Why would there be changes to the park?

1271
01:56:34,894 --> 01:56:55,235
If, for example, the ADA accessibility study highlights the need for grading or other changes near the entrance of the park in order to make a more accessible entrance, if there are other elements of the park that need improvements.

1272
01:56:55,335 --> 01:56:58,158
On that side of the wall, with ADA,

1273
01:56:59,655 --> 01:57:04,138
that's not gonna impact the playing field or the fences.

1274
01:57:04,438 --> 01:57:09,000
Okay, that's what I just want assurance that the things that you're asking for.

1275
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:11,782
That would be, that would be, because there's ample space here.

1276
01:57:12,162 --> 01:57:19,326
That's the other thing I can, in terms of like the garden club, like the floor plan that I provided, I mean, it was the first time people saw it.

1277
01:57:19,386 --> 01:57:21,147
I mean, because it was at the Registry of Deeds.

1278
01:57:21,628 --> 01:57:26,530
Like when you look at this, this is the line here in terms of the property line.

1279
01:57:27,191 --> 01:57:29,412
The fence is back in here.

1280
01:57:30,223 --> 01:57:32,620
Okay, and we've maintained all these shrubberies here.

1281
01:57:33,344 --> 01:57:43,266
So, if you're looking in terms of big picture, this Heckner Center here, I mean, this whole area, I mean, can get redesigned and redeveloped.

1282
01:57:43,506 --> 01:57:51,348
How we used to do it, with the people that were disabled, we had them park in the parking lot up here, and have them basically walk down through the gate.

1283
01:57:52,088 --> 01:58:02,090
And then, mysteriously, one day, a lock showed up on it during the playoff game, and it was just bolted shut, and the parking lot was bolted shut, and they said, oh, the owners of the property did that.

1284
01:58:02,995 --> 01:58:03,535
You know what I mean?

1285
01:58:03,615 --> 01:58:06,978
We had to research it to find out that the owners of the property were the city of Medford.

1286
01:58:06,998 --> 01:58:08,639
You know what I mean?

1287
01:58:08,679 --> 01:58:21,629
So, like, I'll play the cat and mouse game all day, but at the end of the day, you know what I mean, the room that's available in order to basically make this ADA accessible is going to go into the design and scope of what needs to get done.

1288
01:58:22,049 --> 01:58:24,011
The problem is just thinking out of the box.

1289
01:58:24,391 --> 01:58:29,655
Everybody wants to think, well, this is the entrance, so we have to have this as the entrance.

1290
01:58:30,096 --> 01:58:30,556
No, you don't.

1291
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:33,152
You walk down the field and say, you know something?

1292
01:58:33,512 --> 01:58:38,296
This is a better entrance down here, and then grade it in order to make it ADA accessible.

1293
01:58:38,356 --> 01:58:45,281
I mean, we had the same issue when we had the Field of Dreams, where they didn't want to basically put in an access ramp.

1294
01:58:45,301 --> 01:58:47,723
People had to think outside the box in order to do that.

1295
01:58:48,423 --> 01:58:49,204
And it was successful.

1296
01:58:49,264 --> 01:58:53,067
And these people that are basically the ones that are looking to get hired, they do this nationally.

1297
01:58:53,087 --> 01:58:57,931
I mean, I'm a project manager for Bank of America, so I mean, I deal with this all the time.

1298
01:58:58,031 --> 01:58:59,452
I'm also an ADA attorney.

1299
01:59:00,014 --> 01:59:11,665
I'm not concerned in terms of what's going to happen when they go in and design it because it's going to be done tastefully and aesthetically pleasing so that it basically balances off both the pock as well as the experience.

1300
01:59:11,966 --> 01:59:14,568
And that's what we're looking for in terms of a big picture.

1301
01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:16,030
Thank you.

1302
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:18,392
Any other questions from committee members?

1303
01:59:21,551 --> 01:59:25,219
Well, thank you for all your volunteer work of everybody who came tonight.

1304
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:28,666
It's obviously a labor of love, and it benefits a lot of kids.

1305
01:59:28,746 --> 01:59:31,251
Listen, if you're a volunteer in Medford, you have to enjoy being punished.

1306
01:59:33,535 --> 01:59:42,719
Well, we're not trying to punch you here, but we do have to try to follow the state rules, too, to make sure that we're spending the money appropriately.

1307
01:59:42,739 --> 01:59:43,880
I understand completely.

1308
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:46,021
So, I did have one question.

1309
01:59:46,041 --> 01:59:55,525
When you mentioned about the improvements to the wall, and you said that it got turned into like an ice rink at one point, and that did damage to the wall.

1310
01:59:55,625 --> 01:59:57,806
So, does that happen every winter?

1311
01:59:58,006 --> 01:59:59,307
It'll never happen again.

1312
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:02,058
The damage of the rink.

1313
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:10,683
It was an illegal rink that the park board never authorized to be there.

1314
02:00:11,863 --> 02:00:15,745
Am I correct on stating that?

1315
02:00:16,046 --> 02:00:16,786
That was my question.

1316
02:00:17,386 --> 02:00:27,532
Unfortunately, the volunteers went down and did humans work in terms of restoring it and putting it back so that it wasn't a safety issue.

1317
02:00:28,631 --> 02:00:33,853
Our goal here is to restore it to its natural beauty.

1318
02:00:33,933 --> 02:00:43,556
The money we've spent on this, just to give you an idea, we basically had to do all the drainage over and we had to basically skim the field.

1319
02:00:43,896 --> 02:00:45,716
That cost us $25,000 and then we had to take out

1320
02:00:48,478 --> 02:00:54,924
all the shrubs that were around the park because they were just overgrown and no one was maintaining them.

1321
02:00:54,944 --> 02:00:58,127
When we did that, we put a batting cage in the back.

1322
02:00:58,668 --> 02:01:01,490
That batting cage gets utilized constantly.

1323
02:01:02,511 --> 02:01:07,476
I mean, it's just one of those things where it's like, where's the return on the investment?

1324
02:01:07,716 --> 02:01:14,382
We just had the concession stand because of how it's graded from the street and the storms in the winter.

1325
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:19,433
all the water runs down and it rotted out the concession stand floor.

1326
02:01:20,053 --> 02:01:25,394
Everybody will agree, any of these things that are down here are classified as fixtures, correct?

1327
02:01:26,515 --> 02:01:27,615
And fixtures are what?

1328
02:01:28,135 --> 02:01:29,215
Property of the city.

1329
02:01:30,356 --> 02:01:34,957
Their response is it's not our responsibility to maintain it.

1330
02:01:35,417 --> 02:01:36,697
So here's where it lies a problem.

1331
02:01:37,077 --> 02:01:40,458
We have to have volunteers come down, donate product,

1332
02:01:41,210 --> 02:02:05,729
Labor get things squared away and it's money out of our pocket in order to maintain an experience for the kids in our community And again, we have volunteers and I'm sure I'm not sure I'm assuming you guys are volunteers too But I mean, it's that that whole like all we're looking to do is restore to its original condition and then basically You mean work to have a maintenance account?

1333
02:02:06,102 --> 02:02:10,746
And again, the folks that are behind me, they're looking to do the same thing.

1334
02:02:11,286 --> 02:02:18,652
If we have to put an action plan and a memorandum of understanding together, I think that was something that was talked about in terms of getting a contract with the city.

1335
02:02:19,312 --> 02:02:20,353
I don't have a problem doing that.

1336
02:02:20,882 --> 02:02:23,463
you know, I mean, I have no problem, I've been negotiating my whole life.

1337
02:02:23,603 --> 02:02:24,783
It's free arguments for me.

1338
02:02:24,803 --> 02:02:25,543
You know what I mean?

1339
02:02:25,563 --> 02:02:26,484
That's kind of how I see it.

1340
02:02:26,784 --> 02:02:35,006
I'm not getting paid to do it, but if I have to do it, I'll do it in order to leave that legacy behind, so that there'll still be Little League Baseball here.

1341
02:02:35,026 --> 02:02:35,446
It all started in 1954.

1342
02:02:35,526 --> 02:02:36,807
Ideally it would be great to have a, kind of a,

1343
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:46,601
master plan or design for the parks and a maintenance.

1344
02:02:47,381 --> 02:02:49,342
What was that woman's name that was here earlier?

1345
02:02:49,502 --> 02:02:50,242
Clodagh.

1346
02:02:50,322 --> 02:02:51,383
Allie Fisk, you mean?

1347
02:02:51,583 --> 02:02:52,103
No, no.

1348
02:02:52,143 --> 02:02:52,743
Clodagh.

1349
02:02:52,783 --> 02:02:53,603
Oh, Clodagh, yes, sorry.

1350
02:02:53,763 --> 02:02:55,084
Yes, the woman prior.

1351
02:02:55,404 --> 02:02:58,264
When you brought that up, that's all that we look for, you know what I mean?

1352
02:02:58,304 --> 02:02:59,925
We have a lot, we have 26 parks here.

1353
02:03:00,345 --> 02:03:02,366
If we could have a seat at the table.

1354
02:03:03,106 --> 02:03:05,326
There's a lot of intelligent people here, you know what I mean?

1355
02:03:05,386 --> 02:03:09,167
It's like, everybody thinks the politicians are the ones that have the solutions.

1356
02:03:09,828 --> 02:03:10,968
And unfortunately, they don't.

1357
02:03:11,848 --> 02:03:17,629
It's the private industry that basically will provide the input and the recognition in order to get things done.

1358
02:03:17,989 --> 02:03:18,950
It's their tax dollars.

1359
02:03:19,290 --> 02:03:20,610
They should have a voice in it.

1360
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:25,331
Well, it looks like there's going to be that, you know, the new open space plan is going to begin.

1361
02:03:25,351 --> 02:03:27,491
So it would be great for you guys to be involved with that.

1362
02:03:27,551 --> 02:03:28,092
We'd love to.

1363
02:03:28,312 --> 02:03:28,772
We'd love to.

1364
02:03:29,072 --> 02:03:31,752
So actually, I just want to finally clarify.

1365
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:33,813
It's kind of what I asked before, but I just want to clarify.

1366
02:03:34,913 --> 02:03:54,422
The vision for this park, the things that you've asked for in the scope of this plan, do you see further changes being needed after this, or in what state, like how many stages of improvements do you see this park needing in order to be brought up to the standards that it needs to be?

1367
02:03:54,763 --> 02:03:56,283
I can speak candidly to that.

1368
02:03:56,423 --> 02:04:03,707
After this is done here, you mean, and then the accessibility study's done, and they make their recommendations?

1369
02:04:04,683 --> 02:04:05,804
That's probably it.

1370
02:04:06,484 --> 02:04:08,265
We already have the lights down there.

1371
02:04:08,706 --> 02:04:15,871
You mean my biggest thing is the Heckner Center and the collaboration that that can provide to the community.

1372
02:04:16,251 --> 02:04:17,552
That's a value added.

1373
02:04:17,652 --> 02:04:19,413
That's an untapped resource.

1374
02:04:20,067 --> 02:04:28,851
I know the art center is looking at it, you can have the recreation group, there's space for the garden club down at the Heckner Center in Gillis Park.

1375
02:04:29,532 --> 02:04:32,513
You can even put a bocce court down there if you want to.

1376
02:04:32,533 --> 02:04:33,354
There's enough room.

1377
02:04:33,494 --> 02:04:40,557
So it's all on what you want to do in terms of a vision and what this community wants to do as a vision for that North Method area.

1378
02:04:41,021 --> 02:04:44,102
Same thing with Car Park and Tufts Park.

1379
02:04:45,003 --> 02:04:56,487
The reason why the Community Preservation Commission was put together was to restore the integrity of the items that you guys are basically working on, which is the historical open space and recreation.

1380
02:04:56,908 --> 02:05:02,090
We don't want to outsource to third parties to have them manage in order for them to reap the benefits of it.

1381
02:05:02,410 --> 02:05:04,791
Let us recycle our own money and do it on our own.

1382
02:05:05,501 --> 02:05:18,564
These concession stands and using the vocational services that are available, those are the life skills that make quality of life in Memphis a lot better when we start to access them for not only our kids, but for the next generation.

1383
02:05:18,844 --> 02:05:26,326
And there's a plan and a template that speaks to that so that we don't have to worry about who's going to be basically the gatekeeper after we're gone.

1384
02:05:26,806 --> 02:05:30,727
We set it as a cookie cutter, and that's basically how it should work going forward.

1385
02:05:31,026 --> 02:05:35,755
And I hope that's the goal and the mission of what this board is looking to do because there's a lot of money.

1386
02:05:36,296 --> 02:05:39,322
There's a lot of money and you're not going to have a lot of applicants come in.

1387
02:05:39,762 --> 02:05:42,728
And I'd hate to see this become just like one of those patronage farms.

1388
02:05:43,081 --> 02:05:45,122
So political agendas, you know what I mean?

1389
02:05:45,162 --> 02:05:49,124
My biggest concern with a lot of this money is that, you know what I mean, it's going to be self-serving.

1390
02:05:49,144 --> 02:05:50,785
And I hope it's not going to happen that way.

1391
02:05:50,805 --> 02:05:51,586
You know what I mean?

1392
02:05:51,606 --> 02:05:55,908
I hope there's really going to be resources that are basically going to be available for this community.

1393
02:05:56,168 --> 02:05:59,670
And I don't say it to basically, you know what I mean, throw a nudge at you.

1394
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:03,192
But, you know what I mean, it's hard to have a lot of this money and spend it.

1395
02:06:03,212 --> 02:06:03,852
You know what I mean?

1396
02:06:03,872 --> 02:06:05,513
This is your first go around with it.

1397
02:06:06,334 --> 02:06:08,135
I'm sure it was hard to digest.

1398
02:06:08,175 --> 02:06:09,896
Like, wow, there's a lot of money.

1399
02:06:10,436 --> 02:06:12,177
And there's only going to be more money coming.

1400
02:06:12,896 --> 02:06:14,618
You know, I appreciate what you do.

1401
02:06:14,738 --> 02:06:15,599
I love what you do.

1402
02:06:15,639 --> 02:06:17,581
I mean, no good deed goes unpunished.

1403
02:06:18,182 --> 02:06:19,583
Thank you very much.

1404
02:06:19,743 --> 02:06:22,106
Is there any other comment that anyone wanted to make?

1405
02:06:22,346 --> 02:06:23,747
I'll just make a comment.

1406
02:06:24,608 --> 02:06:34,579
Just from a resident parent coach perspective, I mean, just comparing the other cities or communities that we, I guess, are categorized by district, Somerville, Medford,

1407
02:06:36,182 --> 02:06:58,708
East Boston Melrose Everett I'd say out of those and our team is Our group of kids year in year out competes and probably wins that that grouping, you know more often than not It's probably the the last in terms of facilities again, just a general observation I know there's a lot that goes into what Billy, you know eloquently outlined our need here, but I

1408
02:06:59,048 --> 02:07:01,510
It's probably the worst out of those six communities, I would say.

1409
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:06,754
I mean, Columbus is a different animal a little bit, but just to offer that perspective.

1410
02:07:07,395 --> 02:07:10,297
The way the community is trending and going, it shouldn't be.

1411
02:07:11,358 --> 02:07:11,718
Thank you.

1412
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:15,341
A lot of, excuse me.

1413
02:07:15,602 --> 02:07:16,762
I'm sorry.

1414
02:07:16,843 --> 02:07:18,524
Hold on for one second.

1415
02:07:18,584 --> 02:07:19,605
Can I get your name again?

1416
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:20,505
Craig Moody.

1417
02:07:20,866 --> 02:07:21,386
Craig Moody.

1418
02:07:22,367 --> 02:07:25,630
I'm sorry for saying, but a lot of the other parks and a lot of the other cities.

1419
02:07:30,592 --> 02:07:36,116
We just want to make the point that this park is used nine months out of the year for the kids.

1420
02:07:36,176 --> 02:07:37,097
It's all about the kids.

1421
02:07:54,073 --> 02:07:56,174
It's almost deplorable what condition it's in.

1422
02:07:56,474 --> 02:08:08,782
And the only reason it's in a reasonable condition is the efforts of all these coaches and other coaches that go there beforehand and clean it and rake it and fix it and prepare it so it looks reasonable.

1423
02:08:09,602 --> 02:08:12,844
But the bottom line is the infrastructures need to be replaced.

1424
02:08:13,264 --> 02:08:14,085
These are your children.

1425
02:08:14,605 --> 02:08:17,627
These are the kids that are there playing games.

1426
02:08:17,707 --> 02:08:20,569
Safety and teaching them lessons and so forth.

1427
02:08:20,969 --> 02:08:22,770
These are very important facilities.

1428
02:08:23,337 --> 02:08:28,601
that should be maintained by the city, and it's ridiculous that we have to do the work for it.

1429
02:08:28,621 --> 02:08:29,762
It doesn't make any sense.

1430
02:08:30,503 --> 02:08:33,205
This is very important, these ballparks and these kids.

1431
02:08:33,245 --> 02:08:35,787
It's a big learning experience for all the kids.

1432
02:08:35,907 --> 02:08:38,850
It's something that I think everyone should take very seriously.

1433
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:49,759
We have a lot of kids go through there, and it builds them for the future with everything they're gonna do, playing this wonderful game of baseball, and we're just asking for a reasonable facility.

1434
02:08:50,255 --> 02:08:51,095
for them to do that.

1435
02:08:51,635 --> 02:08:52,876
You want to keep them off the streets.

1436
02:08:53,516 --> 02:08:54,756
You want to keep them off the streets.

1437
02:08:55,556 --> 02:08:56,357
Let them keep playing.

1438
02:08:57,017 --> 02:09:01,278
And baseball, baseball gives character to kids growing up.

1439
02:09:02,438 --> 02:09:08,620
I've played it, I'm not saying anything about myself, but I've played it for so, so, so many years and it builds character.

1440
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:15,061
And you gotta keep them off the streets, because there's too much drugs and all that stuff going around.

1441
02:09:15,641 --> 02:09:17,302
Let them play, let them enjoy life.

1442
02:09:17,742 --> 02:09:19,722
Let them grow up healthy and strong.

1443
02:09:20,563 --> 02:09:21,803
And that's what baseball does.

1444
02:09:22,663 --> 02:09:23,423
Bill, one more thing.

1445
02:09:23,543 --> 02:09:28,584
I think, I mean, the kids kind of love Gillis anyway, which is the, I mean, they should.

1446
02:09:28,965 --> 02:09:29,725
It's a great place.

1447
02:09:29,785 --> 02:09:32,105
It's a meeting place for a lot of different people to congregate.

1448
02:09:32,625 --> 02:09:35,266
But it has so much, it has so much more potential.

1449
02:09:37,207 --> 02:09:38,347
It could be a really cool,

1450
02:09:39,287 --> 02:09:58,541
Park of the future for the city if people like looking that direction Yeah, it's a community you don't see many like it like one thing I'll say Travel play a lot of summer ball Gillis has character that most other parks don't have it does I think we just need to put the money in it, you know to make it what it should be.

1451
02:09:58,821 --> 02:10:00,162
Yeah that I remove the Yankee State

1452
02:10:03,645 --> 02:10:08,447
And to give you an idea, too, like 1947, my father played for the Memphis High Mustangs.

1453
02:10:08,728 --> 02:10:10,248
They went to the championship game.

1454
02:10:10,609 --> 02:10:14,631
They played in the Gator Bowl when high school teams were able to play in those collegiate bowls.

1455
02:10:15,392 --> 02:10:19,974
So they went down to Fort Lee, Mississippi and had a zero-zero tie.

1456
02:10:20,435 --> 02:10:21,535
But it was at Gillis Park.

1457
02:10:21,955 --> 02:10:28,039
I mean, Gillis Park has a very historical perspective for a lot of people, not only in Memphis, but outside of Memphis, too, as well.

1458
02:10:28,219 --> 02:10:31,321
So when they come here, I was gonna ask Joe Brandi to come,

1459
02:10:31,795 --> 02:10:39,180
Joe was a teacher at the high school and spent basically most of his adult life maintaining Gillis Park.

1460
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:43,723
He doesn't have the opportunity to access it because he's old.

1461
02:10:44,744 --> 02:10:55,472
We got him a plaque last year, we got it up down the field, we got a Hall of Fame wall that we're recognizing a lot of people that have made significant contributions to the community.

1462
02:10:56,203 --> 02:11:01,625
It's tough to build on if I can I'm just gonna leave you a book here Yeah, I mean these have all the bleachers and things in it.

1463
02:11:01,685 --> 02:11:03,265
I mean none of the bleachers

1464
02:11:23,370 --> 02:11:24,891
of standards or requirements.

1465
02:11:25,272 --> 02:11:30,115
Just so you have an idea of the quotes, this is what I put in on my other quotes that didn't get signed off on.

1466
02:11:30,796 --> 02:11:35,059
If there is extra money, that's what ideally we'd look to do.

1467
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:44,366
Most of the bleaches, so we caught the people, they were basically dragging them out onto the street, put them in a truck and then scrapping them over at the Everett Aluminum.

1468
02:11:44,426 --> 02:11:48,249
We don't have a lot of them left, but the ones we do have left, don't need to go.

1469
02:11:49,431 --> 02:11:50,332
All right, thank you very much.

1470
02:11:50,352 --> 02:11:52,774
I believe that concludes our agenda for this evening.

1471
02:11:52,854 --> 02:11:54,295
Is there a motion to adjourn?

1472
02:11:55,976 --> 02:11:56,537
Motion to adjourn.

1473
02:11:56,597 --> 02:11:56,857
Second.

1474
02:11:56,937 --> 02:11:57,498
All in favor?

1475
02:11:57,518 --> 02:11:57,598
Aye.

1476
02:11:57,618 --> 02:11:57,878
Thank you.
