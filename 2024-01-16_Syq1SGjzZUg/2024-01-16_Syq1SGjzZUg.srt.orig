1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:02,431
[SPEAKER_10]: You will find fortune cookies.

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:12,600
[SPEAKER_10]: They are not spiritual guideposts, but they do represent a diverse tradition and a way for us to connect as humans.

3
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:19,987
[SPEAKER_10]: So crack one open, and please take a moment or two to share what your fortune says with your table mates.

4
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:38,189
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

5
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:46,252
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

6
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:53,075
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully, and if everyone could take their seats, please.

7
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:05,360
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully, whatever it said inside of your fortune cookie, if you were fortunate enough to find one,

8
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:13,620
[SPEAKER_10]: is fortuitous for you, is predictive of long life and many blessings.

9
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:17,581
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go.

10
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:28,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Please allow me to introduce a lifelong West Medford resident and licensed minister, Stacey Moore, to offer an invocation for today's gathering.

11
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:33,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Stacey is a woman of deep faith and a community connector for the city of Medford.

12
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:33,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Stacey.

13
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:48,937
[SPEAKER_21]: Good morning.

14
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:51,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me grab this.

15
00:03:52,299 --> 00:04:00,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Today is a perfect day to honor the legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

16
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:20,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, with due respect for one's personal beliefs and traditions, I'd like to invite you all to join me in prayer as we invoke a spirit of love, a spirit of love, community, and compassion.

17
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:31,622
[SPEAKER_21]: All-encompassing spirit, we welcome your presence as we gather in reflection and celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King.

18
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:40,766
[SPEAKER_21]: We are grateful for Dr. King's love of humanity, his faith, his vision, and his relentless effort to see the mission through.

19
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:49,771
[SPEAKER_21]: While some of his dream has been realized in these changed times of today, there is still much work to be done.

20
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:57,050
[SPEAKER_21]: We ask to be united as community as we embrace Dr. King's teachings.

21
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:06,257
[SPEAKER_21]: And when we leave here today, let us leave with a commitment to ourselves and to one another to be community champions of change.

22
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:11,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Equity, equality, and justice for all.

23
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:12,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Amen.

24
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:26,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Stacey, for those words of faith in action.

25
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:31,343
[SPEAKER_10]: You've helped us to set the atmosphere for all we plan to do today.

26
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:40,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And now with official words of welcome from the West Medford Community Center, may I present Lisa M. Crossman, Executive Director,

27
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:59,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Lisa has been with our organization for a few whirlwind years and has skillfully continued to transform our neighborhood home into the vital and dynamic heart of the traditional black community while embracing significant change and increasing diversity of an evolving neighborhood.

28
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:01,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Please show us some love.

29
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:28,201
[SPEAKER_17]: everybody all right so thank you all for coming today thank you special thanks to Terry Carter who pulled together an amazing program thank you thank you

30
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:33,319
[SPEAKER_17]: We're so happy to have you all back again this year.

31
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,223
[SPEAKER_17]: For us at the West Medford Community Center, this is really our new year.

32
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:43,607
[SPEAKER_17]: This really is the starting point for us to start fresh, to set new goals.

33
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,270
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you know, with goals, it's about the journey.

34
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,091
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not about the destination.

35
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:51,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it's not about the destination.

36
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:51,973
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about our journey.

37
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:55,936
[SPEAKER_17]: So just some really quick housekeeping.

38
00:06:56,136 --> 00:07:00,340
[SPEAKER_17]: If you could turn your cell phones to vibrate or turn them off, we would appreciate that.

39
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Bathrooms are right out this way, so whenever, please go.

40
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:16,296
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'd like to start off, but if everyone could just turn to their neighbor and say, I'm happy that you are here.

41
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:19,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, wait, wait, wait, now don't lie to him now.

42
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Now let's do this again.

43
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:22,743
[SPEAKER_17]: I am happy

44
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:25,563
[SPEAKER_17]: that you are here.

45
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, wonderful.

46
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:54,046
[SPEAKER_17]: So I won't take up much time, just really quickly, I had the opportunity to get online and do some training with the King Institute, where they discuss beloved community, and it's really about how you show up, how you show up as a person, showing up with peace, kindness, and love, and that we don't match the situation with the intensity of that situation, whether it's anger, whether it's sadness, whether it's anxiety,

47
00:07:54,546 --> 00:08:01,709
[SPEAKER_17]: that we hold true to that beloved form, that we be loved and we are loved.

48
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,610
[SPEAKER_17]: We allow ourselves to be loved.

49
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:13,495
[SPEAKER_17]: And so as we go forward in this year, we are really setting the tone with character and values and holding firm to that because

50
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,097
[SPEAKER_17]: We all agree we are all humankind.

51
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:17,458
[SPEAKER_17]: We are all here today.

52
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:20,541
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't do one thing to wake ourselves up and get here today.

53
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:22,923
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we all can agree with that.

54
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:26,526
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is the starting point on which we will set off.

55
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:31,951
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have the pleasure to work with some children in Medford.

56
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,452
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an after school program.

57
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,754
[SPEAKER_17]: They are wonderful.

58
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:35,474
[SPEAKER_17]: They are great.

59
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:39,398
[SPEAKER_17]: But the one thing that I notice is that we can't communicate.

60
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,441
[SPEAKER_17]: We yell at each other, and it's not an anger.

61
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,563
[SPEAKER_17]: We just don't know how to communicate.

62
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:54,992
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, you know, being locked down with COVID and all the things that spun and turned, that these children have lost their way.

63
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:58,536
[SPEAKER_17]: And with the climate we see on social media and

64
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:05,278
[SPEAKER_17]: on our television screens, it's the same way people don't communicate and that we really need to take ownership of that.

65
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:16,722
[SPEAKER_17]: We really need to pull that back and we really need to set the tone for the children to show them how it is to communicate, how it is to listen to others, how it is to empathize with others.

66
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:20,543
[SPEAKER_17]: And so today we are kicking off that point.

67
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:22,784
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to take up any more time.

68
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,505
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a wonderful, dynamic show.

69
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:32,949
[SPEAKER_17]: These are people who have mastered their craft, and I am so excited for you to see what we have for you today.

70
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:41,654
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that, I would like to welcome Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern to come give the welcome for the city of Medford.

71
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Lisa.

72
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Terry.

73
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:59,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this celebration of Dr. King's life and legacy.

74
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:02,811
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm honored to be here today to honor his life with all of you.

75
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:14,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you to everyone who's made this wonderful event possible, the West Medford Community Center for organizing and running the event, especially Executive Director Lisa Crossman and Terry Carter, St.

76
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:24,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Raphael's Parish for hosting, the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Director Francis Wojcicki, the Haywood Family Foundation, Medford Community Media, and Wegmans.

77
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:32,224
[SPEAKER_19]: And thanks to retired Special Officer Daryl Owens from the Boston Police Department for being here and to share some words with us.

78
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:43,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Having the opportunity to talk openly about the challenges we face as a community, as well as the successes we've had crafting more meaningful relationships between one another, is a humbling experience.

79
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:48,791
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm grateful that we've been able to take this journey of equity and understanding together.

80
00:10:49,872 --> 00:11:00,897
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, there's much more work we have to do as a government to not only solidify trust with our community, but better serve people who historically have not had agency with those making the decisions.

81
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:09,747
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm thankful that we're changing that in Medford, and with the help of all of you, we've made such significant progress, but we're not done.

82
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:13,552
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking forward to a wonderful event.

83
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:13,912
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

84
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:29,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So much of what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

85
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:38,552
[SPEAKER_10]: did as a leading light for social justice and human rights was born out of his Christian upbringing and his life in the church.

86
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:45,437
[SPEAKER_10]: The church had and still has stirring gospel music as its heart and soul.

87
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:56,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Please embrace our own Stacey Clayton as she ministers in song with Dr. King's favorite traditional hymn, Precious Lord, Take My Hand.

88
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:04,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.

89
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:05,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

90
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:37,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Precious Lord, take my hand, lead me on, and help me stand.

91
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:41,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I am tired.

92
00:12:55,213 --> 00:13:04,000
[SPEAKER_04]: through the storm, through the night.

93
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:13,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Precious Lord, lead me to the light.

94
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Take my hand.

95
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:23,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Precious Lord,

96
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:47,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Precious Lord, you're the one that I built my life on.

97
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,080
[SPEAKER_04]: You're my rock.

98
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,962
[SPEAKER_04]: You're my hope.

99
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,924
[SPEAKER_04]: You're my song.

100
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:21,269
[SPEAKER_04]: You picked me up, made me strong when my way was all wrong.

101
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:30,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my hand, precious love.

102
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:39,939
home.

103
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:59,727
[SPEAKER_04]: When my way grows drear, precious Lord, linger near.

104
00:15:20,826 --> 00:15:38,051
[SPEAKER_05]: hear my cry hear my call take my hand lest I

105
00:15:42,546 --> 00:16:08,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Take my hand Precious Lord Lead me home Take my hand Precious Lord

106
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:17,138
[SPEAKER_04]: home.

107
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Stacey.

108
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:47,888
[SPEAKER_10]: As always, you make music that brings us closer together as a human family with faith and hope to hold on to.

109
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:53,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Stacey was accompanied by my dear friend, Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

110
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:59,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And you will hear from Jonathan a little bit more a little bit later.

111
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:13,981
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dr. King's leadership and his ability to connect with people brought tremendously talented, diverse, and passionate folks into the struggle for civil rights and social justice.

112
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:23,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Three of those talented, diverse, and passionate folks were African American women, whose names are synonymous with the movement.

113
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:46,896
[SPEAKER_10]: We are blessed today to once again have actress and theater professional Maya N. Cotter here with us today, all the way from Brooklyn, New York, to dramatize three semi-fictional letters of appreciation from Marian Wright Edelman, Maya Angelou, and Diane Nash Bevel to Dr. King.

114
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:53,328
[SPEAKER_10]: The letters will glean from authentic words, impressions, and reflections of each writer.

115
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,558
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take a minute to set the stage, and then we present to you Maya and Carter.

116
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:21,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear Martin, I know how heavy your heart is right now, how tiring it must be to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, like an atlas shouldering the sky as all the gods of Olympus recoil from the ills and maladies and troubles of mere mortals.

117
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:29,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm again on my way to defend the children as I've been called upon by my maker to do in perpetuity.

118
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Bobby Kennedy in Washington.

119
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:46,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I explained to him the sorrow and the burden and the longing that you too have for the poorest among our people, and particularly the poverty of so many of the babies.

120
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:48,352
[SPEAKER_08]: As I was set to leave,

121
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:51,772
[SPEAKER_08]: He gave me a message for you.

122
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:59,742
[SPEAKER_08]: He said something that I never expected a wealthy white politician from a Boston Brahmin family to say.

123
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:04,668
[SPEAKER_08]: He told me to tell you to bring the poor to Washington.

124
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing about the Ku Kluxers

125
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:13,895
[SPEAKER_08]: or Vietnam or the Freedom Riders or the lunch counters in Carolina and Richmond and Nashville.

126
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:20,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps his vision is clouded in ambition or ignorance or whimsy.

127
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't matter.

128
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,783
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the words I know we both have been longing to hear.

129
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:40,302
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been pretty clear in 1966 and 1967 that you had to address the socioeconomic problems of black folks if political and civil rights were going to have meaning.

130
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:53,074
[SPEAKER_08]: But you also knew that the tandem issues of hunger and poverty within our communities were killing our people as dead as church bombings and Klan nooses.

131
00:20:54,659 --> 00:21:00,210
[SPEAKER_08]: We are surely kindred spirits in this recognition and its attendant dismay.

132
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:10,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Kennedy asked me how things were going in Mississippi and I told him how horrified I was at how slow everything seemed and how little progress had been made at this point.

133
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:17,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew that the country was preoccupied with the Vietnam War and that the government's money was going there.

134
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:25,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnson was so entrenched and so people were forgetting what was going on in these poor communities across the country.

135
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:35,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I shared my frustration with Robert Kennedy, and I told him I was going to see you, and he told me to tell you to bring the poor to Washington.

136
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:47,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, by this time, see, he was running for president and for the Democratic nomination, and I knew we needed to let the nation see the poor, to see their distress, and to see their needs.

137
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So I became the willing trustee of this message to you, Dr. King.

138
00:21:55,021 --> 00:22:02,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Visiting with you, a modern-day atlas, in that modest office in Atlanta, that was the message.

139
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:13,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And I knew you'd been there, sitting by yourself, and that you were constantly at your prodigious wits' end, trying to figure out the next step to take.

140
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:23,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you, I too was depressed about what to do about the war and this poverty that engulfs us.

141
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:36,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, we're waist deep in the refunding battle over our Head Start program, a program we both know is critical to detangling the Gordian Knot of child poverty in America.

142
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:42,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I told you that Robert Kennedy said, bring the poor to Washington,

143
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,513
[SPEAKER_08]: How your face lit up.

144
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:49,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was transfixed by it.

145
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:55,079
[SPEAKER_08]: You made me think that I was an angel delivering a message.

146
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, an angel.

147
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:03,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, you chose to make war on poverty.

148
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:10,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Despite a lot of internal dissension and a lot of young bright minds that cried for different emphasis.

149
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:28,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, your last Sunday sermon, you told your mother in Memphis that you were going to preach on why America may go to hell if we don't share our richness, the blessings of our rich, our wealth, with all those who need the basic necessities of life.

150
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:32,266
[SPEAKER_08]: You said, we're going to go to hell.

151
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:45,479
[SPEAKER_08]: And you called for a poor people's campaign at a time when we had 11 million poor children in this country of so much wealth and promise.

152
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:53,361
[SPEAKER_08]: I will forever salute you and be in your debt for the courage to love us so much.

153
00:23:54,561 --> 00:24:01,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that in my life I will someday have the courage to love us this much.

154
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:07,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Yours in the struggle, Marian Wright Edelman.

155
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear Dr. King,

156
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:54,289
[SPEAKER_08]: In 1960, as a single mother and struggling actress, I accepted the position of Northern Coordinator for the New York office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

157
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:58,650
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in this capacity that I first met you, Dr. King.

158
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:12,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I only worked with the SCLC for six months, but you told me you were grateful for my contribution, particularly the contribution of several fundraising ventures.

159
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:25,463
[SPEAKER_08]: My default position in describing most of the things that have tested my humanity in this life is writing and poetry.

160
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:31,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Please allow me to describe my admiration for you thusly.

161
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:35,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Your gratitude.

162
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I was born into the village of strife.

163
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:41,418
[SPEAKER_08]: St.

164
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:49,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Louis in 1928 wasn't Stone Mountain, Georgia, but it wasn't no paradise for the Negro either.

165
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,061
[SPEAKER_08]: My folks split up.

166
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,622
[SPEAKER_08]: My grandmama raised me.

167
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:57,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a baby of my own way too early.

168
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:07,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to raise him up in the way he should go, but boy children need strong, good men in their lives.

169
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:09,467
[SPEAKER_08]: They just do.

170
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:13,802
[SPEAKER_08]: New York called and I left to dance.

171
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:17,742
[SPEAKER_08]: One desperate migration made way for another.

172
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:26,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Porgy and Bess took me to the camps of the colonizers and to the comfort of the motherland.

173
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:32,665
[SPEAKER_08]: By 1960, I was familiar with American trials and American turbulence.

174
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,486
[SPEAKER_08]: But I heard you speak at a church in Harlem.

175
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:40,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Brother Martin, you captured my heart.

176
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:44,452
[SPEAKER_08]: You captured a lot of hearts in Harlem.

177
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:53,318
[SPEAKER_08]: You were yet another black renaissance, a renaissance for black folk, a glorious black prince out of Africa.

178
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:57,942
[SPEAKER_08]: More than anything else, you compelled us to do something.

179
00:26:58,663 --> 00:27:05,568
[SPEAKER_08]: To take what we had and what we knew and who we were and just do something.

180
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:11,586
[SPEAKER_08]: With my good friend Godfrey, my something was the cabaret for freedom.

181
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:20,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew song and dance and how to entertain, and the black elite said, yes, my sister.

182
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:31,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Sidney Poitier and Ozzie Davis and Ruby Dee and Lorraine Hansberry came out to see us dance and sing and entertain.

183
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:37,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Every dime that came into the SCLC's coffers, blessed.

184
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,180
[SPEAKER_08]: You thanked me for this.

185
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,620
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you were grateful.

186
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:49,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I couldn't be Bayard Rustin at SCLC, but you compelled me to do something.

187
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:58,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I took what I had and what I knew and who I was and did something.

188
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:04,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I did my best to be useful, to show myself approved.

189
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:10,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Meeting you face to face was monumental, if not magical.

190
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:13,192
[SPEAKER_08]: You were shorter than I expected.

191
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:15,734
[SPEAKER_08]: And so young.

192
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:19,697
[SPEAKER_08]: You had an easy friendliness which was unsettling.

193
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And you were funny.

194
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:22,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Really.

195
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:24,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't stay long.

196
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Just as St.

197
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:32,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Louis ultimately became Harlem, Harlem must ultimately become the new thing and the next thing.

198
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Change remains our only constant.

199
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:42,415
[SPEAKER_08]: In late 1960, I met my own South African freedom fighter.

200
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:48,117
[SPEAKER_08]: My time to do something evolved into something else.

201
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:58,561
[SPEAKER_08]: As I left the cocoon of SCLC, I wished you all a year of unlimited success, unlimited strides.

202
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:05,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I joined with millions of black people all over the world saying, you are our leader.

203
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:09,519
[SPEAKER_08]: We couldn't want for better.

204
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:15,022
[SPEAKER_08]: America couldn't want for better.

205
00:29:16,543 --> 00:29:18,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

206
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:23,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair winds and full sails forever.

207
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:26,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Maya Angelou.

208
00:29:38,792 --> 00:30:00,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear Reverend Dr. King, in August 28th of 1963, when about 250,000 people streamed towards the Lincoln Memorial at the March on Washington and the hours before you'd given your magnificent I Have a Dream speech, I was invited to stand with five other women and be recognized on stage during an official tribute to Negro women and freedom fighters in America.

209
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:07,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, Diane Nash Bevel, alongside Rosa Parks and Daisy Bates,

210
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:12,628
[SPEAKER_08]: In the perfection of hindsight, I regret not being there.

211
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:23,215
[SPEAKER_08]: James and I decided to watch the ceremony from our motel room in Birmingham, Alabama, eating room service in bed and just trying to rest up for the next big fight.

212
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:29,760
[SPEAKER_08]: That morning in Birmingham, when people had started to assemble to get on the buses, James said to me,

213
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:38,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane, you know, with everybody having left and gone to Washington, we could get some rest if we stayed here, which just sounded great to me.

214
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:44,636
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd worked so hard recruiting people to get on the buses that we were exhausted.

215
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:50,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know that I was going to be recognized on stage, but we saw the moment on TV.

216
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,360
[SPEAKER_08]: That was such a weird feeling.

217
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like reaching towards the television and saying, oh, I can't get there.

218
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:07,976
[SPEAKER_08]: My first political awakening came in 1959 when I was a college student at Fisk University in Nashville.

219
00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:12,320
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I wanted to come to the South to see what it was really like.

220
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:15,103
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I saw was eye-opening.

221
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't get takeout at certain restaurants.

222
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't even go to the public library.

223
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:23,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know I'm preaching to a preacher here.

224
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:32,673
[SPEAKER_08]: But very often, people think of segregation before our movement as the notion that you couldn't go into restaurants and that blacks had to ride at the back of buses.

225
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,794
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was so much more than that.

226
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Even for us young college students.

227
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:40,835
[SPEAKER_08]: There were daily insults.

228
00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:45,217
[SPEAKER_08]: A white person could pass you and call you horrible things.

229
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:49,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you dared retaliate or say anything, you could be beaten.

230
00:31:49,938 --> 00:31:51,558
[SPEAKER_08]: or arrested or killed.

231
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:58,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I just felt outraged when I was trying to learn new things, broaden my horizons.

232
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:06,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I found segregation just the opposite, limiting, constricting, confining, insulting.

233
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:17,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time I obeyed a segregation rule, I felt like I was agreeing that I was too inferior to use this facility or to go through a front door.

234
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:23,391
[SPEAKER_08]: The change in me came through James Lawson's workshops on campus.

235
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:29,459
[SPEAKER_08]: He shared nonviolent movement techniques that he learned from Gandhi in India.

236
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I took what I learned and became chairperson of the Student Central Committee.

237
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:44,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And we planned the 1960 sit-ins that led to Nashville becoming the first southern city to desegregate lunch counters and public facilities.

238
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:51,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Eventually, I co-founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

239
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,262
[SPEAKER_08]: My dear friend, John Lewis, was with me then.

240
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:57,804
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought we could make a difference.

241
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:01,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. King, I know you know all of this.

242
00:33:02,258 --> 00:33:04,359
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been so gracious in your acknowledgment.

243
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:13,683
[SPEAKER_08]: In 1962, you said, I was the driving spirit in the nonviolent assault on segregation at lunch counters.

244
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:20,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Freedom Riders were attacked in Alabama on May 14th in 1961.

245
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:36,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I was one of those folks who decided that the Freedom Rides must continue, and one who organized transportation for members of the Nashville Student Central Committee to go to Alabama to finish the journey that those Freedom Riders started.

246
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:44,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to prove that you can't stop a determined nonviolent movement by inflicting violence.

247
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:49,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a lesson about the power of love.

248
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:56,171
[SPEAKER_08]: You taught me that truth, Dr. King, and I'm in debt for the lesson.

249
00:33:57,938 --> 00:34:07,951
[SPEAKER_08]: My involvement with your march on Washington began shortly after I was arrested for trying to finish the walk for justice started by white postal worker William Moore.

250
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:13,097
[SPEAKER_08]: His trek ended in Alabama when he was shot dead on April 23, 1963.

251
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:30,640
[SPEAKER_08]: James came to drive me home to Birmingham after I got out of the jail, and he asked me what I thought of the idea of a national campout on the White House lawn to solidify and insist on the movement's goals.

252
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:38,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked the idea and got started on a meeting to talk about it, inviting attendees, finding a location, and following up on the logistics.

253
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:44,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you came to that meeting, Dr. King, with some of your team when you left.

254
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:50,410
[SPEAKER_08]: The notion of planning and organizing that march moved along with you, but I didn't feel left out.

255
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to see it come to fruition.

256
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:58,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I spread the word about the march in Birmingham at churches and at the bus stops.

257
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:14,599
[SPEAKER_08]: The notion of receiving an award for my work in this movement at your monumental march on Washington was the furthest thing from my mind when James and I settled into our hotel room in late August.

258
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:22,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'd worked so hard recruiting people to get on the buses and we were just exhausted indeed.

259
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:29,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the movement has also shown me that a little rest from time to time is surely a good thing.

260
00:35:31,624 --> 00:35:36,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I pray that you will also have time to rest, Dr. King.

261
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:41,927
[SPEAKER_08]: So much of our hopes and dreams depend on what you're teaching us.

262
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:48,549
[SPEAKER_08]: We will forever be in your debt for the lessons.

263
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:56,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Yours, in service and sacrifice, Diane Nash Bevel.

264
00:36:55,277 --> 00:37:02,844
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's here engaged in a serious exercise in American oratory.

265
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:07,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm over there crying like a baby.

266
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Maya.

267
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:16,335
[SPEAKER_10]: You make your daddy and mommy proud.

268
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:29,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew when I was writing the letters that you would be perfect for the assignment.

269
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:37,579
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm so grateful that you made time to come create community and art with us today.

270
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Maya Naomi Cotter.

271
00:37:45,470 --> 00:38:03,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so now if you will indulge the poet in me to dip into my own bag, I'm going to have my piano man and the founder of the Medford Jazz Festival, Jonathan Fagan, join me for a piece that we played together a number of times.

272
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:15,693
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, we've recently released an entire CD of music that meets at the intersection of jazz and social justice under the title of The Ally Project.

273
00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:19,376
[SPEAKER_10]: That CD is available today if you're interested.

274
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:21,818
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a sample of that music.

275
00:38:22,198 --> 00:38:23,759
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Beloved Country.

276
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:36,354
do

277
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love this country, too.

278
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have to be born on these barney shores.

279
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:18,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have to be a son of the Pentacook, Quinnipiac, or Mohican.

280
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:24,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have to have a pilgrim pedigree or be a Connecticut Yankee from King Arthur's Court.

281
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:31,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I can be the Dahomian, the Pole, or the child of Caribbean suns and Amazon shades.

282
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,766
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love this country too.

283
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:39,328
[SPEAKER_10]: My green card was a welcome ticket to a new life in a new land.

284
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:42,969
[SPEAKER_10]: My passport was stamped with new hopes and new dreams.

285
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:49,312
[SPEAKER_10]: My suitcase was packed full with new aspirations and some apprehensions too.

286
00:39:59,918 --> 00:40:09,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps I didn't see the harbor sign that said, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuge of your teeming shore.

287
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:12,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.

288
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:15,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I lift my lamp beside the golden door.

289
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:24,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps I didn't see the lady in the lamp, but I did see the gleaming city on a hill that couldn't be hid, and my soul responded.

290
00:40:27,734 --> 00:40:29,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love this country, too.

291
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:33,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its rocky mountains and its rolling meadows.

292
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its gospel songs and its crazy rhythms.

293
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:42,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its asphalt highways and its born-to-run boss.

294
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

295
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:53,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I can love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

296
00:41:03,772 --> 00:41:03,892
do

297
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:31,211
[SPEAKER_10]: But can America love me, too?

298
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:35,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my curry spices, roti, and oxtails?

299
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:39,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my dearie, akjonjon, and papitas?

300
00:41:40,523 --> 00:41:42,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my hijab and henna tattoos?

301
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:47,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my Hajj, my Mecca, my Medina?

302
00:41:47,686 --> 00:41:50,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my Cinco de Mayo, my Dia de los Muertos?

303
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:55,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love my kente cloth, dreads, twists, and locks?

304
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:04,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love the skin I'm in, be it ebony, ivory, dulce de leche, or cafe au lait?

305
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:08,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she love me by name?

306
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:20,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Shekinah Glory, Muhammad Bin Saeed, Anastasia Kozov, Cleophis Dorsey, Claudia Gonzalez, or Gael Petit Frere, can she love me by name?

307
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:29,495
[SPEAKER_10]: And what if I am among those huddled masses in that wretched refuge or that homeless, tempest-tossed?

308
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:32,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Will she continue to lift her lamp?

309
00:42:35,572 --> 00:42:49,769
[SPEAKER_10]: or do war and rumors of war, IEDs, sleeper cells, and faith distortions make me a pariah to be eliminated, a scourge to be annihilated, and a plague to be exterminated.

310
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:54,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I come in peace.

311
00:42:57,023 --> 00:42:58,184
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this country, too.

312
00:42:58,985 --> 00:43:00,766
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its boundless opportunity.

313
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:03,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its generosity of spirit.

314
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the audacity of its hope.

315
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its rolling meadows and its joyful songs.

316
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:12,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its asphalt highways and its little red Corvette.

317
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:17,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

318
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

319
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:30,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I come in peace and I love America too.

320
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:36,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I come in peace and I love America too.

321
00:43:46,755 --> 00:43:47,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

322
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:49,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

323
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:52,752
[SPEAKER_10]: The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

324
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:55,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Jonathan.

325
00:43:55,273 --> 00:43:56,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

326
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:06,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jonathan will be back in a little while to play again later in our program.

327
00:44:09,406 --> 00:44:12,509
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is fun for me.

328
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:15,331
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my happy place.

329
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:30,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Reading poetry, speaking before interested audiences, introducing wonderful folks to come and minister and perform and do the things that they do.

330
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:35,669
[SPEAKER_10]: But something else that's fun for me is being at the West Medford Community Center

331
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:43,052
[SPEAKER_10]: and seeing so many who have, especially of late, come to the aid of our camp.

332
00:44:44,173 --> 00:44:51,036
[SPEAKER_10]: And these folks that we're going to talk about now are folks that truly have come to the aid of our camp.

333
00:44:51,997 --> 00:44:57,980
[SPEAKER_10]: At last year's MLK celebration back on 111 Arlington Street, a little bit smaller than today's,

334
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:06,102
[SPEAKER_10]: We began a new WMC tradition to honor community leadership in a number of important areas.

335
00:45:07,602 --> 00:45:19,445
[SPEAKER_10]: We awarded the first Drum Major Awards, picking up on Dr. King's notion of leading out and being engaged in the business of building beloved community.

336
00:45:20,405 --> 00:45:34,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Today's second annual WMCC Drum Major Awards focus on the categories of community advocacy, dedicated public service, and cultural legacy.

337
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:39,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Here to help me present those awards are Lisa Crossman,

338
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:07,637
[SPEAKER_10]: West Med Community Center Incorporated is honored to present the 2024 Drum Major Award to Joseph M. Jones.

339
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:59,997
[SPEAKER_10]: in view of your cultural and social significance to the West Medford community and to greater Medford as a builder of bridges, a peacemaker, a preserver of neighborhood history, an active volunteer, a mentor, a teacher, and an outstanding role model for young people, we gratefully present this acknowledgement.

340
00:47:00,558 --> 00:47:01,719
[SPEAKER_10]: You will always

341
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:08,647
[SPEAKER_10]: have an honored place in the annals and living archive of your beloved neighborhood home.

342
00:47:09,228 --> 00:47:16,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Presented this day, signed by Lisa M. Crossman, Executive Director, January 15, 2024, West Medford Community Center.

343
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:28,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you community, beloved community of West Medford.

344
00:47:28,998 --> 00:47:40,143
[SPEAKER_12]: West Medford is fruitful ground for people that came before us that contributed vastly

345
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:45,087
[SPEAKER_12]: to the cultural heritage of this community.

346
00:47:45,847 --> 00:47:56,956
[SPEAKER_12]: It brings to mind people like Coral Yancey, who created the emblematic song for the Hobbs Junior High School.

347
00:47:57,737 --> 00:48:03,201
[SPEAKER_12]: People like Adele Evans, who created the West Medford Girls Chorus.

348
00:48:04,242 --> 00:48:08,005
[SPEAKER_12]: People like William Thompson, saxophonist

349
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:16,172
[SPEAKER_12]: who established his career as Woodwind Professor of Music of Berkeley College.

350
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:32,908
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can go on and on with the fruitful ground of West Medford that gave us talents, cultural talents, like Terry Carter, who became our first poet laureate of the city of Medford.

351
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:54,270
[SPEAKER_12]: People like my co-celebrant, Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker, who in her 90s gave us her gifts and talents by dancing in front of us at the Memphis Senior Center, 95 years of age.

352
00:48:56,201 --> 00:49:08,248
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wish I could have more time and recall others, but West Medford is a resource for talented people.

353
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:24,038
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope that you could join me to help continue nurturing this community by doing things like join the West Medford Community Center.

354
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:47,830
[SPEAKER_12]: join in the battle for civil justice by becoming members of the Mystic Valley branch of the NAACP and join the community center and become part of our community and volunteer

355
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:57,673
[SPEAKER_12]: volunteer to help nurture our young people who need guidance in this time of disinformation and confusion.

356
00:49:59,393 --> 00:50:01,754
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is such opportunity for us.

357
00:50:02,194 --> 00:50:03,815
[SPEAKER_12]: We are on the

358
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:10,196
[SPEAKER_12]: beginnings of a new year, and we should look positively for the future.

359
00:50:11,117 --> 00:50:17,680
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank you for this honor, but we also must continue to look to the future.

360
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, everyone.

361
00:50:23,883 --> 00:50:24,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Joseph.

362
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:45,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Our second 2024 Jump Major Award goes to Francis N. Nwaje.

363
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:12,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people make an impact on an environment the minute that they step into the room, and Frances has been such a person since she's been in Medford.

364
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:25,783
[SPEAKER_10]: In view of your outstanding service to the city of Medford as a director of equity, diversity, and inclusion, your profound desire to make all the residents of the city feel welcomed and heard,

365
00:51:26,523 --> 00:51:36,866
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as your demonstrated advocacy and affinity for the historic West Medford community, we present this acknowledgment with sincere gratitude.

366
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:45,568
[SPEAKER_10]: West Medford Community Center Incorporated is proud to present the 2024 Drum Major Award to Frances N. Nwaje.

367
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:53,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

368
00:51:56,881 --> 00:52:03,143
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not one for big speeches, but what I will say to you is this is a really unique place to be.

369
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:08,926
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm one of those who believe that my work should speak through my actions.

370
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:22,652
[SPEAKER_15]: I am deeply humbled and grateful for this award, but as it has been said before, success is the outcome of always making ethical decisions while respecting others.

371
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:25,713
[SPEAKER_15]: So this award is not my award.

372
00:52:26,153 --> 00:52:28,554
[SPEAKER_15]: It is our award as a community.

373
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:34,716
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to ask you, what does diversity, equity, and inclusion mean to you?

374
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:47,381
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, caution you to remember that each response is the correct response because it is based on your own experience, your own understanding.

375
00:52:48,181 --> 00:52:55,065
[SPEAKER_15]: In order to truly effect change, we must recognize the platform that we stand on.

376
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:57,847
[SPEAKER_15]: No act is too small.

377
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:00,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Every act is a win.

378
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:10,014
[SPEAKER_15]: However, we must be willing to listen without judgment and to hear what is being said.

379
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:21,419
[SPEAKER_15]: and to know how to come to the table and join so that we can create that fabric of community that we have the ability to.

380
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:34,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Let us never have a better yesterday and always have a brighter tomorrow because Martin Luther King said he had a dream and his dream is my hope and my platform.

381
00:53:36,806 --> 00:53:37,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

382
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:38,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

383
00:53:38,146 --> 00:53:39,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

384
00:53:48,294 --> 00:53:53,497
[SPEAKER_10]: She says things beautifully, but that accent, man.

385
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:55,278
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what gets you.

386
00:53:56,118 --> 00:53:56,498
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

387
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:15,693
[SPEAKER_10]: The community center over the course of its history, and it's a long history going all the way back to the late 30s and the true establishment in 1945, has had a lot of friends.

388
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:20,375
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had our detractors, but we're not going to speak about the ill and dead.

389
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:25,464
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna speak about the loving and live.

390
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:44,669
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of our friends is a friend of mine and West Memphis Community Center Incorporated is honored to present the 2024 Drum Major Award to Richard Rick Caraviello.

391
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:12,499
[SPEAKER_10]: In view of your long-standing dedication to the city of Medford, as a member of the City Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Kiwanis Club, among other affiliations, your pride in the best traditions of public service

392
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:22,684
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as your demonstrated advocacy and affinity for the historic West Medford community, we present this acknowledgement with sincere gratitude.

393
00:55:23,044 --> 00:55:38,652
[SPEAKER_10]: West Medford Community Center Incorporated is proud to present the 2024 Drum Major Award to Richard Rick Caraviello this day, January 15, 2024, and it's signed by Executive Director Lisa M. Grossman.

394
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:40,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

395
00:55:41,094 --> 00:55:41,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Terry.

396
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:51,986
[SPEAKER_00]: So being up here speaking, I'm probably the least of the poet laureates that have come before me here.

397
00:55:52,026 --> 00:56:04,140
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to thank everybody in the room, especially to receive this award, to be in the company with Joe Jones, Dorothy Tucker,

398
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:06,102
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great company to be with.

399
00:56:06,982 --> 00:56:12,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two people, those are the icons of this community.

400
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:18,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need more people to step up to be like Joe Jones and Dorothy Tucker going forward.

401
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:25,675
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's many people in this room that have been an inspiration to me and friends and colleagues.

402
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:28,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank them for helping me move forward.

403
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:32,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank my parents for giving me a value system.

404
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,661
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to Martin Luther King's.

405
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:46,388
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife and myself, we try to teach our children the same value system so they can move forward and reflect the values of Martin Luther King.

406
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,749
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, thank you very much for today.

407
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, Terry, for the honor.

408
00:56:51,391 --> 00:56:51,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rick.

409
00:56:52,431 --> 00:56:53,192
[SPEAKER_10]: My pleasure, brother.

410
00:56:54,192 --> 00:56:54,653
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

411
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:56,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Rick.

412
00:57:08,101 --> 00:57:22,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even really, and I very often do because I write, but I write them down and that's why I can remember them, have words to express the joy I have at presenting this award.

413
00:57:24,602 --> 00:57:35,553
[SPEAKER_10]: in absentia, but nonetheless with a presence that is overwhelming and takes over the space of this convening like no other.

414
00:57:36,134 --> 00:57:46,404
[SPEAKER_10]: West Medford Community Center Incorporated is honored to present the 2024 Drum Major Award posthumously to Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker.

415
00:58:09,215 --> 00:58:09,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

416
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:26,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is Dorothy's daughter-in-law, Ketley Tucker, her daughter-in-law, Anita Tucker, and her son, Matthew Tucker.

417
00:58:33,115 --> 00:58:37,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't belabor it, although I certainly could.

418
00:58:37,156 --> 00:58:41,437
[SPEAKER_10]: I've written at least two or three poems about Dorothy Elizabeth.

419
00:58:42,037 --> 00:58:59,541
[SPEAKER_10]: But the one vision that I want you to get in your mind is at her homegoing ceremony, after we finished up at West Medford Baptist Church, we formed a New Orleans second line and marched up Harvard Ave

420
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,326
[SPEAKER_10]: down Monument, onto Fairfield, and convened in front of Dorothy Elizabeth's house.

421
00:59:08,406 --> 00:59:17,034
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is one of, in my estimation, the seminal moments in the people history of the West Medford community.

422
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:39,450
[SPEAKER_10]: So, in view of Dorothy Elizabeth's cultural and social significance to the West Medford community and to greater Medford, as a builder of bridges, a peacemaker, a preserver of neighborhood history, an artistic presence, and an outstanding role model for young people, we gratefully present this acknowledgement

423
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:57,013
[SPEAKER_10]: She will always have an honored place in the annals and living archive of her beloved neighborhood home, presented this day by Executive Director Lisa M. Crossman, January 15, 2024, the West Medford Community Center, Incorporated.

424
01:00:09,608 --> 01:00:10,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Dorothy was a wonderful woman.

425
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:13,089
[SPEAKER_20]: I really loved her.

426
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,911
[SPEAKER_20]: When people would say, well, how is she as a mother-in-law?

427
01:00:16,931 --> 01:00:19,472
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was like, I couldn't have got a better mother-in-law.

428
01:00:20,673 --> 01:00:21,693
[SPEAKER_20]: She was the best.

429
01:00:22,694 --> 01:00:31,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Not only did she help us as we went along, but she was able to provide her sons and their families

430
01:00:32,523 --> 01:00:43,789
[SPEAKER_20]: homes to live in, and in this day and age, to have that forethought back in the 60s that we would never be able to afford it otherwise.

431
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,411
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just amazing.

432
01:00:46,511 --> 01:00:48,231
[SPEAKER_20]: And she always did things like that.

433
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:52,594
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be like she might have thought of it 20 years before you even knew it was a problem.

434
01:00:53,374 --> 01:00:54,655
[SPEAKER_20]: And she had it solved.

435
01:00:55,086 --> 01:00:57,007
[SPEAKER_20]: And you would come in and say, well, what about this?

436
01:00:57,087 --> 01:01:00,909
[SPEAKER_20]: And she would, oh, yeah, this is the way it goes.

437
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:03,430
[SPEAKER_20]: She raised two wonderful sons.

438
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:07,251
[SPEAKER_20]: I married one of them.

439
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:07,852
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

440
01:01:10,073 --> 01:01:11,133
[SPEAKER_20]: And Kepley the other.

441
01:01:11,353 --> 01:01:13,054
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was really kind of nice.

442
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:18,096
[SPEAKER_20]: She really was a wonderful woman in this community.

443
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,497
[SPEAKER_20]: She helped me with open studios because I worked on that board.

444
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:26,059
[SPEAKER_20]: She opened her house every year for us, for our readers to be there.

445
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,020
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, I couldn't say enough about her.

446
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:30,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you want to say anything?

447
01:01:40,353 --> 01:01:40,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

448
01:01:40,974 --> 01:01:42,095
[SPEAKER_20]: She was an awesome woman.

449
01:01:42,275 --> 01:01:43,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, she was awesome.

450
01:01:43,696 --> 01:01:48,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Since the first day I met her, she made me feel like a daughter.

451
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,744
[SPEAKER_18]: So I never, never referred to her at my, like my mother-in-law.

452
01:01:53,804 --> 01:01:56,086
[SPEAKER_18]: She always, everybody thought she was my mother.

453
01:01:56,586 --> 01:01:57,927
[SPEAKER_18]: And then they said we look alike.

454
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,992
[SPEAKER_18]: So she always, she accepted me the first time she met me.

455
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:06,674
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, she was a wonderful woman.

456
01:02:07,215 --> 01:02:07,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

457
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:10,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

458
01:02:11,325 --> 01:02:12,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, family.

459
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:14,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

460
01:02:24,134 --> 01:02:30,638
[SPEAKER_10]: We congratulate and are extremely grateful for the life contributions of each of our drum majors.

461
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:39,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford has been truly blessed by your efforts and by your hearts for the work of building beloved community in Medford and beyond.

462
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,791
[SPEAKER_10]: And that deserves a round of applause.

463
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:56,143
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can already see, today is a family affair for WMCC.

464
01:02:56,623 --> 01:03:05,107
[SPEAKER_10]: There is talent and community spirit all around us, and we try to take advantage of it whenever possible.

465
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:08,448
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, that frequently means the Cotter household.

466
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:13,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Pastor Teresa J. Cotter is an ordained

467
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:28,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, she is a trained dancer and pastors women and girls across New England in liturgical dance ministry, discipleship, missions, and Christian evangelism.

468
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,149
[SPEAKER_10]: She has just recently returned from Cape Town, South Africa,

469
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:40,252
[SPEAKER_10]: where she was on the missions field, bringing hope, help, and the heart of God to underserved communities.

470
01:03:40,892 --> 01:03:48,556
[SPEAKER_10]: To present ministry and dance to CeCe Winans' belief for it, please welcome Pastor Teresa J. Cotter.

471
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Good afternoon, everyone.

472
01:04:01,101 --> 01:04:02,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Good afternoon, everybody.

473
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,383
[SPEAKER_07]: That's better.

474
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:09,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to see you, and it's great to be here at St.

475
01:04:09,326 --> 01:04:10,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Raphael's, my first time at St.

476
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:16,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Raphael's, but not my first time with the family of the West Metro Community Center.

477
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:27,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have to say that Sister Dorothy Tucker was an inspiration to me as a dancer at the age of 95.

478
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:33,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know that she was my soror.

479
01:04:34,514 --> 01:04:43,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So I honor Dr. Tucker Soror Dorothy on the Founders Day of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated.

480
01:04:44,816 --> 01:04:56,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm also honored, most importantly, to be here representing my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as we celebrate Dr. King's birthday.

481
01:04:57,619 --> 01:04:59,660
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a hope that he had.

482
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,581
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a hope that I pray we all still have.

483
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:11,248
[SPEAKER_07]: When he gave his speech that we all know and have heard of so often, I have a dream.

484
01:05:11,268 --> 01:05:23,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I implore you this day to remember the words of Dr. King and the words that are in the scripture that tell us to act justly,

485
01:05:24,935 --> 01:05:29,276
[SPEAKER_07]: to love mercy, and to walk humbly.

486
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:44,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we do those three things, no matter what's happening in the world, I still believe in miracles, and I still believe that the dream is coming to fruition, no matter what the circumstances look like.

487
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:45,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Amen?

488
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:46,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Be blessed.

489
01:06:51,112 --> 01:06:54,596
[SPEAKER_04]: They say this mountain can't be moved.

490
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:03,084
[SPEAKER_04]: They say these chains will never break.

491
01:07:03,224 --> 01:07:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't know you like we do.

492
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:12,434
[SPEAKER_04]: There is power in your name.

493
01:07:27,492 --> 01:07:30,520
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't seen what you can do

494
01:08:33,268 --> 01:08:33,836
[SPEAKER_05]: there is

495
01:09:25,687 --> 01:09:25,964
[SPEAKER_05]: you.

496
01:11:03,812 --> 01:11:06,616
[SPEAKER_10]: See, if they don't do what I want them to do, I get my money back.

497
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:10,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Teresa, that was lovely.

498
01:11:11,584 --> 01:11:12,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I expected no less.

499
01:11:20,183 --> 01:11:26,206
[SPEAKER_10]: My Jubilee Bishop Gideon Thompson always says it's a sorry frog that won't praise his own pond.

500
01:11:27,086 --> 01:11:33,610
[SPEAKER_10]: So heartfelt thanks to you for that wonderful presentation honoring God and Dr. Martin Luther King.

501
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:36,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm certain they are both well pleased.

502
01:11:37,887 --> 01:11:41,648
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, that has been quite an hour and a half.

503
01:11:43,189 --> 01:11:45,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Full disclosure, we're going to run a little bit long.

504
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:55,854
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're going to break now for some light refreshment and an opportunity for folks to connect a bit more with whoever is at your table.

505
01:11:56,414 --> 01:11:59,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, our volunteers will guide you in getting a snack.

506
01:11:59,456 --> 01:12:00,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to call the tables off.

507
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:06,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you are asked to return quickly to your table to eat and converse.

508
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:12,924
[SPEAKER_10]: At each table, you will find a tent card with a single question to ponder.

509
01:12:12,984 --> 01:12:16,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So look at the yellow tent card and see the question.

510
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:24,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, have a little discussion among yourself, and if you can figure out a way to do it, there's a notebook and a pen on the table.

511
01:12:25,149 --> 01:12:38,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Have somebody record some of those impressions so that later on, not today, we just don't have time, we'll be able to get those impressions back into everybody's hands so they'll know what was talked about today.

512
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:46,273
[SPEAKER_10]: And this will be a jumping-off point for more discussion as we go along during the course of this year.

513
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:53,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we'll reconvene in about 20 minutes for the remainder of today's program.

514
01:12:53,957 --> 01:13:05,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Restrooms are located in the foyer and we thank you for your attentiveness and for your participation.

515
01:15:16,493 --> 01:15:16,732
you

516
01:17:17,244 --> 01:17:17,744
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, tables 5 through 8.

517
01:17:17,784 --> 01:17:18,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Tables 5 through 8.

518
01:17:18,124 --> 01:17:18,524
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, take off, take off.

519
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:54,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, table 912.

520
01:19:46,886 --> 01:19:47,611
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, that's it for this episode.

521
01:21:35,845 --> 01:21:35,905
[SPEAKER_13]: you

522
01:33:34,978 --> 01:33:45,625
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you can, to the extent that you can, try to get in a little bit of conversation around that question that's on your tent card, on the yellow tent card.

523
01:33:46,486 --> 01:33:48,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to talk about it a little bit.

524
01:34:09,548 --> 01:34:12,889
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get everybody fed and back to their tables.

525
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:15,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

526
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:26,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody that hasn't been to the table to get a sandwich and a chips and whatever, come now, speak now, forever hold your peace.

527
01:34:30,695 --> 01:34:34,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, I got volunteers that I need to feed too, so let's go.

528
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:38,378
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

529
01:34:44,409 --> 01:34:45,814
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Brian, keep it moving.

530
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:46,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep it moving, mates.

531
01:38:49,807 --> 01:38:51,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Check, check, mic check, check.

532
01:39:07,584 --> 01:39:10,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, can you, yeah, because what I'm gonna try and do is I'm gonna try and

533
01:40:42,452 --> 01:40:42,832

[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

557
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:52,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what happened, since I got back over here.

558
01:42:56,333 --> 01:42:57,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I have game, but.

559
01:42:58,694 --> 01:42:59,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

560
01:43:01,736 --> 01:43:03,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Check mic one two, mic one two.

561
01:43:30,533 --> 01:43:38,566
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure you have enough room so it doesn't get too hot.

562
01:43:38,606 --> 01:43:42,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Pass it through, we'll do the screws in hand, get it back going.

563
01:44:11,943 --> 01:44:12,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Check, check.

564
01:44:25,575 --> 01:44:25,935
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

565
01:44:30,579 --> 01:44:32,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I still don't have a lot of gain.

566
01:44:41,007 --> 01:44:42,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Check, check, check.

567
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:45,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

568
01:44:49,417 --> 01:44:53,761
[SPEAKER_10]: You never think that it would take so long for people to grab a sandwich.

569
01:44:54,242 --> 01:44:56,424
[SPEAKER_10]: But a lot of folks in the room.

570
01:44:57,084 --> 01:44:58,405
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a beautiful thing.

571
01:44:58,946 --> 01:45:06,273
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully everybody is having a little bit of a nosh and had a chance to talk a little bit amongst yourselves.

572
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:10,457
[SPEAKER_10]: In a perfect world, what we would have done is we would have had

573
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:13,160
[SPEAKER_10]: a greater conversation.

574
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:15,923
[SPEAKER_10]: We would have had a recorder at each table.

575
01:45:15,963 --> 01:45:20,469
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a notebook, notepad, and pen to write down some of the observations.

576
01:45:20,529 --> 01:45:23,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we would even have had a report out or two.

577
01:45:24,033 --> 01:45:27,978
[SPEAKER_10]: But my sense of it is that we'd be here till 4 o'clock if we tried to do it.

578
01:45:28,579 --> 01:45:49,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're gonna try and shoot for kind of 1.30-ish at this point, because we know that folks have schedules and things to do, but we're hoping that everybody's kind of in holiday mode, so that they've slowed things down a little bit, you know, and taking time to smell the flowers.

579
01:45:50,113 --> 01:45:54,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Those of you that got flowers, anybody that didn't get flowers, I'll hear about that later.

580
01:45:56,378 --> 01:45:56,958
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways,

581
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:02,387
[SPEAKER_10]: We hope you get refreshed and that you're reflective.

582
01:46:04,972 --> 01:46:06,615
[SPEAKER_10]: We just want to take a little time.

583
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:16,951
[SPEAKER_10]: to thank you all for your openness and your participation.

584
01:46:17,411 --> 01:46:25,892
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we recognize that these conversations are just kind of the tip of the iceberg of what we'd like to see across the city on a regular basis.

585
01:46:26,673 --> 01:46:37,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Our hope is that all of our community-based institutions can become greater and more effective incubators for dynamic communication, communion, and convening.

586
01:46:37,875 --> 01:46:41,456
[SPEAKER_10]: That is certainly the intent of the West Medford Community Center.

587
01:46:45,543 --> 01:46:47,973
[SPEAKER_10]: For me personally, the desire

588
01:46:49,764 --> 01:46:58,990
[SPEAKER_10]: to be in communion with the folks around me underpins what I do as a poet and as a creative spirit.

589
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:04,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know for sure the same can be said for our next speaker.

590
01:47:04,973 --> 01:47:08,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Vijaya Sundaram is Medford's second Poet Laureate.

591
01:47:08,776 --> 01:47:15,980
[SPEAKER_10]: She assumed her duties in July of last year, right around the time she released her first volume of poetry.

592
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,302
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Fractured Lens.

593
01:47:18,962 --> 01:47:23,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Vijaya is also a professor of literature at Bunker Hill Community College.

594
01:47:23,845 --> 01:47:25,907
[SPEAKER_10]: She is also a mother and a wife.

595
01:47:26,467 --> 01:47:31,811
[SPEAKER_10]: She sings and composes music and she's a visual artist online as well.

596
01:47:32,211 --> 01:47:33,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Her drawings are fantastic.

597
01:47:34,252 --> 01:47:41,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Here to share her creativity with you ladies and gentlemen is my friend and fellow poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram.

598
01:48:04,008 --> 01:48:04,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Terry.

599
01:48:04,889 --> 01:48:05,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me properly?

600
01:48:06,830 --> 01:48:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

601
01:48:08,271 --> 01:48:16,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Please feel free to raise a finger to let me, the forefinger, to let me know if you can't hear me.

602
01:48:16,597 --> 01:48:18,018
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will respond accordingly.

603
01:48:18,619 --> 01:48:25,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry, it's an honor to follow Terry and in his footsteps and to have these amazing performers before me.

604
01:48:25,424 --> 01:48:27,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for having me here.

605
01:48:27,405 --> 01:48:29,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is my first time at this event.

606
01:48:30,227 --> 01:48:32,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really grateful to be a part of it.

607
01:48:33,294 --> 01:48:38,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry told me that the theme was the beloved country, so I had to write a poem for it.

608
01:48:41,693 --> 01:48:46,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, I struggled a little bit with it, because I've never written a poem about a person.

609
01:48:47,634 --> 01:48:48,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was my first time.

610
01:48:49,295 --> 01:48:51,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished it on Saturday morning.

611
01:48:52,656 --> 01:48:54,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But I promise you, I put my heart and soul into it.

612
01:48:55,256 --> 01:48:59,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And before that, I thought the song that I would like to sing is not mine.

613
01:48:59,397 --> 01:49:01,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, when you hear it, you'll know it's not mine.

614
01:49:01,738 --> 01:49:07,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by Mongo Santa Maria, and it's Afro Blue, because the beloved country.

615
01:49:11,843 --> 01:49:25,993
[SPEAKER_02]: dream of the land my soul is from I hear a hand stroke on a drum shades of delight

616
01:49:27,662 --> 01:49:33,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Cocoa hues, rich as the night.

617
01:49:34,246 --> 01:49:38,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Afro blue.

618
01:49:40,590 --> 01:49:44,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Elegant boy, beautiful girl.

619
01:49:46,654 --> 01:50:13,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Dancing for joy Elegant world Shades of delight Cocoa hue Rich as the night Afro blue Two young lovers are face to face With undulating grace

620
01:50:14,671 --> 01:50:21,013
[SPEAKER_02]: They gently sway then slip away to some secluded place.

621
01:50:23,153 --> 01:50:24,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Shades of delight.

622
01:50:26,314 --> 01:50:29,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Cocoa hue.

623
01:50:29,495 --> 01:50:32,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich as the night.

624
01:50:32,776 --> 01:50:37,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Afro blue.

625
01:50:37,938 --> 01:50:39,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it for Mongo.

626
01:50:42,099 --> 01:50:42,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

627
01:50:47,717 --> 01:50:49,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So I call this the dreamland.

628
01:50:56,223 --> 01:51:05,550
[SPEAKER_02]: There was once a dreamer who had a dream in whom the song of all the forebears flowed unbounded in a visionary stream.

629
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:12,724
[SPEAKER_02]: He spoke of the promised land undeterred, the shining mountaintop to which he had been.

630
01:51:13,465 --> 01:51:16,387
[SPEAKER_02]: He spoke aloud and claimed the dream deferred.

631
01:51:17,448 --> 01:51:27,716
[SPEAKER_02]: This land, this country that's been ruled by might, he strove for it for us, for those to come, to tilt the balance in the cause of right.

632
01:51:28,616 --> 01:51:35,278
[SPEAKER_02]: He strove, he spoke, and passed a weary spell, while clubs and tear gas tried to hold him back.

633
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:39,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I may not get there, were his words, a knell.

634
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:43,101
[SPEAKER_02]: The dream lived on beyond that fateful year.

635
01:51:43,661 --> 01:51:49,583
[SPEAKER_02]: The bridge held, while the ranks of marchers swelled, and pushed aside the bigotry and fear.

636
01:51:50,785 --> 01:51:55,868
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes us reach together for a goal while the chasm widens beneath our feet?

637
01:51:56,789 --> 01:51:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: We seek to build a bridge to make us whole.

638
01:52:01,211 --> 01:52:10,977
[SPEAKER_02]: But bridges take a while to build and cross, so some leap into currents, fearing not, for time is short and fears are albatross.

639
01:52:12,472 --> 01:52:17,678
[SPEAKER_02]: What currents do we have to swim to brave the hatred that erodes our conjoint work?

640
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:21,822
[SPEAKER_02]: On rafts of hope, some ride the swelling wave.

641
01:52:22,963 --> 01:52:32,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers, sisters rail against each other, brown and black and beige and white and pale, forgetting that we are born of earth, our mother.

642
01:52:33,874 --> 01:52:40,323
[SPEAKER_02]: This dream for which we're marching is the grail so far away, and yet we see its form.

643
01:52:41,084 --> 01:52:44,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, through wind and storm, we shall prevail.

644
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:48,635
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll hold each other's hands in loving trust.

645
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:50,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

646
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:09,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Vijaya, we are different, but we are the same.

647
01:53:12,485 --> 01:53:15,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that wonderful mix of sound and spirit.

648
01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:27,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We're so happy to have you here with us today, and we look forward to all that you will continue to do as Medford's second ever Poet Laureate and a great resource for the arts in this community.

649
01:53:35,888 --> 01:53:41,446
[SPEAKER_10]: So we thought long and hard about what we wanted a guest speaker to bring to our audience today.

650
01:53:42,335 --> 01:53:50,578
[SPEAKER_10]: we came to the conclusion that there are so many entities that help the public navigate on this journey to beloved community.

651
01:53:51,379 --> 01:54:08,626
[SPEAKER_10]: And while some of these entities may occasionally seem to delay, deny, or obstruct some of what happens as we make our way toward King's ideal, Dr. King himself knew that we have to have effective partnerships with them.

652
01:54:09,446 --> 01:54:12,309
[SPEAKER_10]: This is particularly true of law enforcement.

653
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:28,487
[SPEAKER_10]: In his 13 years as a civil rights leader, Dr. King was arrested 30 times, largely for misdemeanors or civil protest violations, so his experience with the police must have been at least troubling.

654
01:54:29,255 --> 01:54:41,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Nonetheless, he maintained that the police had to be included as part of the solution to the civil rights question, even while it frequently cast itself as part of the problem itself.

655
01:54:42,265 --> 01:54:49,571
[SPEAKER_10]: That recognition informed the decision to have a perspective of law enforcement as part of today's conversation.

656
01:54:50,256 --> 01:55:02,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Therefore, if you have any skepticism or disbelief, I ask you to temporarily suspend and have a good listen to this afternoon's keynote address.

657
01:55:03,724 --> 01:55:05,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, another bit of full disclosure.

658
01:55:06,366 --> 01:55:14,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I have yet again prevailed upon a family member to help us with today's celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

659
01:55:15,643 --> 01:55:21,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Darrell W. Owens retired on March 17th, 2023 after 34 years.

660
01:55:21,988 --> 01:55:26,892
[SPEAKER_10]: He only looks like he's 34, it's too funny, with the Boston Police Department.

661
01:55:27,413 --> 01:55:31,316
[SPEAKER_10]: He spent the majority of his police career at the BPD Academy.

662
01:55:31,796 --> 01:55:44,987
[SPEAKER_10]: There he specialized in defensive tactics, use of force and de-escalation, while at the academy he trained over 2,000 police officers and a total of 30 recruit classes.

663
01:55:46,397 --> 01:55:57,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Daryl is the founder and director of the Boston Police Teen Academy, a summer job and outreach program that connects police officers with at-risk youth.

664
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:06,023
[SPEAKER_10]: His use of force expertise has been honed through hundreds of hours of training, personal research, and consultation.

665
01:56:06,423 --> 01:56:13,445
[SPEAKER_10]: He has trained with the FBI, the Police Executive Research Forum, and the Force Science Institute.

666
01:56:14,005 --> 01:56:21,787
[SPEAKER_10]: One of his passions is teaching the concepts of constitutional police practices to varied civilian audiences.

667
01:56:22,427 --> 01:56:31,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Darryl is a nephew of the late Massachusetts State Senator William Bill Owens and former State Representative Shirley Owens-Hicks.

668
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:39,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Like so many of his siblings, cousins, and friends, he grew up in the politics of race and reconciliation.

669
01:56:40,257 --> 01:56:48,003
[SPEAKER_10]: He brings that recognition to his evolving professional life beyond his three decades of work with BBT.

670
01:56:48,424 --> 01:56:49,665
[SPEAKER_10]: He has a beautiful wife.

671
01:56:49,705 --> 01:56:50,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Her name is Barbara.

672
01:56:50,645 --> 01:56:51,926
[SPEAKER_10]: He has lovely daughters.

673
01:56:53,208 --> 01:56:58,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed cousin, my brother in Christ, and my friend, Darryl W. Owens.

674
01:57:16,448 --> 01:57:19,609
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you and hello everybody.

675
01:57:19,629 --> 01:57:23,531
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great to be here so far.

676
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:36,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I am really honored to be invited here to speak on this day, to think about and to reflect on the life and legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

677
01:57:37,598 --> 01:57:39,598
[SPEAKER_01]: It is enormous to me.

678
01:57:40,019 --> 01:57:42,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't quite put it in words,

679
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:49,406
[SPEAKER_01]: how big it is for me to be able to come before you and speak to you today.

680
01:57:50,326 --> 01:58:04,000
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the one thing that I'm really grateful for in the legacy of Dr. King is that all throughout today and all throughout next month, we can actually hear the man's voice.

681
01:58:05,575 --> 01:58:17,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology was at a place, it wasn't where it is in 2024 of course, but it was at a place during his lifetime that we could actually hear his words from his voice.

682
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:27,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people who weren't even on the earth when he lived get to hear his actual voice, his actual words.

683
01:58:28,825 --> 01:58:34,888
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know something that's amazing about Dr. King is that his actions,

684
01:58:35,697 --> 01:58:37,679
[SPEAKER_01]: were greater than his words.

685
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:42,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know about you, but I want to be like that.

686
01:58:43,263 --> 01:58:44,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I am 58 years old.

687
01:58:44,764 --> 01:58:47,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm recently retired from the Boston Police Department.

688
01:58:49,208 --> 01:58:52,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to have a life of impact.

689
01:58:53,371 --> 01:58:54,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to live a life of impact.

690
01:58:55,472 --> 01:58:56,733
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard it in my introduction.

691
01:58:56,774 --> 01:59:01,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't bore you with any more of the facts, but I love

692
01:59:01,482 --> 01:59:04,563
[SPEAKER_01]: the topics that I've come to teach at the Boston Police Academy.

693
01:59:04,623 --> 01:59:05,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a true teacher.

694
01:59:07,104 --> 01:59:07,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach.

695
01:59:08,385 --> 01:59:09,145
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I do.

696
01:59:09,445 --> 01:59:13,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't talk a lot unless I'm teaching.

697
01:59:13,687 --> 01:59:18,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually a quiet person, quiet and some might even say shy.

698
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:22,351
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I have something to teach, I talk.

699
01:59:23,314 --> 01:59:28,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm much better standing here in front of a group of 100 or so people than I am mingling at a party.

700
01:59:29,318 --> 01:59:31,159
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't believe me, ask my cousins.

701
01:59:32,861 --> 01:59:35,102
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few of them sprinkled around here.

702
01:59:35,502 --> 01:59:37,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not a very good mingler.

703
01:59:37,123 --> 01:59:37,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

704
01:59:38,945 --> 01:59:39,745
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am a teacher.

705
01:59:40,346 --> 01:59:42,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved teaching police use of force.

706
01:59:43,848 --> 01:59:46,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I passionately loved it.

707
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:52,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been involved in several places around the country.

708
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:55,062
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching police use of force.

709
01:59:55,542 --> 02:00:00,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I am the use of force subject matter expert for Ferguson, Missouri.

710
02:00:02,169 --> 02:00:14,101
[SPEAKER_01]: That department has signed a consent decree and a bunch of civilians, me included, went down there and we helped them to restructure their police use of force.

711
02:00:14,742 --> 02:00:16,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very proud of that work.

712
02:00:22,418 --> 02:00:26,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I've been on both sides of this issue.

713
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:38,264
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, when you're the person who is the use of force subject matter expert, and people see you, they want to kind of dictate how it's going to go.

714
02:00:39,485 --> 02:00:40,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me explain.

715
02:00:40,926 --> 02:00:42,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get kicked out of both cookouts.

716
02:00:42,346 --> 02:00:43,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get kicked out of two cookouts.

717
02:00:45,828 --> 02:00:49,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I can seriously get kicked out of the police cookout.

718
02:00:50,899 --> 02:01:03,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we might be hanging around the burgers and someone might say, hey, Darryl, what do you think about this issue that happened in this city at this time to that black person?

719
02:01:04,872 --> 02:01:06,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might say, well, that cop was wrong.

720
02:01:08,215 --> 02:01:09,096
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's how I know.

721
02:01:11,257 --> 02:01:12,499
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already studied it out.

722
02:01:13,499 --> 02:01:17,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I took six hours to read about it and watch the videos and read the reports.

723
02:01:18,186 --> 02:01:21,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what I think, and that cop was wrong.

724
02:01:22,447 --> 02:01:28,389
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the cop cookout, somebody might say, do you want that burger wrapped in foil?

725
02:01:29,409 --> 02:01:31,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Means, you got to go, bruh.

726
02:01:33,410 --> 02:01:35,591
[SPEAKER_01]: At the family cookout, I can get kicked out.

727
02:01:38,912 --> 02:01:39,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.

728
02:01:40,779 --> 02:01:51,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Darryl, what do you think about this particular use of force that happened to this black person in this city at this time?

729
02:01:53,382 --> 02:02:04,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And my answer might be, this is going to be a hard truth for you, cousin, dear cousin, but this particular use of force

730
02:02:05,219 --> 02:02:12,462
[SPEAKER_01]: was the only reasonable response that that police officer could have arrived at at that particular time.

731
02:02:14,703 --> 02:02:23,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Now maybe there's some ribs and chicken at the family cookout, but nonetheless, would you like your plate to go?

732
02:02:25,627 --> 02:02:26,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can live with that.

733
02:02:28,167 --> 02:02:29,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pleased with that.

734
02:02:30,731 --> 02:02:39,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the statements that I reiterate to myself all the time when I'm going into these conversations is that the truth has no friends.

735
02:02:41,298 --> 02:02:43,420
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth does not have a friend.

736
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:44,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.

737
02:02:44,761 --> 02:02:46,502
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a straight line most of the time.

738
02:02:49,104 --> 02:02:55,768
[SPEAKER_01]: What complicates those truths in this country is implicit bias.

739
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:59,211
[SPEAKER_01]: It really complicates things.

740
02:03:00,572 --> 02:03:14,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to go too much into this, but the devaluing of black and brown bodies in this country is epidemic and historic, of course.

741
02:03:16,176 --> 02:03:17,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go too much into that.

742
02:03:17,977 --> 02:03:19,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to teach you something, though.

743
02:03:19,797 --> 02:03:20,137
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready?

744
02:03:21,358 --> 02:03:25,579
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I'm going to give you a two-minute lesson in de-escalation.

745
02:03:27,435 --> 02:03:29,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to use your imagination first.

746
02:03:29,496 --> 02:03:30,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get some water.

747
02:03:30,256 --> 02:03:30,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that OK?

748
02:03:30,536 --> 02:03:40,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to lubricate the instrument, as my table neighbor just told me a few minutes ago, a voice teacher.

749
02:03:44,662 --> 02:03:46,823
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my quick two-minute de-escalation lesson.

750
02:03:48,644 --> 02:03:49,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your imagination.

751
02:03:50,344 --> 02:03:57,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine you're on one of those game shows, like a minute-to-win-it game show, and you're the contestant in the phone booth.

752
02:03:58,393 --> 02:04:02,934
[SPEAKER_01]: where in a couple of seconds dollar bills are going to fly up from the floor.

753
02:04:03,794 --> 02:04:04,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your job?

754
02:04:05,935 --> 02:04:07,815
[SPEAKER_01]: To get as many as possible.

755
02:04:08,595 --> 02:04:09,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be able to get all of them?

756
02:04:11,216 --> 02:04:13,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be able to dictate which ones you grab?

757
02:04:14,316 --> 02:04:20,177
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're just going to grab as many as possible so you can come out of the phone booth with something of value, yes?

758
02:04:21,858 --> 02:04:23,458
[SPEAKER_01]: The de-escalation conversation.

759
02:04:25,532 --> 02:04:37,541
[SPEAKER_01]: You are talking to someone who is agitated, angry, frustrated, for real good reasons or reasons you don't even understand.

760
02:04:39,063 --> 02:04:47,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything they say comes out hard and fast and almost assaultive and almost offensive.

761
02:04:49,070 --> 02:04:50,772
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not controlling their tone.

762
02:04:51,991 --> 02:04:54,132
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not being delicate and kind.

763
02:04:54,753 --> 02:04:57,634
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just firing words at you.

764
02:04:59,215 --> 02:05:04,078
[SPEAKER_01]: The de-escalation listener is just like the phone booth contestant.

765
02:05:05,219 --> 02:05:14,044
[SPEAKER_01]: In that environment of loudness and emotion and angst, they're trying to grab as many truths as possible.

766
02:05:16,185 --> 02:05:20,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they come out of that environment with something of value, they can say,

767
02:05:22,375 --> 02:05:25,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that you're very upset about this or that.

768
02:05:28,358 --> 02:05:29,379
[SPEAKER_01]: That's de-escalation.

769
02:05:30,759 --> 02:05:32,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give it some real flesh and bones now.

770
02:05:35,081 --> 02:05:40,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Terry mentioned that I'm the founder of the Boston Teen Police Academy.

771
02:05:40,244 --> 02:05:46,587
[SPEAKER_01]: It is my great joy and pleasure and honor to lead that program.

772
02:05:47,007 --> 02:05:48,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you the beginning story.

773
02:05:50,609 --> 02:05:50,669
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2010,

774
02:05:53,293 --> 02:05:58,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I did karate since I was nine years old, I needed double hip replacement surgery.

775
02:06:01,096 --> 02:06:05,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the hospital, I got my hips done, and it was intense.

776
02:06:06,298 --> 02:06:07,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of you can relate.

777
02:06:08,599 --> 02:06:11,200
[SPEAKER_01]: It was intense, and I can remember, I was only 45 years old.

778
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:17,431
[SPEAKER_01]: And the doctor came in, and he said, hey, Mr. Owens.

779
02:06:17,631 --> 02:06:18,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah.

780
02:06:18,131 --> 02:06:22,053
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, you're going to be feeling better than you have in 15 years.

781
02:06:22,533 --> 02:06:26,994
[SPEAKER_01]: In a few days, I want you to do something amazing.

782
02:06:28,135 --> 02:06:29,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first, I was like, what?

783
02:06:31,056 --> 02:06:31,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are you?

784
02:06:32,236 --> 02:06:33,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, who are you?

785
02:06:34,137 --> 02:06:35,237
[SPEAKER_01]: You ain't my preacher.

786
02:06:35,297 --> 02:06:37,098
[SPEAKER_01]: You ain't, what?

787
02:06:38,178 --> 02:06:39,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little bit offended.

788
02:06:40,059 --> 02:06:41,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went back to work.

789
02:06:41,872 --> 02:06:46,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was on light duty, I couldn't go out in the street, I couldn't do anything but I was working in the academy.

790
02:06:46,697 --> 02:07:00,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this time I was halfway through my career as an academy instructor, so I had a few classes of officers under me who really loved and respected me because I was really hard on them when they were in the academy.

791
02:07:01,598 --> 02:07:06,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So they called me up, two cops called me up, and they said, hey, we have a young kid.

792
02:07:06,642 --> 02:07:08,043
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a lot of potential.

793
02:07:08,383 --> 02:07:10,624
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of falling in with the wrong group.

794
02:07:10,945 --> 02:07:14,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we bring him in and you give him a little tour and tell him what you do?

795
02:07:14,727 --> 02:07:21,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he doesn't think that there's anybody that looks like him that has a role of influence in the Boston Police Department.

796
02:07:21,772 --> 02:07:22,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, sure, bring him in.

797
02:07:23,834 --> 02:07:24,454
[SPEAKER_01]: He came in.

798
02:07:25,635 --> 02:07:28,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And right away, I don't know if you've ever done this,

799
02:07:29,639 --> 02:07:31,660
[SPEAKER_01]: But right away, I loved this kid.

800
02:07:32,441 --> 02:07:32,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Right away.

801
02:07:33,862 --> 02:07:38,985
[SPEAKER_01]: But not for, I loved him because he was just so edgy and tough.

802
02:07:40,166 --> 02:07:42,207
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could see that there was softness there.

803
02:07:43,328 --> 02:07:53,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he had, well, one of my pet peeves at the time, no longer, but at the time, I had a pet peeve about young men wearing their pants really low.

804
02:07:54,555 --> 02:07:55,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Full disclosure.

805
02:07:56,855 --> 02:07:59,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're 58, that happens to you.

806
02:07:59,637 --> 02:08:02,759
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have that.

807
02:08:02,879 --> 02:08:04,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not offended by that anymore.

808
02:08:05,381 --> 02:08:05,941
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.

809
02:08:05,961 --> 02:08:06,562
[SPEAKER_01]: It's normal.

810
02:08:07,202 --> 02:08:09,324
[SPEAKER_01]: But back then, it wasn't normal.

811
02:08:11,685 --> 02:08:19,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two police officers knew that I had that pet peeve, and he had adjusted his pants thusly.

812
02:08:21,953 --> 02:08:25,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, hey, man, can you do me a favor and pull those up?

813
02:08:26,067 --> 02:08:29,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, I'm not here to get advice on how I wear my clothes from you, man.

814
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:33,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought, word, I like this kid.

815
02:08:35,333 --> 02:08:36,254
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't think that.

816
02:08:36,594 --> 02:08:38,515
[SPEAKER_01]: The two officers that brought him in didn't think that.

817
02:08:39,636 --> 02:08:51,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of them kind of gently put their hand on his elbow, came up from behind the young man, put his hand on his elbow, and said, hey, come over here.

818
02:08:51,524 --> 02:08:52,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me talk to you.

819
02:08:53,485 --> 02:08:54,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And this young man, what do you think he did?

820
02:08:56,616 --> 02:08:57,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your hand off me.

821
02:08:59,257 --> 02:09:00,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be touching me.

822
02:09:00,418 --> 02:09:03,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't come here for you to put your hands all over me.

823
02:09:04,739 --> 02:09:05,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw it.

824
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:11,482
[SPEAKER_01]: The officer was going to respond in kind, and it was going to be a situation.

825
02:09:12,282 --> 02:09:13,523
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what a situation is, right?

826
02:09:16,824 --> 02:09:17,665
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be an issue.

827
02:09:18,865 --> 02:09:19,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, stop.

828
02:09:20,686 --> 02:09:21,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop.

829
02:09:21,686 --> 02:09:23,227
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in the gymnasium at the time.

830
02:09:24,656 --> 02:09:27,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, do you guys, do you two wanna go get some coffee or something?

831
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:30,361
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a coffee machine in my office.

832
02:09:30,381 --> 02:09:32,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you guys go and make yourself a cup?

833
02:09:32,783 --> 02:09:36,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, why don't you go do that?

834
02:09:37,367 --> 02:09:38,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna stay here and talk to him.

835
02:09:41,010 --> 02:09:41,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked.

836
02:09:42,971 --> 02:09:46,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, it was all attitude.

837
02:09:47,395 --> 02:09:49,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still like, word, I like this kid.

838
02:09:49,196 --> 02:09:50,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I like this kid.

839
02:09:52,756 --> 02:09:54,317
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to make him do push-ups.

840
02:09:54,337 --> 02:09:58,619
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought I was going to make him do push-ups and yell at him and tell him off.

841
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:01,321
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said, hey, sit down on that bench over there.

842
02:10:01,341 --> 02:10:02,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sit down on this bench over here.

843
02:10:02,902 --> 02:10:05,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to tell you about myself.

844
02:10:06,524 --> 02:10:07,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know why you're here?

845
02:10:09,125 --> 02:10:09,805
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, no.

846
02:10:09,925 --> 02:10:11,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I happen to know.

847
02:10:12,167 --> 02:10:15,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to know that your father was taken to prison when you were very young.

848
02:10:16,689 --> 02:10:17,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

849
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:19,971
[SPEAKER_01]: My father was taken to prison when I was very young.

850
02:10:21,795 --> 02:10:26,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to know that your father passed away soon after he went away.

851
02:10:27,077 --> 02:10:27,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

852
02:10:28,137 --> 02:10:30,778
[SPEAKER_01]: My father passed away soon after he went away.

853
02:10:32,798 --> 02:10:45,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to know that you do pretty well at school, but you're not at the age right now where it's really cool to let other people know in your neighborhood that you're doing well at school.

854
02:10:46,431 --> 02:10:49,475
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was your age, I was doing pretty well at school.

855
02:10:49,876 --> 02:10:54,642
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was not cool to let people know in my neighborhood that I was doing pretty well.

856
02:10:54,922 --> 02:10:57,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, we're the same.

857
02:10:57,325 --> 02:11:01,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, we're the same.

858
02:11:03,273 --> 02:11:04,154
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the same.

859
02:11:05,171 --> 02:11:16,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just started talking and laughing and talking about sneakers and talking about the girls he liked and talking about what he wanted to do in his life.

860
02:11:16,816 --> 02:11:20,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And we became friends.

861
02:11:22,318 --> 02:11:24,639
[SPEAKER_01]: That relationship didn't last a long time.

862
02:11:26,359 --> 02:11:27,340
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you see what I did?

863
02:11:29,141 --> 02:11:30,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the phone booth.

864
02:11:31,862 --> 02:11:32,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I was right there.

865
02:11:34,656 --> 02:11:46,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that he didn't want that police officer coming up from behind him and touching him because that was traumatic for him in some way.

866
02:11:47,547 --> 02:11:49,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I related to him.

867
02:11:50,689 --> 02:11:54,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And he realized, I didn't tell him this because it would have been totally weird.

868
02:11:54,913 --> 02:11:56,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say, I love you, man.

869
02:11:56,774 --> 02:12:03,720
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think he realized through the connection that I did that I cared.

870
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:10,543
[SPEAKER_01]: that my heart was open to him, that I wanted his heart to be open to me.

871
02:12:13,085 --> 02:12:22,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after they left, I said, I'm going to call my wife and tell her about this.

872
02:12:23,912 --> 02:12:28,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called her, and she said, maybe this is what your doctor was talking about.

873
02:12:30,066 --> 02:12:42,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, you know what, I'm going to try to form an organization to bring kids like him into the police academy so they can, I don't even know what I'm going to do with them, but I just want them to experience me.

874
02:12:42,338 --> 02:12:43,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound weird?

875
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:46,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I just want them to meet me.

876
02:12:46,842 --> 02:12:54,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want them to see that I am the one who's training the police that go out to interact with them.

877
02:12:56,303 --> 02:13:05,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to see that I come from damage and trauma and heartbreak and heartache and I'm here and I'm doing something to give back.

878
02:13:06,269 --> 02:13:07,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to see me.

879
02:13:07,470 --> 02:13:09,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So it started off very simple.

880
02:13:10,592 --> 02:13:11,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a three week program.

881
02:13:12,879 --> 02:13:14,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did things like teach them how to tie a necktie.

882
02:13:14,741 --> 02:13:15,922
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all boys initially.

883
02:13:16,482 --> 02:13:19,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Taught them how to tie a necktie, something I didn't learn.

884
02:13:20,085 --> 02:13:25,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Taught them how to catch a baseball and a mitt, something I didn't learn.

885
02:13:25,110 --> 02:13:26,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a father to play catch with.

886
02:13:27,832 --> 02:13:32,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Taught them how to order their food at a restaurant, something I didn't learn.

887
02:13:32,336 --> 02:13:33,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't grow up with a father.

888
02:13:36,308 --> 02:13:39,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And the program grew and grew and grew.

889
02:13:40,309 --> 02:13:45,711
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's a six week long summer program where they are getting paid.

890
02:13:47,652 --> 02:13:49,893
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my kids right now, thank you.

891
02:13:52,533 --> 02:13:53,834
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my kids right now.

892
02:13:55,063 --> 02:14:00,547
[SPEAKER_01]: is in Wentworth Institute, a junior in Wentworth Institute.

893
02:14:00,607 --> 02:14:05,671
[SPEAKER_01]: She should be a sophomore, but she took classes right out of the Teen Academy.

894
02:14:05,931 --> 02:14:19,641
[SPEAKER_01]: She went and took classes at Roxbury Community College and got herself into Wentworth Institute on a higher level and is gonna be finished in less than a year with her training as a software engineer.

895
02:14:24,244 --> 02:14:27,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not there to make cops, although that has been a benefit.

896
02:14:28,307 --> 02:14:29,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a few kids.

897
02:14:29,949 --> 02:14:34,232
[SPEAKER_01]: About 10 of them have become police officers thus far in the last 15 years.

898
02:14:34,853 --> 02:14:38,375
[SPEAKER_01]: But my main goal is to give them a pathway to success.

899
02:14:40,097 --> 02:14:41,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved my profession.

900
02:14:43,499 --> 02:14:49,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sobered by the power that I had as a member of my profession.

901
02:14:51,070 --> 02:14:55,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I was and am concerned about my profession.

902
02:14:57,254 --> 02:15:06,981
[SPEAKER_01]: As you well know, the history of policing and black and brown people are deeply intertwined in this country.

903
02:15:07,881 --> 02:15:16,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the foundational principles of forming modern policing is to control black and brown populations in major cities.

904
02:15:17,548 --> 02:15:17,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Control.

905
02:15:19,662 --> 02:15:22,163
[SPEAKER_01]: subjugation, oppression.

906
02:15:23,443 --> 02:15:25,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were some of the initial goals.

907
02:15:27,665 --> 02:15:29,306
[SPEAKER_01]: But now times have changed.

908
02:15:29,666 --> 02:15:45,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of work of great people like Dr. King and because of modern efforts like the public outcry and the police killings that have happened in the last five or 10 years, things are changing.

909
02:15:45,512 --> 02:15:48,833
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a nationwide movement for police reform.

910
02:15:50,529 --> 02:15:58,154
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that Terry asked me to speak about was, how can we make things better?

911
02:15:59,475 --> 02:16:04,279
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it differently than that, but what I read was, how can we make things better?

912
02:16:04,959 --> 02:16:07,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, things are beginning to get better.

913
02:16:09,863 --> 02:16:19,950
[SPEAKER_01]: The departments that I've interacted with closely all over the country, I can't even name all of them because I signed agreements that I won't disclose who they are.

914
02:16:21,121 --> 02:16:26,805
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've seen them do some of the following 10 things to make things better.

915
02:16:28,246 --> 02:16:33,209
[SPEAKER_01]: One, screen candidates for implicit bias and aggression.

916
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:46,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, train candidates in de-escalation, recognition of mental illness and neurodivergence, and also implicit bias.

917
02:16:48,086 --> 02:16:51,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach people that their biases exist.

918
02:16:56,452 --> 02:17:03,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, conduct regular training audits to combat complacency.

919
02:17:04,038 --> 02:17:08,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we change, so does police training need to change.

920
02:17:10,763 --> 02:17:17,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, create a training environment that supports and encourages cultural curiosity.

921
02:17:19,602 --> 02:17:31,889
[SPEAKER_01]: That means to have an intentionally diverse training staff, not a bunch of people who look just alike, who are eating the same things, who are wearing the same things, and live in the same neighborhoods.

922
02:17:31,949 --> 02:17:34,030
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to train your police force.

923
02:17:36,571 --> 02:17:40,113
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 Chevy Tahoes in the parking lot is not going to train your police force.

924
02:17:40,613 --> 02:17:41,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some Priuses in there.

925
02:17:44,761 --> 02:17:46,062
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a joke.

926
02:17:46,162 --> 02:17:47,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a funny joke.

927
02:17:47,302 --> 02:17:49,804
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were a cop, it's a funny joke.

928
02:17:49,944 --> 02:17:50,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, sir?

929
02:17:50,784 --> 02:17:52,885
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one if you're a cop.

930
02:17:52,965 --> 02:17:53,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

931
02:17:53,786 --> 02:17:54,826
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

932
02:17:55,406 --> 02:17:59,408
[SPEAKER_01]: True transparency in internal investigations.

933
02:18:00,829 --> 02:18:06,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting complainants know the progress of the actual investigation.

934
02:18:06,772 --> 02:18:10,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting the public know the progress of the actual investigation.

935
02:18:10,634 --> 02:18:12,175
[SPEAKER_01]: This is happening around the country.

936
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:20,410
[SPEAKER_01]: foster a police culture that embraces accountability rather than fears it.

937
02:18:21,431 --> 02:18:34,496
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I've done to kind of get my way back into that cop cookout is to explain to them that high accountability is good if you are good.

938
02:18:34,516 --> 02:18:37,397
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

939
02:18:40,029 --> 02:18:44,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Use technology such as body-worn cameras to enhance accountability.

940
02:18:45,351 --> 02:18:47,112
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a big boon for me.

941
02:18:48,272 --> 02:18:56,375
[SPEAKER_01]: My laptop at home has so many body cam videos that I could probably sell it for big money to a news outlet, but I'm not doing that.

942
02:19:00,636 --> 02:19:07,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Center your department identity around the concept of community policing.

943
02:19:11,044 --> 02:19:16,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, help officers to understand it's to their benefit.

944
02:19:18,830 --> 02:19:31,820
[SPEAKER_01]: To have these kind of concepts accepted by officers throughout the departments, we must teach that this approach is good for the public and for the police officers.

945
02:19:33,161 --> 02:19:38,145
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a difficult job at times, and there's no getting around that.

946
02:19:40,222 --> 02:19:50,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could stand here and tell you some war stories about my worst days on the job.

947
02:19:52,249 --> 02:19:54,911
[SPEAKER_01]: But I won't, because you're not ready.

948
02:19:56,812 --> 02:19:58,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Only my therapist is ready for that.

949
02:19:59,614 --> 02:20:01,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for real, real.

950
02:20:01,915 --> 02:20:02,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one.

951
02:20:03,156 --> 02:20:03,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I need one.

952
02:20:04,377 --> 02:20:05,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, hallelujah, amen.

953
02:20:14,591 --> 02:20:29,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Having an appropriate value for the concepts of supportiveness, teamwork, empathy, and care enables officers to better cope with the inevitable stress that goes with the job.

954
02:20:33,305 --> 02:20:43,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Empathy and compassion are the two key ingredients that enabled me to serve for 34 years and to leave that job loving that job.

955
02:20:45,674 --> 02:20:49,576
[SPEAKER_01]: because I exercised empathy and compassion.

956
02:20:50,896 --> 02:21:00,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very grateful for my experience, and I want to continue to use my life for good and for impact.

957
02:21:02,101 --> 02:21:09,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very thankful for you for listening to me today, but like Dr. King's short life,

958
02:21:11,488 --> 02:21:15,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I want my actions to speak louder than these few words.

959
02:21:15,771 --> 02:21:16,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

960
02:21:39,029 --> 02:21:40,150
[SPEAKER_10]: For the vertically challenged,

961
02:21:44,274 --> 02:21:46,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Brother Cousin.

962
02:21:47,176 --> 02:21:57,301
[SPEAKER_10]: You clearly understood the assignment and we're so glad that you agreed to join us today as we reflect upon our own journeys to beloved community.

963
02:21:58,862 --> 02:22:07,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we're getting close to the close of our program and no such gathering would be complete if we didn't link arms and sing together.

964
02:22:08,426 --> 02:22:09,567
[SPEAKER_10]: So here to present

965
02:22:12,136 --> 02:22:17,758
[SPEAKER_10]: and lead us in the Black National Anthem, lift every voice and sing, is the voice of the city.

966
02:22:17,798 --> 02:22:24,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I call her the voice of the city, Stacey Clayton, accompanied once again by my good friend, pianist Jonathan Fagan.

967
02:22:32,202 --> 02:22:33,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Please stand if you're able.

968
02:22:35,783 --> 02:22:37,584
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome to sit if not.

969
02:22:38,704 --> 02:22:40,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And sing out loud, we'll hear you.

970
02:22:53,949 --> 02:23:04,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring.

971
02:23:05,736 --> 02:23:12,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Ring with the harmonies of America.

972
02:23:17,590 --> 02:23:28,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies.

973
02:23:29,461 --> 02:23:37,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

974
02:23:40,805 --> 02:23:42,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Sing a song full of the faith.

975
02:23:42,746 --> 02:23:48,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Sing a song that the dark past has taught us.

976
02:23:49,109 --> 02:23:53,550
[SPEAKER_04]: That the dark past has taught us.

977
02:23:54,471 --> 02:24:04,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.

978
02:24:06,975 --> 02:24:18,865
[SPEAKER_04]: us, facing the rising sun of our new day begun.

979
02:24:19,605 --> 02:24:24,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us march on till victory is won.

980
02:24:28,089 --> 02:24:31,152
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time, the same verse, because I know you know that one.

981
02:24:31,312 --> 02:24:32,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Lift every voice and sing.

982
02:24:33,313 --> 02:24:36,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Lift every voice and sing.

983
02:24:37,416 --> 02:24:42,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Till earth and heaven ring.

984
02:24:43,420 --> 02:24:51,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Ring with the harmonies of liberty.

985
02:24:53,117 --> 02:25:06,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies.

986
02:25:06,803 --> 02:25:14,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

987
02:25:19,611 --> 02:25:30,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Sing a song full of the hope that the dark past has taught us.

988
02:25:30,819 --> 02:25:43,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.

989
02:25:46,556 --> 02:26:09,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on till victory is won.

990
02:26:10,295 --> 02:26:14,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Facing the rising sun.

991
02:26:19,561 --> 02:26:26,306
[SPEAKER_04]: of our new day begun.

992
02:26:28,027 --> 02:26:41,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us march on till victory is won.

993
02:26:52,239 --> 02:26:54,501
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Stacey.

994
02:26:54,521 --> 02:26:55,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Jonathan.

995
02:26:55,761 --> 02:26:56,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So appreciate that.

996
02:26:57,082 --> 02:27:10,111
[SPEAKER_10]: So just wanted you to know that on Saturday, February 17, in concert at Somerville Community Baptist Church will be Stacey and her community choir.

997
02:27:10,171 --> 02:27:11,331
[SPEAKER_10]: They do it every year.

998
02:27:11,732 --> 02:27:12,392
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wonderful.

999
02:27:12,432 --> 02:27:16,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had an opportunity to participate on several occasions.

1000
02:27:16,975 --> 02:27:19,717
[SPEAKER_10]: The time is to be determined, but in the late afternoon,

1001
02:27:20,157 --> 02:27:33,142
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're free on February 17th, Somerville Community Baptist Church, Stacey Clayton and her wonderful community choir will be celebrating Black History Month in song and other things.

1002
02:27:44,367 --> 02:27:47,248
[SPEAKER_10]: So from one rousing tradition to another,

1003
02:27:49,881 --> 02:27:57,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to bring Reverend Wendy Miller Olopade, the pastor of Sanctuary United Church of Christ to the front.

1004
02:27:58,207 --> 02:28:08,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Reverend Wendy will deliver our challenge and our charge as we leave this gathering to continue on this kindred journey to beloved community in Medford and beyond.

1005
02:28:09,134 --> 02:28:09,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Reverend Wendy.

1006
02:28:09,754 --> 02:28:17,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Just leave it on the thing.

1007
02:28:17,279 --> 02:28:17,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Just leave it on the thing.

1008
02:28:29,357 --> 02:28:31,058
[SPEAKER_16]: I gotta tell you, I'm really anxious.

1009
02:28:31,939 --> 02:28:33,339
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been anxious all day.

1010
02:28:33,359 --> 02:28:38,442
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel really honored, really, really honored.

1011
02:28:38,942 --> 02:28:39,702
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not hearing that.

1012
02:28:40,203 --> 02:28:46,206
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel really, really honored to have been invited to do this, to do this thing.

1013
02:28:46,786 --> 02:28:54,890
[SPEAKER_16]: When Terry asked me a couple of weeks ago, I said, Terry, do you really want an old white lady doing the charge of the community?

1014
02:28:57,173 --> 02:28:58,117
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what he said?

1015
02:28:58,137 --> 02:29:03,215
[SPEAKER_16]: I want this old white lady to do the charge to the community.

1016
02:29:10,842 --> 02:29:21,730
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm standing here underneath this image that has been staring at me all morning, feeling the responsibility of this moment.

1017
02:29:23,252 --> 02:29:31,178
[SPEAKER_16]: So can I ask you to just sort of extend your hands up this way and give me a little of your positive energy, because I'm just so anxious.

1018
02:29:33,191 --> 02:29:34,793
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been doing this for 30 years.

1019
02:29:34,833 --> 02:29:49,466
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd think I'd know how to do this without, you know, a script and anxiety, but it is so important for us to gather in moments like this, to be community in the ways that King asked us to be.

1020
02:29:51,187 --> 02:29:53,069
[SPEAKER_16]: And so you can put your hands down, thanks.

1021
02:29:53,089 --> 02:29:56,832
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish that that moved all that energy out, but it didn't, but that's okay.

1022
02:29:57,153 --> 02:29:58,614
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll start talking and it'll go.

1023
02:30:00,939 --> 02:30:13,694
[SPEAKER_16]: I got to thinking this morning about what beloved community would look like as envisioned by Martin and Coretta and the King Center and so many others who aspired to make it so.

1024
02:30:13,734 --> 02:30:14,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear me all right?

1025
02:30:18,837 --> 02:30:21,458
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be racial harmony and diversity.

1026
02:30:22,299 --> 02:30:32,084
[SPEAKER_16]: A society that truly embraces the idea of the beloved community actively promotes racial harmony and celebrates diversity.

1027
02:30:32,484 --> 02:30:47,372
[SPEAKER_16]: This would be evident in integrated communities and schools and workplaces where people of all races and religions and perspectives and ethnicities actually interact with each other respectfully and with equity.

1028
02:30:48,729 --> 02:30:52,432
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be economic justice and equity, Steve.

1029
02:30:52,472 --> 02:30:53,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Is Steve still here back there?

1030
02:30:54,253 --> 02:30:58,837
[SPEAKER_16]: Economic disparities would be addressed through fair policies and practices.

1031
02:30:59,417 --> 02:31:04,361
[SPEAKER_16]: And that includes equal opportunities in education and employment and housing.

1032
02:31:04,661 --> 02:31:12,467
[SPEAKER_16]: It also means providing support for those in poverty and working towards a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, yes?

1033
02:31:13,328 --> 02:31:17,071
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be nonviolent conflict resolution.

1034
02:31:17,732 --> 02:31:25,237
[SPEAKER_16]: In the beloved community, conflicts, whether interpersonal or international, are resolved through nonviolent means.

1035
02:31:25,698 --> 02:31:31,302
[SPEAKER_16]: This approach involves dialogue and empathy and understanding and compassion, Owen.

1036
02:31:33,726 --> 02:31:38,187
[SPEAKER_16]: it would involve a commitment to finding mutually beneficial solutions.

1037
02:31:38,607 --> 02:31:42,348
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be community engagement and participation.

1038
02:31:42,808 --> 02:31:47,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Active community involvement is a key feature of Beloved Community.

1039
02:31:47,630 --> 02:31:53,551
[SPEAKER_16]: People are encouraged to participate in civic life and contribute to decision-making processes.

1040
02:31:53,591 --> 02:32:00,013
[SPEAKER_16]: This could manifest in local community meetings, Erin Olopade, participating in government models and volunteerism.

1041
02:32:03,254 --> 02:32:06,557
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be education and moral development.

1042
02:32:06,937 --> 02:32:15,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Our systems in a beloved community wouldn't focus just on academic achievement, but also on moral and ethical development.

1043
02:32:15,364 --> 02:32:26,773
[SPEAKER_16]: They would teach those values that our speaker spoke of, like empathy and social justice and community service, preparing everybody to contribute positively to society.

1044
02:32:27,333 --> 02:32:40,520
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be access to health care and social services, and that would be universal, ensuring that all members of the community have the support that they need to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.

1045
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:43,762
[SPEAKER_16]: We would steward the environment, yes?

1046
02:32:44,262 --> 02:32:49,345
[SPEAKER_16]: A beloved community recognizes the importance of protecting the Earth and her environments.

1047
02:32:49,585 --> 02:32:57,909
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be sustainable practices and policies would become the norm, reflecting a deep respect for the planet and future generations.

1048
02:32:57,969 --> 02:33:00,991
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be global solidarity and peace.

1049
02:33:01,751 --> 02:33:12,797
[SPEAKER_16]: The principles of the beloved community extend beyond Medford, extend beyond the United States, promoting global solidarity, global peace, global cooperation.

1050
02:33:13,437 --> 02:33:22,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Efforts to address global issues like poverty and climate change and conflict would be grounded in the principles of justice and nonviolence.

1051
02:33:23,442 --> 02:33:26,723
[SPEAKER_16]: There would be cultural and spiritual enrichment.

1052
02:33:27,444 --> 02:33:33,647
[SPEAKER_16]: A rich cultural life that celebrates diversity and fosters spiritual growth would be integral.

1053
02:33:34,267 --> 02:33:41,731
[SPEAKER_16]: This might include community events like this one and arts programs and spaces for spiritual reflection and connection.

1054
02:33:42,551 --> 02:33:46,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And we would practice restorative justice.

1055
02:33:46,933 --> 02:33:57,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead of punitive justice systems, a beloved community would focus on restorative justice, seeking to heal and rebuild relationships rather than simply punish.

1056
02:33:58,239 --> 02:33:59,920
[SPEAKER_16]: So tell me, are we there?

1057
02:34:01,660 --> 02:34:02,421
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we are not.

1058
02:34:03,126 --> 02:34:17,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a society, a city, a faith community, or even a neighborhood that's deeply rooted in justice, equity, love, and respect for all its members, where every individual has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to the common good?

1059
02:34:17,994 --> 02:34:18,394
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1060
02:34:18,894 --> 02:34:19,754
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we do not.

1061
02:34:19,835 --> 02:34:22,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want beloved community?

1062
02:34:23,356 --> 02:34:24,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me hear that.

1063
02:34:24,117 --> 02:34:25,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to help make it so?

1064
02:34:26,898 --> 02:34:36,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Then I invite you today, I charge you to join me and people around the world to make the pledge, as Lisa talked about, to be love.

1065
02:34:38,009 --> 02:34:39,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Lisa mentioned it at the beginning.

1066
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:40,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Have some of you already done this?

1067
02:34:42,233 --> 02:34:42,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes?

1068
02:34:42,954 --> 02:34:43,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

1069
02:34:43,614 --> 02:34:44,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Stand up if you've done it.

1070
02:34:45,076 --> 02:34:46,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Help me to lead this.

1071
02:34:47,412 --> 02:34:55,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Be Love is a movement that's been born amidst the immense uncertainty and global tension of the past couple of years.

1072
02:34:56,319 --> 02:35:15,534
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's grounded in the iconic words of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who in his notable and inspirational writing, Where Do We Go From Here, Chaos or Community, professed that power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice.

1073
02:35:17,085 --> 02:35:24,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love.

1074
02:35:25,370 --> 02:35:26,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you need to hear that again?

1075
02:35:27,151 --> 02:35:32,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice.

1076
02:35:32,994 --> 02:35:42,040
[SPEAKER_16]: And justice at its best is love correcting everything, everything that stands against love.

1077
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:46,922
[SPEAKER_16]: But friends, it is not enough to say that you want beloved community.

1078
02:35:47,203 --> 02:35:49,784
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not enough to say that you want to be love.

1079
02:35:50,384 --> 02:35:52,986
[SPEAKER_16]: We must make love and justice real.

1080
02:35:54,588 --> 02:35:55,628
[SPEAKER_16]: we must live it.

1081
02:35:56,789 --> 02:36:17,515
[SPEAKER_16]: In order to be the kind of love that implements the demands of justice, in order to be the kind of love that corrects everything that stands against love, in order to be the kind of love that practices beloved community, we must practice what informs King's call to become beloved community, and that is nonviolence.

1082
02:36:18,115 --> 02:36:25,661
[SPEAKER_16]: a powerful, practical approach to dealing with conflict and dismantling injustice in every aspect of our society.

1083
02:36:26,582 --> 02:36:36,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Nonviolence is a practice that can be used in our personal lives, our schools, our workplaces, our local community, and in national and global movements.

1084
02:36:36,489 --> 02:36:45,516
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a love-centered way of thinking, speaking, engaging, and acting that leads to personal, cultural, and societal transformation.

1085
02:36:46,116 --> 02:36:56,140
[SPEAKER_16]: And by the way, the Kingian philosophy called Nonviolence 365, that's what Lisa was talking about, is available online for anybody to watch and learn from.

1086
02:36:56,961 --> 02:37:01,082
[SPEAKER_16]: And so today, I charge you to be love.

1087
02:37:01,742 --> 02:37:04,584
[SPEAKER_16]: To do so, we need to acknowledge three things.

1088
02:37:05,284 --> 02:37:10,566
[SPEAKER_16]: The violence, oppression, inequity, injustice, and hate in our world has to stop.

1089
02:37:11,106 --> 02:37:11,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you say that?

1090
02:37:12,247 --> 02:37:12,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Stop.

1091
02:37:13,857 --> 02:37:22,208
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a responsibility and a role to play in creating social change for a more just, humane, equitable, and peaceful world.

1092
02:37:22,789 --> 02:37:30,519
[SPEAKER_16]: And the decision is ours whether or not to do something in this moment to have the courage to stand up for justice.

1093
02:37:31,099 --> 02:37:33,141
[SPEAKER_16]: So I charge you to make your own decision.

1094
02:37:33,541 --> 02:37:37,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Starting today, make a personal choice to be love.

1095
02:37:38,125 --> 02:37:45,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Pledge to allow love to drive your thoughts, words, decisions, and actions, and honor the humanity of every individual.

1096
02:37:46,733 --> 02:37:50,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Pledge to speak the truth to power in love.

1097
02:37:51,176 --> 02:37:55,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Pledge to focus on defeating injustice and not destroying a person.

1098
02:37:56,659 --> 02:38:00,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Pledge to support leaders who demonstrate a love for humanity.

1099
02:38:00,201 --> 02:38:01,482
[SPEAKER_16]: That means vote, by the way.

1100
02:38:02,142 --> 02:38:18,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Pledge to promote unity and refuse to perpetuate or magnify division, and pledge to demonstrate a life of courage, care, and compassion as you boldly confront anything that stands in opposition to love.

1101
02:38:19,711 --> 02:38:23,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Make this your pledge here, now, today.

1102
02:38:23,774 --> 02:38:24,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Be love.

1103
02:38:25,135 --> 02:38:25,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Live out love.

1104
02:38:26,475 --> 02:38:28,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Make love and justice real.

1105
02:38:29,237 --> 02:38:31,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Go to the kingcenter.org website.

1106
02:38:32,599 --> 02:38:33,200
[SPEAKER_16]: It's easy.

1107
02:38:33,220 --> 02:38:35,221
[SPEAKER_16]: All you have to do is Google be love.

1108
02:38:35,341 --> 02:38:36,041
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll get there.

1109
02:38:36,662 --> 02:38:36,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah?

1110
02:38:38,041 --> 02:38:48,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Go to the website, sign the pledge, go to the website, sign up for the training, and be love in the world, because there isn't anything else.

1111
02:38:49,841 --> 02:38:50,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

1112
02:39:05,633 --> 02:39:15,981
[SPEAKER_10]: If you give a preacher a mic, she will do exactly as she is warranted to do by the universe.

1113
02:39:16,141 --> 02:39:16,961
[SPEAKER_10]: She will preach.

1114
02:39:18,382 --> 02:39:24,466
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Sister Pastor, for those stirring and heartfelt words of challenge and conviction.

1115
02:39:24,987 --> 02:39:32,272
[SPEAKER_10]: You have given us both food and fuel for the days ahead, and we're going to need it because being love isn't easy.

1116
02:39:33,891 --> 02:39:35,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Medford, that's a lot.

1117
02:39:36,993 --> 02:39:42,097
[SPEAKER_10]: We've discussed, we've dined, we've danced, we've sang, we've listened, and we've learned.

1118
02:39:42,637 --> 02:39:46,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

1119
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:47,140
[SPEAKER_10]: would have wanted.

1120
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:52,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I pray that there's no COVID, no conflict, and no controversy in the room.
