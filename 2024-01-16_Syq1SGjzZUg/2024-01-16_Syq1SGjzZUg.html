    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=0.569s">You</a>  will find fortune cookies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=3.792s">They</a>  are not spiritual guideposts, but they do represent a diverse tradition and a way for us to connect as humans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=13.201s">So</a>  crack one open, and please take a moment or two to share what your fortune says with your table mates.</p>

    <p>[o9F0qYH9Geo_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=157.609s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=165.792s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=168.893s">So</a>  hopefully, and if everyone could take their seats, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=179.278s">So</a>  hopefully, whatever it said inside of your fortune cookie, if you were fortunate enough to find one, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=187.978s">is</a>  fortuitous for you, is predictive of long life and many blessings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=196.941s">So</a>  let's go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=199.262s">Please</a>  allow me to introduce a lifelong West Medford resident and licensed minister, Stacey Moore, to offer an invocation for today's gathering. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=208.845s">Stacey</a>  is a woman of deep faith and a community connector for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=213.547s">Stacey.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=228.237s">Good</a>  morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=228.957s">Let</a>  me grab this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=232.299s">Today</a>  is a perfect day to honor the legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=242.816s">Now,</a>  with due respect for one's personal beliefs and traditions, I'd like to invite you all to join me in prayer as we invoke a spirit of love, a spirit of love, community, and compassion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=263.678s">All-encompassing</a>  spirit, we welcome your presence as we gather in reflection and celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=272.602s">We</a>  are grateful for Dr. King's love of humanity, his faith, his vision, and his relentless effort to see the mission through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=282.167s">While</a>  some of his dream has been realized in these changed times of today, there is still much work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=291.806s">We</a>  ask to be united as community as we embrace Dr. King's teachings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=297.67s">And</a>  when we leave here today, let us leave with a commitment to ourselves and to one another to be community champions of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=307.578s">Equity,</a>  equality, and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=311.901s">Amen.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=323.854s">Thank</a>  you, Stacey, for those words of faith in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=327.518s">You've</a>  helped us to set the atmosphere for all we plan to do today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=332.545s">And</a>  now with official words of welcome from the West Medford Community Center, may I present Lisa M. Crossman, Executive Director, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=341.355s">Lisa</a>  has been with our organization for a few whirlwind years and has skillfully continued to transform our neighborhood home into the vital and dynamic heart of the traditional black community while embracing significant change and increasing diversity of an evolving neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=360.002s">Please</a>  show us some love.</p>

    <p>[Crossman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=372.409s">everybody</a>  all right so thank you all for coming today thank you special thanks to Terry Carter who pulled together an amazing program thank you thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=391.277s">We're</a>  so happy to have you all back again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=394.239s">For</a>  us at the West Medford Community Center, this is really our new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=399.263s">This</a>  really is the starting point for us to start fresh, to set new goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=405.008s">And</a>  as you know, with goals, it's about the journey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=407.41s">It's</a>  not about the destination. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=409.651s">Yes,</a>  it's not about the destination. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=411.073s">It's</a>  about our journey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=413.855s">So</a>  just some really quick housekeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=416.136s">If</a>  you could turn your cell phones to vibrate or turn them off, we would appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=421.04s">Bathrooms</a>  are right out this way, so whenever, please go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=427.367s">But</a>  I'd like to start off, but if everyone could just turn to their neighbor and say, I'm happy that you are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=436.316s">Okay,</a>  wait, wait, wait, now don't lie to him now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=439.78s">Now</a>  let's do this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=440.761s">I</a>  am happy <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=444.562s">that</a>  you are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=445.583s">Okay,</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=448.105s">So</a>  I won't take up much time, just really quickly, I had the opportunity to get online and do some training with the King Institute, where they discuss beloved community, and it's really about how you show up, how you show up as a person, showing up with peace, kindness, and love, and that we don't match the situation with the intensity of that situation, whether it's anger, whether it's sadness, whether it's anxiety, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=474.546s">that</a>  we hold true to that beloved form, that we be loved and we are loved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=481.769s">We</a>  allow ourselves to be loved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=484.171s">And</a>  so as we go forward in this year, we are really setting the tone with character and values and holding firm to that because <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=494.115s">We</a>  all agree we are all humankind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=496.157s">We</a>  are all here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=497.518s">We</a>  didn't do one thing to wake ourselves up and get here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=500.561s">And</a>  I think we all can agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=503.223s">And</a>  that is the starting point on which we will set off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=507.487s">And</a>  I have the pleasure to work with some children in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=511.991s">We</a>  have an after school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=513.492s">They</a>  are wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=514.794s">They</a>  are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=515.835s">But</a>  the one thing that I notice is that we can't communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=519.958s">We</a>  yell at each other, and it's not an anger. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=523.662s">We</a>  just don't know how to communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=525.644s">And</a>  I think, you know, being locked down with COVID and all the things that spun and turned, that these children have lost their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=535.433s">And</a>  with the climate we see on social media and <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=539.216s">on</a>  our television screens, it's the same way people don't communicate and that we really need to take ownership of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=545.658s">We</a>  really need to pull that back and we really need to set the tone for the children to show them how it is to communicate, how it is to listen to others, how it is to empathize with others. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=556.922s">And</a>  so today we are kicking off that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=561.463s">I'm</a>  not going to take up any more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=563.104s">It</a>  is a wonderful, dynamic show. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=565.585s">These</a>  are people who have mastered their craft, and I am so excited for you to see what we have for you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=573.049s">So</a>  with that, I would like to welcome Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn to come give the welcome for the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=589.639s">Thank</a>  you, Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=590.32s">Thank</a>  you, Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=592.061s">Good</a>  morning, everyone, and welcome to this celebration of Dr. King's life and legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=600.028s">I'm</a>  honored to be here today to honor his life with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=603.991s">Thank</a>  you to everyone who's made this wonderful event possible, the West Medford Community Center for organizing and running the event, especially Executive Director Lisa Crossman and Terry Carter, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=614.796s">Raphael's</a>  Parish for hosting, the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Director Francis Wojcicki, the Haywood Family Foundation, Medford Community Media, and Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=624.92s">And</a>  thanks to retired Special Officer Daryl Owens from the Boston Police Department for being here and to share some words with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=633.424s">Having</a>  the opportunity to talk openly about the challenges we face as a community, as well as the successes we've had crafting more meaningful relationships between one another, is a humbling experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=644.169s">And</a>  I'm grateful that we've been able to take this journey of equity and understanding together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=649.872s">Of</a>  course, there's much more work we have to do as a government to not only solidify trust with our community, but better serve people who historically have not had agency with those making the decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=661.798s">I'm</a>  thankful that we're changing that in Medford, and with the help of all of you, we've made such significant progress, but we're not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=669.767s">I'm</a>  looking forward to a wonderful event. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=673.632s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=685.982s">So</a>  much of what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=689.485s">did</a>  as a leading light for social justice and human rights was born out of his Christian upbringing and his life in the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=699.253s">The</a>  church had and still has stirring gospel music as its heart and soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=706.238s">Please</a>  embrace our own Stacey Clayton as she ministers in song with Dr. King's favorite traditional hymn, Precious Lord, Take My Hand.</p>

    <p>[Clayton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=724.243s">Good</a>  morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=724.903s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=740.146s">Precious</a>  Lord, take my hand, lead me on, and help me stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=757.761s">Because</a>  I am tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=775.213s">through</a>  the storm, through the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=786.281s">Precious</a>  Lord, lead me to the light. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=794.207s">Take</a>  my hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=799.091s">Precious</a>  Lord, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=813.53s">Precious</a>  Lord, you're the one that I built my life on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=828.959s">You're</a>  my rock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=832.281s">You're</a>  my hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=835.042s">You're</a>  my song. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=843.717s">You</a>  picked me up, made me strong when my way was all wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=862.93s">Here's</a>  my hand, precious love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=884.14s">When</a>  my way grows drear, precious Lord, linger near.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=920.826s">hear</a>  my cry hear my call take my hand lest I</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=942.546s">Take</a>  my hand Precious Lord Lead me home Take my hand Precious Lord <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=976.318s">home.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=999.164s">Thank</a>  you, Stacey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1001.265s">As</a>  always, you make music that brings us closer together as a human family with faith and hope to hold on to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1008.368s">Stacey</a>  was accompanied by my dear friend, Jonathan Fagan on the keys. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1015.811s">And</a>  you will hear from Jonathan a little bit more a little bit later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1021.167s">So</a>  Dr. King's leadership and his ability to connect with people brought tremendously talented, diverse, and passionate folks into the struggle for civil rights and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1035.062s">Three</a>  of those talented, diverse, and passionate folks were African American women, whose names are synonymous with the movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1044.431s">We</a>  are blessed today to once again have actress and theater professional Maya N. Cotter here with us today, all the way from Brooklyn, New York, to dramatize three semi-fictional letters of appreciation from Marian Wright Edelman, Maya Angelou, and Diane Nash Bevel to Dr. King. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1067.779s">The</a>  letters will glean from authentic words, impressions, and reflections of each writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1074.61s">We'll</a>  take a minute to set the stage, and then we present to you Maya and Carter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1142.108s">Dear</a>  Martin, I know how heavy your heart is right now, how tiring it must be to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, like an atlas shouldering the sky as all the gods of Olympus recoil from the ills and maladies and troubles of mere mortals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1162.981s">I'm</a>  again on my way to defend the children as I've been called upon by my maker to do in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1171.105s">I</a>  saw Bobby Kennedy in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1173.045s">I</a>  explained to him the sorrow and the burden and the longing that you too have for the poorest among our people, and particularly the poverty of so many of the babies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1187.211s">As</a>  I was set to leave, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1189.249s">He</a>  gave me a message for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1192.553s">He</a>  said something that I never expected a wealthy white politician from a Boston Brahmin family to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1200.743s">He</a>  told me to tell you to bring the poor to Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1205.809s">Nothing</a>  about the Ku Kluxers <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1208.152s">or</a>  Vietnam or the Freedom Riders or the lunch counters in Carolina and Richmond and Nashville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1214.936s">Perhaps</a>  his vision is clouded in ambition or ignorance or whimsy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1221.24s">Doesn't</a>  matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1222.921s">These</a>  are the words I know we both have been longing to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1228.331s">It's</a>  been pretty clear in 1966 and 1967 that you had to address the socioeconomic problems of black folks if political and civil rights were going to have meaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1241.443s">But</a>  you also knew that the tandem issues of hunger and poverty within our communities were killing our people as dead as church bombings and Klan nooses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1254.659s">We</a>  are surely kindred spirits in this recognition and its attendant dismay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1261.98s">Kennedy</a>  asked me how things were going in Mississippi and I told him how horrified I was at how slow everything seemed and how little progress had been made at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1271.947s">I</a>  knew that the country was preoccupied with the Vietnam War and that the government's money was going there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1278.411s">Johnson</a>  was so entrenched and so people were forgetting what was going on in these poor communities across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1286.696s">I</a>  shared my frustration with Robert Kennedy, and I told him I was going to see you, and he told me to tell you to bring the poor to Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1296.558s">Well,</a>  by this time, see, he was running for president and for the Democratic nomination, and I knew we needed to let the nation see the poor, to see their distress, and to see their needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1307.94s">So</a>  I became the willing trustee of this message to you, Dr. King. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1315.021s">Visiting</a>  with you, a modern-day atlas, in that modest office in Atlanta, that was the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1323.05s">And</a>  I knew you'd been there, sitting by yourself, and that you were constantly at your prodigious wits' end, trying to figure out the next step to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1334.884s">Like</a>  you, I too was depressed about what to do about the war and this poverty that engulfs us. <a

of child poverty in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1357.33s">And</a>  when I told you that Robert Kennedy said, bring the poor to Washington, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1363.572s">How</a>  your face lit up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1366.974s">Oh,</a>  I was transfixed by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1370.316s">You</a>  made me think that I was an angel delivering a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1375.999s">Yes,</a>  an angel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1379.281s">Ultimately,</a>  you chose to make war on poverty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1384.344s">Despite</a>  a lot of internal dissension and a lot of young bright minds that cried for different emphasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1392.25s">Now,</a>  your last Sunday sermon, you told your mother in Medford that you were going to preach on why America may go to hell if we don't share our richness, the blessings of our rich, our wealth, with all those who need the basic necessities of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1409.483s">You</a>  said, we're going to go to hell. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1412.666s">And</a>  you called for a poor people's campaign at a time when we had 11 million poor children in this country of so much wealth and promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1427.859s">I</a>  will forever salute you and be in your debt for the courage to love us so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1434.561s">I</a>  hope that in my life I will someday have the courage to love us this much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1443.425s">Yours</a>  in the struggle, Marian Wright Edelman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1475.71s">Dear</a>  Dr. King, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1479.065s">In</a>  1960, as a single mother and struggling actress, I accepted the position of Northern Coordinator for the New York office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1495.469s">It</a>  was in this capacity that I first met you, Dr. King. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1500.717s">Now,</a>  I only worked with the SCLC for six months, but you told me you were grateful for my contribution, particularly the contribution of several fundraising ventures. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1514.66s">My</a>  default position in describing most of the things that have tested my humanity in this life is writing and poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1526.926s">Please</a>  allow me to describe my admiration for you thusly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1533.996s">Your</a>  gratitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1536.94s">I</a>  was born into the village of strife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1541.218s">St.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1541.478s">Louis</a>  in 1928 wasn't Stone Mountain, Georgia, but it wasn't no paradise for the Negro either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1549.941s">My</a>  folks split up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1551.881s">My</a>  grandmama raised me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1554.562s">I</a>  had a baby of my own way too early. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1558.503s">I</a>  tried to raise him up in the way he should go, but boy children need strong, good men in their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1568.547s">They</a>  just do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1571.201s">New</a>  York called and I left to dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1574.142s">One</a>  desperate migration made way for another. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1578.362s">Porgy</a>  and Bess took me to the camps of the colonizers and to the comfort of the motherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1586.384s">By</a>  1960, I was familiar with American trials and American turbulence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1593.625s">But</a>  I heard you speak at a church in Harlem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1597.466s">Brother</a>  Martin, you captured my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1601.409s">You</a>  captured a lot of hearts in Harlem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1605.092s">You</a>  were yet another black renaissance, a renaissance for black folk, a glorious black prince out of Africa. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1613.378s">More</a>  than anything else, you compelled us to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1618.663s">To</a>  take what we had and what we knew and who we were and just do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1627.045s">With</a>  my good friend Godfrey, my something was the cabaret for freedom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1632.868s">I</a>  knew song and dance and how to entertain, and the black elite said, yes, my sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1642.212s">Sidney</a>  Poitier and Ozzie Davis and Ruby Dee and Lorraine Hansberry came out to see us dance and sing and entertain. <a

href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1659.6s">You</a>  said you were grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1662.681s">Now,</a>  I couldn't be Bayard Rustin at SCLC, but you compelled me to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1670.704s">I</a>  took what I had and what I knew and who I was and did something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1680.427s">I</a>  did my best to be useful, to show myself approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1685.353s">Meeting</a>  you face to face was monumental, if not magical. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1691.431s">You</a>  were shorter than I expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1693.212s">And</a>  so young. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1696.775s">You</a>  had an easy friendliness which was unsettling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1700.417s">And</a>  you were funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1702.178s">Really.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1703.779s">I</a>  couldn't stay long. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1705.58s">Just</a>  as St. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1706.441s">Louis</a>  ultimately became Harlem, Harlem must ultimately become the new thing and the next thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1713.846s">Change</a>  remains our only constant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1717.853s">In</a>  late 1960, I met my own South African freedom fighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1723.055s">My</a>  time to do something evolved into something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1729.117s">As</a>  I left the cocoon of SCLC, I wished you all a year of unlimited success, unlimited strides. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1738.721s">I</a>  joined with millions of black people all over the world saying, you are our leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1748.018s">We</a>  couldn't want for better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1750.719s">America</a>  couldn't want for better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1756.543s">Dr.</a>  Martin Luther King, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1759.264s">Fair</a>  winds and full sails forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1765.488s">Maya</a>  Angelou. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1778.792s">Dear</a>  Reverend Dr. King, in August 28th of 1963, when about 250,000 people streamed towards the Lincoln Memorial at the March on Washington and the hours before you'd given your magnificent I Have a Dream speech, I was invited to stand with five other women and be recognized on stage during an official tribute to Negro women and freedom fighters in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1801.958s">Me,</a>  Diane Nash Bevel, alongside Rosa Parks and Daisy Bates, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1809.145s">In</a>  the perfection of hindsight, I regret not being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1813.508s">James</a>  and I decided to watch the ceremony from our motel room in Birmingham, Alabama, eating room service in bed and just trying to rest up for the next big fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1824.416s">That</a>  morning in Birmingham, when people had started to assemble to get on the buses, James said to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1831.11s">Diane,</a>  you know, with everybody having left and gone to Washington, we could get some rest if we stayed here, which just sounded great to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1839.674s">We'd</a>  worked so hard recruiting people to get on the buses that we were exhausted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1845.637s">I</a>  didn't know that I was going to be recognized on stage, but we saw the moment on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1851.7s">That</a>  was such a weird feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1853.4s">I</a>  felt like reaching towards the television and saying, oh, I can't get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1860.089s">My</a>  first political awakening came in 1959 when I was a college student at Fisk University in Nashville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1868.957s">See,</a>  I wanted to come to the South to see what it was really like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1873.481s">And</a>  what I saw was eye-opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1876.103s">I</a>  couldn't get takeout at certain restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1878.666s">I</a>  couldn't even go to the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1880.627s">Now,</a>  I know I'm preaching to a preacher here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1883.61s">But</a>  very often, people think of segregation before our movement as the notion that you couldn't go into restaurants and that blacks had to ride at the back of buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1893.993s">But</a>  it was so much more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1896.794s">Even</a>  for us young college students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1899.675s">There</a>  were daily insults. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1901.796s">A</a>  white person could pass you and call you horrible things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1905.777s">And</a>  if you dared retaliate or say anything, you could be beaten. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1909.938s">or</a>  arrested or killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1911.578s">I</a>  just felt outraged when I was trying to learn new things, broaden my horizons. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1919.58s">I</a>  found segregation just the opposite, limiting, constricting, confining, insulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1928.102s">Every</a>  time I obeyed a segregation rule, I felt like I was agreeing that I was too inferior to use this facility or to go through a front door. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1939.366s">The</a>  change in me came through James Lawson's workshops on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1944.192s">He</a>  shared nonviolent movement techniques that he learned from Gandhi in India. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1950.5s">I</a>  took what I learned and became chairperson of the Student Central Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1955.666s">And</a>  we planned the 1960 sit-ins that led to Nashville becoming the first southern city to desegregate lunch counters and public facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1965.794s">Eventually,</a>  I co-founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1972.72s">My</a>  dear friend, John Lewis, was with me then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1976.663s">We</a>  thought we could make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1979.096s">Dr.</a>  King, I know you know all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1982.258s">You've</a>  been so gracious in your acknowledgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1985.399s">In</a>  1962, you said, I was the driving spirit in the nonviolent assault on segregation at lunch counters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=1995.804s">Our</a>  Freedom Riders were attacked in Alabama on May 14th in 1961. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2001.828s">I</a>  was one of those folks who decided that the Freedom Rides must continue, and one who organized transportation for members of the Nashville Student Central Committee to go to Alabama to finish the journey that those Freedom Riders started. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2017.717s">I</a>  wanted to prove that you can't stop a determined nonviolent movement by inflicting violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2025.762s">It</a>  was a lesson about the power of love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2031.026s">You</a>  taught me that truth, Dr. King, and I'm in debt for the lesson. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2037.938s">My</a>  involvement with your march on Washington began shortly after I was arrested for trying to finish the walk for justice started by white postal worker William Moore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2048.832s">His</a>  trek ended in Alabama when he was shot dead on April 23, 1963. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2056.849s">James</a>  came to drive me home to Birmingham after I got out of the jail, and he asked me what I thought of the idea of a national campout on the White House lawn to solidify and insist on the movement's goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2071.661s">I</a>  liked the idea and got started on a meeting to talk about it, inviting attendees, finding a location, and following up on the logistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2079.468s">Now,</a>  you came to that meeting, Dr. King, with some of your team when you left. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2084.972s">The</a>  notion of planning and organizing that march moved along with you, but I didn't feel left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2091.491s">I</a>  just wanted to see it come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2094.132s">I</a>  spread the word about the march in Birmingham at churches and at the bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2100.294s">The</a>  notion of receiving an award for my work in this movement at your monumental march on Washington was the furthest thing from my mind when James and I settled into our hotel room in late August. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2115.399s">Well,</a>  we'd worked so hard recruiting people to get on the buses and we were just exhausted indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2122.247s">Now,</a>  the movement has also shown me that a little rest from time to time is surely a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2131.624s">I</a>  pray that you will also have time to rest, Dr. King. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2137.046s">So</a>  much of our hopes and dreams depend on what you're teaching us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2143.328s">We</a>  will forever be in your debt for the lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=2149.97s">Yours,</a>  in service and sacrifice, Diane Nash Bevel.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6289.417s">You</a>  never think that it would take so long for people to grab a sandwich. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6294.242s">But</a>  a lot of folks in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6297.084s">And</a>  that's a beautiful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6298.946s">So</a>  hopefully everybody is having a little bit of a nosh and had a chance to talk a little bit amongst yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6306.633s">In</a>  a perfect world, what we would have done is we would have had <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6311.838s">a</a>  greater conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6313.881s">We</a>  would have had a recorder at each table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6315.963s">There</a>  was a notebook, notepad, and pen to write down some of the observations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6320.529s">And</a>  then we would even have had a report out or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6324.033s">But</a>  my sense of it is that we'd be here till 4 o'clock if we tried to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6328.579s">So</a>  we're gonna try and shoot for kind of 1.30-ish at this point, because we know that folks have schedules and things to do, but we're hoping that everybody's kind of in holiday mode, so that they've slowed things down a little bit, you know, and taking time to smell the flowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6350.113s">Those</a>  of you that got flowers, anybody that didn't get flowers, I'll hear about that later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6356.378s">But</a>  anyways, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6359.08s">We</a>  hope you get refreshed and that you're reflective. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6364.972s">We</a>  just want to take a little time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6374.13s">to</a>  thank you all for your openness and your participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6377.411s">I</a>  guess we recognize that these conversations are just kind of the tip of the iceberg of what we'd like to see across the city on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6386.673s">Our</a>  hope is that all of our community-based institutions can become greater and more effective incubators for dynamic communication, communion, and convening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6397.875s">That</a>  is certainly the intent of the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6405.543s">For</a>  me personally, the desire <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6409.764s">to</a>  be in communion with the folks around me underpins what I do as a poet and as a creative spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6419.59s">And</a>  I know for sure the same can be said for our next speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6424.973s">Vijaya</a>  Sundaram is Medford's second Poet Laureate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6428.776s">She</a>  assumed her duties in July of last year, right around the time she released her first volume of poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6436.38s">It's</a>  called Fractured Lens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6438.962s">Vijaya</a>  is also a professor of literature at Bunker Hill Community College. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6443.845s">She</a>  is also a mother and a wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6446.467s">She</a>  sings and composes music and she's a visual artist online as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6452.211s">Her</a>  drawings are fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6454.252s">Here</a>  to share her creativity with you ladies and gentlemen is my friend and fellow poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6484.008s">Thank</a>  you, Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6484.889s">Can</a>  you hear me properly? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6486.83s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6488.271s">Please</a>  feel free to raise a finger to let me, the forefinger, to let me know if you can't hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6496.597s">So</a>  I will respond accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6498.619s">Terry,</a>  it's an honor to follow Terry and in his footsteps and to have these amazing performers before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6505.424s">So</a>  thank you for having me here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6507.405s">And</a>  this is my first time at this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6510.227s">So</a>  I'm really grateful to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6513.294s">Terry</a>  told me that the theme was the beloved country, so I had to write a poem for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6521.693s">I</a>  have to admit, I struggled a little bit with it, because I've never written a poem about a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6527.634s">And</a>  this was my first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6529.295s">I</a>  finished it on Saturday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6532.656s">But</a>  I promise you, I put my heart and soul into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6535.256s">And</a>  before that, I thought the song that I would like to sing is not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6539.397s">Obviously,</a>  when you hear it, you'll know it's not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6541.738s">It's</a>  by Mongo Santa Maria, and it's Afro Blue, because the beloved country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6551.843s">dream</a>  of the land my soul is from I hear a hand stroke on a drum shades of delight <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6567.662s">Cocoa</a>  hues, rich as the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6574.246s">Afro</a>  blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6580.59s">Elegant</a>  boy, beautiful girl. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6586.654s">Dancing</a>  for joy Elegant world Shades of delight Cocoa hue Rich as the night Afro blue Two young lovers are face to face With undulating grace <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6614.671s">They</a>  gently sway then slip away to some secluded place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6623.153s">Shades</a>  of delight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6626.314s">Cocoa</a>  hue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6629.495s">Rich</a>  as the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6632.776s">Afro</a>  blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6637.938s">And</a>  that's it for Mongo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6642.099s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6647.717s">So</a>  I call this the dreamland. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6656.223s">There</a>  was once a dreamer who had a dream in whom the song of all the forebears flowed unbounded in a visionary stream. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6666.86s">He</a>  spoke of the promised land undeterred, the shining mountaintop to which he had been. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6673.465s">He</a>  spoke aloud and claimed the dream deferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6677.448s">This</a>  land, this country that's been ruled by might, he strove for it for us, for those to come, to tilt the balance in the cause of right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6688.616s">He</a>  strove, he spoke, and passed a weary spell, while clubs and tear gas tried to hold him back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6696.079s">I</a>  may not get there, were his words, a knell. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6700.46s">The</a>  dream lived on beyond that fateful year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6703.661s">The</a>  bridge held, while the ranks of marchers swelled, and pushed aside the bigotry and fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6710.785s">What</a>  makes us reach together for a goal while the chasm widens beneath our feet? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6716.789s">We</a>  seek to build a bridge to make us whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6721.211s">But</a>  bridges take a while to build and cross, so some leap into currents, fearing not, for time is short and fears are albatross. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6732.472s">What</a>  currents do we have to swim to brave the hatred that erodes our conjoint work? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6738.599s">On</a>  rafts of hope, some ride the swelling wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6742.963s">Brothers,</a>  sisters rail against each other, brown and black and beige and white and pale, forgetting that we are born of earth, our mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6753.874s">This</a>  dream for which we're marching is the grail so far away, and yet we see its form. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6761.084s">And</a>  so, through wind and storm, we shall prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6765.29s">We'll</a>  hold each other's hands in loving trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6770.097s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6786.98s">Vijaya,</a>  we are different, but we are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6792.485s">Thank</a>  you for that wonderful mix of sound and spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6796.229s">We're</a>  so happy to have you here with us today, and we look forward to all that you will continue to do as Medford's second ever Poet Laureate and a great resource for the arts in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6815.888s">So</a>  we thought long and hard about what we wanted a guest speaker to bring to our audience today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6822.335s">we</a>  came to the conclusion that there are so many entities that help the public navigate on this journey to beloved community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6831.379s">And</a>  while some of these entities may occasionally seem to delay, deny, or obstruct some of what happens as we make our way toward King's ideal, Dr. King himself knew that we have to have effective partnerships with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6849.446s">This</a>  is particularly true of law enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6853.17s">In</a>  his 13 years as a civil rights leader, Dr. King was arrested 30 times, largely for misdemeanors or civil protest violations, so his experience with the police must have been at least troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6869.255s">Nonetheless,</a>  he maintained that the police had to be included as part of the solution to the civil rights question, even while it frequently cast itself as part of the problem itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6882.265s">That</a>  recognition informed the decision to have a perspective of law enforcement as part of today's conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6890.256s">Therefore,</a>  if you have any skepticism or disbelief, I ask you to temporarily suspend and have a good listen to this afternoon's keynote address. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6903.724s">Okay,</a>  another bit of full disclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6906.366s">I</a>  have yet again prevailed upon a family member to help us with today's celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6915.643s">Darrell</a>  W. Owens retired on March 17th, 2023 after 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6921.988s">He</a>  only looks like he's 34, it's too funny, with the Boston Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6927.413s">He</a>  spent the majority of his police career at the BPD Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6931.796s">There</a>  he specialized in defensive tactics, use of force and de-escalation, while at the academy he trained over 2,000 police officers and a total of 30 recruit classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6946.397s">Daryl</a>  is the founder and director of the Boston Police Teen Academy, a summer job and outreach program that connects police officers with at-risk youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6958.22s">His</a>  use of force expertise has been honed through hundreds of hours of training, personal research, and consultation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6966.423s">He</a>  has trained with the FBI, the Police Executive Research Forum, and the Force Science Institute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6974.005s">One</a>  of his passions is teaching the concepts of constitutional police practices to varied civilian audiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6982.427s">Darryl</a>  is a nephew of the late Massachusetts State Senator William Bill Owens and former State Representative Shirley Owens-Hicks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=6992.39s">Like</a>  so many of his siblings, cousins, and friends, he grew up in the politics of race and reconciliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7000.257s">He</a>  brings that recognition to his evolving professional life beyond his three decades of work with BBT. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7008.424s">He</a>  has a beautiful wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7009.705s">Her</a>  name is Barbara. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7010.645s">He</a>  has lovely daughters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7013.208s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen, my esteemed cousin, my brother in Christ, and my friend, Darryl W. Owens.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7036.448s">All</a>  right, thank you and hello everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7039.629s">It's</a>  been great to be here so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7043.551s">I</a>  am really honored to be invited here to speak on this day, to think about and to reflect on the life and legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7057.598s">It</a>  is enormous to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7060.019s">I</a>  can't quite put it in words, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7063.72s">how</a>  big it is for me to be able to come before you and speak to you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7070.326s">You</a>  know, the one thing that I'm really grateful for in the legacy of Dr. King is that all throughout today and all throughout next month, we can actually hear the man's voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7085.575s">Technology</a>  was at a place, it wasn't where it is in 2024 of course, but it was at a place during his lifetime that we could actually hear his words from his voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7097.9s">And</a>  so people who weren't even on the earth when he lived get to hear his actual voice, his actual words. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7108.825s">But</a>  you know something that's amazing about Dr. King is that his actions, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7115.697s">were</a>  greater than his words. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7118.639s">And</a>  I don't know about you, but I want to be like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7123.263s">I</a>  am 58 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7124.764s">I'm</a>  recently retired from the Boston Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7129.208s">And</a>  I want to have a life of impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7133.371s">I</a>  want to live a life of impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7135.472s">You</a>  heard it in my introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7136.774s">I</a>  won't bore you with any more of the facts, but I love <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7141.482s">the</a>  topics that I've come to teach at the Boston Police Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7144.623s">I'm</a>  a true teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7147.104s">I</a>  teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7148.385s">That's</a>  what I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7149.445s">I</a>  actually don't talk a lot unless I'm teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7153.687s">I'm</a>  actually a quiet person, quiet and some might even say shy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7159.13s">But</a>  when I have something to teach, I talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7163.314s">I'm</a>  much better standing here in front of a group of 100 or so people than I am mingling at a party. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7169.318s">And</a>  if you don't believe me, ask my cousins. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7172.861s">There's</a>  a few of them sprinkled around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7175.502s">I'm</a>  just not a very good mingler. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7177.123s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7178.945s">But</a>  I am a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7180.346s">I</a>  loved teaching police use of force. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7183.848s">I</a>  passionately loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7187.35s">And</a>  I've been involved in several places around the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7193.28s">teaching</a>  police use of force. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7195.542s">Right</a>  now, I am the use of force subject matter expert for Ferguson, Missouri. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7202.169s">That</a>  department has signed a consent decree and a bunch of civilians, me included, went down there and we helped them to restructure their police use of force. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7214.742s">I</a>  am very proud of that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7222.418s">And</a>  you know, I've been on both sides of this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7227.28s">It's</a>  funny, when you're the person who is the use of force subject matter expert, and people see you, they want to kind of dictate how it's going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7239.485s">Let</a>  me explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7240.926s">I</a>  can get kicked out of both cookouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7242.346s">I</a>  can get kicked out of two cookouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7245.828s">I</a>  can seriously get kicked out of the police cookout. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7250.899s">Because</a>  we might be hanging around the burgers and someone might say, hey, Darryl, what do you think about this issue that happened in this city at this time to that black person? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7264.872s">And</a>  I might say, well, that cop was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7268.215s">And</a>  here's how I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7271.257s">I've</a>  already studied it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7273.499s">I</a>  took six hours to read about it and watch the videos and read the reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7278.186s">And</a>  here's what I think, and that cop was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7282.447s">And</a>  then at the cop cookout, somebody might say, do you want that burger wrapped in foil? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7289.409s">Means,</a>  you got to go, bruh. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7293.41s">At</a>  the family cookout, I can get kicked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7298.912s">Same</a>  thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7300.779s">Hey,</a>  Darryl, what do you think about this particular use of force that happened to this black person in this city at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7313.382s">And</a>  my answer might be, this is going to be a hard truth for you, cousin, dear cousin, but this particular use of force <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7325.219s">was</a>  the only reasonable response that that police officer could have arrived at at that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7334.703s">Now</a>  maybe there's some ribs and chicken at the family cookout, but nonetheless, would you like your plate to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7345.627s">And</a>  I can live with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7348.167s">I'm</a>  pleased with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7350.731s">Because</a>  one of the statements that I reiterate to myself all the time when I'm going into these conversations is that the truth has no friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7361.298s">The</a>  truth does not have a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7363.92s">It</a>  is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7364.761s">It's</a>  a straight line most of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7369.104s">What</a>  complicates those truths in this country is implicit bias. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7377.47s">It</a>  really complicates things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7380.572s">And</a>  I don't want to go too much into this, but the devaluing of black and brown bodies in this country is epidemic and historic, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7396.176s">I</a>  don't want to go too much into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7397.977s">I</a>  do want to teach you something, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7399.797s">You</a>  ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7401.358s">OK,</a>  so I'm going to give you a two-minute lesson in de-escalation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7407.435s">I</a>  want you to use your imagination first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7409.496s">I'm</a>  going to get some water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7410.256s">Is</a>  that OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7410.536s">Got</a>  to lubricate the instrument, as my table neighbor just told me a few minutes ago, a voice teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7424.662s">So</a>  here's my quick two-minute de-escalation lesson. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7428.644s">Use</a>  your imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7430.344s">Imagine</a>  you're on one of those game shows, like a minute-to-win-it game show, and you're the contestant in the phone booth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7438.393s">where</a>  in a couple of seconds dollar bills are going to fly up from the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7443.794s">And</a>  what's your job? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7445.935s">To</a>  get as many as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7448.595s">Are</a>  you going to be able to get all of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7451.216s">Are</a>  you going to be able to dictate which ones you grab? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7454.316s">No,</a>  you're just going to grab as many as possible so you can come out of the phone booth with something of value, yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7461.858s">The</a>  de-escalation conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7465.532s">You</a>  are talking to someone who is agitated, angry, frustrated, for real good reasons or reasons you don't even understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7479.063s">And</a>  everything they say comes out hard and fast and almost assaultive and almost offensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7489.07s">They're</a>  not controlling their tone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7491.991s">They're</a>  not being delicate and kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7494.753s">They're</a>  just firing words at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7499.215s">The</a>  de-escalation listener is just like the phone booth contestant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7505.219s">In</a>  that environment of loudness and emotion and angst, they're trying to grab as many truths as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7516.185s">And</a>  then when they come out of that environment with something of value, they can say, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7522.375s">I</a>  can see that you're very upset about this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7528.358s">That's</a>  de-escalation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7530.759s">I'm</a>  going to give it some real flesh and bones now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7535.081s">Terry</a>  mentioned that I'm the founder of the Boston Teen Police Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7540.244s">It</a>  is my great joy and pleasure and honor to lead that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7547.007s">I'll</a>  tell you the beginning story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7550.609s">In</a>  2010, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7553.293s">Because</a>  I did karate since I was nine years old, I needed double hip replacement surgery. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7561.096s">I</a>  went to the hospital, I got my hips done, and it was intense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7566.298s">Maybe</a>  some of you can relate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7568.599s">It</a>  was intense, and I can remember, I was only 45 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7573.51s">And</a>  the doctor came in, and he said, hey, Mr. Owens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7577.631s">I</a>  said, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7578.131s">He</a>  said, you're going to be feeling better than you have in 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7582.533s">In</a>  a few days, I want you to do something amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7588.135s">And</a>  at first, I was like, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7591.056s">Who</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7592.236s">Like,</a>  who are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7594.137s">You</a>  ain't my preacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7595.297s">You</a>  ain't, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7598.178s">I</a>  was a little bit offended. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7600.059s">And</a>  then I went back to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7601.872s">And</a>  I was on light duty, I couldn't go out in the street, I couldn't do anything but I was working in the academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7606.697s">Now</a>  at this time I was halfway through my career as an academy instructor, so I had a few classes of officers under me who really loved and respected me because I was really hard on them when they were in the academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7621.598s">So</a>  they called me up, two cops called me up, and they said, hey, we have a young kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7626.642s">He</a>  has a lot of potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7628.383s">He's</a>  kind of falling in with the wrong group. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7630.945s">Can</a>  we bring him in and you give him a little tour and tell him what you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7634.727s">Because</a>  he doesn't think that there's anybody that looks like him that has a role of influence in the Boston Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7641.772s">I</a>  said, sure, bring him in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7643.834s">He</a>  came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7645.635s">And</a>  right away, I don't know if you've ever done this, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7649.639s">But</a>  right away, I loved this kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7652.441s">Right</a>  away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7653.862s">But</a>  not for, I loved him because he was just so edgy and tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7660.166s">But</a>  I could see that there was softness there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7663.328s">Anyway,</a>  he had, well, one of my pet peeves at the time, no longer, but at the time, I had a pet peeve about young men wearing their pants really low. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7674.555s">Full</a>  disclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7676.855s">Once</a>  you're 58, that happens to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7679.637s">So</a>  I don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7682.879s">I'm</a>  not offended by that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7685.381s">It's</a>  all good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7685.961s">It's</a>  normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7687.202s">But</a>  back then, it wasn't normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7691.685s">So</a>  these two police officers knew that I had that pet peeve, and he had adjusted his pants thusly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7701.953s">So</a>  I said, hey, man, can you do me a favor and pull those up? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7706.067s">And</a>  he was like, I'm not here to get advice on how I wear my clothes from you, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7711.23s">And</a>  I just thought, word, I like this kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7715.333s">They</a>  didn't think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7716.594s">The</a>  two officers that brought him in didn't think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7719.636s">And</a>  so one of them kind of gently put their hand on his elbow, came up from behind the young man, put his hand on his elbow, and said, hey, come over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7731.524s">Let</a>  me talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7733.485s">And</a>  this young man, what do you think he did? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7736.616s">Get</a>  your hand off me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7739.257s">Don't</a>  be touching me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7740.418s">I</a>  didn't come here for you to put your hands all over me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7744.739s">And</a>  I saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7746.18s">The</a>  officer was going to respond in kind, and it was going to be a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7752.282s">You</a>  know what a situation is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7756.824s">It</a>  was going to be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7758.865s">And</a>  I said, stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7760.686s">Stop.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7761.686s">We</a>  were in the gymnasium at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7764.656s">I</a>  said, do you guys, do you two wanna go get some coffee or something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7768.84s">There's</a>  a coffee machine in my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7770.381s">Why</a>  don't you guys go and make yourself a cup? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7772.783s">Yeah,</a>  why don't you go do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7777.367s">I'm</a>  gonna stay here and talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7781.01s">So</a>  we talked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7782.971s">Initially,</a>  it was all attitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7787.395s">I'm</a>  still like, word, I like this kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7789.196s">I</a>  do, I like this kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7792.756s">They</a>  wanted to make him do push-ups. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7794.337s">They</a>  thought I was going to make him do push-ups and yell at him and tell him off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7799.22s">But</a>  I said, hey, sit down on that bench over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7801.341s">I'm</a>  going to sit down on this bench over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7802.902s">And</a>  I'm going to tell you about myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7806.524s">Do</a>  you know why you're here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7809.125s">And</a>  he said, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7809.925s">I</a>  said, I happen to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7812.167s">I</a>  happen to know that your father was taken to prison when you were very young. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7816.689s">Guess</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7817.67s">My</a>  father was taken to prison when I was very young. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7821.795s">I</a>  happen to know that your father passed away soon after he went away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7827.077s">Guess</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7828.137s">My</a>  father passed away soon after he went away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7832.798s">I</a>  happen to know that you do pretty well at school, but you're not at the age right now where it's really cool to let other people know in your neighborhood that you're doing well at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7846.431s">When</a>  I was your age, I was doing pretty well at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7849.876s">But</a>  it was not cool to let people know in my neighborhood that I was doing pretty well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7854.922s">And</a>  he was like, we're the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7857.325s">And</a>  I said, we're the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7863.273s">We're</a>  the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7865.171s">And</a>  we just started talking and laughing and talking about sneakers and talking about the girls he liked and talking about what he wanted to do in his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7876.816s">And</a>  we became friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7882.318s">That</a>  relationship didn't last a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7886.359s">But</a>  do you see what I did? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7889.141s">I</a>  was in the phone booth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7891.862s">I</a>  was right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7894.656s">And</a>  I realized that he didn't want that police officer coming up from behind him and touching him because that was traumatic for him in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7907.547s">And</a>  so I related to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7910.689s">And</a>  he realized, I didn't tell him this because it would have been totally weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7914.913s">I</a>  didn't say, I love you, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7916.774s">But</a>  I think he realized through the connection that I did that I cared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7925.66s">that</a>  my heart was open to him, that I wanted his heart to be open to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7933.085s">And</a>  so after they left, I said, I'm going to call my wife and tell her about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7943.912s">And</a>  I called her, and she said, maybe this is what your doctor was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7950.066s">And</a>  I said, you know what, I'm going to try to form an organization to bring kids like him into the police academy so they can, I don't even know what I'm going to do with them, but I just want them to experience me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7962.338s">Does</a>  that sound weird? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7964.28s">I</a>  said, I just want them to meet me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7966.842s">I</a>  just want them to see that I am the one who's training the police that go out to interact with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7976.303s">I</a>  want them to see that I come from damage and trauma and heartbreak and heartache and I'm here and I'm doing something to give back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7986.269s">I</a>  want them to see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7987.47s">So</a>  it started off very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7990.592s">It</a>  was like a three week program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7992.879s">And</a>  I did things like teach them how to tie a necktie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7994.741s">It</a>  was all boys initially. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=7996.482s">Taught</a>  them how to tie a necktie, something I didn't learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8000.085s">Taught</a>  them how to catch a baseball and a mitt, something I didn't learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8005.11s">I</a>  didn't have a father to play catch with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8007.832s">Taught</a>  them how to order their food at a restaurant, something I didn't learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8012.336s">I</a>  didn't grow up with a father. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8016.308s">And</a>  the program grew and grew and grew. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8020.309s">And</a>  now it's a six week long summer program where they are getting paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8027.652s">One</a>  of my kids right now, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8032.533s">One</a>  of my kids right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8035.063s">is</a>  in Wentworth Institute, a junior in Wentworth Institute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8040.607s">She</a>  should be a sophomore, but she took classes right out of the Teen Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8045.931s">She</a>  went and took classes at Roxbury Community College and got herself into Wentworth Institute on a higher level and is gonna be finished in less than a year with her training as a software engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8064.244s">I'm</a>  not there to make cops, although that has been a benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8068.307s">I've</a>  gotten a few kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8069.949s">About</a>  10 of them have become police officers thus far in the last 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8074.853s">But</a>  my main goal is to give them a pathway to success. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8080.097s">I</a>  loved my profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8083.499s">I</a>  was sobered by the power that I had as a member of my profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8091.07s">I</a>  was and am concerned about my profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8097.254s">As</a>  you well know, the history of policing and black and brown people are deeply intertwined in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8107.881s">Some</a>  of the foundational principles of forming modern policing is to control black and brown populations in major cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8117.548s">Control.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8119.662s">subjugation,</a>  oppression. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8123.443s">Those</a>  were some of the initial goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8127.665s">But</a>  now times have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8129.666s">Because</a>  of work of great people like Dr. King and because of modern efforts like the public outcry and the police killings that have happened in the last five or 10 years, things are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8145.512s">There</a>  is a nationwide movement for police reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8150.529s">One</a>  of the things that Terry asked me to speak about was, how can we make things better? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8159.475s">He</a>  said it differently than that, but what I read was, how can we make things better? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8164.959s">Fortunately,</a>  things are beginning to get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8169.863s">The</a>  departments that I've interacted with closely all over the country, I can't even name all of them because I signed agreements that I won't disclose who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8181.121s">but</a>  I've seen them do some of the following 10 things to make things better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8188.246s">One,</a>  screen candidates for implicit bias and aggression. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8195.27s">Two,</a>  train candidates in de-escalation, recognition of mental illness and neurodivergence, and also implicit bias. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8208.086s">Teach</a>  people that their biases exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8216.452s">Number</a>  three, conduct regular training audits to combat complacency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8224.038s">Because</a>  as we change, so does police training need to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8230.763s">Four,</a>  create a training environment that supports and encourages cultural curiosity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8239.602s">That</a>  means to have an intentionally diverse training staff, not a bunch of people who look just alike, who are eating the same things, who are wearing the same things, and live in the same neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8251.949s">That's</a>  not going to train your police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8256.571s">14</a>  Chevy Tahoes in the parking lot is not going to train your police force. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8260.613s">Get</a>  some Priuses in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8264.761s">That's</a>  a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8266.162s">That</a>  was a funny joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8267.302s">If</a>  you were a cop, it's a funny joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8269.944s">Right,</a>  sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8270.784s">That's</a>  a good one if you're a cop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8272.965s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8273.786s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8275.406s">True</a>  transparency in internal investigations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8280.829s">Letting</a>  complainants know the progress of the actual investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8286.772s">Letting</a>  the public know the progress of the actual investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8290.634s">This</a>  is happening around the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8293.888s">foster</a>  a police culture that embraces accountability rather than fears it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8301.431s">One</a>  of the things that I've done to kind of get my way back into that cop cookout is to explain to them that high accountability is good if you are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8314.516s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8320.029s">Use</a>  technology such as body-worn cameras to enhance accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8325.351s">This</a>  has been a big boon for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8328.272s">My</a>  laptop at home has so many body cam videos that I could probably sell it for big money to a news outlet, but I'm not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8340.636s">Center</a>  your department identity around the concept of community policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8351.044s">And</a>  finally, help officers to understand it's to their benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8358.83s">To</a>  have these kind of concepts accepted by officers throughout the departments, we must teach that this approach is good for the public and for the police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8373.161s">It's</a>  a difficult job at times, and there's no getting around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8380.222s">I</a>  mean, I could stand here and tell you some war stories about my worst days on the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8392.249s">But</a>  I won't, because you're not ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8396.812s">Only</a>  my therapist is ready for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8399.614s">And</a>  that's for real, real. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8401.915s">I</a>  got one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8403.156s">I</a>  need one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8404.377s">And</a>  I say, hallelujah, amen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8414.591s">Having</a>  an appropriate value for the concepts of supportiveness, teamwork, empathy, and care enables officers to better cope with the inevitable stress that goes with the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8433.305s">Empathy</a>  and compassion are the two key ingredients that enabled me to serve for 34 years and to leave that job loving that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8445.674s">because</a>  I exercised empathy and compassion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8450.896s">I'm</a>  very grateful for my experience, and I want to continue to use my life for good and for impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8462.101s">I'm</a>  very thankful for you for listening to me today, but like Dr. King's short life, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8471.488s">I</a>  want my actions to speak louder than these few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8475.771s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8499.029s">For</a>  the vertically challenged, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8504.274s">Thank</a>  you so much, Brother Cousin. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8507.176s">You</a>  clearly understood the assignment and we're so glad that you agreed to join us today as we reflect upon our own journeys to beloved community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8518.862s">Okay,</a>  so we're getting close to the close of our program and no such gathering would be complete if we didn't link arms and sing together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8528.426s">So</a>  here to present <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8532.136s">and</a>  lead us in the Black National Anthem, lift every voice and sing, is the voice of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8537.798s">I</a>  call her the voice of the city, Stacey Clayton, accompanied once again by my good friend, pianist Jonathan Fagan.</p>

    <p>[Clayton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8552.202s">Please</a>  stand if you're able. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8555.783s">You're</a>  welcome to sit if not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8558.704s">And</a>  sing out loud, we'll hear you.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8812.239s">So</a>  thank you, Stacey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8814.521s">Thank</a>  you, Jonathan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8815.761s">So</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8817.082s">So</a>  just wanted you to know that on Saturday, February 17, in concert at Somerville Community Baptist Church will be Stacey and her community choir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8830.171s">They</a>  do it every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8831.732s">It's</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8832.432s">I've</a>  had an opportunity to participate on several occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8836.975s">The</a>  time is to be determined, but in the late afternoon, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8840.157s">So</a>  if you're free on February 17th, Somerville Community Baptist Church, Stacey Clayton and her wonderful community choir will be celebrating Black History Month in song and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8864.367s">So</a>  from one rousing tradition to another, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8869.881s">I</a>  would like to bring Reverend Wendy Miller Olapade, the pastor of Sanctuary United Church of Christ to the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8878.207s">Reverend</a>  Wendy will deliver our challenge and our charge as we leave this gathering to continue on this kindred journey to beloved community in Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8889.134s">Reverend</a>  Wendy.</p>

    <p>[Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8889.754s">Just</a>  leave it on the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8897.279s">Just</a>  leave it on the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8909.357s">I</a>  gotta tell you, I'm really anxious. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8911.939s">I've</a>  been anxious all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8913.359s">I</a>  feel really honored, really, really honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8918.942s">You're</a>  not hearing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8920.203s">I</a>  feel really, really honored to have been invited to do this, to do this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8926.786s">When</a>  Terry asked me a couple of weeks ago, I said, Terry, do you really want an old white lady doing the charge of the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8937.173s">And</a>  you know what he said? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8938.137s">I</a>  want this old white lady to do the charge to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8950.842s">And</a>  I'm standing here underneath this image that has been staring at me all morning, feeling the responsibility of this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8963.252s">So</a>  can I ask you to just sort of extend your hands up this way and give me a little of your positive energy, because I'm just so anxious. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8973.191s">I've</a>  been doing this for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8974.833s">You'd</a>  think I'd know how to do this without, you know, a script and anxiety, but it is so important for us to gather in moments like this, to be community in the ways that King asked us to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8991.187s">And</a>  so you can put your hands down, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8993.089s">I</a>  wish that that moved all that energy out, but it didn't, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=8997.153s">I'll</a>  start talking and it'll go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9000.939s">I</a>  got to thinking this morning about what beloved community would look like as envisioned by Martin and Coretta and the King Center and so many others who aspired to make it so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9013.734s">Can</a>  you hear me all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9018.837s">There</a>  would be racial harmony and diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9022.299s">A</a>  society that truly embraces the idea of the beloved community actively promotes racial harmony and celebrates diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9032.484s">This</a>  would be evident in integrated communities and schools and workplaces where people of all races and religions and perspectives and ethnicities actually interact with each other respectfully and with equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9048.729s">There</a>  would be economic justice and equity, Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9052.472s">Is</a>  Steve still here back there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9054.253s">Economic</a>  disparities would be addressed through fair policies and practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9059.417s">And</a>  that includes equal opportunities in education and employment and housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9064.661s">It</a>  also means providing support for those in poverty and working towards a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9073.328s">There</a>  would be nonviolent conflict resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9077.732s">In</a>  the beloved community, conflicts, whether interpersonal or international, are resolved through nonviolent means. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9085.698s">This</a>  approach involves dialogue and empathy and understanding and compassion, Owen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9093.726s">it</a>  would involve a commitment to finding mutually beneficial solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9098.607s">There</a>  would be community engagement and participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9102.808s">Active</a>  community involvement is a key feature of Beloved Community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9107.63s">People</a>  are encouraged to participate in civic life and contribute to decision-making processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9113.591s">This</a>  could manifest in local community meetings, Erin Olapade, participating in government models and volunteerism. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9123.254s">There</a>  would be education and moral development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9126.937s">Our</a>  systems in a beloved community wouldn't focus just on academic achievement, but also on moral and ethical development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9135.364s">They</a>  would teach those values that our speaker spoke of, like empathy and social justice and community service, preparing everybody to contribute positively to society. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9147.333s">There</a>  would be access to health care and social services, and that would be universal, ensuring that all members of the community have the support that they need to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9160.78s">We</a>  would steward the environment, yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9164.262s">A</a>  beloved community recognizes the importance of protecting the Earth and her environments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9169.585s">There</a>  would be sustainable practices and policies would become the norm, reflecting a deep respect for the planet and future generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9177.969s">There</a>  would be global solidarity and peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9181.751s">The</a>  principles of the beloved community extend beyond Medford, extend beyond the United States, promoting global solidarity, global peace, global cooperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9193.437s">Efforts</a>  to address global issues like poverty and climate change and conflict would be grounded in the principles of justice and nonviolence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9203.442s">There</a>  would be cultural and spiritual enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9207.444s">A</a>  rich cultural life that celebrates diversity and fosters spiritual growth would be integral. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9214.267s">This</a>  might include community events like this one and arts programs and spaces for spiritual reflection and connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9222.551s">And</a>  we would practice restorative justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9226.933s">Instead</a>  of punitive justice systems, a beloved community would focus on restorative justice, seeking to heal and rebuild relationships rather than simply punish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9238.239s">So</a>  tell me, are we there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9241.66s">No,</a>  we are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9243.126s">Do</a>  we have a society, a city, a faith community, or even a neighborhood that's deeply rooted in justice, equity, love, and respect for all its members, where every individual has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to the common good? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9257.994s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9258.894s">No,</a>  we do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9259.835s">Do</a>  you want beloved community? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9263.356s">Let</a>  me hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9264.117s">Do</a>  you want to help make it so? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9266.898s">Then</a>  I invite you today, I charge you to join me and people around the world to make the pledge, as Lisa talked about, to be love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9278.009s">Lisa</a>  mentioned it at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9279.49s">Have</a>  some of you already done this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9282.233s">Yes?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9282.954s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9283.614s">Stand</a>  up if you've done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9285.076s">Help</a>  me to lead this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9287.412s">Be</a>  Love is a movement that's been born amidst the immense uncertainty and global tension of the past couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9296.319s">And</a>  it's grounded in the iconic words of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who in his notable and inspirational writing, Where Do We Go From Here, Chaos or Community, professed that power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9317.085s">Justice</a>  at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9325.37s">Do</a>  you need to hear that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9327.151s">Power</a>  at its best is love implementing the demands of justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9332.994s">And</a>  justice at its best is love correcting everything, everything that stands against love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9342.92s">But</a>  friends, it is not enough to say that you want beloved community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9347.203s">And</a>  it's not enough to say that you want to be love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9350.384s">We</a>  must make love and justice real. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9354.588s">we</a>  must live it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9356.789s">In</a>  order to be the kind of love that implements the demands of justice, in order to be the kind of love that corrects everything that stands against love, in order to be the kind of love that practices beloved community, we must practice what informs King's call to become beloved community, and that is nonviolence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9378.115s">a</a>  powerful, practical approach to dealing with conflict and dismantling injustice in every aspect of our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9386.582s">Nonviolence</a>  is a practice that can be used in our personal lives, our schools, our workplaces, our local community, and in national and global movements. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9396.489s">It</a>  is a love-centered way of thinking, speaking, engaging, and acting that leads to personal, cultural, and societal transformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9406.116s">And</a>  by the way, the Kingian philosophy called Nonviolence 365, that's what Lisa was talking about, is available online for anybody to watch and learn from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9416.961s">And</a>  so today, I charge you to be love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9421.742s">To</a>  do so, we need to acknowledge three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9425.284s">The</a>  violence, oppression, inequity, injustice, and hate in our world has to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9431.106s">Can</a>  you say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9432.247s">Stop.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9433.857s">We</a>  have a responsibility and a role to play in creating social change for a more just, humane, equitable, and peaceful world. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9442.789s">And</a>  the decision is ours whether or not to do something in this moment to have the courage to stand up for justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9451.099s">So</a>  I charge you to make your own decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9453.541s">Starting</a>  today, make a personal choice to be love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9458.125s">Pledge</a>  to allow love to drive your thoughts, words, decisions, and actions, and honor the humanity of every individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9466.733s">Pledge</a>  to speak the truth to power in love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9471.176s">Pledge</a>  to focus on defeating injustice and not destroying a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9476.659s">Pledge</a>  to support leaders who demonstrate a love for humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9480.201s">That</a>  means vote, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9482.142s">Pledge</a>  to promote unity and refuse to perpetuate or magnify division, and pledge to demonstrate a life of courage, care, and compassion as you boldly confront anything that stands in opposition to love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9499.711s">Make</a>  this your pledge here, now, today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9503.774s">Be</a>  love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9505.135s">Live</a>  out love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9506.475s">Make</a>  love and justice real. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9509.237s">Go</a>  to the kingcenter.org website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9512.599s">It's</a>  easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9513.22s">All</a>  you have to do is Google be love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9515.341s">You'll</a>  get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9516.662s">Yeah?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9518.041s">Go</a>  to the website, sign the pledge, go to the website, sign up for the training, and be love in the world, because there isn't anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9529.841s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9545.633s">If</a>  you give a preacher a mic, she will do exactly as she is warranted to do by the universe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9556.141s">She</a>  will preach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9558.382s">So</a>  thank you, Sister Pastor, for those stirring and heartfelt words of challenge and conviction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9564.987s">You</a>  have given us both food and fuel for the days ahead, and we're going to need it because being love isn't easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9573.891s">Well,</a>  Medford, that's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9576.993s">We've</a>  discussed, we've dined, we've danced, we've sang, we've listened, and we've learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9582.637s">I</a>  believe it's exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9586.16s">would</a>  have wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9587.16s">I</a>  pray that there's no COVID, no conflict, and no controversy in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9593.805s">As</a>  we wrap things up, I do have a few folks to acknowledge and to thank. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9598.648s">Please</a>  show your love for our program participants, Minister Stacey Moore, <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9610.279s">The</a>  divine Stacey Clayton. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9616.701s">My</a>  man on the keys, Jonathan Fagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9623.184s">My</a>  beloved daughter, Maya Cotter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9628.305s">My</a>  even more beloved wife, gotta be that way, Teresa J.

degree to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9874.44s">You</a>  don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9879.122s">You</a>  only need to have a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love. <a href="https://youtu.be/Syq1SGjzZUg&t=9886.511s">As</a>  we leave this place, let's allow our hearts to be full of grace and our
