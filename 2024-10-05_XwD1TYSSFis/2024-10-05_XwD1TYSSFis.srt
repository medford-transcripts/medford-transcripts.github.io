[SPEAKER_02]: Henry and Evelyn have long worked with the Arc and for more than 50 years have advocated for and worked to improve the lives of individuals, intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families.

22
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:08,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I introduced this resolution, but I'm happy to have if there's any other counselors wanna speak first.

23
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:10,882
[SPEAKER_02]: resolution on the Miller and family.

24
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:11,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also I'll just go.

25
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:23,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I put this on a resident actually brought this to my attention as everyone who knows Henry and Evelyn there's no shortage of causes they're involved in in the city, they dedicate a lot of time their, their time to the city.

26
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:30,551
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as to the Arc of Massachusetts and specifically individuals and families that are affected by intellectual and developmental disabilities.

27
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:35,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're being honored by the Arc of Massachusetts as they celebrate 70 years.

28
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:43,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's just a testament to all the work they've done for this community and all the work they continue to do and their dedication.

29
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:49,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna thank the resident who brought this to my attention because there's no shortage of accolades for Henry and Evelyn.

30
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:51,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate them bringing this to my attention as well.

31
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:56,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

32
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:58,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for placing this on the agenda.

33
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:02,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, we all know Henry and Evelyn we've worked with.

34
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:14,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Henry, especially in the government capacity as now our chair of our Elections Commission, but formerly as a leader of the Medford Democratic City Committee.

35
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:26,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know, I always get calls from him, sometimes during meetings, usually after, to comment on what's going on in the city.

36
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But also in addition to their devotion to Medford,

37
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:44,248
[SPEAKER_05]: and our community here in Medford, I think their devotion to the ARC and to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities across the Boston area, across the state is well-known as well.

38
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:46,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not all that either of them do.

39
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:53,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's great that they're being honored and I'm glad that we can have a resolution recognizing the great work that both Henry and Evelyn do.

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

41
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

42
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Saik.

43
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

44
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Henry and Evelyn,

45
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:07,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I was counselor various that we all know for their dedication and care for Medford for our residents for the goings on of our city.

46
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:17,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's, I think, just in general there's just so much to talk about with their dedication to Medford and to our residents but

47
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:30,375
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, every time I learn something new about Henry, it's truly inspiring that level of care that he's willing to give to people around him.

48
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:38,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And to see that, you know, this, I think they're, you know, I'm just so happy that they're being honored for their work.

49
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:48,448
[SPEAKER_06]: especially with improving the lives of those with intellectual and developmental disabilities, because I think it's a realm that needs so much care.

50
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:49,849
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs so much attention.

51
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:56,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to know that someone like Henry and Evelyn, to know that people like them are there, I think, makes me feel better about this world.

52
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:00,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

53
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:09,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all know Henry and Evelyn for their work in Medford, which is tireless, but I've known Henry a long time.

54
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:15,857
[SPEAKER_10]: For those who don't know him, Henry is well-renowned throughout the state of Massachusetts for his work in that community.

55
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:29,600
[SPEAKER_10]: And he doesn't get the recognition sometimes that he deserves, but those of us in the hometown, we all know and we recognize his commitment to people with disabilities and things like that.

56
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:38,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to salute Henry for his work and glad he's getting some recognition, both him and Evelyn for all the things they do.

57
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:39,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

58
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:40,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Collins.

59
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Murrell for putting this forward.

60
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone who knows Henry and Evelyn knows they truly have some of the

61
00:04:48,254 --> 00:05:05,928
[SPEAKER_08]: one of the most enthusiastic, energetic households in the city of Medford, and we're all very lucky that they choose to direct so much of their energies towards positive causes, typically, and for families in Medford, and I'm just so happy to see them getting some of the recognition that they deserve.

62
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:09,591
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, Henry and Evelyn, for a really lifetime of positive contributions.

63
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:11,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

64
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:12,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

65
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:13,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

66
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna speak more of a personal level,

67
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:18,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I've known Henry a long time.

68
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Henry and my dad were very close.

69
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:32,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember many a night in Boston Ave in West Medford with Henry, my dad, and Mr. Caggiano just hanging out and drinking homemade wine and telling stories.

70
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:40,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just realize, I often talk about when great residents pass on, who steps up.

71
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:46,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's refreshing when you could talk about a resident like Henry Miller and his lovely wife.

72
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: what they've done for our community.

73
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:51,112
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not someone that sits back.

74
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,812
[SPEAKER_03]: He sees an issue and he attacks it.

75
00:05:54,273 --> 00:06:00,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's always there to lend his word, whether you want to hear it or not, whether you like it or not.

76
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:09,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate his friendship and we should all be honored to have residents like the Miller and family here in Medford.

77
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:10,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Madam President.

78
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

79
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:12,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have a motion?

80
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:16,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I introduced it, so I just need a motion.

81
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,709
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Carvilla to approve, seconded by Councilor Seng.

82
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:21,729

84
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,150

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:23,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

86
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:25,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Records.

87
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:29,314
[SPEAKER_02]: The records of the meeting of October 17, 2023 were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

88
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:29,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

89
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:33,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I found them in order and will approve, Madam President.

90
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,218
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Seng.

91
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:36,858
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

92
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:37,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

93
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:38,279
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

94
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:39,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

95
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

96
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:46,204
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-412, Adam Dash and Associates, Attorneys at Law,

97
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:57,333
[SPEAKER_02]: to the City Clerk's Office, City of Medford, regarding 12 Dell Avenue petition to amend deed restriction petition and owners Gerald L. Alves and Janet R. Alves.

98
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:02,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get into this, if folks want me to read again, this came before us at one of our September meetings.

99
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:10,302
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a petition to remove a deed restriction, and we had worked through, we had some questions, and we tabled this to a date certain, that date certain being today.

100
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,322
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's before us.

101
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:19,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm happy to read this again if councilors would like, or I can hand it off to Attorney Dash to give us an update of where we're standing right now.

102
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:26,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President, I think that we've already, I think coming from Representative Dash, I think that

103
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,568
[SPEAKER_03]: would sum it up for us and give us a brief synopsis.

104
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:33,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've already gone through this, but I'd appreciate that.

105
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:33,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

106
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:47,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And I forgot to add that part of the reason that we tabled to a date certain was so that the attorney and his petitioners could meet with some city departments and see if we could find some common ground to have some language to reflect on for this proposed removal of the deed restriction.

107
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll go to Attorney Dash.

108
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:48,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly so.

109
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President, members of the council.

110
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:55,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Summerville with Mayor Janet Alves and Jerry Alves, the

111
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:57,525
[SPEAKER_14]: owners and petitioners.

112
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:11,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we last saw you September 19th, we have been in communication with the planning development sustainability and with the city council about this client, my client's petitions to amend the deed restriction on the property located at 12 Dell Avenue.

113
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:17,261
[SPEAKER_14]: While these discussions have been productive, we have not reached an end result on which the council can act.

114
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:23,108
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would ask that the matter be put off for an additional period of time to allow us to come back with something.

115
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:24,388
[SPEAKER_14]: We're working on some documents.

116
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:27,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there'll be a lot cleaner at that point.

117
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Something like I was talking with Alicia before we started like November 28th.

118
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're meeting that might work.

119
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,271
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to get into all of it too much.

120
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:40,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So I make a recommendation that we table this until October.

121
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:50,849
[SPEAKER_03]: until date certain, which would be the date of November 28th or meeting that close to that day, whether it's the 1st of December, if that's okay.

122
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:53,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

123
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:58,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other discussion from the council or anyone else like to speak on this topic before we get that motion?

124
00:08:59,616 --> 00:08:59,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

125
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:00,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

126
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:00,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

127
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:08,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So the motion from Councilor Scarpelli to table this paper once more to a date certain November 28th or November 28th meeting, seconded by Councilor Carriello.

128
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,581
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

129
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

130
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:10,904
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

131
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:11,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

132
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:13,288
[SPEAKER_02]: The paper is tabled to November 28th.

133
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Motions, orders and resolutions 23-442 offered by Vice President Behrs.

134
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:36,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Resolved by the Medford City Council that the Traffic Commission review ways to reduce the speed and volume of traffic using Willis Avenue as a cut through, including but not limited to directing one-way traffic away from Willis Avenue and toward Mystic Avenue and Main Street.

135
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:40,347
[SPEAKER_02]: The addition of speed tables and any other design changes that were discouraged cut through traffic.

136
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:51,296
[SPEAKER_02]: be it further resolved that the Director of Traffic and Transportation provide the Council with information regarding any existing traffic flow studies for the area, or any plans to adjust traffic patterns to reduce cut-through trips.

137
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:52,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Harris.

138
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:53,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

139
00:09:54,437 --> 00:10:04,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We are seeing, and I'm hearing from residents, just the sheer amount of cut-through trips now cutting through on Willis Ave in between Main Street and Mystic Ave.

140
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:18,554
[SPEAKER_05]: just a high volume of cars, high speed, sometimes such a high volume that it's not high speed, but it is really dangerous for our neighborhood streets to be being used as through ways and thoroughfares.

141
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:21,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Residents have had some suggestions.

142
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:29,324
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on the microphone system, I swear.

143
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:41,911
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, essentially people are using Willis Ave either instead of using Main Street or using Mystic Ave, they're using it to get through from Main Street to Mystic Ave or Mystic Ave to Main Street.

144
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:44,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were some suggestions.

145
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:55,044
[SPEAKER_05]: A, the residents are interested in what the city's general plan is in the area to have traffic try to stay on streets like Harvard.

146
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,192
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, Hancock and others.

147
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:04,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I have communicated with the Director of Traffic and Transportation about this.

148
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:10,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said that it is a difficult situation, but that he's looking into some of these solutions.

149
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:21,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, I think design changes like speed tables and potentially other design changes could discourage the cut through traffic and discourage the apps from directing people down those roads.

150
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:28,557
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask for my colleagues support for this motion to refer this to the Traffic Commission so they put it on their agenda.

151
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:36,932
[SPEAKER_05]: and get back to us and the residents about what our plan is for the area of South Medford that is facing these issues.

152
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:37,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

153
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:44,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very grateful that Vice President Barris has put this on the agenda.

154
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:50,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a year ago, I put on the agenda something about cut-throughs

155
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:55,600
[SPEAKER_06]: perpendicular to Willis, between Main and Mystic.

156
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:12,613
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that I think folks, neighbors in the area talked about for a while, something that came up, that's always come up on Doorknocking in the area, and something that I've also talked to Director Blake about as well.

157
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:17,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he's working hard on it, but there needs to be more action being taken.

158
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very grateful.

159
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:22,659
[SPEAKER_06]: to my fellow counselor for putting this on the agenda.

160
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:30,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in the neighborhood recently and it was just so hard even to cross the neighborhood street because cars were driving by so quickly.

161
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just for families in the area with kids, that's just not safe at all.

162
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:40,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'd really want us to see the city do something about it.

163
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:48,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm grateful to the counselor for kind of pushing this forward again, putting this back on the agenda again.

164
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:50,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

165
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:51,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Carvajal.

166
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:52,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

167
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate Councilor Baird's putting this on there.

168
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:56,737
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't just Willis Ave.

169
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:58,862
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gridlocked in the city.

170
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:00,355
[SPEAKER_10]: at certain times of the day.

171
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:11,079
[SPEAKER_10]: I know some of the improvements we made for safety is we've cut down the size of the roads, we've cut down turns.

172
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:18,702
[SPEAKER_10]: So now people are sitting in traffic for crazy periods of time, they're getting frustrated, and they're going down all these side roads.

173
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:20,202
[SPEAKER_10]: They say, this is just Willis-Eve.

174
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:25,244
[SPEAKER_10]: In the morning, the traffic is backing up into Winchester on Winter Street.

175
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,905
[SPEAKER_10]: It's backing up past the train station.

176
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:28,425
[SPEAKER_10]: This morning,

177
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:33,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Took me 38 minutes to get into the square from my house in West Medford.

178
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,592
[SPEAKER_10]: High Street is backed up everywhere.

179
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:42,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a problem, especially between the morning hours and the afternoon hours.

180
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,157
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just gridlocked, no matter where you go in the city.

181
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:48,599
[SPEAKER_10]: And frustration is, people are going down all these side roads.

182
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,401
[SPEAKER_10]: If you use Waze, it's taking you everywhere.

183
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:56,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we've been shut down every road in the city for, you know, certain hours of the day.

184
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:59,507
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, it's getting unbearable.

185
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:11,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, and I have something on the agenda that's part of this, what Councilor Baird says, that I'll talk about later, but this problem isn't, Jermaine, just to Willis Avenue.

186
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:12,457
[SPEAKER_10]: It's everywhere.

187
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:16,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hearing from all the neighbors and everywhere saying, I can't take the traffic.

188
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,361
[SPEAKER_10]: People are flying down my streets.

189
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:21,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank you, and I say, if we just have the traffic commission look into,

190
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:26,549
[SPEAKER_10]: examined the whole city, not just Willis Avenue.

191
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Fevella.

192
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:31,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

193
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:36,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Baez, for bringing this forward because, you know, listen to everybody's points.

194
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:40,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a complicated situation, and I think that this brings me to my point.

195
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:48,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked to a couple of business owners that people aren't realizing some of the traffic calming measures that we've implemented

196
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you an example, one of our local businesses had five delivery drivers that were always on the road.

197
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:11,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're finding right now is he had to let go of two delivery drivers, but the outside agencies, Grubhub, all the other automobile delivery services,

198
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:15,914
[SPEAKER_03]: they've increased, he said, over 75%.

199
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're doing is they don't care where they're parking.

200
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:21,318
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still parking in the bike lanes.

201
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,780
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still parking, you know, we've lost control.

202
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason why I bring that up is because I think it's important.

203
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:34,047
[SPEAKER_03]: As we move forward to make these decisions, and I appreciate Councilor Behrs bringing this up, because I have neighbors calling me about that whole neighborhood.

204
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:35,807
[SPEAKER_03]: where it is a cut through.

205
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:38,629
[SPEAKER_03]: It was no different than what a couple years ago was Fulton Street, right?

206
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Fulton Street area, the corridor, and people have just forgotten.

207
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're so fed up with it that they're just living with it by now.

208
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:53,975
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue I'm seeing is that it's good to do initial conversation with that traffic engineer, but I think we need to start involving the community.

209
00:15:54,675 --> 00:16:00,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that I got a few phone calls the other day with the whole idea of eliminating left-hand turns.

210
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:05,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, people calling me saying, well, where is that going to now lead the people?

211
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,817
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to lead them right into their right turns into their neighborhoods.

212
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:17,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're, instead of going 50-50, their discussion is now you're flooding that area with 100% of the traffic.

213
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:24,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth of the matter is, there is no communication with the neighbors in those neighborhoods that are affected.

214
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:29,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate it, but I think we need to move forward with this.

215
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:34,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I support Councilor Beas' initiative in getting our traffic engineer and working on

216
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:40,621
[SPEAKER_03]: that corridor, but at the same time, I think that we should do this shockingly.

217
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:57,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the word transparent because it's never used in this community, but bringing the neighborhood into the meetings, bringing the neighborhood into the meetings with the traffic engineer and say, okay, what would one solution that you think, how would that solution affect

218
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,623
[SPEAKER_03]: other situations.

219
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:01,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not seeing that.

220
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:08,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, just today to get emails and phone calls from from residents and business owners saying, you know, George, I know the sounds great.

221
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what it checks a certain box.

222
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:27,591
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth of the matter is, his business has increased automobile traffic that are parking, there's no enforcement use, we all see it, lift, whatever they are, whoever they are, they all they pull over wherever they want.

223
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:35,346
[SPEAKER_03]: they pull into bike lanes, they block driveways, and they do whatever, they are now dictating what happens on our streets.

224
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:55,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna second Councilor Beas' initiative, but I would really like to see more community participation in these decisions so we can really get a true outlook, outline of what everybody sees, the people that live there every single day, and how one issue

225
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:59,936
[SPEAKER_03]: one solution can affect another and just at least vet that out.

226
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:01,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Madam President.

227
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:02,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

228
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:05,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Morrell.

229
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:08,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate, uh, counselor bears for putting this forward.

230
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:15,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I see this issue in action every time I try to drive to my house in South Medford from Wegmans.

231
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:22,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and it's this is a citywide issue of, you know, every apartment that I've lived in in South Medford.

232
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:22,784
[SPEAKER_08]: There's

233
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:29,920
[SPEAKER_08]: one intersection that I look at 100 times a week where it seems to be a cut through street that inevitably has a daycare on that street.

234
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And you see the people get impatient with the main thoroughfare and they use the cut through, they speed down it.

235
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:47,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, I agree it is a citywide issue and it's horrifying to see it every time because you're just waiting for something, you know, hair raising to happen and residents shouldn't have to live with that volume of high speed cut through traffic.

236
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And I completely agree that the

237
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,374
[SPEAKER_08]: widespread nature of this issue throughout the city.

238
00:18:55,414 --> 00:19:02,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it shines a light on how what we really need is the resources to support citywide approach.

239
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:07,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of the time with these issues, we can't control for every person who would speed if they got the opportunity.

240
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:10,484
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to devise a perfect

241
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:12,338
[SPEAKER_08]: quick fix.

242
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:15,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Often those aren't as those aren't the solves that we want them to be.

243
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:28,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the absence of resources, you know, tomorrow to type of street redesign work that would really result in safer, appropriately speeded streets, you know, I'm hoping that our traffic and

244
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:36,898
[SPEAKER_08]: transportation departments can look at Willis Avenue with haste because, you know, it's been getting, you know, this seems like it's an acute issue right now in neighborhoods.

245
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:53,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Neighbors have been speaking up about it, and it's my hope that absent, you know, the resources for a redesign, at least the solutions that seem to be working best on Willis Avenue, when we get the chance to roll those out, we can be taking the best practices and hopefully adopting those for the other many, many problem areas across the city.

246
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:53,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

247
00:19:54,414 --> 00:20:08,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councillor Collins, and just from the chair appreciate bears bringing this up and just my fellow counselors comments on this because I think, as we know, this is a multifaceted issue and I really appreciate the focus on looking citywide I think that's absolutely the approach we should take and I'm sure it's.

248
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,202
[SPEAKER_02]: at least in part happening already.

249
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:27,081
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think like so many of our issues, there is a facet of this that is at the state level, we're dealing with a deeply broken public transit system, that people they would be on the T, you know, or they wouldn't take the bus, but they're sitting in the traffic on the bus, and the T doesn't run.

250
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:30,864
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have people that are dealing with return to office.

251
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:32,205
[SPEAKER_02]: You have people who can't take the train.

252
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have more cars than ever on our roads.

253
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,309
[SPEAKER_02]: They're backing up and they're looking for ways to cut around.

254
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:41,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the technology and we have the Uber Eats and we have it's, you know, it's a perfect storm.

255
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes from everywhere.

256
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:52,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It backs up to Winchester because, you know, it comes out of Uber and it comes through, you know, everywhere is inching down the line as you get closer and closer to city center and we just stop moving.

257
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:55,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate the effort to see what we can do.

258
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:08,362
[SPEAKER_02]: um, as a city, but just also recognizing that, um, the density of our community and even more so as we'll talk about the rest of this year, in part relies on a public transit system that has not been functioning for a long time.

259
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:10,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's embarrassing.

260
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:11,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

261
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:12,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, my colleagues.

262
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:18,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to add, uh, that one of the reasons that a resident raises concern with me

263
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:21,214
[SPEAKER_05]: was the kids walking to Ms.

264
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:21,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuck's school.

265
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:26,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also that I completely agree with my colleagues that this is a citywide issue.

266
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:38,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of the reasons I asked for a traffic flow study for the whole area is because even if we were to implement this on Willis, maybe it wouldn't work because it would impact other streets.

267
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:40,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's a serious issue.

268
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:44,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it also points me towards

269
00:21:45,822 --> 00:22:05,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those improvements that we had heard from the folks who want to develop the large, the combined properties life sciences project on Mystic Ave, potentially some of the improvements to the area's physical infrastructure that they had talked about committing to, that could go to benefit this project, this issue.

270
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:05,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

271
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:06,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

272
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:09,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to hit that button?

273
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:15,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can hear you, the people on TV can't hear you.

274
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:16,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, is it?

275
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:20,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there you go.

276
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:20,752
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

277
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Just name and address for the record.

278
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:25,014
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue.

279
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:26,955
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a church in here, so quiet.

280
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:28,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I would know, but anyway.

281
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:38,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you brought this up, Councilor Beas, because I wanted to bring up something that we did several years ago when Chief Sacker was around.

282
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:44,024
[SPEAKER_09]: terrible parking problems down in South Medford, down on Yale Harbor, Main Street and everything.

283
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:53,129
[SPEAKER_09]: We started at the Kennedy Condominiums, a group of neighbors, must have been about 20 of us.

284
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:54,709
[SPEAKER_09]: We walked the whole neighborhood.

285
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,972
[SPEAKER_09]: We walked and saw the situation, the problems that we were experiencing.

286
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,053
[SPEAKER_09]: We wound up all the way down to Columbus Park.

287
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:08,396
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem you have is one of the things that's increased the traffic

288
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:14,108
[SPEAKER_09]: to cut through traffic is when they put that juggernaut across from the fire station.

289
00:23:15,108 --> 00:23:18,049
[SPEAKER_09]: People don't want to go down there, wait for the turn, take a left.

290
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:23,611
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going down to Alexander Avenue now, or cutting across Harvard, and then they're zooming down to Willis Avenue.

291
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:24,551
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really dangerous.

292
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:30,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And the children there, I mean, the poor traffic supervisors there, they put their lives at risk over there.

293
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:34,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I can hear them yelling at the people in the morning sometimes, you know?

294
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:37,715
[SPEAKER_09]: But for every solution,

295
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:43,150
[SPEAKER_09]: the way the city is right now, it creates a problem on another part of that neighborhood.

296
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:48,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't really see any solution to divert all the traffic.

297
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:53,318
[SPEAKER_09]: All I see is a heavy duty, a heavy hand in enforcement, okay?

298
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:58,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that may defer or deter some of the activities that are going on there.

299
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:07,870
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, you know, I'm out five o'clock in the morning walking my dog and I bring a light and I have to flash it when I cross Willis Ave because they're flying up there.

300
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Councilor Beall said, if they're not doing 50, they're not doing anything, okay?

301
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:18,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And even sometimes with the light, I think they must know where they wanna run me over because it'll slow down.

302
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:33,540
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, I think it would be great to get together because I don't think the traffic engineer or anybody would be able to go down there and say, okay, we're gonna do this because it has to be, you have to have all the voices, you have to have what the concerns are and everything.

303
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:35,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's one thing that I noticed.

304
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:50,827
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're coming up Willis Avenue, and you're going to approach Hicks, or going to the left to go to Columbus School, or Missy's Steak, or Missy Tuck, you don't see the stop sign until you get right to the top of the rise.

305
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:55,550
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's dangerous, because people don't see the stop sign, so they're not slowing down.

306
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:59,113
[SPEAKER_09]: They got these great guys that take the corners really nice.

307
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:00,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody's gonna get killed.

308
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:09,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that, and I just wish that we would put something together so the neighbors can get together and say, here's our concerns, what can we do?

309
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:11,177
[SPEAKER_09]: And see what happens from there.

310
00:25:12,318 --> 00:25:15,839
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, the Aisle Street parking lot, I mean, it's still a problem.

311
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:17,460
[SPEAKER_09]: It's getting worse, just to let you know.

312
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you very much.

313
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:19,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

314
00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:28,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion by Susan Bares, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, to refer to the Traffic Commission.

315
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:30,326
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

316
00:25:31,556 --> 00:25:32,877
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

317
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:35,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

318
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,901
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-443 offered by Councilor Carvajal.

319
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:48,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved the Medford City Council have the DCR and the traffic engineer address the light sequence on Fulton Street and the Felsway along with the light sequence at Winthrop Street and Route 16 in the interest of public safety.

320
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:49,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Carvajal.

321
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:50,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

322
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:54,395
[SPEAKER_10]: This goes handed in with what Councilor Baez just talked about.

323
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:55,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Fulton Street,

324
00:25:56,457 --> 00:26:09,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, as Councilor Scott Pelley said, people are just living with it now, but it's backing up further and further up the hill, and no one's really listening, watching those signs saying, you know, resident only.

325
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:17,353
[SPEAKER_10]: They're pretty much going down all those neighborhood streets and flooding those neighborhoods as the traffic keeps getting further up.

326
00:26:19,315 --> 00:26:28,557
[SPEAKER_10]: If you live in the West Method area, you're seeing the lights at Route 16 and Winter Street, three or four cars get through.

327
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:38,079
[SPEAKER_10]: And the problem over there is because there's two sets of lights on Route 16 that go off in the morning when there's really no one over there, causing the traffic to back up.

328
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,820
[SPEAKER_10]: So now you get three cars go through.

329
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:46,360
[SPEAKER_10]: traffic's backing up everywhere, and it's backing up on the Boston Ave now on some mornings.

330
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,286
[SPEAKER_10]: So along with the motion we just passed, this is something that has to be looked into.

331
00:26:53,866 --> 00:27:03,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this is not so much a city problem, but it's a DCR problem, and we're still waiting for the lights on South Street to get going.

332
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:05,907
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we have there?

333
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:07,168
[SPEAKER_10]: We still got the same blinking light.

334
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:09,468
[SPEAKER_10]: So now the people are going down South Street.

335
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:17,551
[SPEAKER_10]: And before, they used to get on Mystic Avenue, but now if you notice, they blocked off the other turn there.

336
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:27,133
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we're gonna be flooding Mystic Avenue with more cars, because if you come down over that way, your only access to 93 is to go all the way into Somerville now.

337
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:29,254
[SPEAKER_10]: So all we're doing is just,

338
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:36,031
[SPEAKER_10]: and just making our traffic problems larger and larger without thinking before we make decisions.

339
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:45,326
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the council and the neighborhoods, everyone has to get together with the Traffic Commission and figure out where we're going for our traffic.

340
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:48,068
[SPEAKER_10]: It's getting worse by the day.

341
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, people, the kids are late going to school in the morning.

342
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:56,836
[SPEAKER_10]: I spoke at the school the last couple of weeks and kids are complaining that they can't get to school in time.

343
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:57,817
[SPEAKER_10]: The bus can't make it there.

344
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:02,281
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're getting their three, they get three tidies and you got a problem at school.

345
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:05,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Parents who drive their kids to school can't get out of the school.

346
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,487
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's, it's a, the problem is just compounded around the whole city.

347
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:10,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and,

348
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:19,785
[SPEAKER_10]: The traffic engineer has to come together with the community and different neighborhoods to figure out how to fix this and bring the DCR to fix this light situation.

349
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:21,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

350
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:23,647
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bares.

351
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:24,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

352
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:26,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caravaglia, for bringing this forward.

353
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:31,230
[SPEAKER_05]: The light sequence is certainly an issue at both of these locations.

354
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:38,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also wonder, you know, I think it would be helpful for DCR to potentially

355
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:49,795
[SPEAKER_05]: look at peak, having a certain sequence for peak hours and then a certain sequence for the rest of the time, you know, that might help to address the backups that are happening.

356
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:59,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, you know, I mean, obviously there's traffic and gridlock at many hours of the day these days, but the very serious backups are concentrated to two or three hours in the morning and the evening.

357
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:06,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to see something like that as well, but I'm not amending this and I second it and I support it.

358
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:06,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

359
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Vice Mayor Behrs.

360
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:12,389
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

361
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,030
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

362
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

363
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President.

364
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice Mayor Behrs.

365
00:29:17,171 --> 00:29:23,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take paper 23419 for third reading and 23444 under suspension.

366
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:33,476
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Vice Mayor Behrs to take 23419 for third reading and 23444 papers in the hands of the clerk under suspension.

367
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:34,636
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

368
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:36,397
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

369
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:37,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

370
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I want to do that again.

371
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:43,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second on that?

372
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:44,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Seng.

373
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:46,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the motion of Vice Mayor Seng, by Councilor Seng.

374
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:47,614
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

375
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:47,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

376
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:48,595
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

377
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:49,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

378
00:29:49,315 --> 00:30:03,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So, 23419, eligible for third reading, district improvement financing, approved for first reading in city council on September 19, 2023, advertised in the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal, October 12, 2023, and eligible for third reading on October 24, 2023.

379
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,340
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an ordinance that we had

380
00:30:08,582 --> 00:30:20,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, multiple meetings on that would just actually, Director Hunt, could you give us a super brief reminder of, or everyone watching at home, just what the DIF ordinance is?

381
00:30:20,064 --> 00:30:21,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want, I can do it, but you're here, so.

382
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:28,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

383
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:31,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't prepare this so off the top of my head.

384
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:37,428
[SPEAKER_01]: The DIF is District Improvement Financing, which is a financing structure used to allow

385
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:50,323
[SPEAKER_01]: the city to capture some of the new growth from the revenue that would be generated from new development in Medford Square into a fund specifically for use in Medford Square.

386
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:56,786
[SPEAKER_01]: The plans that you've reviewed before have all the details on dollars, numbers, et cetera, and how that works.

387
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy.

388
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:00,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that significant enough?

389
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:00,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

390
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:04,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any questions or discussion or a motion?

391
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion approves for third reading.

392
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:13,469
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Vice President Behrs to approve for third reading, seconded by Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

393
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Vice President Behrs?

394
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:24,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

395
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:26,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio?

396
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:26,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

397
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:28,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

398
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

399
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:31,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Nunez-Sapiro?

400
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:32,042
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

401
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:39,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent.

402
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,430
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes for third reading.

403
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:48,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to papers in the hands of the clerk 23444 offered under suspension by Councilor Scarpelli.

404
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:55,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the City Council discuss a message received from the Chief of Staff regarding extra election ballots mailed to residents' homes.

405
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:56,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

406
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:57,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

407
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:58,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to share with

408
00:31:59,295 --> 00:32:09,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I've received multiple phone calls, especially Ward 6, that we did get an email from the chief of staff, and I'll read that if that's okay, Madam President.

409
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:10,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

410
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:20,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear President Morrell and city councilors, we recently learned that some addresses who are requesting early voting ballots have received more than one ballot.

411
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:27,658
[SPEAKER_03]: A short while ago, Steve Smerti and I met with elections to better understand what happened.

412
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:29,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the uh...

413
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:39,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this process is not, it happened, there's still checks and balances that are in the system.

414
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:42,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, my email is breaking up.

415
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,172
[SPEAKER_03]: In the system that would prevent someone from being able to physically cast multiple ballots.

416
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:52,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are fail-safes to make sure that you cannot vote twice.

417
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:58,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, there is a unique identifier assigned to each voter and only allows them to cast a ballot once.

418
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:07,141
[SPEAKER_03]: As we learn more about how this happened and steps that are going to be taken to avoid this from reoccurring, we will update the council.

419
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:21,612
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that what I appreciate going forward with this resolution is the first thing is just to express that multiple phone calls that are very, very concerned with voter fraud, right?

420
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And the conspiracy theorists are going crazy.

421
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,037
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think my concern right now is

422
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:34,450
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen some pretty drastic issues in the last month dealing with this election.

423
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:40,656
[SPEAKER_03]: One being that I believe the ballots, there were misspelled names and they had to redo ballots.

424
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:41,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that's one thing.

425
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:46,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with these ballots, it's not a few people.

426
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I got a phone call from one person that said they requested two, they got eight.

427
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:55,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is scary for the sense that

428
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:02,577
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gotta be some people held accountable for this situation.

429
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:09,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And this administration is fluffing this over like it's nothing.

430
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: It's costing the city a lot of money.

431
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:12,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's begin with that.

432
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:15,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if they're giving away ballots, that's a problem.

433
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:25,319
[SPEAKER_03]: If the misspelling ballots and then the ballots have to redone in a rush order to make sure that we can have a true election, this is a problem.

434
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So perception is reality.

435
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:51,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, I brought this up just to explain it, understand that I've talked to a very knowledgeable former elections coordinator that told me that George is no way that, you know, what people are saying on the streets, that that person is gonna take eight votes and they're gonna go to the ballot box, they're gonna mail eight votes for so-and-so.

436
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:58,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And rest assured, that's not the way it can happen that way because of the fail safes that are on the ballot.

437
00:34:58,914 --> 00:34:59,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

438
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:01,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure everybody knows that.

439
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:06,338
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I think we have to realize something.

440
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:08,579
[SPEAKER_03]: We're two weeks away from a very big election.

441
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had two major flops with this election process.

442
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:18,342
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look well.

443
00:35:18,402 --> 00:35:23,486
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look like it's being handled by a leader in this community.

444
00:35:25,668 --> 00:35:27,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we're moving forward for two weeks.

445
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:35,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I just pray that we're kept in the loop with everything that's happening because again, unfortunately, I was gonna bring this forth.

446
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:41,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad we got the email beforehand because I believe it was only one district, one precinct that really-

447
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:46,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

448
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:46,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

449
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:46,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

450
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:47,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

451
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but again, I think moving forward, we need to, we need to buckle down.

452
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is, this is, you know, you see what's going on in this country.

453
00:35:56,801 --> 00:36:03,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Every, the issue in this country is in what's inflammatory is voter fraud and everybody's going crazy about it.

454
00:36:04,323 --> 00:36:06,483
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not doing ourselves any favors in this community.

455
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:11,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just had to, I had to share my frustration.

456
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to calm some people's nerves and understand publicly that there are fail safes in place, even though they're getting 10 ballots.

457
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:24,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure I'm gonna get text message and emails later saying, oh, no way, they'll find a way.

458
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:29,884
[SPEAKER_03]: But there isn't a way that they can use all eight ballots.

459
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:35,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but again, moving forward, I think we really have to tighten this department up.

460
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:37,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And it starts with the mayor.

461
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:41,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that it sounds political, but truly,

462
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:47,513
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the CEO of this community, and this is happening under her watch.

463
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:49,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Something has to be done.

464
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:51,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate it, Madam President.

465
00:36:51,935 --> 00:36:53,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Capelli, and I'll get to other councils.

466
00:36:53,936 --> 00:37:04,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I did reach out to elections manager Melissa Ripley, and she's recovering from surgery, so she couldn't attend, but she did send me, I had some questions myself, just some basic information.

467
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So she did apologize for not being able to be here tonight, and she stated that 5,100 ballots were sent out over the course of two days,

468
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,866
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, the percentage of voters affected is less than 1%.

469
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:24,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The commission is reviewing the process to ensure that they're putting stopgaps in place to avoid this situation in the future, and they will be reviewing all batches of printed label to ensure that voters only receive one ballot.

470
00:37:24,997 --> 00:37:33,685
[SPEAKER_02]: For voters that receive two ballots, you can either shred one or you can drop the extra ballot, and the ballot collection has been located outside of City Hall or outside of the Election Commission's office.

471
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:39,452
[SPEAKER_02]: The State Election Division has a robust computer database that assigns each voter a unique ID.

472
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:43,455
[SPEAKER_02]: When casting a ballot, if a voter were to send in two ballots, only one ballot would be counted.

473
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:46,237
[SPEAKER_02]: The other ballot would be rejected, and it would be filed accordingly.

474
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:52,563
[SPEAKER_02]: She says, we want to assure the voters that our job is to provide the residents and candidates with a fair and equitable election.

475
00:37:54,624 --> 00:37:56,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to Councilor Collins, then Vice Chair Behrs.

476
00:37:58,728 --> 00:38:02,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Morrell, and I appreciate you sharing that update.

477
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I also appreciate Councilor Scarpelli

478
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:08,596
[SPEAKER_08]: bringing this forward, and I appreciate your efforts to get out ahead of the issue.

479
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:30,029
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a lot of concerns about this, and one of them is making sure that we're, since this issue is known, that we're being proactive with how we're communicating about it, and letting people know that this election is going to be, you know, has been above board, will be above board, and not sowing confusion.

480
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Because obviously,

481
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:40,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you said it very well, Councilor Scarpelli, that's the last thing that we need and it's unfortunate to have issues like this come up at this point in kind of the national mood around elections.

482
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:48,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, using this platform to reassure the voters, I think is very productive.

483
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:54,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I reached out to the Chief of Staff after seeing the update this afternoon with some questions, really glad to hear that.

484
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:57,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Manager Ripley already responded.

485
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:02,737
[SPEAKER_08]: to shed some light on the scale of the problem.

486
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:18,671
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of the questions I had, as well as, you know, when we say checks and balances, I think it's important for us to know exactly what those are so that we can, you know, again, be reassuring residents about, you know, exactly the how and the why of this not being an issue for election integrity.

487
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:22,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's great to know, you know, the nuts and bolts for those who don't already know about how the

488
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:25,746
[SPEAKER_08]: state-assigned voter IDs.

489
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:26,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't.

490
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:36,910
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great to know about that process so that we can all feel assured that, you know, extra ballots, if they're not disposed of before people get to City Hall, will not be counted.

491
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really important to emphasize.

492
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:43,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's unfortunate.

493
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:45,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important that we

494
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:51,479
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, be transparent about the mistakes that have been made and be transparent about how exactly they're getting fixed.

495
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:58,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad that we are being properly hasty and responsible about fixing the issue.

496
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:13,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And clearly, you know, making sure that this type of snafu does not keep happening in this office is something that I'm sure we'll all be, you know, very keen on communicating with that office about in the future, because this isn't what Medford needs.

497
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:14,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

498
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:15,951
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bares.

499
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:18,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

500
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:24,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think, uh, you know, to counselors here probably points both of them.

501
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:25,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one.

502
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:25,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

503
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:27,321
[SPEAKER_05]: We've reiterated multiple times.

504
00:40:28,222 --> 00:40:33,223
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that the ballots can't be used, but I actually appreciate bringing up the other issue.

505
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:37,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, which was the misprinted ballots because I believe all the ballots had to be reported.

506
00:40:37,865 --> 00:40:39,326
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a significant cost to the city.

507
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:39,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

508
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:43,138
[SPEAKER_05]: last budget, we were very clear.

509
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:51,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of us on this council that we were last two budgets, but especially last budget that we were uncomfortable with the reductions in the elections department.

510
00:40:52,464 --> 00:41:00,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the prior system before we moved to the independent elections commission system, we had as many as five staff working full time on elections.

511
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,692
[SPEAKER_05]: We now have two staff working full time on elections.

512
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:05,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe there's a vacancy that's unfilled.

513
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:08,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that were to be filled, it would be up to three.

514
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:19,960
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is a significant reduction in staffing, a significant reduction in a second pair of eyes to double check the ballot, a second pair of eyes to be able to supervise the distribution of mail ballots.

515
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think

516
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:25,599
[SPEAKER_05]: given the facts on the ground today are the same as the facts on the ground before.

517
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:26,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You can register later.

518
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, I'm guessing we'll end up with same day registration.

519
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:30,944
[SPEAKER_05]: We have mail ballots.

520
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:31,925
[SPEAKER_05]: We have early ballots.

521
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:32,967
[SPEAKER_05]: We have election day.

522
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:36,430
[SPEAKER_05]: We have essentially all year elections a lot of the time.

523
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,214
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's another election in March and there's an election in September and an election in November.

524
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:43,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's going to be four elections in the next 12 months.

525
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:48,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that merits a reduction in staff and a reduction in budget for the department that should be handling that.

526
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:56,639
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something this council has raised for two budget cycles consecutively, and I think we're seeing that it's an issue.

527
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:11,624
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that in the future budgets that that issue is addressed and the staffing for that department is at least made whole so that there's additional resources and capacity for the administration of elections here in the city.

528
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:14,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

529
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:19,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Council bears brings up a great point, not to be insensitive, but we're two weeks away.

530
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else is supporting?

531
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:32,831
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have an elections coordinator who's not here two weeks before the election with these issues, who's that?

532
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:33,871
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

533
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:34,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It's frightening.

534
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's supporting that department right now?

535
00:42:37,572 --> 00:42:39,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any information with that?

536
00:42:43,414 --> 00:42:45,556
[SPEAKER_02]: She's I believe she was in or she's working remotely.

537
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:46,776
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not.

538
00:42:47,537 --> 00:42:48,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

539
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,238
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

540
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:55,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I didn't want but I appreciate because I think it is so sensitive right now, that it is heightened.

541
00:42:56,223 --> 00:43:06,970
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that who's supporting, you know, I don't, you know, we were very fortunate under clerk, he, you know, we had a great team together.

542
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:16,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and Councilor Baez is right, that's something we talked about at budget time, of the reduction of staff, and situations happen.

543
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:23,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Every employee, they have the right, if they're injured, or sick, or hurt, that they need to take care of what they need to care.

544
00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:32,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't wanna be insensitive to that at all, but the truth of the matter is, we're still two weeks away from a very important election, in my eyes, because I'm running.

545
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:59,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think it's important that I'd like to, if we can, I'd like to make a motion to see, can we ask the administration, are they supporting the staff, even if our director is on remotely, having people in the office is so important.

546
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:06,704
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, is this somebody that are they working with maybe getting someone in for the next two weeks and three weeks to try to make sure that we're

547
00:44:07,682 --> 00:44:09,063
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we're filling the gaps.

548
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:09,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

549
00:44:09,263 --> 00:44:11,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And she may be, I mean, she could have been here today for all I know.

550
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:13,226
[SPEAKER_02]: She just could have an afternoon thing.

551
00:44:13,246 --> 00:44:17,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just, she just couldn't attend tonight because of a medical issue, but okay.

552
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:20,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So you tell me what we're doing.

553
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

554
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:22,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

555
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:22,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam president.

556
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:33,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say she hasn't been in or I think it was just like, she couldn't attend tonight because I'm just, and I'm just saying, if this is something that's longterm, we really need to find a way that we have assisted, we get assistance to that office.

557
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:34,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a fair question.

558
00:44:34,282 --> 00:44:34,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

559
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:34,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

560
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:38,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kerrio.

561
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

562
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:41,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilor Baez hit the nail on the head here.

563
00:44:41,836 --> 00:44:46,917
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this is something we fought for, was to have a fully staffed election department.

564
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:50,338
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we are, two weeks out, and we still never hired anybody.

565
00:44:51,218 --> 00:44:53,859
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're working with volunteers down there.

566
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:57,099
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are, like I said, these are mistakes that shouldn't be happening.

567
00:44:57,419 --> 00:45:04,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone should have proofread the ballots before they went out instead of costing us thousands of dollars to reprint them and have them sent in.

568
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,541
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, having a mistake like this, where people are getting seven, eight, nine ballots.

569
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:19,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, as Councilor Scott Pelli has brought up, you know, there's safeguards in place, but perception is reality nowadays, and it's all over the news about voter fraud, and this is what people talk about.

570
00:45:19,906 --> 00:45:21,227
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what's going around the community.

571
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:27,290
[SPEAKER_10]: How was our election going to be handled?

572
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:31,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, do we have enough people to man the polls this year?

573
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:32,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, are we gonna be fully staffed?

574
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:33,373
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know.

575
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:34,814
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think,

576
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:42,243
[SPEAKER_10]: This council deserves some kind of explanation on if we're going to be ready for our election time in two weeks.

577
00:45:44,305 --> 00:45:44,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

578
00:45:47,426 --> 00:45:51,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as this is under suspension, I don't think we have any motions, but I think we can always come in.

579
00:45:51,468 --> 00:45:55,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to communicate that and just make sure we can get an update on staff and understand where we are.

580
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:56,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate that.

581
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:00,773
[SPEAKER_02]: You're under suspension.

582
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:02,534
[SPEAKER_02]: All we have left is public participation.

583
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was no motion made.

584
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to, I'll just send it.

585
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to send an email.

586
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:18,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to send an email and update the council.

587
00:46:19,952 --> 00:46:20,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Public participation.

588
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:31,257
[SPEAKER_02]: To Honorable City Council, we undersign and respectfully pray Andrew P. Castagnetti to speak on the affairs in Medford on October 24th, 2023.

589
00:46:33,018 --> 00:46:33,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Signed Andrew Castagnetti.

590
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:37,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Castagnetti, whenever you're ready.

591
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:45,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

592
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:47,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Council President.

593
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Honorable Councilors.

594
00:46:58,055 --> 00:47:00,757
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't been here in a while, and I'll make this very brief.

595
00:47:02,178 --> 00:47:10,645
[SPEAKER_12]: It is election time in two weeks, and I have some pros and cons for the city of Medford that concern me and other voters.

596
00:47:11,817 --> 00:47:22,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one, on a positive note, we have the best, as you know, location in all of New England, five miles north of Boston, Interstate Route 93.

597
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:28,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't beat it, and mostly residential community, by the way.

598
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:34,855
[SPEAKER_12]: On the con side, I live in Mystic Ave, and in 1960, they built Route 93.

599
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:36,376
[SPEAKER_12]: That was 63 years ago.

600
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:48,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Gav was kind of like in rough condition business-wise in those days.

601
00:47:48,495 --> 00:47:55,778
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the same old song and dance, mostly cars and car lots and too many cars.

602
00:47:56,879 --> 00:47:59,640
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just a disaster.

603
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:12,105
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was thinking out loud here that we should have requests for proposals from the best you can get, even from the boys from New York City and the New York Minute.

604
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:18,546
[SPEAKER_12]: to give us the best, as Murata would say, best possible use for that land while we're still here.

605
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:21,887
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't forget, it's like 63-year relic.

606
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:24,728
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a great opportunity.

607
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:32,010
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably 35 times more valuable today than it was 63 years ago.

608
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:40,792
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I was in charge, I would have mixed shoes, like the Roman Empire did business

609
00:48:41,715 --> 00:48:49,442
[SPEAKER_12]: The first floor would be business, commercial, even a 24-hour donut and coffee shop, and other commercial businesses, retail.

610
00:48:49,722 --> 00:48:54,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Second floor, you could do offices, whatever, insurance companies, et cetera.

611
00:48:54,506 --> 00:49:04,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And the third floor up to this, whatever, six, seven, eight, nine, especially on the east side of the, which is next to 93, it's a lot of land back there.

612
00:49:05,515 --> 00:49:07,337
[SPEAKER_12]: You could have affordable housing.

613
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,321
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean really affordable housing instead of what they call affordable.

614
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:19,502
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a golden opportunity, especially with the rental problems these days.

615
00:49:25,324 --> 00:49:34,345
[SPEAKER_12]: And then maybe after you have all these residential units, maybe you'd be able to adopt by chapter 59, section 5C, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption.

616
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:36,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Although not everybody would be grateful about that.

617
00:49:40,669 --> 00:49:44,410
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess I said enough about that golden opportunity.

618
00:49:45,571 --> 00:49:47,491
[SPEAKER_12]: But first we have safety issues in the city.

619
00:49:48,532 --> 00:49:54,353
[SPEAKER_12]: And number one I have is the same old song from when I was here three months ago.

620
00:49:54,974 --> 00:49:56,154
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Roosevelt Circle.

621
00:49:57,414 --> 00:50:02,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Get on 93 right here, go north, first exit is Roosevelt Circle.

622
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:12,189
[SPEAKER_12]: As you're going around the intersection, the roundabouts, as they say in Great Britain, there's weeds that are taller than me, they're six feet tall.

623
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:17,390
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's an obstruction, it's a danger, it's a safety problem.

624
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,490
[SPEAKER_12]: And the cars are flying around there.

625
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:26,952
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what I found out, coming back from my friends from our walk around the Hidden Reservoir, coming down 93,

626
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:32,067
[SPEAKER_12]: from Stoneham to Roseville Circle, it's worse.

627
00:50:32,727 --> 00:50:40,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Not only do you have eight foot weeds, you have 30, 40, 50 foot high junk trees, wild.

628
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And you cannot see what's coming around the bend on the roundabout.

629
00:50:46,696 --> 00:50:48,277
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been too many accidents there.

630
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:55,041
[SPEAKER_12]: You can say, hey Andrew, this is MG, it's a state issue.

631
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:56,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know something?

632
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not that smart, maybe you people are city councilors,

633
00:50:59,124 --> 00:51:00,605
[SPEAKER_12]: that are smarter and more honorable.

634
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:03,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you should just check it out.

635
00:51:04,347 --> 00:51:09,850
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you feel it's an issue, you drop the dime to the state and not leave it on Castanetti.

636
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:11,511
[SPEAKER_12]: You might have more pull.

637
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:13,212
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm tired.

638
00:51:13,732 --> 00:51:15,353
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been fighting the city for too long.

639
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,475
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've come up with solutions.

640
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:20,456
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not trying to be negative.

641
00:51:21,657 --> 00:51:22,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Another one's a problem.

642
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:25,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna talk fast because you're not gonna wanna hear about this.

643
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:28,181
[SPEAKER_12]: You're on Mystic Avenue from Somerville driving

644
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:31,921
[SPEAKER_12]: 38 north towards Memphis Square.

645
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:36,142
[SPEAKER_12]: As you pass Harvard Street, you have two lanes on both sides.

646
00:51:36,363 --> 00:51:38,623
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no cars parked there at all.

647
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,023
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a state road.

648
00:51:41,004 --> 00:51:45,385
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the old highway to Boston before Route 93.

649
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:52,566
[SPEAKER_12]: And then all of a sudden, we're doing 40, 50, some are doing 60 miles an hour on average.

650
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:55,067
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not pushing the number here.

651
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:59,228
[SPEAKER_12]: And all of a sudden, it merges into one lane.

652
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:11,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And instead of no cars, right after Atlas and Hancock Street, as you mentioned earlier, Councilor, there's five cars parked there.

653
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:18,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't they park further down in front of the VFW or the Verizon building?

654
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:21,988
[SPEAKER_12]: That gives us an extra 100 feet to make the adjustment.

655
00:52:22,248 --> 00:52:25,951
[SPEAKER_12]: I see a car roll over there with an accident with an elderly lady.

656
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:27,832
[SPEAKER_12]: There's too many accidents in that location.

657
00:52:28,868 --> 00:52:32,049
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not gonna say it again for the fourth time, so I said it for the third time.

658
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:37,972
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder about this missing bike path right behind you, Councilor Morrell.

659
00:52:39,313 --> 00:52:46,756
[SPEAKER_12]: The bike path comes from Arlington, West Medford, it goes right into Memphis Square, right behind you, at the Senior Citizen Center, it stops.

660
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:51,138
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a half a mile blockage.

661
00:52:51,966 --> 00:53:00,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Once you get to the Doug Andrews School, 23 years ago they were built, you had a bike path all the way to take the subway, you don't have to worry about driving down Willis Ave.

662
00:53:00,855 --> 00:53:05,259
[SPEAKER_12]: You could take your bicycle, you could walk too, or a wheelchair.

663
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:10,084
[SPEAKER_12]: So what happened to this missing bike path?

664
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:13,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Can anyone tell me what's going on?

665
00:53:13,387 --> 00:53:14,348
[SPEAKER_12]: When will it be done?

666
00:53:15,515 --> 00:53:18,698
[SPEAKER_12]: All these people want more transportation, but what is going on?

667
00:53:18,718 --> 00:53:23,342
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been five, six, seven years I've been working on this and broke my head in one of the potholes there.

668
00:53:24,183 --> 00:53:25,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Can someone tell me, please?

669
00:53:26,925 --> 00:53:30,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have answers to all your questions, but- No, no, just the one on the bike path.

670
00:53:30,268 --> 00:53:31,109
[SPEAKER_05]: On the bike path, yeah.

671
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:31,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.

672
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,834
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that that did go out to bid and is going to be under construction next year.

673
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:48,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool, and by the way, it's gonna be within 12 feet of mean high tide next to the river, I hope, because that's the Massachusetts law back in the 1700s on the riparian rights.

674
00:53:48,714 --> 00:53:49,975
[SPEAKER_12]: You know about that, right, Counselor?

675
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:50,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely do.

676
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:51,576
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad you do.

677
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,497
[SPEAKER_12]: I always said you were smart.

678
00:53:54,757 --> 00:53:56,058
[SPEAKER_12]: But let's get the job done.

679
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:57,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you.

680
00:53:57,499 --> 00:53:58,799
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't wanna get PO'd, man.

681
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,620
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I hear you.

682
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanna be able to use it with a bicycle, and not have, down the road, they have to use a wheelchair.

683
00:54:03,862 --> 00:54:04,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

684
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:06,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, come on, this is ridiculous.

685
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:11,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm gonna keep my animation down.

686
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:16,116
[SPEAKER_12]: And what about the marathon bombing?

687
00:54:16,137 --> 00:54:17,117
[SPEAKER_12]: 2000, what?

688
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:20,079
[SPEAKER_12]: My wife had cancer, I was in Mass General.

689
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:22,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to go, she said, I don't want to go, let's go, I've never been there.

690
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:24,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank God we didn't go.

691
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,064
[SPEAKER_12]: And I missed the Dalai Lama too, at the Buddhist temple.

692
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:34,969
[SPEAKER_12]: But the point is, McGlynn, Mayor McGlynn, he got a lot of business people at the Chamber of Commerce

693
00:54:36,496 --> 00:54:42,938
[SPEAKER_12]: thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands to build the Kristin Campbell fountain.

694
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:45,719
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see any activity.

695
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,421
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see any water spouting out of that for at least months, years.

696
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:53,562
[SPEAKER_12]: But Mr. Scarpelli, Mr. Caviola, can you help me?

697
00:54:53,742 --> 00:54:54,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I can answer you.

698
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:56,203
[SPEAKER_12]: The parts are on order?

699
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:57,584
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't get the parts?

700
00:54:57,664 --> 00:54:58,284
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

701
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:01,285
[SPEAKER_10]: There is money to fix the fountain.

702
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:03,845
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in the trust funds.

703
00:55:04,786 --> 00:55:07,969
[SPEAKER_10]: That's overseen by a group.

704
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:23,543
[SPEAKER_10]: From what I'm told from the people that are running the trust fund, they're waiting for the city engineer to submit a plan on A, who's going to do the work, who's going to maintain the fountain,

705
00:55:24,156 --> 00:55:34,644
[SPEAKER_10]: and the landscape plan, so that's what I'm told, is to hang up, and until the trustees get the plan, they're not going to release the funds.

706
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,466
[SPEAKER_10]: The funds are there to fix it, though.

707
00:55:37,787 --> 00:55:38,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Where is it, a pump?

708
00:55:39,228 --> 00:55:39,708
[SPEAKER_12]: What's a pump, $100?

709
00:55:39,768 --> 00:55:43,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever it is, they wanna see a plan.

710
00:55:44,672 --> 00:55:50,036
[SPEAKER_10]: They wanna see a maintenance plan, who's gonna do the work, and who's gonna maintain the grounds around the fountain.

711
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:51,978
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's,

712
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,512
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I've been told is the holdup there.

713
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:57,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So the funds are there.

714
00:55:57,633 --> 00:56:00,135
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you've always been good about these things, Counselor.

715
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:01,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate your help.

716
00:56:01,156 --> 00:56:02,216
[SPEAKER_12]: You have good common sense.

717
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:02,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say that.

718
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:04,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to say it again later.

719
00:56:04,598 --> 00:56:08,401
[SPEAKER_02]: We're approaching 10 minutes.

720
00:56:08,441 --> 00:56:09,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to cut you off.

721
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:12,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Where is the scoop?

722
00:56:12,723 --> 00:56:13,504
[SPEAKER_12]: I shouldn't say this.

723
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Where is the scoop on all the silence with the airplanes running?

724
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:19,084
[SPEAKER_12]: runway 33L.

725
00:56:19,144 --> 00:56:20,785
[SPEAKER_12]: It's another construction.

726
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:22,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Haven't heard a plane in months or months.

727
00:56:22,886 --> 00:56:24,586
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I'm going.

728
00:56:24,606 --> 00:56:28,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just don't jinx it.

729
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:29,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

730
00:56:29,548 --> 00:56:31,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody must know the answer.

731
00:56:31,769 --> 00:56:36,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It was down for work in August, but it's been quiet before August and it's been quiet since, so I don't know.

732
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:37,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they forgot about us.

733
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:37,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope.

734
00:56:38,192 --> 00:56:39,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's hope is correct.

735
00:56:40,432 --> 00:56:47,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I must thank City Councilor Caviello for having great common sense all these years.

736
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:49,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I really, we thank you for that.

737
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:50,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

738
00:56:51,633 --> 00:57:03,977
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully your concern will come to materialize and fruition about that guy, that big guy north of Richmond might cause a drag us into a World War III.

739
00:57:04,478 --> 00:57:09,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope that doesn't come to fruition.

740
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw buying Camel cigarettes at 1750.

741
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:15,042
[SPEAKER_12]: It must be Biden economics.

742
00:57:17,138 --> 00:57:18,799
[SPEAKER_12]: It used to be 28 cents a pack.

743
00:57:18,819 --> 00:57:21,899
[SPEAKER_12]: 28 cents a pack, 1962, when the first bar movie came out, Dr. No.

744
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:29,121
[SPEAKER_12]: The stock market went up so many times, the cigarettes went up more, 20% more than the Dow Jones.

745
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:30,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you imagine?

746
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:32,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Larry knows what I'm speaking about.

747
00:57:33,942 --> 00:57:44,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, you city councilors, would you want to take this opportunity to tell the voters of your best accomplishment in the past two years, starting with Councilor Knight, but I think he's indisposed.

748
00:57:45,065 --> 00:57:45,545
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

749
00:57:46,323 --> 00:57:50,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to tell us, can you, can Council build some of your best accomplishment in the last two years?

750
00:57:50,246 --> 00:57:51,467
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to go around the horn.

751
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:53,108
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure the voters want to know.

752
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:55,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this feels like campaigning, and I know we can't campaign.

753
00:57:56,511 --> 00:57:57,632
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't campaign behind the rails.

754
00:57:57,652 --> 00:57:58,673
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't get into that, you said?

755
00:57:59,193 --> 00:58:00,194
[SPEAKER_12]: No?

756
00:58:00,754 --> 00:58:01,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

757
00:58:01,935 --> 00:58:08,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Lastly, I have a really, really cool idea for the city, for the best landmark.

758
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,721
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the, it's essential or something?

759
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:11,703
[SPEAKER_12]: The best landmark in the city.

760
00:58:11,723 --> 00:58:14,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know what the best landmark would be in your opinions?

761
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Not the big or low building.

762
00:58:19,392 --> 00:58:20,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you anybody have an idea?

763
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:23,314
[SPEAKER_12]: The best landmark in this city, what would that be?

764
00:58:24,115 --> 00:58:24,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Like a square?

765
00:58:24,975 --> 00:58:25,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Wright's Tower.

766
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:26,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Wright's Tower.

767
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,378
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the London?

768
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:34,220
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the footbridge behind Old Craddock's?

769
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,341
[SPEAKER_12]: The footbridge over the Mystic River.

770
00:58:42,363 --> 00:58:43,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would be really cool

771
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:53,403
[SPEAKER_12]: If you did a like a salt and pepper thing like the bridge in Boston Council bid maybe you take $100 instead.

772
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:55,105
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm, I'm offering $100.

773
00:58:56,207 --> 00:59:05,537
[SPEAKER_12]: I donate this to the city to put two strands of Christmas lights on each side of that footbridge since you don't know where to send that direction.

774
00:59:07,182 --> 00:59:10,043
[SPEAKER_12]: It would look really cool with the lights glowing, have it come on at dusk.

775
00:59:10,283 --> 00:59:16,044
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, my old electrician used to work for the city, Jimmy Abagast told me, and I saw it, the pole was right there.

776
00:59:16,064 --> 00:59:17,544
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called the electric pole.

777
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:20,164
[SPEAKER_12]: I could spit at it.

778
00:59:20,204 --> 00:59:21,825
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only five feet away from the bridge.

779
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,926
[SPEAKER_12]: So Mr. City messenger, please take this.

780
00:59:26,806 --> 00:59:29,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you to do that.

781
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:31,767
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you to message it over there.

782
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:33,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Please write a check.

783
00:59:34,764 --> 00:59:36,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you please get this to the mayor?

784
00:59:37,345 --> 00:59:48,607
[SPEAKER_07]: You can donate additional on your property tax bills, which I know you.

785
00:59:59,815 --> 01:00:00,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

786
01:00:00,356 --> 01:00:02,057
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

787
01:00:02,157 --> 01:00:03,458
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to give that back.

788
01:00:03,538 --> 01:00:04,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to give it back, Larry.

789
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,582
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I want you to give it to the mayor.

790
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

791
01:00:12,926 --> 01:00:14,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't.

792
01:00:15,108 --> 01:00:22,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not dropping it off at the treasurer's office because when it comes to money, McGrath said he couldn't trust his own shadow.

793
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:25,059
[SPEAKER_02]: For those following at home, I can't be here.

794
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,860
[SPEAKER_12]: We should take a moment of silence for what happened in Israel.

795
01:00:28,321 --> 01:00:29,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Castagnet, thank you.

796
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:30,602
[SPEAKER_02]: You're well past your time.

797
01:00:30,642 --> 01:00:34,224
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not many people here tonight, so I don't want to cut you off, but I appreciate it.

798
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:38,046
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want the Christmas lights on the- We do, but- It sounds like a lovely idea.

799
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:38,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that $100.

800
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,767
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wants that $100.

801
01:00:41,447 --> 01:00:41,948
[SPEAKER_05]: It's real.

802
01:00:42,428 --> 01:00:43,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that's the problem.

803
01:00:44,169 --> 01:00:45,610
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was fake, it would be better.

804
01:00:52,190 --> 01:01:00,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

805
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:05,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Madam President, city councilors, and city clerk.

806
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:07,037
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Linda Coloso.

807
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,958
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 64 Forest Street in Medford.

808
01:01:10,478 --> 01:01:13,520
[SPEAKER_13]: As you know, I am the former business manager at the Medford Police.

809
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,901
[SPEAKER_13]: I was employed there for nine years and two months.

810
01:01:17,434 --> 01:01:26,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I was waiting to receive my COVID pay and my retro pay as I resigned on July 21st, 2023.

811
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:32,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Five weeks later, I guess the cost of living assessments were passed.

812
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:36,085
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the ink wasn't even dry on my resignation letter.

813
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I was informed that I would get it.

814
01:01:39,467 --> 01:01:46,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Local 25 had contacted the HR department here and they said I would get both the COVID pay and the COLA pay.

815
01:01:47,502 --> 01:01:55,969
[SPEAKER_13]: I went to visit the HR department last Wednesday and they looked at me kind of puzzled and said, I'm not on the list.

816
01:01:56,189 --> 01:01:57,510
[SPEAKER_13]: So now I'm concerned about it.

817
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:11,220
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, it's been a past practice in processing payroll for the last nine years and two months for police that any retired person or resignee police officer always received their pay.

818
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:15,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I'm not sure why they're stating that I may not get it now.

819
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:19,526
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was hoping I could get some clarity tonight on the timing of the processing of the payments.

820
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:21,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

821
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:22,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

822
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:36,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and in a municipality, anytime there is any any pay that was that was distinguished during a certain time when a retiree was on duty, they would

823
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:39,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It's automatic, this is confusing me.

824
01:02:39,353 --> 01:02:43,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's clerical error, but you can't do that.

825
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:46,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fair labor, I believe.

826
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,601
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's definitely a fair labor act issue.

827
01:02:48,621 --> 01:03:00,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're talking about, again, our working men and women in our community, they're telling you that the money that everybody's getting, while you were there too, by the way,

828
01:03:01,169 --> 01:03:05,130
[SPEAKER_03]: through the through the worst time of our hyperinflation, you were there.

829
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And it works every day during COVID.

830
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:07,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that.

831
01:03:09,132 --> 01:03:21,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the President can reach out to the city administration to get an answer by as soon as they can to get us an email that the chief of staff can inform us why this is happening.

832
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:22,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if there's anybody else?

833
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that how you're the only person?

834
01:03:25,737 --> 01:03:33,639
[SPEAKER_13]: The crime analyst, Rob McIntyre, he was told that he was going to receive it, and now they don't return calls, and they kind of brush him off.

835
01:03:33,819 --> 01:03:38,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe anything that's negotiated... Right, I was active in negotiations, and I worked.

836
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:46,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that's negotiated during the time that any retiree was still in place, they would be... I didn't retire, I actually resigned.

837
01:03:46,463 --> 01:03:47,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, or resigned, doesn't matter.

838
01:03:47,684 --> 01:03:55,586
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you're working during that time, you are giving the same amount, same treatment, same incentives that they received.

839
01:03:56,044 --> 01:03:56,985
[SPEAKER_13]: All my dues were current.

840
01:03:57,106 --> 01:04:01,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I attended all the meetings for the negotiations.

841
01:04:02,053 --> 01:04:09,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Shockingly, we have another issue with our labor question with our working men and women here at City Hall.

842
01:04:09,764 --> 01:04:10,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Shockingly.

843
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can, I think we need to get word on this and get get it back to us as soon as possible because if, if we haven't, if we have one that's one too many, it was city employees.

844
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:23,023
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I was an excellent employee.

845
01:04:23,043 --> 01:04:26,527
[SPEAKER_13]: I left six hours of sick time on the books.

846
01:04:26,728 --> 01:04:31,012
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like hard work didn't pay off in the city for me, you know, and a lot of people starting to feel that way.

847
01:04:31,926 --> 01:04:33,227
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why there's a mass exodus.

848
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:37,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, well, we can see that, but, you know, rumor has it there's a great team somewhere in here.

849
01:04:38,428 --> 01:04:39,129
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't seen it.

850
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:44,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think that, I don't know who to ask because I don't know what department's in and out, but- I'll reach out to the chief of staff.

851
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:45,991
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can go HR, chief of staff.

852
01:04:46,031 --> 01:04:48,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to reiterate that the contract expired July, 2019.

853
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:57,695
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking four years later, during a time of hyperinflation, worked every day during COVID, and I was supposed to receive both, and now they're acting like I'm not gonna receive anything.

854
01:04:58,817 --> 01:05:04,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and then ask if there's any other employees, because I bet you there's other employees that just washed their hands of Medford and said, what?

855
01:05:04,918 --> 01:05:06,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Typical Medford, they walk away.

856
01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:08,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they earned it, they deserve it.

857
01:05:08,299 --> 01:05:08,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

858
01:05:08,959 --> 01:05:10,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Just pay us what we deserve.

859
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,660
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, why invite more lawsuits?

860
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,540
[SPEAKER_13]: That's insanity.

861
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,520
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not feasible.

862
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,220
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not worth it.

863
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:14,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fair to you.

864
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:16,021
[SPEAKER_03]: You deserve it.

865
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:16,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

866
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:17,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get some answers, Madam President.

867
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:22,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if we can, I'll put it on as a resolution for our next meeting to make sure that we follow up.

868
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:22,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

869
01:05:22,782 --> 01:05:23,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck, everyone.

870
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:24,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

871
01:05:24,523 --> 01:05:25,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

872
01:05:28,032 --> 01:05:28,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll get that.

873
01:05:28,753 --> 01:05:29,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get that out tonight.

874
01:05:30,575 --> 01:05:32,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else for public participation?

875
01:05:36,623 --> 01:05:40,047
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the end of our agenda, I believe.

876
01:05:42,569 --> 01:05:45,990
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

877
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:52,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, before we adjourn, because of the election, our next regular meeting will be on November 14th.

878
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:54,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks have any issues?

879
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:58,193
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, email the council, call the council, and we'll get things sorted out.

880
01:05:58,213 --> 01:06:01,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So our next- Thank you, thank you.

881
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:04,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

882
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:05,194
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

883
01:06:06,034 --> 01:06:06,695
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

884
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:07,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

885
01:06:07,475 --> 01:06:08,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Meeting is adjourned.
