3
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:23,236
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole today at 6 p.m.

4
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:30,781
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Medford City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.

5
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:34,024
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the annual budget process.

6
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:36,225
[SPEAKER_05]: This is preliminary budget meeting number five.

7
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:41,789
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor has communicated that the following departments will be present, the library and the police.

8
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:44,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So without further ado, we'll go in alphabetical order.

9
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:52,458
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take the library, we have Director Kerr, and this is a little bit different from previous years.

10
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:53,819
[SPEAKER_05]: We are meeting with you before.

11
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,335
[SPEAKER_05]: the budget is fully presented.

12
00:00:56,355 --> 00:01:01,178
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, as I said, our fifth meeting, and we're excited to have you.

13
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:10,323
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have copies of your budgets in front of us, and I've basically been asking four questions of the department.

14
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:13,105
[SPEAKER_05]: One, what was your budget request?

15
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:20,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, are there any programs or other additions that you didn't request this year that you would be looking at in the future?

16
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,851
[SPEAKER_05]: and then asking you to share kind of the narrative of your budget for your department.

17
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:39,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of the presentation, I will just note that if we see a big change from today to when the budget is presented to us, we may invite you back in June for another round.

18
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:46,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So very quickly, I will just read off here the library budget.

19
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,028
[SPEAKER_05]: For fiscal 24, the budget was $2,012,177.

20
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,369
[SPEAKER_05]: The budget this year is proposed at $2,245,111.90.

21
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:17,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main changes there are in our fixed cost growth category with 104,000 involved in staff increases and moving the office manager from 30 hours to 35 hours.

22
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:27,701
[SPEAKER_05]: 44,000 also in the staff to ensure that there's a pay increase for the hourly part time and a $90,000 increase in data processing because the cost of tech in our new library is much bigger.

23
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:29,782
[SPEAKER_05]: than our old library.

24
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:31,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, I'll turn it over to you.

25
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:37,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have a fun infographic, if you wanna, I could pass that.

26
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:43,769
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a mixture of calendar year 2023 statistics.

27
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:49,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I have therefore 23 statistics, but there's a lot going on.

28
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:57,076
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went into the budget with three things in mind, the increase for the hourly part-time rate,

29
00:02:58,103 --> 00:03:03,051
[SPEAKER_08]: the increase in the tech line, and also we wanted to add a programming librarian.

30
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,394
[SPEAKER_08]: The hourly rate is great.

31
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:07,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody will be excited.

32
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And the tech, that isn't the original.

33
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:19,660
[SPEAKER_08]: We asked for more than that, but we made an agreement that we'd put this much in this year, and then the rest of it could go in next year.

34
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,742
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been covering the cost of the tech stuff out of the funding left from the construction project.

35
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:27,723
[SPEAKER_08]: So the last couple of years,

36
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:33,105
[SPEAKER_08]: we just that was our main goal was to like get our expenses into the actual budget.

37
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're almost there this year.

38
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:35,445
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the 90,000.

39
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:38,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was it.

40
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:44,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the programming library and we were not funded for but we are up for a Cummings grant.

41
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll find out next week whether we have it or not.

42
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:51,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would cover the maker space piece of our programming.

43
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:58,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So that will that will take a lot of the weight away from people so we can wait till next year for the programming piece.

44
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:10,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, and feel free, if you wanna walk through this infographic or share your budget narrative, we'd love to hear what you've been doing this past year and what you're going to be up to next year.

45
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I handed them all out, so I don't know what's on it.

46
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some extras here too.

47
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I did that with the directions to the after party of my brother's wedding too, that was disastrous.

48
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:28,750
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very busy and this year things are going up.

49
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:35,494
[SPEAKER_08]: We were pretty holding steady at 17,000 people a month last year and now we're up to 18 pretty much.

50
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:47,061
[SPEAKER_08]: The meeting spaces, we have five study rooms plus the maker space, the tech lab and the large program room and a children's program room and several children's study rooms.

51
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:55,086
[SPEAKER_08]: There've been 7,000 in 2023, there were 7,000 bookings of those rooms and the study rooms in particular are

52
00:04:55,706 --> 00:05:04,552
[SPEAKER_08]: book solid every day, which is terrific, because we're still a very open plan building, but if you want a quiet space, you can book a quiet space.

53
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:09,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the local history room, except people have been eating in there, so we're not sure about that anymore.

54
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:12,897
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had, I think we had 860 programs last year.

55
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,479
[SPEAKER_08]: There are programs practically every day.

56
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Children's does, from Baby Lapse It to

57
00:05:21,257 --> 00:05:31,749
[SPEAKER_08]: What are they sixth grade and then the teens have their whole scope of programming and we are where the teens go in the afternoon now which most times is good sometimes is terrifying.

58
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,732
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's really great that they are there.

59
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:38,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a we have a team advisory board who helps Nicole do a lot of

60
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:43,682
[SPEAKER_08]: plan the programming, they plan their own programs, and they get a lot of other kids in.

61
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:49,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's been very gratifying to have a space for them to be in finally, and that's been great.

62
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And children's is crazy.

63
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:58,679
[SPEAKER_08]: In the morning after the story times or the lap sits, the nannies all hang out in the cafe area and have coffee, and that's been a great.

64
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,361
[SPEAKER_08]: socializing thing.

65
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:08,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And this year we've actually started offering ESOL classes and citizenship classes, which is something I've been wanting to do for years, but we didn't have a room.

66
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:16,273
[SPEAKER_08]: So that started, we're doing two 12-week ESOL classes and they're full and there's a waiting list.

67
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:18,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're gonna continue with that next year.

68
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:22,919
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not exactly the budget, but we're very busy and we're,

69
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:32,787
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a great space, so we're trying to maximize the use of all the different rooms and the potential that it has.

70
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:37,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

71
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:38,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Director Kerr.

72
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:40,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the Council?

73
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:43,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

74
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:49,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just talk a little bit more about the data processing, what it covers, what the systems are?

75
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,667
[SPEAKER_08]: And why we don't change the name from the 1980s terminology?

76
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:58,469
[SPEAKER_08]: For us, data processing is tech, but not just physical tech.

77
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:09,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So it covers our network membership, the Minuteman Library network membership, plus there's a cost for telecommunications and digital content.

78
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,095
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a shared

79
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:12,977
[SPEAKER_08]: ebook platform.

80
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:21,043
[SPEAKER_08]: It also covers things, it also covers our TOS, which is the company that does tech support for the library, covers that.

81
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:22,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the two big things.

82
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:27,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have, but there's a, what is it?

83
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:28,748
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of fees for this.

84
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:30,089
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a laptop dispenser.

85
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,052
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a printing system.

86
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:35,794
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a traffic counting system in the ceiling.

87
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:40,917
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the platform for our newsletters, the platform for our summer reading program.

88
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:46,780
[SPEAKER_08]: and a bunch of databases, because we have Ancestry.com and Consumer Reports Morningstar.

89
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:54,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an amalgam of, oh, and we have two streaming platforms and a film streaming platform.

90
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:57,345
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's those guys and then little things that get stuck in.

91
00:07:57,405 --> 00:08:05,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're only two years old, we have not done a lot of purchasing of equipment, because it's holding up pretty well.

92
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:07,510
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's aging, they tell me.

93
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:10,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Did that make sense?

94
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:18,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions for our library director, Director Kerr?

95
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Vice President Collins.

96
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:21,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

97
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for being here.

98
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you other board members and trustees for being here as well.

99
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate this presentation.

100
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:34,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I also know me and several other Councilors were able to take you up on the invitation to attend.

101
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:40,101
[SPEAKER_07]: a public trustees meeting several weeks ago, maybe last month.

102
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:44,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Really appreciate the dialogue about where the library is at and the budgeting process.

103
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:55,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I say this about a lot of departments, but I really like these hearings for being able to just shine an extra spotlight on the work that the library is doing, that the work that the department is doing year round.

104
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:03,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I know during budget time, conversation is often like, what do we have to take to get what is on offer to the community?

105
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:16,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And the library is such an excellent example of what the community is getting out of the work that we're investing in, especially when you're talking about the programming that isn't even inside of the operating budget, but offers so much to, in many cases, the people in Medford who really need the most.

106
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:23,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Something like ESL classes, I know that was such a need to be within Medford City boundaries for such a long time.

107
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:28,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just very special to hear of this and other programming going on in the building now that we do have the new building.

108
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:47,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that moving into the new building has been kind of one of the central pieces of the library narrative over the past few years, going from that sort of artificially smaller budget during the interim space to now try to, you know, funding for the big, beautiful, modern, contemporary building that the library is now in.

109
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:58,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that was certainly a conversation last year and something that we'll be continuing to work through over the next few years to make sure that the library is supported to really be operating.

110
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:01,662
[SPEAKER_07]: at full capacity and bring that full capacity into the operating budget.

111
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:10,764
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just a note of acknowledgement and thanks to you and all the work that's going on behind the scenes all year round to make this such a useful space for the community.

112
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,045
[SPEAKER_08]: We really are being used.

113
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:12,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice.

114
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:13,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a very good crew, too.

115
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:14,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that.

116
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:21,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, the funding that you were able to get for us the last two years were much more stable than we had been for a long time.

117
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:22,828
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was good.

118
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:24,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's great to hear.

119
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:25,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

120
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's been put to really good use.

121
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:29,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I have just one small question.

122
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we've talked about this in the past.

123
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:39,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there was some of the part-time workers at the library, there was kind of a talk of a raise.

124
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,194
[SPEAKER_07]: There hadn't been a raise in several years.

125
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:52,999
[SPEAKER_07]: The under-fixed costs, the increase that was mentioned, the part-time pay increase for hourly part-time, does that cover the proposed raise, or is that

126
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:54,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, that covers the raise.

127
00:10:54,867 --> 00:11:02,710
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually more than I had originally asked for, because they calculated the increase, so that's good.

128
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we had people who were getting less than minimum wage, so now they're not, so that's good.

129
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:10,953
[SPEAKER_08]: And then everybody else is going up a dollar, so that's good.

130
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:11,493
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

131
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:12,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they haven't gone up since 2019.

132
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:17,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm so glad that we're bringing up that baseline this year.

133
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:20,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know off the top of your head, what is the amount of the raise per hour?

134
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:22,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a dollar an hour.

135
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:22,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

136
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:24,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for everybody.

137
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:27,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

138
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

139
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions by members of the council for the library director?

140
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:35,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, I have a few.

141
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,703
[SPEAKER_05]: One, I just want to confirm, there's no headcount increase in the budget as far as I could tell.

142
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:47,566
[SPEAKER_05]: The only real major change is the 30 to 35 hours for the business manager?

143
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

144
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:50,248
[SPEAKER_08]: No new positions.

145
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:51,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

146
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:55,156
[SPEAKER_05]: A follow-up on the part-time hourly salaries.

147
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,317
[SPEAKER_05]: You said that the last time that had gone up was 2019.

148
00:11:57,638 --> 00:11:58,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

149
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to put it out there.

150
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:08,083
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason that they were making less than the minimum wage is that technically cities and towns are exempt from the minimum wage law in the Commonwealth.

151
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:09,364
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was not illegally.

152
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:12,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, the laws of the Commonwealth allow that.

153
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:14,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad to see that that's changing.

154
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:19,411
[SPEAKER_05]: My last question is kind of a three-parter.

155
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:24,436
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned around new staff and programs that you'd be looking for in the future, the program librarian.

156
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:27,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you talk a little bit more about that, what that job does?

157
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Has that job existed in the past?

158
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:36,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, are there any other programs or staff that you would like to see maybe in future budgets?

159
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:37,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is a tough year.

160
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:40,007
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the main one.

161
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:46,370
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the piece of our operation that is kind of new because in the old building, we had one room.

162
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,692
[SPEAKER_08]: So we didn't have a lot that needed to be coordinated.

163
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:53,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus we didn't have enough staff anyway.

164
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:58,356
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody did a piece of the programming and that's what we're doing right now.

165
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:07,160
[SPEAKER_08]: My assistant director does the majority of the adult programming, but there are several other people who pop in and then children and teens do their own.

166
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:19,918
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of it's a it's much expanded because we've got all these spaces now and there's a lot of demand and there's a lot of there's a lot of demand it when you only have one room.

167
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:27,063
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only have four or five things a week, and now we can have things in multiple rooms and some nights there's five things so.

168
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:37,772
[SPEAKER_08]: What we've been trying to get away from the last few years is having everybody who works there do five jobs, because really they were hired to do one job.

169
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:42,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And at this point, it's pretty good, actually.

170
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:48,203
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first time for me since 1993 that I'm only doing one job, which is, that's progress.

171
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:50,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but this is the piece.

172
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:56,779
[SPEAKER_08]: it really would be better if there was one person focusing on all of the programming.

173
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,948
[SPEAKER_08]: They would be more focusing on the adult stuff, but coordinating everything, doing multi-year planning, which is not something that we do right now.

174
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:15,257
[SPEAKER_08]: We do our programming sort of quarterly and we're still in that model because the people who are doing it are doing other things too, it's not the priority.

175
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:27,064
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a new position and it is a new focus, but I think it would be very valuable because we're doing so much programming and there's so much demand.

176
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:36,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sam, who is my assistant director, she does a lot of the maker space stuff, but she's really limited because she's assistant director and there's so much demand for more stuff.

177
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that would be good if we do that.

178
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if we do get the Cummings grant,

179
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,432
[SPEAKER_08]: the makerspace piece will be able to maximize that and plan for several years.

180
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:55,175
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other stuff is still a little bit of a catch all, depending on who has time to do a program or sit down and schedule something.

181
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:09,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And my last question, you mentioned that some of this is bringing onto the budget items that have been funded temporarily by the Metro Public Library Foundation, part of the new building.

182
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:13,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else that needs to be brought over from that?

183
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:19,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, is there anything that was being funded at the library by ARPA that is being brought onto the general fund?

184
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:21,008
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have any ARPA.

185
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,068
[SPEAKER_05]: No ARPA, okay.

186
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,949
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends.

187
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I was talking to Nina, wherever Nina is.

188
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:32,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We may be combining the tech support.

189
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:40,779
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we do that, there may not be anything else that needs to be brought over, but we'll find out about that.

190
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:51,706
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be a little bit, there are still, there's still some money in that account and it was intended for building stuff, for furniture fixtures and equipment.

191
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:53,267
[SPEAKER_08]: So we may use that.

192
00:15:54,383 --> 00:16:01,751
[SPEAKER_08]: like I'd like to add a few more cameras in places, but things like that, or I've got a little bit of furniture on order now, but it'll depend.

193
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:07,218
[SPEAKER_08]: We might need to bring over a bit more depending on how this year goes, but we may not, so.

194
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:09,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, that's great to hear.

195
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:17,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were some large expenditures the last few years, just because we were moving in and like we had to, the way we had the tech lab set up was silly.

196
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:22,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had to reorganize that and get some more computers and things this year, but that's a one-time expense.

197
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:25,497
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't see anything really major coming.

198
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:27,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

199
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:29,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions by members of the council?

200
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:36,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, is there anyone in the public who would like to comment on the library budget?

201
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:38,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Any members of the boards of trustees?

202
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,371
[SPEAKER_08]: No, apparently not.

203
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:43,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Feeling good.

204
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:44,092
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

205
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:45,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you then.

206
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:46,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

207
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:49,535
[SPEAKER_05]: We will certainly invite you back if anything changes.

208
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:50,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

209
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:53,316
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

210
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:56,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, we will go to Medford Police Department.

211
00:16:56,418 --> 00:17:00,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Chief Buckley and I will

212
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,806
[SPEAKER_05]: say once again, kind of the framing here.

213
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll quickly read the budget request.

214
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:10,010
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anything I missed, feel free to add on to that.

215
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:16,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'd love to hear about anything that wasn't requested this year that you'll be requesting in the future.

216
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:20,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to add that and share your narrative, and then we'll go to questions from the council.

217
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So very quickly, I will go here.

218
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:26,082
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Manford Police Department budget.

219
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:29,385
[SPEAKER_05]: We had for fiscal 24, $14,566,880 budgeted.

220
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:30,787
[SPEAKER_05]: For fiscal 25, the proposed budget is $14,785,259.

221
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had FY 24 budgeted total headcount 122, FY 25 total headcount 128.

222
00:17:48,943 --> 00:18:07,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the change sheet indicates that the fixed cost growth is $317,217 in full-time salaries, and then about $150,000, maybe $140,000 in a number of other items, court time, education incentive, academy tuition, professional services, and laundry.

223
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:13,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in terms of new expenses, there's some new expenses for data processing and for telephone.

224
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:15,642
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, I will turn it over to you, Chief Buckley.

225
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:16,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

226
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate the opportunity.

227
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:20,204
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my sixth budget presentation.

228
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing to me how fast time goes on.

229
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to introduce Lieutenant Joe Gagliardi.

230
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:28,309
[SPEAKER_03]: He is basically charged with administration of finance and the department.

231
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:29,270
[SPEAKER_03]: He's my numbers guy.

232
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:35,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we get into the depths of where money's being spent and what's in what account, he's my kind of assistant to come up in there.

233
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:43,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, to some degree, I consider this a level funded budget, but we did have to tighten our belt in some areas, right?

234
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,597
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand the fiscal situation the city's in.

235
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:49,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And so where we tightened our belt, we feel comfortable that we can get through that process.

236
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:58,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will always say, anytime I come to the city council, the one thing that we're going to be looking for now and are in the future is police officers, right?

237
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we feel that there's a certain number of police officers

238
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,785
[SPEAKER_03]: that are required to maintain public safety in the city.

239
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:07,367
[SPEAKER_03]: 112 has generally been the number over the last few years.

240
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:09,589
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been cut down this year.

241
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:12,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to make strides to get back a little bit closer to that number.

242
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:16,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's, you can see that reflected in the budget.

243
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:23,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, I don't, there's no other further asks that I think some of the increased costs will be related to, you know, we're in year,

244
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,425
[SPEAKER_03]: for going into year three or four of the new police station.

245
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:32,050
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of warranties are up or software needs to be renegotiated and that sort of items.

246
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:37,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll see increases in those areas as opposed to cuts in other areas.

247
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:42,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get it, it's tough fiscal year and that's where we are now.

248
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:46,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's anything specific I can address or...

249
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:50,790
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the next part of this that you would want me to talk about?

250
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:55,935
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to share a little bit about what you've done, Fiscal 24, any plans or new things you'd like to do in Fiscal 25?

251
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:56,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

252
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:03,274
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we've maintained sort of an increase in calls for services over the last year.

253
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:06,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did north of 36,000 calls for service.

254
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:12,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was told today as estimated that 50% of those even surprising me are 911 emergency type calls.

255
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:17,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So those types of things are increasing and keeping us busy.

256
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:23,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I am proud to say that the proactive calls for service, that means just that the police officers who are out there and

257
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:29,115
[SPEAKER_03]: and being visible in the community are up to about 28% of all of our calls for service.

258
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:30,897
[SPEAKER_03]: That has kind of

259
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:47,465
[SPEAKER_03]: continues to increase, and it continues to be sort of a sign that the police department is vested in the community and is active and is out there kind of helping with those regular and ordinary issues, whether it's traffic or just presence issues.

260
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:53,426
[SPEAKER_03]: We have pursued our community engagement unit, and we increase the support.

261
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:55,606
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been to a number of different events throughout the year.

262
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:58,267
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably received the 2023

263
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,070
[SPEAKER_03]: annual report from the police department.

264
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:10,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you guys have gone through that pretty extensively and to give you an idea of all the things that we've been involved in throughout the year.

265
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:17,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Our behavioral support unit remains to be active and a vital part of what we do as an operation.

266
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:22,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you remember, I've talked about this over the past couple of years in behavioral support, we have three full-time clinicians.

267
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:30,297
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were one of the very few communities in all of Massachusetts where they actually respond to calls for mental health services with our police officers.

268
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:33,778
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't call them afterwards, they'll actually respond on scene.

269
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:42,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has, we do see an increase both in the number of calls, but both in the effectiveness of the police response when we have a clinician with us responding to those sorts of calls.

270
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:47,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So that continues to grow as a part of our operations.

271
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:51,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that body-worn cameras now have been in play, we continue to see

272
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:58,928
[SPEAKER_03]: some positives with that and we continue to monitor that as we grow and no major issues with that.

273
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:04,431
[SPEAKER_03]: As for fiscal 25, I've outlined three sort of short-term goals.

274
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:10,575
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them will be to continue to pursue the hiring and recruitment of qualified in a diverse workforce.

275
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:21,383
[SPEAKER_03]: every police department, probably across the country, but I can say specifically in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is concentrating on hiring and recruitment and maintaining police officers.

276
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:24,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't want to fall behind in that.

277
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:27,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we have a great police department for a great city.

278
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:31,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to attract and keep police officers as we've trained.

279
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:37,556
[SPEAKER_03]: The second short term goal for 25 will be to kind of concentrate those employees and, you know,

280
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:46,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Our officers take pride and satisfaction in the work that they do, and we in turn need to take some pride and satisfaction in them.

281
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:52,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And we concentrate a lot over this past year, and we'll do so in the future, on their physical health, their mental health.

282
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:56,566
[SPEAKER_03]: These are sort of epidemic problems in policing across the country.

283
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:00,428
[SPEAKER_03]: But also with some job career enhancements and development.

284
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:02,869
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a lot of training in the Medford Police Department.

285
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:03,690
[SPEAKER_03]: We increase that and go,

286
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:11,796
[SPEAKER_03]: But finally, and one of the things I'm going to be more proud of in fiscal 25 is that we are now moving forward to being an accredited police department.

287
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:18,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the hope that in fiscal 25 that we can become an accredited police department through the State Police Accreditation Commission.

288
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:27,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, this is our police department coming in line with the standards and best practices for all police agencies.

289
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So every state has

290
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:34,695
[SPEAKER_03]: standards and policies that are derived from a national level of police standards across the country.

291
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:41,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's good for liability purposes, it's good for professionalism, and it's going to establish

292
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:47,854
[SPEAKER_03]: more directives and more procedures for personnel to follow, but in the end, that is a good thing for policing, right?

293
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:52,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know what we're required to do, we know how to do it and we know why we're doing it.

294
00:23:54,458 --> 00:24:03,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is an extensive process and it essentially requires us to really dig deep into how we operate and do that.

295
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:08,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna overcome that goal in fiscal 25 and push towards accreditation.

296
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:11,930
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be a gold star for the police department for the city of Medford.

297
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:12,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

298
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:18,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Long term goals, while they slightly change over the years, they're always produced in our budget.

299
00:24:18,603 --> 00:24:19,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I can read them here.

300
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:27,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some of the things you're going to be used to hearing decreased crime rates with effective crime prevention strategies and proactive policing.

301
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:34,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Maintain law standard objective to making our community safe and desirable place to live, work and visit.

302
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:38,556
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to partner with the community to solve problems and improve public safety.

303
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:42,399
[SPEAKER_03]: We will maintain community policing as our guiding philosophy.

304
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,480
[SPEAKER_03]: We intend to recruit and retain diverse, highly skilled, and motivated police officers.

305
00:24:49,861 --> 00:25:05,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, over the last few years, taken up the long-term goal to maintain public contact through social media, and we see the increased importance of being able to connect

306
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:16,610
[SPEAKER_03]: our community through social media and so that remains one of our long-term goals is to to be out there visibly and publicly contacting, keeping the public abreast of what we're doing.

307
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:23,515
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to maintain a long-term commitment to the safety and well-being of our police officers as I've just addressed previously.

308
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:31,643
[SPEAKER_03]: We're and provide quality services for the mental health crisis is to our behavioral support unit.

309
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:37,610
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can grow that 1 of the things we are trying to do in this coming fiscal year, which I forgot to mention is bring on a.

310
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,792
[SPEAKER_03]: bring into our police department a recovery coach, right?

311
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:44,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So it used to be done through the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

312
00:25:44,373 --> 00:25:48,254
[SPEAKER_03]: We think it's a perfect fit to bring that into our behavioral support unit in the police department.

313
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:55,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some negotiations with Elliot Services and DMH and some other avenues to make that happen and increase that unit.

314
00:25:56,815 --> 00:26:01,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, I mean, in general, those are our long-term, short-term goals.

315
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And we think we've,

316
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:07,212
[SPEAKER_03]: had a pretty productive year.

317
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to grow as a police department.

318
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:14,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I will take this opportunity to tell you right now that I'm very proud of the women and men of the Method Police Department.

319
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:17,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate everything that they do every single day out there.

320
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not easy.

321
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:26,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I recognize that it is not easy job, but they do an outstanding job and they're committed to what they do and they're committed to this community.

322
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:29,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So I probably thank them when I have this opportunity.

323
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:31,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chief Buckley.

324
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the council?

325
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:36,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro.

326
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here.

327
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate this really clearly very level funded budget here.

328
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:47,268
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, things are going up, things are going down.

329
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:50,411
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking almost the same as last time.

330
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:54,514
[SPEAKER_00]: As a new councilor, I have a couple clarifying questions.

331
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:55,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

332
00:26:55,435 --> 00:27:02,361
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really looked at the budget at this scale before, but just to help me understand,

333
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:09,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that overtime is calculated here, it's gone down.

334
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:17,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Overtime for officers has gone down by $50,000 from last year's budget, but it's separate from holiday pay.

335
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:18,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you help me understand how that's negotiated?

336
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that part of the contract for officers or is it based on something else?

337
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:25,634
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that and is it

338
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,388
[SPEAKER_00]: how is overtime calculated?

339
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so yes, it's contractual.

340
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:42,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but overtime for patrol officers would be any rank of police officer with the exception of the chief, but that has to perform work above and beyond their, let's say 40 hours of work service.

341
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:50,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could be shift coverage for vacation time shift coverage for sick time when we meet, we have to maintain a minimum standard of police officers.

342
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:57,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but it could be other could be training we send certain people to training over times and there's a separate line item for the cover on those.

343
00:27:58,716 --> 00:28:04,961
[SPEAKER_03]: We feel that it's a, you know, like we're tightening the belt there on the on the 1.15 million, but I will tell you this in the 6.

344
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:15,806
[SPEAKER_03]: The overtime budget prior to this, prior to me becoming chief was probably, I think it was estimated at $1.8 to $2 million a year.

345
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:19,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So we continue to work hard on our overtime budget to bring that down.

346
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:22,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's another stretch.

347
00:28:23,143 --> 00:28:28,186
[SPEAKER_03]: overtime budget relates to extra work performed by police officers, not say pay detail work.

348
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:32,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Holiday pay, as you mentioned, is simply that we don't get holidays off, right?

349
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:39,614
[SPEAKER_03]: So when Christmas comes, we come to work and the officers get a payment for that day instead of the day off.

350
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:41,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why there's a line item for that.

351
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:47,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's increased payments per contract is if you come to work and you actually work the shift, then you get it off.

352
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,721
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't come to work, well, you didn't get a holiday, so you get paid for that holiday.

353
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:54,442
[SPEAKER_03]: That's contractual, and it's a number that we have to abide by.

354
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:59,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It paid for the 13 holidays that is contractually committed to by the city of Medford.

355
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.

356
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:18,293
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a possibility to kind of schedule creatively to sort of try to tighten up overtime, which sounds like you've been attempting to do, and it looks like you're trying to do with this budget in the same way.

357
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:19,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

358
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:20,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to always look.

359
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:23,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at it weekly, if not daily.

360
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:29,258
[SPEAKER_03]: We do work on that often, too often.

361
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:36,666
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just very quickly did like, just divided that it would be about, it's budgeted around

362
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:39,286
[SPEAKER_00]: $10,700 per officer.

363
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:43,509
[SPEAKER_00]: But is that is is does that usually work out evenly?

364
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:47,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it it depends on who's on staff that day?

365
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:47,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just it?

366
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:51,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends because per contract.

367
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:52,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So it depends.

368
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:55,417
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't always doesn't ever work out evenly across the board.

369
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Some ranks will get paid higher, of course, but the patrol officers generally have more overtime work assigned to them.

370
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:07,024
[SPEAKER_03]: But we still maintain our overtime.

371
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the overtime majority is voluntary.

372
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:14,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if there's an overtime opportunity, we look to establish a list.

373
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:18,190
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've signed up and willing to work overtime, you'll get that overtime opportunity.

374
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't sign up to work the overtime, you won't get offered it.

375
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:26,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we don't have anybody and we have to force officers or we assign in advance for emergency type situations.

376
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:32,010
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not across the board because it's a voluntary situation.

377
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:40,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that there's a lot of moving parts to this and everything has scales and everybody's trying to fit the puzzle pieces together.

378
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:41,298
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you coming out.

379
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:43,480
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a good opportunity to talk about how it works.

380
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to understand it all, so thank you very much.

381
00:30:47,063 --> 00:30:51,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It is complicated, but it's a chance to tell and explain some of these questions.

382
00:30:51,928 --> 00:30:53,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We will take advantage of it.

383
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:55,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

384
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor  Tseng, Councilor Callaghan.

385
00:30:58,254 --> 00:30:58,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor  Tseng.

386
00:30:58,935 --> 00:30:59,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

387
00:30:59,715 --> 00:31:01,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You talked a bit about accreditation.

388
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:02,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a really exciting prospect.

389
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:10,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that is done mostly more through policies, or does the budget have a big impact on that?

390
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:13,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And does this proposed budget move you towards accreditation?

391
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mostly policy.

392
00:31:16,562 --> 00:31:20,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's policy procedures, how we carry out our daily operations.

393
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

394
00:31:20,851 --> 00:31:24,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And but of course, there could be financial impacts on that.

395
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:24,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

396
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:24,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And.

397
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:43,034
[SPEAKER_03]: accreditation will look at every aspect of not just say is your use of force up to standards of Commonwealth of Massachusetts or what other police departments, but we'll say is it will look at your like HVAC system, it'll look at your security of your police station and look at all these other things.

398
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:45,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you fall below that, you have to kind of maintain it.

399
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:48,037
[SPEAKER_03]: We're lucky in that this is the first time we've

400
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:54,200
[SPEAKER_03]: could have started this a couple of years ago, but our prior police station wasn't capable of passing any accreditation.

401
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have a modern police station, and we're able to kind of carry that through.

402
00:31:58,943 --> 00:32:04,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the exception of regular maintenance to a lot of the equipment that we have, we don't see any increased costs that's related to it.

403
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:08,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So we feel it's the perfect time to kind of seek and push for accreditation.

404
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:18,215
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's say in the future, some standard, physical standard of your facility doesn't meet standards, then we would not be re-accredited, and we'd have to find funds for that.

405
00:32:18,595 --> 00:32:27,023
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's not necessarily an increased cost in personnel of assigned a lieutenant and an officer to kind of work through this whole process.

406
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,285
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already sort of on payroll.

407
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:33,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just sort of a reassignment of a special project to get us through this.

408
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:44,578
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of work that goes into it, but I don't expect or see additional costs related to this budget that's not already covered for in here under general salaries and other facility type costs.

409
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:49,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's super helpful for us as Councilors to learn about and to hear.

410
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:51,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mostly a lot of paperwork.

411
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I trust you.

412
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:07,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also curious about, you know, are there any positions that are on grants or funds that aren't being carried over to this budget or are being carried over but require a certain amount of spending?

413
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:09,586
[SPEAKER_04]: to be kept up?

414
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:19,048
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sorry, we have no positions that are funded through a grant per se, with the exception of our clinicians, right?

415
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:22,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're funded full-time through a DMH grant for the department and they're civilian type.

416
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:26,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone else is, all of our other employees are on here.

417
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that doesn't say that we don't receive grant money, right?

418
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:33,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have 9-1-1 grant monies, we receive grant monies from other different states,

419
00:33:34,352 --> 00:33:37,814
[SPEAKER_03]: agencies are funded agencies and they go into kind of supplementing some of the things.

420
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:48,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So the state, say 9-1-1, will require that everyone who answers the phone for 9-1-1, which is generally most of our police officers, undergo 16 hours plus hours of training and additional related to this.

421
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,800
[SPEAKER_03]: They will pay the costs of doing that.

422
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So they go forward and they do that and they pay those costs.

423
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:56,663
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll pay costs for replacement of equipment that's in the 9-1-1 center should they break.

424
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's not unlimited, right?

425
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:07,210
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll go to even a chair if you needed a new chair, but you only have a certain amount of money every single year under a state 9-1-1 grant to sort of fund that.

426
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And then occasionally we see, we have a common trend, so we use that, a lot of that to support our community engagement unit, right?

427
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:24,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we, it's not fund, we don't have no ARPA employees, we don't have any other grant employees that we're gonna lose, they're all budgeted employees, and we continue to kind of supplement what we do through grants.

428
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:30,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those grants that you brought up, does the city also have to pay in a certain amount for,

429
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:33,790
[SPEAKER_03]: match a certain amount or... In those, no.

430
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:44,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Occasionally, we'll see something like, you know, emergency management type grant where it'll be 50-50 and if we need something that we can afford to fund it that way, we'll do that.

431
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:55,163
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a regular type basis, but I can't think of anything else where we're paying into the grants that we get are just fully... We spend the money, they reimburse us in the same fiscal year.

432
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:55,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

433
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:56,744
[SPEAKER_03]: That's essentially how they run.

434
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:57,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

435
00:34:57,404 --> 00:34:57,985
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones we're using.

436
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for your answers.

437
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:01,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your service, both of you.

438
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:04,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And we really appreciate your work.

439
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:04,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

440
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:06,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Councilor Callahan.

441
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

442
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:10,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Lieutenant Caglioti.

443
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:11,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, wonderful.

444
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:14,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you both so much for being here and for all the work that you do all the time.

445
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:18,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious, again, one of the newer city councilors.

446
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:29,187
[SPEAKER_01]: about how the estimates for court time work looks like from 40 to 60K and just curious about how you budget for that.

447
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:36,209
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll probably be able to get deeper into the numbers, but I'm going to explain this in real sort of like easy terms.

448
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:41,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Our officers are obviously required to go to court for many things that we do, right?

449
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:44,734
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just arrest, it could be criminal compliance, it could be witnesses to different things.

450
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:51,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-COVID, so pre-2020, our court time budget, I think was $70,000, $75,000 a year.

451
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:52,839
[SPEAKER_03]: We sort of stretched it.

452
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:54,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Police officers were always going to court.

453
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,261
[SPEAKER_03]: But we carried that same budget, say, into 2020, 2021, 2022.

454
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:57,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And the

455
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:03,224
[SPEAKER_03]: courts have never really got themselves back.

456
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:10,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually we do a lot of whether it was zoom type court hearings and or just handling things and we didn't have a need to spend that much money.

457
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:11,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's changed.

458
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:14,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's starting to up the uptick is to go back.

459
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:18,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're, we're going to go over our line item this year on budget, we'll be able to cover it for this year.

460
00:36:18,986 --> 00:36:24,147
[SPEAKER_03]: But based on that overage, we know that we have to increase for next year, because there will be more officers going to court.

461
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:28,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you have anything you want to add, Lieutenant, but it's pretty ever since those changes.

462
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:32,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We just basically, let's have, if you could just speak into the microphone, sorry.

463
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:47,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since those changes were implemented, we just basically took an average court times paid once a month on the second Wednesday, and we're just taking what the costs have been recently, once a month times 12, and that's all, that's basically it.

464
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:50,635
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for asking that question, because I got him to work now.

465
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:51,916
[SPEAKER_03]: At least he got to answer something.

466
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:53,543
[SPEAKER_03]: keep them up.

467
00:36:53,644 --> 00:37:02,772
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, there's there's there's a few items like that, that because of, you know, 2020 and 2021, the post COVID or it's just we're coming back to normal now.

468
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:04,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And costs go up.

469
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:07,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

470
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:08,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys.

471
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:10,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions from members of the Council?

472
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Vice President Collins.

473
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any questions.

474
00:37:15,303 --> 00:37:16,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Very straightforward.

475
00:37:16,143 --> 00:37:16,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Really appreciate it.

476
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:20,227
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you so much for coming here every year and walking us through it.

477
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:21,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

478
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:27,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for well, they might be more questions, but I do always appreciate the opportunity to talk about the police department.

479
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:31,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's just appreciate it.

480
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:32,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few.

481
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:38,112
[SPEAKER_05]: So just a couple quickly is the accreditation through the post commission.

482
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:39,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that or is it a private accreditation?

483
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:42,354
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it's an interesting question.

484
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's a private accreditation.

485
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mass state accreditation.

486
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:50,238
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, your brain is working in the right direction.

487
00:37:50,258 --> 00:37:54,660
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot of I have a lot of conversations with both the post commission and now the accreditation commission.

488
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:02,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some thought that to help police departments become post certified in the future that they should be mass

489
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:04,665
[SPEAKER_03]: police accredited.

490
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:08,748
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are accredited, you're already meeting certain standards and will help the post commission.

491
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:11,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is my guess that that is going to happen.

492
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but it's not a requirement right now.

493
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:17,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of along the same lines, the education incentives a pretty big chunk of your budget.

494
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:23,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that mostly related to officer certification and like on duty related education?

495
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it kind of wide open?

496
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,527
[SPEAKER_03]: That is related to college degrees.

497
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:33,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are certain collegiate degrees, criminal justice, and we've expanded over the years.

498
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have that degree, you get paid X percentage amount.

499
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be the old Quinn Bill that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts suddenly stopped funding.

500
00:38:42,555 --> 00:38:44,656
[SPEAKER_03]: We do really feel like a lot of things.

501
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:48,898
[SPEAKER_03]: We do feel that having educated police officers, right?

502
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:55,039
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been numerous studies that educated police officers lead to better police public encounters, right?

503
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's been proven over and over again through study after study.

504
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,100
[SPEAKER_03]: This educational incentive simply goes towards that, right?

505
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, throughout the years, the language on the contract has been adjusted.

506
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:12,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, for the first couple of years, you could get a percentage of that, but then after three to five years, three years, you get 50% of it, 100% after five years,

507
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:15,723
[SPEAKER_03]: based on degrees.

508
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:19,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so many educated officers that that number is higher, of course.

509
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:31,088
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other part is like, there's no way to really tell which police officer you currently have on your job that is seeking to obtain a degree or to increase their degree from say a bachelor's degree to a master's degree.

510
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:37,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So we always have to kind of budget to be able to cover any of those increased costs.

511
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:39,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And we always encourage them to go to school.

512
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:47,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to clarify, so it's if they have the degree, there's an incentive pay, not that we're paying, or is it that we're paying for them to get the degree?

513
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:49,857
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not paying for them to get the degree.

514
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:50,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the after.

515
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:51,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the after.

516
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:54,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you have a degree, you get the incentive.

517
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:55,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

518
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:55,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

519
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:01,146
[SPEAKER_05]: The recovery coach for fiscal 25, is that staying with the health department?

520
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:05,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I know that was kind of a grant funded and maybe in a tough spot.

521
00:40:06,013 --> 00:40:13,239
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be grant funded and it's an open question, but we think for fiscal 25, it'll be within the police department.

522
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:13,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

523
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Subject to change.

524
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:15,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

525
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:20,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a lot of, there's still a lot going into that, including how much it's going to cost us, right?

526
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:20,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

527
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:23,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got two more quick questions and I have a question on the head counts.

528
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,610
[SPEAKER_05]: The professional services, legal fees increase.

529
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:31,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, is that going, I'm just wondering why it's outside of the law department budget.

530
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a lot of other things that go into that account, right?

531
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,741
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of our professional fees that we have to pay for a police department.

532
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:52,164
[SPEAKER_03]: But since Bruin, which is like a lot of things have changed and you're getting challenged now on every single one of my decisions that are related to your license and with firearm, and there are legal fees, I get sued every single time.

533
00:40:52,204 --> 00:40:55,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you're getting sued over firearms licenses, basically.

534
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:55,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Like weekly.

535
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:56,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all right.

536
00:40:56,945 --> 00:40:59,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not that much, but yeah.

537
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:01,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what is SonicWall?

538
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:05,994
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just our defense and our service systems.

539
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:08,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, yeah, I just didn't, it's got a fun name.

540
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:12,858
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, my last question is on the headcount.

541
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:15,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a multi-parter.

542
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:22,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Councilor is saying, you answered the question, there's nothing that's ARPA funded that's coming onto the general fund in this budget.

543
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:28,747
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going from 102 to 107 on patrol and then one dispatcher.

544
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I'm wondering kind of two things.

545
00:41:33,703 --> 00:41:37,246
[SPEAKER_05]: It's described as fixed cost growth, but to me it's new positions from fiscal 24.

546
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:44,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering if you could just go a little bit more into why that's being considered a not a new position, but a fixed cost change.

547
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:59,413
[SPEAKER_03]: We have maintained, we maintained and we have since I've become chief that, I was gonna say acceptable, but that's probably not the right word, but a workable number of police officers for this city is 112.

548
00:41:59,674 --> 00:42:04,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I will tell you that, and like everybody else, we'll talk about this one.

549
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:08,040
[SPEAKER_03]: In 98, when I became a police officer, we were at like 138, 130 something.

550
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And throughout the years, we've lost numbers

551
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:16,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the entire position, from chief down.

552
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:21,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And so today as we sit, we're at 97 looking to fill positions.

553
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:26,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Things have changed and we've adjusted.

554
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:29,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometime right before I became chief of police, the number was 112.

555
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:32,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an effective number to kind of carry that.

556
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:33,348
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the patrol.

557
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:36,510
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for the entire department, chief down, 112.

558
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:40,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So we try to maintain that in our budget.

559
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:51,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And last year, and I think two years prior to that, I'd have to go back and look, when there was some budget matters that had to be resolved, we were cut 10 bodies each year.

560
00:42:51,982 --> 00:42:52,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went from 112 to 102.

561
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I misread.

562
00:42:55,584 --> 00:42:57,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 102 to 107 across the board, not patrol.

563
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:58,305
[SPEAKER_05]: My apologies.

564
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:58,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

565
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:02,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, but last year it was, it was 112 to 102 and then the year prior.

566
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:05,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, it's sort of, they're not really new positions.

567
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:09,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just looking to fund them back to try to get back to the one to provide effective public safety.

568
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:09,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

569
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:13,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main reason I ask it is it is a difficult year.

570
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:19,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it sounds like we're just trying to get half of halfway back to where we wanted, where we were a few fiscal years ago.

571
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:19,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

572
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:25,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to raise that point because I think it's important for people to understand what's going on.

573
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:33,708
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the light of proposals in other departments, I mean, we're talking about net 20, maybe net 40 loss in the school department.

574
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:39,533
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need to have all the information out there to explain why things are happening the way that they're happening.

575
00:43:39,973 --> 00:43:40,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a fair question.

576
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:45,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I think I think you at least understand why we're pushing for doing this.

577
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:50,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you review the budget, you can see that we've made cuts in other areas to try to kind of stay.

578
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:55,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the term level funded, but I think we all know what we're talking about to try to

579
00:43:56,084 --> 00:43:58,065
[SPEAKER_03]: compensate for this because we do need people.

580
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:00,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately our job is a people's job.

581
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:02,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the effort completely in the money.

582
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:08,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are going to point to the headcount, you know, and I just think it's important to have a holistic conversation.

583
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:16,173
[SPEAKER_05]: My last two questions, you said you're at, so we're budgeted for 102 and we're at 97 right now?

584
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:16,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

585
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:21,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you're hoping to fill 10 vacancies hopefully if this budget goes through as is?

586
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:25,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're hoping to fill 10 bodies.

587
00:44:25,986 --> 00:44:28,487
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the process of trying to fill five right now.

588
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:32,668
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just early in the stages trying to get through that process.

589
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:33,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

590
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:36,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, I think that's it.

591
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:40,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you expect any more retirements or vacancies this year?

592
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:47,513
[SPEAKER_03]: This fiscal year, we expect two to be, our term is aged out somewhere after January.

593
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:56,976
[SPEAKER_05]: And are you having difficulties with the applications getting enough folks in to civil service and to training?

594
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:01,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's increased over the last few years.

595
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,021
[SPEAKER_03]: We expect to see it's

596
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:13,713
[SPEAKER_03]: We were told somewhere around 56 people took the civil service exam for police officer and that list will be able to view June 1st.

597
00:45:13,953 --> 00:45:22,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really have an exact answer, but that number has increased from the last few years when that number was substantially lower than that.

598
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:27,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's drastic from the 800 when I came on the job, but that's the nature of the game.

599
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:30,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't probably answer that question.

600
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:34,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that we've gone through this current list, but come June 1st, there's going to be a brand new list.

601
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:40,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And we believe there's some 60, I'm sorry, 54, 56 individuals who have taken that test.

602
00:45:40,644 --> 00:45:42,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a positive for us when it comes to that.

603
00:45:42,945 --> 00:45:45,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be able to look at it there and see where it goes.

604
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Civil service now has that test every year, as opposed to every two years.

605
00:45:48,428 --> 00:45:49,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

606
00:45:50,196 --> 00:45:50,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

607
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:50,897
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

608
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:51,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

609
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:52,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that was a bunch of questions.

610
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,420
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big crowd out there.

611
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:54,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

612
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,361
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

613
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:57,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's orchestra.

614
00:45:57,483 --> 00:46:02,688
[SPEAKER_05]: The orchestra is coming to perform their statewide winning award winning performance.

615
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:05,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So want to get them in here as soon as we can.

616
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:10,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you want to say before I open it up to the public very quickly?

617
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:12,729
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I just, I will repeat myself.

618
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:17,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I owe the success of this police department to the police officers who are out there every day.

619
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:19,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I can always highlight the detectives.

620
00:46:19,454 --> 00:46:21,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I can always highlight my administrative staff.

621
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:22,276
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a bang up jobs.

622
00:46:22,296 --> 00:46:31,181
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the police officers that go out there every single day in the cruises and work overnights and holidays and weekends that really are the, you know, the depth of this police department.

623
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:32,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank them for everything they do.

624
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:34,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll leave it at that.

625
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:34,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

626
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:35,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

627
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:36,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

628
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:37,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your time.

629
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:41,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just looking to see if he had something else he wanted to say.

630
00:46:41,275 --> 00:46:43,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, can I also just one last thing?

631
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:49,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think Ronnie Tarantino is so Ronnie's the chief clerk and Ronnie's this is when I said this is my sixth budget in time flies.

632
00:46:49,117 --> 00:46:50,778
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably his 50th budget.

633
00:46:52,118 --> 00:46:54,479
[SPEAKER_03]: He worked a long time with Chief Sacco and I appreciate him.

634
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: He does everything with a pencil but he gets his numbers right and they're accurate.

635
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,920
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to point him out.

636
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for maintaining the pencil budget as long as we get it back there.

637
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:03,701
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's

638
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:07,623
[SPEAKER_03]: still maintains a big strong support for us, so I want to thank him.

639
00:47:07,723 --> 00:47:08,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, appreciate it.

640
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:12,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chief.

641
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:14,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, we do have traffic supervisors.

642
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:16,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go very quickly through that.

643
00:47:17,088 --> 00:47:21,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Traffic supervisors, we're going from 357, 650 to 361, 525.

644
00:47:22,952 --> 00:47:25,953
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that's fixed costs under the union contract, 2%?

645
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:27,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, yes.

646
00:47:27,674 --> 00:47:29,916
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, any questions on traffic supervisors?

647
00:47:31,502 --> 00:47:35,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, on the Traffic Commission, we're going from 27,800 to 30,500.

648
00:47:35,363 --> 00:47:40,124
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like that's a 2,700 increase in materials.

649
00:47:40,144 --> 00:47:41,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to speak to that?

650
00:47:42,745 --> 00:47:49,126
[SPEAKER_03]: In the very simplest terms, the Traffic Commission has been extremely busy this past year, and we expect that we're going to maintain our busy.

651
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:55,447
[SPEAKER_03]: But every time we go to the Traffic Commission, somebody says, hey, can you put up a stop sign here?

652
00:47:57,828 --> 00:48:02,213
[SPEAKER_03]: The bike was the post or any of those things that cost money and funds.

653
00:48:02,514 --> 00:48:13,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're looking for a very small amount of increase and kind of overcome some of that burden but that's what that funds are for the changes that the traffic commission as money for the Plex post coming from this but not all of it.

654
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:14,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using that as an example.

655
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be honest, man.

656
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:22,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know exactly where, but all of the decisions we make as a traffic commission, when we ask for it, like as a handicap sign, those things cost money.

657
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a struggle.

658
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:27,812
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been flat budgeted in line for that for years.

659
00:48:27,892 --> 00:48:29,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And the costs of everything are going up.

660
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:35,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's hard to sit in the traffic commission and say, I don't want to get to a point where I say, no, we can't put that sign up because we don't have funds.

661
00:48:36,415 --> 00:48:37,995
[SPEAKER_03]: The DPW does help us out.

662
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:40,156
[SPEAKER_03]: We do go beyond this and it does help us out with it.

663
00:48:40,176 --> 00:48:42,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's always somewhere in there, but that's what the increase for that is for.

664
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

665
00:48:44,217 --> 00:48:46,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions on the Traffic Commission, Vice President Collins?

666
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:52,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to say between things like the Post Commission and now FlexPost, you truly are working in an evolving field.

667
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,820
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you again for your service.

668
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

669
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I appreciate it.

670
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:56,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

671
00:48:57,861 --> 00:48:59,481
[SPEAKER_05]: With that, I'll open up to members of the public.

672
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:07,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anyone here who would like to speak on the Police Budget or Traffic Commission or Traffic Supervisors either in person or on Zoom?

673
00:49:07,023 --> 00:49:10,844

00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:49,628
