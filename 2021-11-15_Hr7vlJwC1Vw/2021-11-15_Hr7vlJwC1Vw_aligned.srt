1
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:32,463
All those in favor?

2
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:33,164
Aye.

3
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:34,004
All those opposed?

4
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:36,926
Six in favor.

5
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,769
Board of subcommittees, we do not have any.

6
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,051
Next up we have report of superintendent.

7
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,032
Superintendent's updates and comments.

8
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:48,553
Dr. Maurice Edward-Vinson.

9
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:05,674
Good evening.

10
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:09,237
I'd like to start with a public health update.

11
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:22,085
As we noted in the last two school committee meetings, I will be incorporating updates on public health and COVID-19 in my remarks going forward.

12
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:26,268
But of course, Ms.

13
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:32,612
Hines, Mr. Murphy, and other team members are available to answer any questions you might have.

14
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:44,898
Members, you've received our COVID-19 update memo in your email packets, and that document is also posted on the district website.

15
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:56,003
We did see a slight uptick in positivity in last week's surveillance testing, after we had dropped a minuscule 0.37% the week before.

16
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:18,811
Our 1.54% positivity was reflective of both the concerning community-wide numbers and a cluster identified in a program unaffiliated with Medford Public Schools that our health services team immediately notified the Board of Health about last week.

17
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:24,877
Despite the uptick in positive cases, we were very happy to report

18
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:38,800
that we maxed out participation in our NPS students-only COVID-19 vaccination clinic that was held at the Andrews Middle School last Wednesday.

19
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:53,564
Through our partnership with the Board of Health, we will be holding a second vaccination clinic for students ages five to 11 this coming Saturday, November 20th, from 9 a.m.

20
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:54,505
to 1 p.m.

21
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:56,025
at Medford High School.

22
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:03,690
Please be sure to sign up and we'll have additional communication about this event in the coming days.

23
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:14,137
It will be on the four-year side, so coming in through the main entrance, that is one piece of information for people to be aware of.

24
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:23,723
Finally, with respect to public health, today we issued a survey to both staff and parents and caregivers.

25
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:42,173
The survey which I have referenced in my last few Friday updates to the community was commissioned by Tufts University, who as you know, they have partnered with us to have one of the most successful coven testing programs in the state.

26
00:06:43,420 --> 00:07:02,113
The researchers at Tufts University are seeking to obtain data related to the barriers that districts faced in getting students back into school and how we can operate on a more equitable basis when it comes to COVID-19 and public health in general.

27
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,854
The surveys are voluntary.

28
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:11,179
of course, but all NPS community members are encouraged to participate.

29
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,741
So please check your email for that survey.

30
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:26,350
Also, being that November is the month of Thanksgiving, I have notes of gratitude to share with all of you tonight.

31
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:38,157
A special thank you to the families of the five to 11 year old students who participated in a very successful COVID-19.

32
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:44,082
Again, that was held last Wednesday at the Andrews Middle School.

33
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:48,986
Nearly 300 students received their vaccinations.

34
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:53,409
But we also want to send out some special thank yous.

35
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,912
First to the Medford Public Schools nursing team,

36
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:03,828
The city's Board of Health team who worked really hard to make this happen.

37
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:14,852
I would also like to thank our own CTE vocational health assisting students who are actively involved in supporting the vaccination clinic.

38
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:24,045
It is so wonderful to know that we are providing our health assisting students with real life experiences and training.

39
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:29,071
And we are so grateful to be holding a second clinic this Saturday.

40
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:51,174
I do wanna just make note that we were expecting 300 vaccinations for this coming Saturday, and we are going to have an increased number, possibly doubling that number if we could get up to 500 participants.

41
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:53,875
So I do wanna just say that in that section here.

42
00:08:55,386 --> 00:09:01,448
I also wanna send a sincere thanks to all of our veterans who came to Medford High School last week.

43
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:11,172
They took time out of their busy schedules to make presentations to all of our humanities classes on Wednesday, November 10th.

44
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:19,136
We truly appreciate their service and we were so glad to have been able to welcome them back into our classrooms this year.

45
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:22,237
So upcoming events,

46
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:28,364
This Saturday, mark your calendars, the COVID-19 vaccination clinic.

47
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:31,366
Please note that it is a location change.

48
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,987
I did say at the high school, it will not be at the Andrew School.

49
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,708
It is at the high school.

50
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:50,215
And since the Medford Board of Health secured an additional 600 vaccines, which is fabulous news, we are really excited about increasing the amount of participation on Saturday.

51
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,449
So please go back to the registration portal and sign up for a time.

52
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:59,958
We will also have walk-in appointments available.

53
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,883
So please do not miss out.

54
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:08,908
In that same vein of talking about the vaccination clinics, medical help is wanted.

55
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:20,771
We are looking for registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, and doctors who are authorized to administer shots to come out and help.

56
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:23,771
Please reach out to Ms.

57
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,512
Avery Hines, our health services director at 781-393-2292.

58
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:47,318
or you can email her at ahines, H-I-N-E-S, at medford.k12.ma.us if you are interested in volunteering at the vaccination clinic this Saturday.

59
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:50,639
Also on this Saturday,

60
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:59,871
The Greater Boston Girls on the Run event will be taking place in Medford at Hornell Stadium between 8 a.m.

61
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:00,912
and 11 a.m.

62
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:14,703
I believe we are expecting nearly 1,000 runners, and Mayor will be participating in running of her team, so we wish them a successful run this Saturday between 8 a.m.

63
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:15,284
and 11 a.m.

64
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:30,761
On Sunday, November 21st, our Mustang football team will be hosting the alumni flag football game at Hormel at 11 a.m.

65
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:33,682
on Sunday, November 21st.

66
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:42,806
On Monday, November 22nd, the Medford Public Schools wants you to come join our Mustang family.

67
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:56,744
The Human Resources Department will be hosting a job fair, an in-person job fair from 12 noon to 2pm and again from 3pm to 5pm on Monday, November 22nd.

68
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:17,828
There are many opportunities throughout our pre-K district, including substitute teacher positions, afterschool aides, paraprofessional positions, kindergarten aides, teachers, and CTE, trade-specific positions for our vocational school.

69
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:23,552
We also welcome retirees to join us at this job fair

70
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:28,915
And again, it will allow for in-person interviews with select staff.

71
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:36,460
Please plan to bring your proper identification and wear a mask again on Monday, November 22nd.

72
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:38,642
We look forward to meeting you.

73
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:44,926
Wednesday, November 24th, that is also our half day.

74
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:49,729
It will be the Mustang pep rally from 1130 to 12.

75
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:59,080
We are at this time still working out details, but the pep rally will take place outside in the field of dreams.

76
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,443
Again, final details are being worked out.

77
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,461
On Thursday, November 25th, it is Thanksgiving.

78
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:12,963
We're going to say let's go to our Mustangs as they take on Malden.

79
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:20,325
The game this year will take place in Malden for the annual Thanksgiving football game at 10 a.m.

80
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:24,967
Tickets can be purchased in the athletic office during Thanksgiving week.

81
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:33,123
Again, schools are dismissed at 1130 and noon on Wednesday for early dismissal.

82
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:38,268
Friday, November 26th, there is no school, so it is a long weekend.

83
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:51,859
On Sunday, November 28th, the Mustang Band parents begin hosting their annual Christmas tree and wreath sale at the high school parking lot from 10 a.m.

84
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,219
to 5 p.m.

85
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,636
on Tuesday, November 30th.

86
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:09,650
Medford High School will be hosting their first night of parent-teacher conferences, and those will take place in the gymnasium from 6 to 8 p.m.

87
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:15,896
And on Tuesday, November 30th, the programs that will be highlighted are EL,

88
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:28,003
our English learners program, science, math, wellness, and electives on Tuesday, November 30th for parent teacher conferences.

89
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:36,045
Our second event will be Thursday, December 2nd for continued parent teacher conferences

90
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:40,166
and they will be again in the gym from six to 8 p.m.

91
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:50,948
And on Thursday, December 2nd, the parent conferences will be for English language arts, social studies, fine arts, and world languages.

92
00:14:51,549 --> 00:15:06,112
So all of this information will also be posted online, but for those parents that are listening, please mark off Tuesday, November 30th and Thursday, December 2nd for parent teacher conferences at the high school.

93
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:23,772
November is National Native American Heritage Month, which acknowledges the unique contributions made by our first Americans for the growth and establishment of the United States.

94
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:46,595
President Biden noted in the annual proclamation, we honor our Native American veterans and service members who have courageously served and continue to serve in our armed forces, including the brave Native American code talkers in World War I and World War II.

95
00:15:48,395 --> 00:16:00,469
This month and every month, we honor the precious, strong, and enduring cultures and contributions of all Native Americans and recommit ourselves to fulfilling the promise of our nation together.

96
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:05,415
Lastly, since we will not meet again before Thanksgiving,

97
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:12,313
I would like to take this opportunity to wish all of our families an enjoyable holiday.

98
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:26,945
At the same time, Thanksgiving needs to be celebrated safely, and I am asking that all students, staff, and families rededicate themselves to our effective COVID prevention measures.

99
00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:35,962
It is important that we remain vigilant in our COVID awareness as we go into the Thanksgiving holiday.

100
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:43,188
Outside of school activities could greatly impact our exposure within school.

101
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:54,298
So please remember to wear a mask, meet with friends and family outdoors when possible, and stay home if you're feeling ill or recently exposed.

102
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:10,881
So in closing, I do wanna just share one final announcement that this Wednesday, we will be hosting a small clinic, vaccination clinic at the high school.

103
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:20,749
This is in partnership with an organization that also was part of the stop the spread sites.

104
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:29,561
This vaccination clinic will be taking place between 1230 and 2pm on the vocational side of the house.

105
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:40,366
And the preferred age group is for individuals who are over 18 years old or meet qualifications.

106
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:49,250
We did ask if there were going to be additional offerings, and we will get final information for that.

107
00:17:50,791 --> 00:18:00,681
There is a possibility that we may have some Pfizer vaccinations available for students that are 12 and older.

108
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:06,266
So we will have final details on that very small vaccination clinic.

109
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:12,470
which is hoping to vaccinate approximately 80 individuals.

110
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:19,693
We will have the final details on that tomorrow, and we will advertise it widely tomorrow.

111
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:24,515
That will take place on Wednesday, which is early release day at the high school.

112
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,137
And those are my announcements for the day.

113
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:28,677
Thank you.

114
00:18:30,395 --> 00:18:31,676
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

115
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:39,780
If I may, just from the chair, the vaccine clinic on Saturday, because of the girls on the run race, we have moved that to the high school, which you pointed out.

116
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,942
We just want to make sure people got a response that it would be at the Andrews.

117
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:44,943
That's not the case.

118
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:46,724
The vaccine clinic is at the high school.

119
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:48,025
Change of location.

120
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,067
Next up, we have

121
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:56,864
The MCAS Alternative Report, Director of Pupil Services, Ms.

122
00:18:56,905 --> 00:19:00,286
Joan Bowen, will report on the district's result for the MCAS.

123
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:10,550
The MCAS is administered to our students with significant disabilities who are unable to participate in the standard MCAS.

124
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,608
alternative assessment monitors student progress over time.

125
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:15,848
Ms.

126
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,148
Bowen.

127
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:16,969
Good evening.

128
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,354
Tonight I will be presenting on the MCAS alternative assessment.

129
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:30,140
As you know, students in Massachusetts are required to take the MCAS test and they can take it in three ways.

130
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:40,049
So the routine standard MCAS test, also the standard MCAS test with accommodations or the MCAS alternative assessment.

131
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:53,347
Students with disabilities take the standard computer-based or paper and pencil MCAS test, either with or without accommodations, at the grade level specified for assessment in that subject.

132
00:19:54,228 --> 00:20:01,656
But there are a small number of students with disabilities, with significant disabilities, who are unable to take the standard MCAS.

133
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:06,084
Those are our students who take the alternate assessment.

134
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:13,077
And this is about 1% statewide of all students with the most significant disabilities that take the assessment.

135
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:19,514
Medford Public Schools had 17 students participate this year in the alternate assessment.

136
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:27,016
And they all consist of a portfolio of specific materials that's collected throughout the school year.

137
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:39,140
And when I say the school year, it's typically September to March, and then the portfolio is sent into the, to DESE, where they score it and then send the results back late in the summer.

138
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:50,368
For each student that is on an IEP or a 504, their team decides how, not whether they'll participate in the MCAS assessment.

139
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:57,697
The teams make the determination using the guidelines found in the principal's manual for the MCAS alternative.

140
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:01,961
And our special education teams follow this decision-making tool.

141
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:20,016
I've included it in your packet and it's just a flow chart that they go through at every team meeting to indicate or to decide which student will be participating in the standard MCAS and which students will be participating in the alternative.

142
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:27,242
And then they have to make that decision for each content area that the student will be taking the MCAS testing in.

143
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:36,473
So part of the process is we have our teachers go to the training through DESE in the fall.

144
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:49,001
There are sessions throughout the school year that the teachers can go on to get further training or to have their students portfolios looked at and get feedback from DESE representatives.

145
00:21:49,981 --> 00:22:01,445
So once we identify the students going through the decision-making flowchart, each teacher will provide the student with a skill survey for each strand.

146
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:07,307
So they have to do this for English, for math, and if appropriate, for science, depending on the grade level.

147
00:22:07,988 --> 00:22:11,169
So for English, there's one reading and one language strand.

148
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,590
In math, there's three strands.

149
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,491
In science, there's three strands as well.

150
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:23,657
Based on the results of the skills survey, they select entry points or access skills.

151
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:28,560
And then the students participate in the same content areas as the grade level pair.

152
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,842
So if we're starting at grade three, it would be math and English.

153
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:45,371
We also have our veteran teachers who have experience compiling and creating the MCAS alternative assessments, work with our newer special education teachers who are required to do this.

154
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:56,015
So once the student is identified and the skill surveys is completed, the teacher has to set up the folder or the binder that will be presented to DESE.

155
00:22:58,016 --> 00:23:06,842
They select the measurable outcomes and classroom assessment activities, and they compile a binder following the DESE guidelines.

156
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:13,748
In your packet, I provided you with an example from DESE, and it starts with the strand cover sheet.

157
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:19,091
And this just is one strand or an example of a strand that the teachers need to do.

158
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:28,416
So they have to provide the cover sheet, which tells the learning standard that the work samples will be addressing.

159
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:31,638
They have to do include the skills survey.

160
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:37,620
There's a bar graph with student performance that looks at accuracy and independence.

161
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:41,142
And then there's also work samples that go along with it.

162
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:43,323
So this is not a Metro public school student.

163
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:45,944
This is just a sample from the department of education.

164
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:46,885
I mean, Jesse,

165
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:52,830
But this is the kind of work that the teachers are required to do for each one of their students.

166
00:23:54,681 --> 00:24:01,384
Once it's completed, the teacher meets with the guardian or caregiver and they review the binder and the parents sign off on it.

167
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:07,466
Once we receive the parent's signature, it's sent to DESE, where they look at it, they score it.

168
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:17,791
We get preliminary results in mid to late August, and then we get the final report at the same time the standard MCAS scores come out.

169
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:29,098
And then the parents and guardians and caregivers also receive a breakdown of what the scores are, what they mean.

170
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,241
And there also is a scoring rubric, which I included in your packet.

171
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:42,007
So they're looking at five different areas when they score a student's learning standard and materials that are sent in.

172
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:45,009
They wanna look at the level of complexity,

173
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:48,349
A demonstration of skills and concepts.

174
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:54,753
The level of independence that the student has exhibited when completing an assignment.

175
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,694
Do they need hand over hand?

176
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:57,815
Do they need visuals?

177
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:59,236
Do they need prompting?

178
00:25:00,346 --> 00:25:12,555
self-evaluation, this is the student providing feedback on how they felt that they did on the actual task that was at hand, and then generalized performance.

179
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:18,439
And that's a demonstration of knowledge and skills that they have provided samples.

180
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,782
And then I broke it down per schools.

181
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:25,076
Mr. Cushing, Dr. Cushing, if you could go ahead.

182
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:34,884
By each school and the grade level that the students participated in, the content area, if you can go to the next slide, please.

183
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:46,574
So this is the Roberts Elementary School, and there were two students in grade three and two students in grade four.

184
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:50,918
And this is the achievement level that they received in those two areas.

185
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:57,418
The next is the McGlynn Elementary School, and I broke it down the same.

186
00:25:57,478 --> 00:26:01,341
So we had three students at the McGlynn Elementary School that participated.

187
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:06,124
There's a grade three student, a grade four student, and a grade five student.

188
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:18,693
If you go to the next, which is McGlynn Middle School, which is the next two pages, we had sixth, seventh, and eighth graders, sixth and seventh graders participate.

189
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:24,686
And they also participated in English, math, and some participated in science as well.

190
00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:27,669
And the last is Medford High School.

191
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:28,910
We had three students.

192
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:35,135
We had two ninth graders who took the science and then one 10th grader who took the ELA and math.

193
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:45,594
There are several students that received an incomplete, if you see that on the chart, and we are looking at that right now with the teachers to determine why that was.

194
00:26:46,495 --> 00:27:00,888
Sometimes the learning standard doesn't match the curriculum framework, or there was not enough evidence that was submitted to support the student being able to receive the achievement of emerging, progressing, that sort of thing.

195
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:04,523
So these are the scores.

196
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:09,826
I do wanna let people know that we did not include the out-of-district results in this report.

197
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:18,850
We are still collecting those, and I will be able to follow up with those results as soon as we receive them from all of the out-of-district schools.

198
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:27,974
But the next steps for us is we continue to make these determinations on what students require the MCAS Alt Assessment.

199
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:31,797
Staff will continue to receive support from DESE.

200
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:44,976
We are scheduling check-ins with the special education coordinators for their specific staff who will be completing the ALT assessments, just to check their progress, answer any questions, make sure they're on track.

201
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:52,528
The completed binders should be done by mid-March for the final review from the special education coordinators.

202
00:27:53,208 --> 00:28:00,471
And then we will obtain parent signatures and submit to DESE by the deadline of March 31st.

203
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:03,732
Anyone has any questions?

204
00:28:05,593 --> 00:28:07,274
Member McLaughlin?

205
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:08,734
Thank you.

206
00:28:08,794 --> 00:28:11,335
Thank you for putting this report together, Ms.

207
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:14,496
Bowen, especially in the short amount of time that we had.

208
00:28:14,536 --> 00:28:15,637
So I appreciate that this will be

209
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:18,389
an ongoing report.

210
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:20,050
It's interesting information.

211
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:29,035
So 17 students in the district entirely participate in the ALT based on the grade levels for MCAS requirements.

212
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:34,398
And when you say a review with the binder with the parent and that there's a signature

213
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,563
required in March.

214
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:42,789
Do you know, like, have folks, because that's sort of the first I'm hearing about the review of the binder with parent and signature.

215
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:50,697
So is there communication with CPAC around how that's working and whether that's working or with your coordinators around how that's working?

216
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:53,117
So I believe the signature is required.

217
00:28:53,137 --> 00:29:00,159
So last year was very different with COVID and some parents may not have been able to come in to review it.

218
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:06,920
So they might've reviewed it via Zoom and then had the parents sign off on a different, like a separate sheet and send it in.

219
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:20,223
But I know that's something that we are required to do is to, to meet with the parent and to review the whole binder to make sure that they understand why we're doing the MCAS and all the hard work that the student has done throughout the year.

220
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,325
Yeah, that sounds like a really valuable process.

221
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:26,109
I'm just, I want to make sure that it's happening for parents because it's, yeah, that's great.

222
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:30,013
And we'll also, maybe we can check in with CPAC and ask.

223
00:29:30,294 --> 00:29:30,654
Thank you.

224
00:29:31,315 --> 00:29:35,479
And is the review with the binder and the signature happening?

225
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,702
And when you get the OO at a district, can you check?

226
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:43,009
if the review with the parent for the binder is happening with signatures on that as well, just to make sure.

227
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:45,252
Yeah, the other district should be meeting with the parent.

228
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:50,540
If they're not, we need to know about that because they are submitting the documentation and the evidence.

229
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,484
So we want to make sure that parents are aware that it's being sent in.

230
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,611
I couldn't agree more.

231
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:54,971
Okay.

232
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:55,771
Thank you.

233
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:58,893
And where did the portfolios live once they're finished?

234
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:01,795
So once the portfolios come back, we've set it up.

235
00:30:01,895 --> 00:30:06,598
So we, there's a cover sheet that provides us with the students results.

236
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:13,743
We put that in their special education binder, and then we send the portfolio home because it is their property.

237
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:14,543
It is their work.

238
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:16,585
So we want the parents to have it.

239
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:17,385
Oh, okay.

240
00:30:17,405 --> 00:30:17,925
That's great.

241
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:20,227
Thank you.

242
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:21,207
I think that's it.

243
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:21,808
Thank you.

244
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:24,365
Thank you, Ms.

245
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:24,625
Bowen.

246
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:25,466
Thank you.

247
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:32,912
Next up, we have a report on professional development for administrators.

248
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:41,618
Superintendent resident, Karen Williams will report on principal professional development programming that is occurring throughout the school year 21-22.

249
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:42,139
Ms.

250
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:42,499
Williams.

251
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,500
Good evening, everyone.

252
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,482
Thank you all for having me.

253
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:50,465
I do have a PowerPoint presentation.

254
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,550
that is coming.

255
00:30:54,932 --> 00:31:02,157
So this presentation is really an overview of the work that the district has been doing as a whole with its leaders.

256
00:31:03,218 --> 00:31:12,685
There have been several reports presented at committee meetings this year that explain the different levels of professional development and new assessments that the district has adopted.

257
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:19,471
And this piece of the work is how we are building system coherence in the district.

258
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:22,473
Next slide, please.

259
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:33,693
I modeled the process of collecting data and determining the direction for this work based on best practice in education.

260
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:41,177
Creating data cycles with student work is also important when you are looking at adult work.

261
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:48,060
So we collected data and analyzed it through an entry planning process.

262
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:53,583
When I joined the district, I had about 60 to 90 days of entry prep.

263
00:31:54,555 --> 00:32:03,559
And then there were goals set and that was done in some sense making meetings with the core team and the action planning.

264
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:12,242
So this presentation is an overview of where we are to date and hopefully I'll be able to come back and share out how things are going at another time.

265
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,803
So I guess this is an entry planning.

266
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:16,984
So with the entry planning,

267
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:19,894
I first began with a document dive.

268
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:23,096
It was July and many people were still on vacation.

269
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:29,460
So I was able to observe and review the newly adopted strategic plan and the ACES framework.

270
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:41,168
I looked at the strategic allocation of ESSER funds and the budget, the current teacher contracts and other contracts, as well as expectations for leaders.

271
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:43,950
And finally, student performance data.

272
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:54,779
This was prior to the most recent score report, but still relevant because of the goals that are outlined in the strategic plan.

273
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,664
Next, I went through all of the current initiatives and some of these are new.

274
00:33:02,205 --> 00:33:08,111
They're not all new, but definitely nuanced as a result of both the health and racial pandemic.

275
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:10,092
So we know that there have been

276
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:17,582
significant energy put towards parent engagement and social emotional learning.

277
00:33:19,423 --> 00:33:20,123
Next slide, please.

278
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:25,245
I also conducted several interviews.

279
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:33,349
I interviewed a variety of stakeholders, including some of our school committee members, leaders, teachers, and parents in the district.

280
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:38,631
And I asked all of them the same three questions, tried to collect data along the way.

281
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:40,912
And I want to share some of that with you today.

282
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:56,892
I was able to summarize some of those points and a lot of them were consistent across stakeholder groups, but I did summarize statements for the sake of time and I wanted to bring your attention to the highlighted one.

283
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,576
People are really proud of the school district's COVID response.

284
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:07,022
They credit that to the leadership team, as well as the entire school community coming together.

285
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:14,052
There are others here that I'm sure you'll want to read for the sake of time I'm going to move to the next slide.

286
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:21,262
When looking at a vision for success what people wanted to see in the next five to 10 years.

287
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:30,037
More than once it came up that clarifying roles, responsibilities, and expectations would help everyone move towards the same goal.

288
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:34,919
So we know that the strategic plan was adopted in May.

289
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:43,122
And so getting that communicated and out to everyone was really important at that point when I was collecting this data.

290
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:51,545
Also, if you look at this, there's a strong desire for student-centered learning, data usage,

291
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:56,009
autonomy and accountability, as well as a team culture.

292
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:02,894
So now I want to slow down just a little bit and talk about the barriers to success.

293
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:10,979
Again, I summarize the statements after collecting conversations from a variety of stakeholders.

294
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,222
So this is my language, but the community sentiment.

295
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:19,445
Communication is better, but not yet consistent enough or timely.

296
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:28,015
There appears to be a gap in the pace of change and individuals' readiness for change, leading to fatigue, confusion, and frustration.

297
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:32,118
There are too many silos for consistent collaborative work.

298
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:38,202
There is a desire for explicit accountability systems that foster growth.

299
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:45,286
And there is a need to communicate priorities and provide appropriate support through meaningful relationships.

300
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:49,209
That data was so critical.

301
00:35:49,977 --> 00:35:55,359
to the district taking next steps with professional development for administrators.

302
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:57,459
Next slide, please.

303
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:14,465
So the goals for the monthly administrator professional development meeting, and when we say administrator, we're talking about district assistant superintendents, the superintendent, directors, principals, and assistant principals.

304
00:36:16,693 --> 00:36:37,827
So first we wanted to find instructional leadership with a focus of continuous improvement, not to say that that hasn't been happening, but to have a shared understanding of what that looks like, especially since the role of principal has changed in the last 20 years and we had a significant pandemic that has shifted the way we work completely.

305
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:43,991
Develop data collection and analysis skills for decision-making.

306
00:36:45,985 --> 00:36:56,148
In the past, there has been several levels of high data like the MCAS, access for ELL, but now we have NWEA.

307
00:36:56,929 --> 00:37:00,130
We're looking at story as a valid data point.

308
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,450
We're collecting surveys.

309
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:04,391
And so it's more opportunities for us to look at data.

310
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:10,914
Develop a community of practice and space for deep collaborative learning and transformation.

311
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:14,915
This is important because in the past,

312
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:22,111
assistant principals, principals, and directors had not all been in the same meeting at the same time.

313
00:37:23,231 --> 00:37:30,356
And so getting information from different places at different times means there's a little variation, and now they're all in one collaborative space.

314
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:37,140
And then finally, developing symmetric structures of being and doing across the district.

315
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:40,292
We know that we must honor equity.

316
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:45,473
Every school has its own demographics, has its own needs, and we want to honor that.

317
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:52,535
But we also know that there are best practices and quality around quality instruction for students.

318
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:56,155
And we want to mirror those practices when we're working with adults.

319
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:58,616
Next slide, please.

320
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:06,538
So the current research, I won't bore you with a lot of details.

321
00:38:07,677 --> 00:38:33,110
But I have been researching adaptive and technical challenges, Heifetz's work, instructional leadership out of the University of Washington, system coherence, which is Michael Fullan's work, transformational coaching, Elena Arguella's work, and data analysis, which is data-wise in action from Harvard.

322
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:46,479
So what we want to do is take all of those initiatives, the barriers, the goals from the strategic plan, and figure out the lens through which we can build system coherence.

323
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:50,900
System coherence is not just about training and skill development.

324
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:57,002
It's about adopting a mindset and connecting yourself to the impact that you want to make.

325
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:05,045
So of these four dimensions of instructional leadership, improvement of instructional practice is our focus for this year.

326
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,626
Next slide, please.

327
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:18,015
That means our leaders need to take on an identity of an instructional leader where they are focusing on data.

328
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:24,280
They're looking at data through multiple cycles, building a collaborative culture,

329
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:35,808
evaluating teacher performance as well as student performance, and creating space for public practice for continuous improvement.

330
00:39:37,148 --> 00:39:41,810
So we're taking our time and building leader identity through this work.

331
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:43,631
Next slide, please.

332
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:54,056
What's really important is that we recognize that all of our roles have changed in light of the pandemic.

333
00:39:55,178 --> 00:40:06,862
And because of the additional operational focus that comes with maintaining physical and emotional safety in a school, we are asking our leaders to do more than they've done before.

334
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:09,783
So we must support them.

335
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:21,106
This grid comes out of the Achieve Leadership Academy, and it talks about how when we have too much accountability and not enough support, it feels like punishment.

336
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:23,327
But if we don't have

337
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:32,077
any accountability, you're gonna get yourself into either ignoring what's really the problem or enabling the status quo.

338
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:47,301
So we recognize that though our students have progressed and we're happy that they are on target with the state, with MCAS, we still have goals, especially around meeting the needs of students and marginalized communities.

339
00:40:48,222 --> 00:40:52,983
So we must support our administrators as much as we wanna hold them accountable.

340
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:55,664
That is the work of our meetings.

341
00:40:57,904 --> 00:40:59,005
And the end of my presentation.

342
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:00,426
Are there any questions?

343
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:01,506
Thank you, Ms.

344
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:01,846
Williams.

345
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:03,967
That was great.

346
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:05,728
Thank you.

347
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:09,089
May I just ask, so what do we do now?

348
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,451
If you could just kind of explain where we go from here.

349
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:13,611
Absolutely.

350
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:22,235
So I'll work with the administrators for the rest of this school year, and then I'm collecting data on my work with them

351
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:26,615
and they're collecting data on themselves as instructional leaders.

352
00:41:27,336 --> 00:41:38,360
And so hopefully we'll be able to report out some qualitative data on how they feel like their leadership has changed, how support in the district has increased for their role.

353
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:48,204
So with your data collection, you're still in the process of your review, but have steps been made to, I know, sorry.

354
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,701
barriers to success.

355
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:58,605
So have steps been made to make positive changes?

356
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:18,463
For example, I know we had issues this past couple of weeks with our bullying policy and how we all just need, especially the administrators, principals, vice principals need to be on the same page, need to set policy, need to set guidelines together, review the policy together so that everybody's consistent.

357
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:27,940
So are there any positive changes that have come out of this or is that something you expect to give results for say mid to the end of the year and then move forward from there.

358
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:29,462
That's a great question.

359
00:42:29,602 --> 00:42:34,666
I think that policy needs to be set for so that everyone is clear of the expectations.

360
00:42:35,627 --> 00:42:39,590
But when you get into each building and each leader, there are some nuances.

361
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:44,745
on how to discern a specific behavior situation.

362
00:42:45,305 --> 00:42:48,307
And that's where the collaborative space really comes into place.

363
00:42:48,407 --> 00:43:02,793
And so if a leader has a specific behavior incident, there might need to be some conversation on how others are handling it in order to both meet the expectations of the policy, but also meet the needs of the student.

364
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:08,476
Because we know that no tolerance policies do not work for our students.

365
00:43:09,825 --> 00:43:14,850
So that level of discernment cannot be done in silos any longer.

366
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:21,095
We need a collaborative community to say, these are our children and this is how we can move forward together.

367
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:21,956
Great.

368
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:22,676
Yeah.

369
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:23,097
Thank you.

370
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:36,408
At the end of the year, I'd love to see your suggestions too, like once a month meetings between vice principals, even if it's on Zoom or just different examples of how our superintendent can make positive change for our students and staff.

371
00:43:36,816 --> 00:43:46,419
Yeah, meetings have begun and leaders were asked to interview teachers and students and hear their story.

372
00:43:46,899 --> 00:43:49,860
They brought that to the table and we analyze that data.

373
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,421
We've also looked at teacher observation data.

374
00:43:53,702 --> 00:44:04,265
It was blind as far as no names, but we're steadily collecting data that we have immediate control over so we can put data inquiry processes

375
00:44:04,862 --> 00:44:05,643
in action now.

376
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,764
We can't afford to wait another year for MCAS results.

377
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:09,545
Wonderful.

378
00:44:09,665 --> 00:44:09,985
Thank you.

379
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:10,686
May I?

380
00:44:10,786 --> 00:44:11,846
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

381
00:44:12,447 --> 00:44:12,887
Thank you.

382
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:14,488
Thank you for this initial report.

383
00:44:14,508 --> 00:44:15,468
I appreciate your data.

384
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:31,958
I also just want to ensure that the data collection and interviews with students and community members, what have you, are happening across all subgroups, which I'm sure they are, but I just want to make sure and put that out there that all of our subgroups, including our EL,

385
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:40,214
economically disadvantaged, students with disabilities, minority students, obviously, all across the board.

386
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:41,355
Absolutely.

387
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:42,936
Thank you for making that comment.

388
00:44:43,737 --> 00:44:53,006
Again, we want to mirror best practice and create symmetric systems of listening and collecting data.

389
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:57,751
And so we've talked about different levels of data and story being part of that.

390
00:44:58,782 --> 00:45:07,269
And so just like I've modeled that by doing a variety of entry interviews, we're also doing that as an admin group.

391
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:10,851
Thank you.

392
00:45:11,652 --> 00:45:11,872
Thanks.

393
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:17,196
Number four, we have Engagement Hub Report.

394
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:22,600
Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations David Murphy and Director of Family and Community Engagement

395
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:23,407
Ms.

396
00:45:24,008 --> 00:45:37,725
Megan Fidler-Carey will report on the creation and ongoing development of the Medford Public Schools engagement hub providing for the coordination of services meant to foster and deepen the relationships between students and their respective school committees.

397
00:45:38,222 --> 00:45:39,383
Mr. Murphy, Miss.

398
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:42,566
Thank you, Mary Good evening members of the school committee.

399
00:45:43,226 --> 00:45:56,157
You'll recall that last June we presented before you as part of a series of presentations, with regard to the use of our SR funding, and one of the initiatives that we were undertaking as a district through the use of that funding was.

400
00:45:57,478 --> 00:46:11,527
the establishment of an engagement team and essentially an engagement department which would change how we as an organization were organized with respect to the deployment of high-touch student service and family engagement.

401
00:46:11,987 --> 00:46:13,388
And so what Ms.

402
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:19,792
Fidler, Carrie, and I are updating you on this evening are the initial steps we've taken to put that plan into place.

403
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:22,454
And you'll see as we go through the slides this evening that

404
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:35,662
there's both been some accomplishments with respect to our organization and a number of aspirational goals that we still have as we continue to further implement this initiative over the course of this school year and hopefully beyond.

405
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:51,591
So on the screen now, you see our graphic that we rolled out last spring showing how we're taking the existing offices and departments and helping to essentially fusing those offices together in a hub model

406
00:46:52,031 --> 00:46:52,432
that Ms.

407
00:46:52,492 --> 00:47:00,530
Ridley-Carey serves as the director to helping to facilitate cross-departmental initiatives and meetings with the other departments that have

408
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:03,748
the high volume connections with students and families.

409
00:47:04,128 --> 00:47:18,912
The underlying purpose and goal of the engagement hub and the engagement team that we've established this year is in response to what we know is an exacerbation of challenges that families have with regard to the nexus between the school community and the student and the family.

410
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:22,653
This is work that, as I said to you last spring, has been happening

411
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:32,629
in pockets and quarters and corners rather across the metro public schools, but not in the type of cross departmental intentional way.

412
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:36,737
a big part of the engagement hub.

413
00:47:36,777 --> 00:47:58,995
So the sort of new piece of the work that didn't necessarily exist previously is the team of engagement specialists that we assembled over the course of the summer, bringing together a very thoughtful, very well credentialed, very diverse team of individuals that Megan's going to speak a little bit about tonight in their organization at the various levels of the elementary

414
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:00,796
middle and high school levels.

415
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:04,198
So that is essentially, that's one of the teams.

416
00:48:04,658 --> 00:48:11,822
And Mr. Beccari will talk a little bit about how those teams are interacting with the other departments and offices that we have.

417
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:22,347
So I'm happy to take your questions afterwards, but I'd ask Megan to talk, as she's the person leading this work on the ground level, to talk a little bit about how that work is going and where we see it going from here.

418
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:26,390
Hi, it's nice to see you all again.

419
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,010
Thank you.

420
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:45,367
So some of the things that we do have in place are, like we said, so the, what we're calling the hub directors are, so I'm there as the director of family and community engagement, the EL director, director of people services, the director of health services, and the director of counseling.

421
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:55,972
So the five of us have now established a regular scheduled meeting every other week so that we force ourselves to mark time in our calendars to sit down and kind of calibrate.

422
00:48:56,452 --> 00:49:08,561
So that those decisions that are happening in silos where you think, oh, I better check with the EL department to make sure that they're on the same page, but then life gets in the way or work gets in the way and we're not getting to it.

423
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:14,245
Now we're forcing ourselves to sit down at a scheduled time so that we can make sure that our systems are aligned.

424
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:21,008
if there are concerns from one to the other that we're addressing it before we, you know, before it gets to be some sort of fire.

425
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:25,430
So the immediate things that we're addressing are looking at the registration process.

426
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:35,873
So part of what is part of the engagement hub is the Parent Information Center, where families go to register their students, families that are new to Medford, or families that have students that are just starting school.

427
00:49:36,494 --> 00:49:40,095
And we're, you know, working across all of those different departments to find out what's

428
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:49,162
you know, what's important to them or what they're finding from their constituents or barriers and confusing in the registration process so that we can address them all together and sort of problem solve.

429
00:49:49,983 --> 00:50:01,952
So we've been really working to streamline that process, simplify that process, make it equitable so that it's not kind of confusing for some but not others and try and reduce opportunities for mistakes.

430
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:10,159
And then the other thing that we're, the next thing that we have on our agenda to work on is employing these re-engagement specialists from the re-engagement team.

431
00:50:11,857 --> 00:50:14,018
So the next thing we have is the re-engagement team.

432
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:19,482
We've worked together to develop an organizational structure where we have them all seated in the schools.

433
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:28,127
So, you know, we explored ideas about them all being working for all of the schools so that different personalities might jive better with different students.

434
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:31,990
But what we realized was better was to have them become part of school communities.

435
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,232
So we've got them deployed to the different

436
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:37,093
they each own a school.

437
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:42,218
So we've got Kelsey, who works at the Brooks and the McGlynn Elementary.

438
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:46,601
We've got Craig at the Misitech Elementary and the Roberts.

439
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:50,845
We've got Jamal and Stephanie, who are both working at both middle schools.

440
00:50:51,205 --> 00:50:52,987
And then we've got Cullen at the high school.

441
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:58,512
Someday, I hope to have a chance for you all to meet these guys, because they really have done

442
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:06,997
a good job, in my opinion, of really becoming part of the school community and really getting to know a lot of kids and reaching out to a lot of families, which is wonderful to see.

443
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:12,321
We still have a lot of goals set that we're still working towards.

444
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:19,186
We really want to get some systems in place, systems around referral processes for the engagement team specifically.

445
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:25,230
Systems, we're still working on perfecting that registration process.

446
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,871
And then, you know, with the hub directors, we're still,

447
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:31,013
figuring out what else we can be working on.

448
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:49,483
We know that there are a lot of systems that need to be designed and perfected, but it's a matter of like getting all those down and figuring out what all of those are and sort of challenging the way things have always been done and really, you know, looking in the mirror and examining the way we've been doing things and trying to decide whether there's a better way to do these things.

449
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:54,466
So we have a lot of work ahead, but I think we're really getting, going in the right direction.

450
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:58,148
Yeah, I think that's it.

451
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:15,096
So again, there's a number of different sub threads to the engagement hub in terms of how these departments are working together and other places in which essentially it is new work that we are developing as we go.

452
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:18,377
And that's a big part of the work that Megan is leading.

453
00:52:18,397 --> 00:52:23,299
And she spoke a lot about the sort of systems development piece.

454
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,420
What's, I think, challenging

455
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:50,993
and fascinating about this initiative is we are simultaneously looking to develop the structures and systems that will be sustainable beyond the current team, frankly, and years from now that this work will live in a place in which there will be an expectation that the departments are talking to one another, that they are collaborating and that they are working together.

456
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:57,656
And while we're also while we're building those systems and structures that we hope are sustainable and last long into the future.

457
00:52:58,255 --> 00:53:19,819
We're also on the ground, and when I say we, I really mean Megan's team, are on the ground attempting to provide support in discrete situations every day where building administrators or school counselors or teachers are identifying cases in which there are students whose relationship with the school is not as strong as we'd like it to be.

458
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:21,820
And so I think that's why

459
00:53:23,604 --> 00:53:30,589
Megan and I spent a lot of time over the summer interviewing a good, competitive, diverse applicant pool.

460
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:53,085
And what we feel strongly about is the group that we've assembled has demonstrated a capacity both for frankly having the patience to work with us as we develop these systems and rolling up their sleeves and diving into these school communities and building the relationships with staff, students, and families that we need them to in order to provide that discrete level

461
00:53:53,825 --> 00:54:00,187
of support that is particularly important this year as we come out of, hopefully come out of the pandemic.

462
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:10,170
And so this is something that we feel very, as I think as an administration, we feel very strongly about, and that we think has a tremendous amount of potential.

463
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,671
There's still a lot of work to do.

464
00:54:13,431 --> 00:54:15,492
We had Megan assembled

465
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:24,316
very eloquent and concise biographies of each of our engagement specialists that we'll send to you later in the week.

466
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:26,719
And we did consider having the team here tonight.

467
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:32,747
But frankly, like, we're not looking to, we're not looking to just bring this office out and show you like

468
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,128
a good group of people that are very well-intentioned.

469
00:54:35,508 --> 00:54:42,773
What we want to do is come back to you and report on with hard data and say, here are the number of cases that the engagement team has taken on.

470
00:54:43,194 --> 00:54:47,957
Here's some anecdotal information as to how they've been able to move the needle for students and families.

471
00:54:48,377 --> 00:54:56,023
And here's why on the whole, we think we're better off as an organization and better positioned to serve students and families going forward.

472
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,664
And that's frankly, just gonna take more time.

473
00:54:58,225 --> 00:54:58,945
We know what's happening.

474
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:02,348
Some of you, I know we've been in buildings on tours with you and we've bumped into

475
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:09,634
engagement specialists doing their work, but it's still a work in progress, and we're looking forward to reporting back in the coming months.

476
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:13,695
But as I said, or as Megan said, there's a lot of work that hasn't been done so far.

477
00:55:13,715 --> 00:55:19,776
We're proud of it, and we're hoping that this will be a dialogue that will be continuing as the year goes on.

478
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:23,857
So happy to answer any questions or respond to anything you'd like.

479
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,019
Member Stone's hand went up first, then Member Rousseau.

480
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:33,633
Thank you, Mayor.

481
00:55:34,394 --> 00:55:40,339
Can you just explain how the referral system works for people to see these hub leaders?

482
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,462
How the referral system will work, you mean?

483
00:55:44,823 --> 00:55:47,605
But they're in the schools now, but are they not seeing kids directly yet?

484
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:48,646
No, they are.

485
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:49,466
They certainly are.

486
00:55:49,506 --> 00:55:49,807
They are.

487
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,808
That's sort of what I said.

488
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:54,811
There's simultaneous work going on at the same time, right?

489
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:56,132
As most simultaneous work is.

490
00:55:57,097 --> 00:56:13,941
One is building the structures like a sound referral system in which every staff member, whether it be an adjustment counselor or an assistant principal or a teacher or anyone in the building knows that when a particular set of facts line up, this is where that case is best positioned.

491
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:25,384
And then there'll be times when the facts don't line up perfectly and it's not clear who in the organization will be best suited to serve that student and family and reestablish that relationship with the school.

492
00:56:25,724 --> 00:56:26,524
And in those cases,

493
00:56:26,982 --> 00:56:29,504
That's why the cross-departmental work that Ms.

494
00:56:29,544 --> 00:56:48,696
Fidelicari referenced with regard to the hub directors coming together is so important, because part of what happens in those meetings is they're gonna be looking at cases and saying, based on this set of challenges, this particular student and this particular family, this is how the organization can best respond to make sure that we give that student and that family the support that they need.

495
00:56:48,736 --> 00:56:56,601
So that is the vision, so that we have sort of a flow chart, if you will, of who gets what case and when,

496
00:56:57,194 --> 00:57:06,082
And then the hub is there to catch the cases, which there'll be many of that don't fit squarely within that particular equation.

497
00:57:06,142 --> 00:57:09,965
And that's where the directors have to come together and figure out how we best support that student, that family.

498
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:17,079
But is there a ballpark of how many students say they've seen at the four elementary schools combined?

499
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:21,220
So it's one, right now at the elementary level, it's one engagement specialist per two schools.

500
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:40,366
And so there are situations where a family has raised a particular concern and the engagement specialist is an additional team member that a building administrator can defer, can refer a case to, and they can essentially connect with the family or the student, find out exactly what the problem is, and then help them troubleshoot through the organization.

501
00:57:40,796 --> 00:57:42,857
to find out what we can do to support them.

502
00:57:43,417 --> 00:57:49,760
I don't have a specific number on it, because it happens every day, almost every hour, where there are another staff member who's there to help.

503
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:54,783
But what we want to get to is a place where we know, based on these circumstances, this is how we can best respond.

504
00:57:55,505 --> 00:58:05,147
All right, I guess I'm just, I'm trying to figure out, is there an epidemic happening that there's a lot of families that aren't engaged and we need more than five team specialists?

505
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:09,868
Are they seeing five kids a day or are they seeing one a week?

506
00:58:09,928 --> 00:58:11,848
It varies by the day and it varies by the school.

507
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:15,469
And frankly, seeing a student varies by the situation.

508
00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:22,510
Sometimes to reconnect the family to the school community, it's one conversation or it's sitting with the child at lunch

509
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:28,191
to get them, you know, where they can, they feel as though they're in an environment in which they're, they feel welcome or whatnot.

510
00:58:28,572 --> 00:58:36,334
Other times it's a year long process of continuing to engage the family and exploring all the different strategies that we can employ to try to rebuild that relationship.

511
00:58:36,874 --> 00:58:51,098
I think your question as to whether there's an epidemic of disengagement, I don't think, I don't know that we have a official definition of what constitutes an epidemic, but I would say we are, the pandemic has exacerbated

512
00:58:51,857 --> 00:58:57,539
pre-existing challenges with respect to the relationship between students, families, and schools.

513
00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:07,842
And part of this initiative is our response to that, to make sure that we're having a whole of organization response to making sure that we're keeping families and students connected with their schools.

514
00:59:08,522 --> 00:59:15,224
I don't, we will never solve this challenge and we never would have even without the pandemic by assembling teams of engagement specialists.

515
00:59:15,244 --> 00:59:18,045
We're not going to have like a Marine Corps of engagement specialists.

516
00:59:18,412 --> 00:59:35,932
What we need is for the organization as a whole, to understand our responsibility to work together to not be siloed and to understand this is a primary fundamental responsibility we have as a district to keep families connected with with their school communities, right and I understand it's more of a triage, but I guess I'm thinking now okay see.

517
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:40,937
specialist has met a family and they need a lot of assistance.

518
00:59:41,337 --> 00:59:44,540
So then do they then meet weekly with the adjustment counselor?

519
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,861
Do we need more adjustment counselors?

520
00:59:46,001 --> 00:59:51,727
Or I guess it's too early to learn what we're going to need after the engagement specialist are meeting with all these families and students?

521
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:59,193
I don't think anyone, given what we're seeing and how we're prioritizing, know that we need to prioritize social emotional learning.

522
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:02,937
We'll say that there isn't a need for more adjustment counselors.

523
01:00:03,572 --> 01:00:06,975
But to some extent, that's always been true and always will be true.

524
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:16,163
And so I think more than just sort of identifying a specific number and saying, well, if we get to this ratio of counselor to student, we're going to be fine.

525
01:00:16,644 --> 01:00:22,669
It's more about understanding that we have to, as an organization, prioritize engagement.

526
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:30,756
Because if we don't, we know we'll never get them to feel connected enough to have the academic progress that we know they need to have in order to be

527
01:00:31,605 --> 01:00:34,749
successful or to receive the supports and services that they need to be successful.

528
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:39,536
So I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to dance around your question.

529
01:00:39,976 --> 01:00:44,803
It's just that your question sort of gets to the heart of everything we're doing

530
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,161
as an organization, particularly in this particular time period.

531
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:52,183
There isn't like, well, if we just have this many people, we're going to be fine.

532
01:00:52,723 --> 01:00:57,046
It's more about understanding that this is an ongoing and continuous challenge that we have to recognize.

533
01:00:57,486 --> 01:01:01,508
And I think this initiative is one of the ways in which we do that, but it's not the only way.

534
01:01:02,148 --> 01:01:08,771
So then at the end of this year, will the initiative tell us what we should be prioritizing with staff?

535
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:12,033
I imagine there's going to be a need for more staff.

536
01:01:13,063 --> 01:01:15,805
there's many families being referred to the specialist.

537
01:01:17,045 --> 01:01:21,107
Yes, except that the specialist will never have a monopoly on this work.

538
01:01:21,408 --> 01:01:30,753
It will always be a team approach of counselors, of teachers, of administrators, of engagement specialists, of community partners, of mental health support.

539
01:01:30,773 --> 01:01:32,694
The specialist is like a caseworker.

540
01:01:32,714 --> 01:01:34,935
So they're not seeing students one-on-one.

541
01:01:34,955 --> 01:01:35,956
No, they could.

542
01:01:36,556 --> 01:01:36,956
They are.

543
01:01:36,976 --> 01:01:37,196
Okay.

544
01:01:37,356 --> 01:01:38,117
I didn't realize that.

545
01:01:38,137 --> 01:01:39,618
So they can meet with students one-on-one.

546
01:01:39,818 --> 01:01:40,018
Sure.

547
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:43,193
to have a counseling session are.

548
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:57,683
I mean, I don't know that I want to get into a defining as a specific counseling session because there are some licensing issues there, but like certainly there could be an instance where engagement specialist is is meeting with either an individual student or a small group of students, sometimes with family representatives.

549
01:01:58,272 --> 01:02:18,723
Their work is their utility players essentially, I guess I'd be curious if maybe another meeting to hear what their day looks like because I'm, I guess I'm not grasping what their role is and how they're being utilized in one, I think that's a fair question I think in some ways it's, it's in development, but I think if you look through the deck and I think in the last slide

550
01:02:19,343 --> 01:02:40,537
how quickly we can pull it up, but there is a recitation essentially of the sort of like core job duties that range from the sort of like individual discrete case management to working with the district to try to figure out what type of system could we most efficiently and most effectively identify the supports that a student needs.

551
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:52,578
So I meet with the team weekly and one of the things that we're really exploring is how they can collect data and so they're all working together and sharing.

552
01:02:53,627 --> 01:03:01,251
the way that they're recording their data from the students they work with, and students they work with either one-on-one or in a class or in the lunchroom.

553
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:09,916
So they're doing, you know, first of all, they analyze the attendance records and for students that are out of school, they're definitely addressing those students first.

554
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:12,117
That's their main mission.

555
01:03:12,157 --> 01:03:18,200
But then also what can they do preventatively for students that seem to be sort of disengaging from classes,

556
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,433
or in different ways, they're reaching out to those students.

557
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:28,020
And we're talking a lot about how they're collecting the data about that work and with whom they're sharing it with.

558
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:34,247
It's really important to let the counselors know if you've made some sort of relationship breakthrough with a student so that the counselors can get that too.

559
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:36,649
So we're, we're perfecting that.

560
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:45,015
I mean, it's definitely, it's not like I could show you this is our system of data collection, we're talking about that weekly, and, and, you know, improving it and perfecting it weekly.

561
01:03:45,296 --> 01:03:53,342
So hopefully, by the end of the year, we will see some serious trends in what we've collected that will tell us some sort of stories.

562
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:59,127
But something that stood out from the school in Maine where was like engagement is not one person's job.

563
01:03:59,187 --> 01:04:00,428
So definitely, it's not

564
01:04:01,293 --> 01:04:03,855
It's not something that they've passed off to the re-engagement team.

565
01:04:03,895 --> 01:04:07,699
That's still starting with the principals and the assistant principals and going through everybody.

566
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:12,703
And this is just sort of yet another safety net that we're adding on to make the screen a little bit tighter.

567
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:13,924
Thank you.

568
01:04:14,344 --> 01:04:19,048
If I could just add one last point, everyone in the district now is taking on operational duties as well.

569
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:26,455
So these are not well compensated monitors for the building.

570
01:04:26,994 --> 01:04:34,503
But at the same time, because of staff shortages, there are instances in which engagement specialists are covering various types of duties.

571
01:04:35,317 --> 01:04:43,741
they're doing it with the lens of identifying how can they continue to have that relate, build those relationships with students, because that's their, that's their primary focus.

572
01:04:44,721 --> 01:04:58,808
I just want to add that because I think particularly when you have something that's new and a new approach, there are cynics who will be essentially looking for us to say they're out, you know, building relationships with kids all day.

573
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,289
And they'll say, well, I saw one of them doing lunch duty.

574
01:05:01,469 --> 01:05:02,890
And so to save us all time,

575
01:05:03,464 --> 01:05:13,814
I just want to add that occasionally that happens as well, as it does for administrators, as it does for teachers, as it does for paraprofessionals, and given our staffing shortages, as it does for everyone.

576
01:05:14,294 --> 01:05:17,677
But that is absolutely not the primary way in which they're spending their time.

577
01:05:18,238 --> 01:05:19,139
Okay, thank you.

578
01:05:19,919 --> 01:05:20,199
Thank you.

579
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,021
Member Rousseau, and then Member McLaughlin.

580
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:22,662
Thank you.

581
01:05:22,682 --> 01:05:23,643
My questions have been answered.

582
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,005
Member McLaughlin?

583
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:28,680
Thank you.

584
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:35,022
Thank you for the chair to my colleagues for the questions that were answered as well, because I have the same and have a few more.

585
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,023
So I'm wondering how we have engaged.

586
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:47,707
So it sounds to me like the goals for the engagement hub for this year are re-engagement around already diminished relationships.

587
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,563
around academic learning.

588
01:05:50,724 --> 01:05:51,605
Is that accurate?

589
01:05:52,246 --> 01:05:54,591
I think it's a very important part of it.

590
01:05:54,932 --> 01:05:56,975
I think it's probably, I would say it's a

591
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:11,135
The goal is slightly broader than that, because it's not just identifying the subset of students for whom the early warning indicators would say that this is clear diminishment of the relationship between the student and the school.

592
01:06:11,896 --> 01:06:23,438
As Megan said, there's also preventative work that's happening, and so that could be getting involved in extracurricular programming or other ways in which we're trying to keep the relationship strong so we don't have to do the level of re-engagement that would be necessary.

593
01:06:24,198 --> 01:06:32,443
In light of the post-pandemic context, I would say, yeah, that's a very critical part that is unavoidable, just based on the volume.

594
01:06:33,043 --> 01:06:33,383
Yeah.

595
01:06:33,683 --> 01:06:45,250
So I just would say that this deck really feels heavy on the re-engagement sort of specialists working on consistent attendant, chronically disengaged from learning, attendance and residency duties.

596
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:49,532
So I'm hearing that as sort of a focus of this year anyway, and I'm wondering,

597
01:06:50,151 --> 01:06:54,113
again, sort of stepping back a moment and asking ourselves, like, where did that come from?

598
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:57,515
And how did we engage stakeholders and what that was going to look like?

599
01:06:57,575 --> 01:07:00,837
So how, I know you have the hub directors, which I think is great.

600
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:12,124
I think you definitely need the inter, you know, departmental collaboration, but how were families engaged in that process in terms of identifying what the goals would be for the hub for this year is, is one of the questions I have.

601
01:07:12,184 --> 01:07:15,506
Cause I mean, I do feel like it's kind of the irony of family engagement is that

602
01:07:16,112 --> 01:07:21,357
We're saying we're doing family engagement, but we're not engaging families and what the engagement is going to be sometimes.

603
01:07:22,193 --> 01:07:31,879
Yeah, I mean, there was no family engagement department per se, prior to this, so I think it's creation is a good step in the direction of family engagement.

604
01:07:32,279 --> 01:07:39,403
And I think in month three, I would say, I think it would be premature to say that there's been no family engagement.

605
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:46,167
And that's particularly true because depending on the levels, the engagement specialist work can vary.

606
01:07:46,287 --> 01:07:47,848
And so particularly at the elementary level,

607
01:07:48,768 --> 01:07:53,332
there has been a decent amount of direct family engagement.

608
01:07:53,352 --> 01:07:59,697
But I think, I take your question to mean more helping to inform the vision of the work that's happening.

609
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:00,258
Absolutely.

610
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:05,342
And I think that's true, but I just, I wouldn't say it's limited solely to the engagement hub.

611
01:08:05,362 --> 01:08:14,409
I think it has to be an organizational wide priority that the hub is a big part of, but not to the exclusion of all the other facets of the organization.

612
01:08:15,043 --> 01:08:15,323
Right.

613
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:17,064
How, and how is this different?

614
01:08:17,444 --> 01:08:22,226
Are these engagement specialist positions differentiated from school adjustment counselors?

615
01:08:23,727 --> 01:08:24,328
Various ways.

616
01:08:24,348 --> 01:08:30,711
I mean, I think one, it's the sort of the utility of the engagement role is that it can be, it can be broader essentially.

617
01:08:31,151 --> 01:08:39,575
Whereas the adjustment counselors have a more of a defined portfolio that is based specifically on, on counseling within the, whether that be

618
01:08:40,055 --> 01:08:45,698
adjustment counselor support or guidance counselor support, it's sort of an established lane of support.

619
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:57,184
It's not unintentional that some of the engagement specialists bring social work and counseling background, because I think that is a really important part of the work.

620
01:08:58,244 --> 01:09:00,606
But generally speaking, I think

621
01:09:02,103 --> 01:09:10,886
the idea with the engagement team is to be a little more nimble in terms of both background and in terms of the types of supports that they would offer students.

622
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:11,786
Thank you.

623
01:09:11,806 --> 01:09:12,727
And just as a point of information.

624
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:13,547
Sorry.

625
01:09:13,807 --> 01:09:14,527
Point of information.

626
01:09:14,968 --> 01:09:15,708
Point of information.

627
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:17,308
Thank you.

628
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:23,430
We did approve the job descriptions for the engagement specialist earlier this year, correct?

629
01:09:23,771 --> 01:09:24,011
Correct.

630
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:24,271
Yep.

631
01:09:24,491 --> 01:09:24,791
Thank you.

632
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:30,833
And so for the, what are the qualifications for the engagement specialist?

633
01:09:32,778 --> 01:09:42,265
as outlined in the job description that the committee approved, but I think that was intentionally done to have a broad array of backgrounds.

634
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:55,374
And so our staff, we have individuals with extensive school-based experience working as a paraprofessional to someone who was a practicing attorney working in a district attorney's office and eventually a school system.

635
01:09:55,414 --> 01:10:00,018
So again, I would say that it's intentional in part because, and I think this is one of the things that

636
01:10:00,758 --> 01:10:10,763
for Megan and I was really sort of a great opportunity over the course of the summer, is that we were both looking for talented individuals that would add to the organization, but also thinking about how the team would complement each other.

637
01:10:10,783 --> 01:10:22,588
And for that purpose, we wanted a diverse set of professional backgrounds because we knew that this is a department that was going to have to be nimble and flexible and respond essentially to the situations that we were seeing in schools.

638
01:10:22,608 --> 01:10:29,011
And I think that's, again, as we said, there's a lot of work that has to happen in order to really bring this vision to fruition.

639
01:10:30,312 --> 01:10:36,195
But I think we were successful in assembling a team whose background complements one another.

640
01:10:37,655 --> 01:10:38,036
Thank you.

641
01:10:38,076 --> 01:10:39,036
And so that's great.

642
01:10:39,116 --> 01:10:44,159
And so they have a college degree required, not yet required?

643
01:10:44,704 --> 01:10:48,588
to be, again, I don't have the job description that the school committee approved in front of me.

644
01:10:48,688 --> 01:10:50,049
I don't remember it, so I'm asking.

645
01:10:50,429 --> 01:11:09,528
I would assume that there's a bachelor's degree, but I can't, and I'm pretty sure that as it happens, I believe all five individuals do have a bachelor's degree, but I can't, we certainly interviewed individuals who didn't have a bachelor's and that there's, I could envision circumstances under which someone without a bachelor's degree would be successful in this.

646
01:11:11,218 --> 01:11:15,720
Okay, so it's a case by case basis on family engagement qualifications is what I'm hearing.

647
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:25,504
I think it's, I think what's critical from our perspective is to have a team that complements each other and family engagement obviously has a very wide array of responsibilities and duties.

648
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:32,027
And I wouldn't want to create barriers to an applicant pool.

649
01:11:32,912 --> 01:11:37,435
I don't, by the way, I'm not sure we're hiring for this role right now, because it's a position to fill, but I'd like to keep it that way, I won't say.

650
01:11:38,035 --> 01:11:55,547
But I just, I have a, I guess a general aversion to rigid academic barriers to positions that are more based on someone's capacity with- Yeah, no, I'm not saying academic, yeah, I appreciate that.

651
01:11:55,627 --> 01:11:58,569
Qualifications can be about lived experience for sure.

652
01:11:58,609 --> 01:12:00,290
I thought the question was about a bachelor's degree.

653
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,071
Yeah, no, I was wondering if that was part of it.

654
01:12:02,696 --> 01:12:06,219
And we don't know because we don't remember is what I'm asking, right?

655
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:09,701
I believe it's a preferred requirement.

656
01:12:10,342 --> 01:12:15,285
And then thank you for the response and for engaging me for this moment.

657
01:12:15,685 --> 01:12:24,832
And then can we have, I know getting back to some of the colleagues' questions as well, it would be great if there were some data-driven goals and some

658
01:12:25,502 --> 01:12:27,223
flowchart for a referral process.

659
01:12:27,303 --> 01:12:31,944
And so maybe that's something that could be, Megan, yeah, Ms.

660
01:12:32,445 --> 01:12:40,768
Wilson, if we can think about what that would look like and how that could be visualized for the community in a visual flowchart sort of form so people know.

661
01:12:40,888 --> 01:12:43,529
So I guess I'm thinking about it from a family perspective.

662
01:12:44,089 --> 01:12:47,790
If you have a concern and you wanna be proactive, not reactive, right?

663
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:52,112
And a family is looking for some answers, they don't know, are they going to the guidance counselor?

664
01:12:52,152 --> 01:12:53,592
Are they going to the school adjustment counselor?

665
01:12:53,612 --> 01:12:55,053
Are they going to the engagement specialist?

666
01:12:55,711 --> 01:13:05,506
So I think there's a lot of confusion around who I think it's great that we have options on who we can go to, but I think there's a lot of confusion around who we can go to and in what circumstance.

667
01:13:05,526 --> 01:13:08,811
So I think some clarification around that would be super helpful.

668
01:13:08,891 --> 01:13:11,335
I'm really excited about this and I know that

669
01:13:11,837 --> 01:13:20,020
The school in Maine, we'll be talking more about the school in Maine survey, but one of the biggest outcomes of the school in Maine survey was building capacity for staff.

670
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:24,602
And that was sort of, they said, if we're not accomplishing that, then nothing will be accomplished really.

671
01:13:24,642 --> 01:13:26,182
So I thought that was really an important piece.

672
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:31,805
And then lastly, I wanted to ask, sorry, building.

673
01:13:34,126 --> 01:13:37,827
Oh, and in addition to all of the other responsibilities,

674
01:13:38,398 --> 01:13:47,765
that the director has, I see that you're also doing oversight of before and after school care and functioning as the district's transportation liaison.

675
01:13:48,346 --> 01:13:56,652
So I guess I'm wondering how does one person do all of those three, it sounds like three jobs, and more.

676
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:05,037
I guess as the person who had those three parts of my portfolio and then a few other things, I would say it's a real challenge.

677
01:14:06,137 --> 01:14:16,239
And part of the organization that we did was to understand that yes, Megan is the point person for these issues, but there's a team supporting her.

678
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:18,460
So first we had the five engagement specialists.

679
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,300
We have two specialists that work in parent information center.

680
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,441
We have the bus vendor and who I think

681
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,061
Ms.

682
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:31,145
Fidler-Carey and I both have the opportunity to speak with on a regular basis.

683
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:33,687
I'm sorry, the bus vendor, is that what you said?

684
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:36,048
The bus vendor, the bus vendor.

685
01:14:36,088 --> 01:14:40,151
So if the question is, does Ms.

686
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:44,694
Fidler-Carey have a very broad and challenging portfolio, I would say the answer to that is yes.

687
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:55,042
And we've tried to structure the offices of which she has oversight in a way that will position her to be, her and those teams,

688
01:14:55,662 --> 01:14:56,583
to be successful.

689
01:14:56,944 --> 01:15:06,755
I guess the question is, and this is my last question, I guess the question is, is, is the need being met as a transportation liaison, particularly in addition to family and community engagement?

690
01:15:06,776 --> 01:15:10,260
I know that transportation was one of the biggest issues we've been having.

691
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:14,805
And I also, I think, are you also addressing the special education transportation?

692
01:15:14,825 --> 01:15:14,865
No.

693
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:30,387
Yeah, I think if you were if there was an area that we would be like a staffing priority transportation would probably be at the top of that list.

694
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:37,833
It's, it's not a priority that stays at the top of the list 12 months a year, which is why

695
01:15:38,521 --> 01:15:55,149
In our conversations leading up to the eventual establishment of budgetary priorities for FY23, we've talked about what might some options be with respect to building out that capacity in a way that makes the prudent use of resources.

696
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,571
So that could be a part-time position.

697
01:15:57,611 --> 01:15:58,891
It could be some external support.

698
01:15:59,712 --> 01:16:05,855
But I do think in that umbrella, it's the area right now that would probably be at the top of the list in terms of staffing priorities.

699
01:16:07,283 --> 01:16:08,083
Thank you, thank you, Ms.

700
01:16:08,103 --> 01:16:09,324
Feather Perry for all your hard work.

701
01:16:10,544 --> 01:16:11,805
Thank you very much for the presentation.

702
01:16:12,345 --> 01:16:13,385
Oh, I had a question.

703
01:16:13,405 --> 01:16:14,626
Oh, member Van de Kloet.

704
01:16:14,646 --> 01:16:14,886
Sorry.

705
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:17,347
Yeah, so thank you.

706
01:16:17,367 --> 01:16:22,169
I think this sounds like very interesting and challenging work.

707
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:23,509
A couple of questions.

708
01:16:24,009 --> 01:16:28,251
First, where were the engagement specialists housed in the schools?

709
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:30,672
Have we found offices for them all?

710
01:16:31,432 --> 01:16:34,013
Because I can't believe that wasn't a challenge.

711
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:37,009
It was definitely a challenge.

712
01:16:37,549 --> 01:16:40,491
They all have somewhere to sit and somewhere to be.

713
01:16:41,152 --> 01:16:47,075
Some, depending on the school and what else they have to also house in their building.

714
01:16:48,276 --> 01:16:56,081
Some of those offices are more sort of desirable than others, but they do all have a space.

715
01:16:56,442 --> 01:17:01,485
The principals have been really very welcoming to the re-engagement specialists and definitely want to make them feel

716
01:17:02,098 --> 01:17:04,041
very comfortable and a part of the team.

717
01:17:04,722 --> 01:17:16,700
We realized that that was the most important part was to make them part of the school community so that the teachers and counselors would, you know, utilize them and put them to work and so that the students would, you know, trust them and want to be great.

718
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:25,724
That was actually my second question was, you know, part of this is, is that they have to find their place within the schools, right, and to a point that Mr Murphy made earlier.

719
01:17:27,065 --> 01:17:38,850
Sometimes they've had to be utilized as coverage, but frankly, that sometimes is the time when you really get to see a broad view of students, and this can be very very valuable to

720
01:17:39,513 --> 01:17:43,056
whoever works in the school so I actually think, especially at the beginning of the year.

721
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:50,683
That's an asset, even, you know, I understand it's time consuming, but it does allow someone to come in.

722
01:17:51,184 --> 01:18:01,233
Now, my other question is so let's suppose said person, one of your reengagement specialist is something that we as adults understand the terminology.

723
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:04,254
What will the kids call these individuals?

724
01:18:04,314 --> 01:18:05,535
Where do they fit in there?

725
01:18:05,615 --> 01:18:06,576
I'm glad you brought that up.

726
01:18:06,616 --> 01:18:14,340
They'll be glad you brought that up because they have, we've spent a lot of time from their perspective, thinking about how they'll introduce themselves.

727
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:24,866
They, and we've said re-engagement works for, you know, the academics in the room, but how will they introduce themselves to families and to children so that they, it's much clearer.

728
01:18:24,906 --> 01:18:28,267
So they're working on words like outreach and advocates and

729
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:40,550
So that I think they use outreach specialists, the most are family outreach or family advocates or family support specialist specialists, that's how they like to talk about the work that they do.

730
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:47,375
Because they understand that it's it's sort of confusing to use as you speak with families and.

731
01:18:48,093 --> 01:18:56,337
And frankly, they want to be the kind of non, depending on what the issues are that are making the kid not engaged to school.

732
01:18:56,777 --> 01:19:01,680
You know, if it's, especially at the elementary level, it's the family that's not engaged more than the student that's not engaged.

733
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:07,783
So these, the re-engagement specialists understand that they need to establish trust and establish relationships with the family.

734
01:19:07,823 --> 01:19:12,745
So they really make it clear that though their paycheck comes from the school, they work for the family.

735
01:19:13,285 --> 01:19:16,767
I guess, you know, I'm just thinking for the youngest kids, something like a,

736
01:19:17,287 --> 01:19:18,949
helping hand or something.

737
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:36,804
Yeah, you know something, something that something, even a helper I'm a helper that someplace I can just see them being in the school and trying to say, how do they define their place with the title, which is child friendly helper.

738
01:19:37,324 --> 01:19:38,285
Anyway, just curious.

739
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:39,626
It's a good, it's a good question.

740
01:19:41,116 --> 01:19:51,222
Megan and I were talking the other day about how sometimes some of the most important relationships between a student and the adult start with assisting in the opening of a milk carton.

741
01:19:51,922 --> 01:19:57,606
And you don't necessarily need to flash a badge to say you're with the engagement office before you do that.

742
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,527
The student just wants his milk.

743
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:08,771
And I think that's the type of mindset that was evidenced to us and the individuals as we were interviewing people that we really wanted to see.

744
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:19,236
And I think our building administrators would attest that that's the mindset that they've exhibited as they've gone out and started to build their relationships within these individual school communities.

745
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:21,037
Thanks very much.

746
01:20:21,057 --> 01:20:21,557
Thank you.

747
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:22,938
Thank you.

748
01:20:25,062 --> 01:20:38,572
We have number five hot water heater at Medford High School, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. David Murphy, will provide an update on the awarding of a bid contract for the repairs and or replacement of a hot water heater at Medford High School.

749
01:20:38,732 --> 01:20:39,213
Mr. Murphy.

750
01:20:39,413 --> 01:20:40,314
Thank you, Mayor.

751
01:20:40,594 --> 01:20:50,942
Provided in the committee's packet this week was information related to the response to the invitation for bids that was put out by the city's procurement office.

752
01:20:52,253 --> 01:21:04,175
As I mentioned in the memo, the capital repairs presentation that you received a week ago this evening was designed in the hope of having as few surprises.

753
01:21:04,839 --> 01:21:08,883
in capital repair projects as possible for the remainder of the year.

754
01:21:10,424 --> 01:21:24,658
Unfortunately, and I think in my conversations with Mr McLaughlin and Ms Maxwell in the procurement office with the city, it does appear as though our bids are reflective of some of the

755
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:30,381
late stage pandemic pricing that we're seeing in a variety of sectors in the economy.

756
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:45,567
And so while the estimate that we had initially received was for $170,000 for the replacement of the hot water heater at the high school, the lowest bid came in just a little under $370,000.

757
01:21:45,627 --> 01:21:46,388
That is obviously disappointing.

758
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:56,878
But at the same time, this is a critical infrastructure repair.

759
01:21:57,958 --> 01:22:14,707
That was put out as our first request for for bids and proposals this year due to the fact that we have some critical services that we will not be able to sustain if we don't make this repair and so our recommendation tonight would be that the committee approved the awarding of the contract.

760
01:22:15,908 --> 01:22:24,392
The enterprise equipment company incorporated is the company that was both the low bidder and we received a positive reference checks on

761
01:22:25,409 --> 01:22:28,730
and we are eager to get this work moving forward.

762
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:34,032
I'd ask if you do consider the motion if you grant us this approval.

763
01:22:34,893 --> 01:22:41,815
I would ask that the motion leave the administration flexibility with respect to the particular budget line that we charge.

764
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:46,237
At the moment we have capacity within the capital repairs budget

765
01:22:46,941 --> 01:22:52,403
that was allocated in August of 2020 by the Medford City Council to address this issue.

766
01:22:53,643 --> 01:23:10,288
It would be my hope that whether, and it likely would have to be a post-expenditure reclassification in order to do this, but my hope would be that the revolving funds associated with the services that the hot water heater allows us to provide

767
01:23:11,042 --> 01:23:12,482
would be able to defray that cost.

768
01:23:13,142 --> 01:23:21,924
Given the scope of the price that we're not going to be able to, we're not going to find $368,000 in revolving accounts to pay for this in its entirety.

769
01:23:21,944 --> 01:23:34,286
But as I said, we have the capacity we need to in the capital repairs budget, and we'll just try to minimize the use of that, if possible, due to the other capital priorities that were articulated last week.

770
01:23:34,346 --> 01:23:38,587
So I'm happy to answer questions to the best of my ability based on that.

771
01:23:39,692 --> 01:23:41,773
Member Russo, and then Member Kretz.

772
01:23:42,013 --> 01:23:42,433
Thank you.

773
01:23:42,793 --> 01:23:44,694
I have one question.

774
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:47,996
How quickly can they get going on this?

775
01:23:49,496 --> 01:23:59,680
Because I mean, my next statement will be a motion to approve this, but I mean, I don't want to hear in 2024, we're discussing that they finally are able to start the work.

776
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,001
Yeah.

777
01:24:01,521 --> 01:24:02,581
I'm basing my, so

778
01:24:05,267 --> 01:24:16,430
In a variety of areas, we have seen how supply chain issues and some of those other external factors are affecting timelines.

779
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:23,592
And so I'm not really inclined to attest to any specific timeline as a result of that.

780
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:32,275
My understanding based on the reference checks and the scope of work that was articulated in the invitation debate is that the plan would be for this work to

781
01:24:33,857 --> 01:24:36,998
to begin in a matter of weeks and to be completed in the month of December.

782
01:24:37,058 --> 01:24:40,818
So even though I just said I'm not going to establish a timeline, so please remember that.

783
01:24:41,259 --> 01:24:46,540
Qualifier, it certainly is our, our hope is that this work is completed in a matter of weeks.

784
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:47,380
Thank you.

785
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,200
Motion to approve.

786
01:24:59,592 --> 01:25:05,615
because I went through my notes and I was surprised by the increase in the price and you answered that question also.

787
01:25:06,436 --> 01:25:18,822
So, I had in the notes from the building grounds meeting that it was possible that when we approve this in May that there might have been a possibility of getting a rebate.

788
01:25:19,283 --> 01:25:19,443
Yes.

789
01:25:19,463 --> 01:25:21,344
So, I kinda, I was just curious about that.

790
01:25:21,664 --> 01:25:27,487
That's, thank you, miss Gretz and I, I should have added that, that part of the other reason I'm asking for the flexibility with regard, with regard to

791
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:36,178
exactly where it's charged to is that we are hopeful that we'll be able to defray based on a rebate working with other offices within City Hall.

792
01:25:36,218 --> 01:25:37,959
So those conversations are ongoing.

793
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:49,645
I'm certainly happy to report back on what the actual budgetary impact ends up being, but because we don't have full clarity on the potential rebates yet, nor do we have the revolving accounts.

794
01:25:50,526 --> 01:25:56,449
Revolving accounts obviously vary based on participation and a variety of other factors that we can't control.

795
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,722
But I don't have any, I don't, I can't say specific numbers with respect to what the potential rebate could be.

796
01:26:03,162 --> 01:26:07,284
There's some energy efficiency rebates which is part of what we're exploring.

797
01:26:08,004 --> 01:26:13,726
And I don't know what the capacity for the revolving account will be.

798
01:26:14,146 --> 01:26:14,806
My hope is that.

799
01:26:16,595 --> 01:26:32,866
we fix this, first of all, so that we don't avoid an interruption with respect to the services of the swimming pool or, you know, with respect to food services, which we have some makeshift strategies to avoid, but it's still, it's taxing.

800
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:45,335
And then come back and I'll be able to articulate how we were able to reclass based on revolving accounts and rebates and whatnot, and then hopefully not dip into the capital repairs budget to the extent that we might have to.

801
01:26:46,315 --> 01:26:48,216
So, yes, we're looking at that.

802
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:58,798
And it's, frankly, I wanted to get this before the committee as soon as possible to get your approval and then figure out later how we can defray part of the cost.

803
01:26:58,898 --> 01:26:59,138
Thanks.

804
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:05,940
Motion for approval by Member Russo, seconded by Member Van de Kloot.

805
01:27:07,301 --> 01:27:07,841
Please call the roll.

806
01:27:10,441 --> 01:27:11,041
Member Graham.

807
01:27:11,242 --> 01:27:11,502
Yes.

808
01:27:12,342 --> 01:27:12,862
Member Krantz.

809
01:27:13,963 --> 01:27:15,004
Member McLaughlin, yes.

810
01:27:15,204 --> 01:27:15,884
Member McStone, yes.

811
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:17,566
Member Rousseau, yes.

812
01:27:17,846 --> 01:27:18,646
Member Vanden Heuvel, yes.

813
01:27:19,387 --> 01:27:20,928
Mayor Longo-Kern, yes.

814
01:27:20,968 --> 01:27:22,489
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

815
01:27:22,569 --> 01:27:23,630
The paper passes.

816
01:27:26,912 --> 01:27:30,275
We have presentations of the public now to begin before 7 p.m.

817
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:41,363
Regular meeting minutes of the Medford School Committee include this presentation of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

818
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:43,850
A resident may only present once at any meeting.

819
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:50,452
These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

820
01:27:50,532 --> 01:27:58,075
If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request the item be added to the subsequent regular meeting.

821
01:27:58,595 --> 01:28:04,938
The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy, public comment, and presentations of the public.

822
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:15,585
Pursuant to the policy BEDH public comment and presentations of the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

823
01:28:16,285 --> 01:28:19,767
The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

824
01:28:20,287 --> 01:28:25,230
The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Memphis street address where they reside.

825
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:33,074
Residents may also submit their comments by writing to the superintendent of schools prior to the meeting or by emailing medfordsc at medfordkp.edu.

826
01:28:34,411 --> 01:28:38,314
.k12.ma.us prior to or during the item on the agenda.

827
01:28:39,435 --> 01:28:47,181
Written comments must be kept to a length that allows for them to be read into the rec in less than three minutes or the comments will be summarized by the secretary of the school committee.

828
01:28:47,821 --> 01:28:51,744
A welcoming inclusive community is both the value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

829
01:28:51,884 --> 01:28:55,247
We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

830
01:28:56,108 --> 01:29:06,534
When writing or emailing, please provide this required information, the number and name of the item on the agenda, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, where you reside, your question or comment.

831
01:29:09,075 --> 01:29:10,596
Member Vindicu, do we have any emails?

832
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:17,860
Thank you.

833
01:29:26,838 --> 01:29:32,880
Okay, we'll check on that, but thank you for the update.

834
01:29:33,321 --> 01:29:40,584
Number six, continued business update on maintenance of McGlynn Elementary Kindergarten Classrooms requested on November 8th, 2021.

835
01:29:40,644 --> 01:29:43,385
Mr. David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.

836
01:29:44,525 --> 01:29:45,506
Thank you, Mayor.

837
01:29:45,706 --> 01:29:52,388
The committee voted at your last meeting to receive an update related to some of the repair work that's necessary at the McGlynn Elementary School.

838
01:29:53,289 --> 01:29:56,050
As I noted in a memo to the committee last week,

839
01:29:56,924 --> 01:30:08,607
We have identified a firm, gr la design and ESA waterproofing masonry incorporated, which has been retained to complete this work, it was scheduled.

840
01:30:08,627 --> 01:30:13,888
And I believe I said this in the memo scheduled originally to be completed the day after Thanksgiving.

841
01:30:14,968 --> 01:30:18,429
We run into some scheduling difficulties with that and are currently exploring.

842
01:30:20,389 --> 01:30:27,172
Just to be clear what this is, this is the water testing of the area that had the leaks.

843
01:30:27,393 --> 01:30:39,879
So if you'll recall, a member of the community spoke quite passionately about the challenges that were encountered by a kindergarten class that needed to be moved out of an area of the building due to some leaks.

844
01:30:40,459 --> 01:30:48,203
As I stated at the meeting last week and as noted in the memo, we understand as an administration, this is completely unacceptable.

845
01:30:48,263 --> 01:30:48,763
We don't want

846
01:30:49,283 --> 01:30:58,708
Our kindergarten students or frankly our students in any grade level, having to combat these types of infrastructure based disruptions to their education.

847
01:31:00,509 --> 01:31:06,393
We have had multiple storms, since the one that presumably precipitated the leak.

848
01:31:07,013 --> 01:31:08,974
and it has not reoccurred.

849
01:31:09,754 --> 01:31:15,216
But based on the history of the building, I've been advised that that's not something that we can count on going forward.

850
01:31:15,256 --> 01:31:17,697
And so that's why we're doing this higher level water testing.

851
01:31:18,658 --> 01:31:25,100
But we want to do the water testing at a time when the, obviously when the students are not there.

852
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:31,843
And there are some challenges to scheduling that in a holiday period or on a weekend.

853
01:31:32,003 --> 01:31:34,084
So we're navigating that right now.

854
01:31:34,669 --> 01:31:42,132
The very latest that this work would be completed would be during the holiday recess between Christmas and New Year's.

855
01:31:43,993 --> 01:31:48,675
But it's my hope that we'll be able to identify a way of getting it done sooner.

856
01:31:50,495 --> 01:31:56,658
But there are a few procedural hurdles that we'll have to go through to complete that, but it will not be done later than the New Year.

857
01:31:59,455 --> 01:32:06,317
Through the chair, when you say water testing, you're going to figure out where the leak is coming from, even though some patchwork probably has been done.

858
01:32:06,357 --> 01:32:08,738
I'm going to hire people much more well qualified to do this.

859
01:32:08,798 --> 01:32:17,761
I'm not personally going to, but my understanding is that they will essentially be testing both water and the direction that the water is coming in.

860
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:24,283
So the inference is that we have trouble in this particular area when it's a combination of rain and wind.

861
01:32:25,745 --> 01:32:33,653
torrential downpours that are not blowing sideways has not caused the damage that you saw in those photos last week.

862
01:32:34,494 --> 01:32:39,519
The combination of rain and wind appears to be what the area of the building is susceptible to.

863
01:32:40,059 --> 01:32:49,549
And so that's the specific type of test, as I understand it, that needs to be run to determine exactly what needs to be reinforced in order to prevent this from happening again.

864
01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:52,182
Member van de Kloot.

865
01:32:53,263 --> 01:33:01,945
Just to clarify, so the students were moved, or was this an event where the teacher came in and found the water in the?

866
01:33:02,565 --> 01:33:02,885
Yes.

867
01:33:03,485 --> 01:33:05,566
After the evening or weekend?

868
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:11,047
It may have been identified by a custodian or administrator prior to the teacher coming in.

869
01:33:11,087 --> 01:33:12,427
And the students were moved?

870
01:33:12,988 --> 01:33:14,328
To a different area of the building.

871
01:33:14,859 --> 01:33:18,768
They were not there when they didn't have a ceiling tile come down in the middle of the classroom.

872
01:33:18,828 --> 01:33:19,049
Right.

873
01:33:19,731 --> 01:33:23,559
And then are the ceiling tile has been replaced at this point?

874
01:33:23,938 --> 01:33:26,060
That's my understanding of this.

875
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,121
Are the kids back in that original classroom?

876
01:33:28,141 --> 01:33:29,923
Yes, they're definitely back in there.

877
01:33:29,983 --> 01:33:33,186
It may have a temporary patch over that particular area.

878
01:33:33,966 --> 01:33:36,528
Sometimes that happens before the matching ceiling tiles can come in.

879
01:33:37,329 --> 01:33:43,834
But they're definitely back in their classroom and have been, I think, since the day after the initial damage was done.

880
01:33:44,014 --> 01:33:44,194
OK.

881
01:33:44,495 --> 01:33:47,717
And this was one classroom at the McGlynn.

882
01:33:47,757 --> 01:33:48,278
Is that correct?

883
01:33:48,865 --> 01:33:50,666
I think it was three kindergarten classrooms.

884
01:33:50,686 --> 01:33:51,106
Three.

885
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:51,226
Three.

886
01:33:51,526 --> 01:33:53,207
Three kindergarten classrooms were affected.

887
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:56,268
Same, but they're rooms next to each other, but yeah.

888
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:57,608
Okay.

889
01:33:57,708 --> 01:34:17,856
So one of the things which I'm just going to comment on is that I feel almost like our rules and regulations about how we address something, I think we're unfortunate in this case because we had a member of the public come up

890
01:34:18,595 --> 01:34:23,721
and show some photos, and it says we're not supposed to respond.

891
01:34:24,641 --> 01:34:40,178
And yet it was very clear to me that the superintendent had been down, that she knew a lot about this, that you knew a lot about this, but because it says we're not supposed to respond, that family who was sitting here

892
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:45,245
walked away without any answers, just, and we did what we could do.

893
01:34:45,686 --> 01:34:48,648
We said we referred it and asked you for information today.

894
01:34:49,269 --> 01:34:59,718
To me, there's a process thing, which is difficult for me, only because if we're following our rules, then we're not responding to a person with an immediate concern.

895
01:35:00,768 --> 01:35:07,854
And I think it doesn't speak to the strength of the administrative team who knew everything.

896
01:35:08,455 --> 01:35:15,281
You could have answered the questions last week with a follow-up today or whatever.

897
01:35:16,061 --> 01:35:20,545
But I find that to be, as someone who's been on the committee for a long time, a very difficult place.

898
01:35:20,585 --> 01:35:22,847
And I understand we're following procedure.

899
01:35:23,688 --> 01:35:26,690
To the end, the only thing I could think of, frankly,

900
01:35:28,917 --> 01:35:32,719
to the superintendent is to say, please be more proactive.

901
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:35,140
This was a situation you knew about.

902
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:39,042
It probably should have been in your report, so we could have spoken about it.

903
01:35:39,623 --> 01:35:49,548
So if something like that's the thing, the only thing my sort of plea to you is to be, I think you guys did everything right, that you were on top of the situation.

904
01:35:50,228 --> 01:35:55,291
But unfortunately, when it was presented, because we were following our rules,

905
01:35:56,255 --> 01:36:00,436
it didn't look like you were as on top of the situation as you actually were.

906
01:36:02,496 --> 01:36:03,377
I think that's a fair point.

907
01:36:03,397 --> 01:36:21,301
The only thing I would say is for the members of the community, I don't think any answer I give tonight or any answer I could have given last week are going to erase the fact that three kindergarten classes had to move out of their room and that the photos were taken mid-repair, so they were never going to be

908
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,912
aesthetically pleasing, but I just I think your point is perfectly well taken.

909
01:36:25,932 --> 01:36:30,084
And I think particularly when we know that there's going to be an agenda item and someone who's going to speak.

910
01:36:30,575 --> 01:36:34,378
I think providing that information beforehand will be helpful to the committee and to the community member.

911
01:36:34,858 --> 01:36:44,285
I just don't want anyone to infer that I think tonight's response somehow fully remedies the challenge that those students and families faced, because I recognize that it does.

912
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:49,769
It doesn't, and it never will, because when things happen like that, it's going to be a problem for all of us.

913
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:55,574
But on the other hand, since we did know it was going to be on the agenda, if it had been included

914
01:36:57,764 --> 01:37:03,690
In the superintendent's remarks, we could have said, we're going to hold that until later.

915
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:13,300
I mean, frankly, I'm trying to do a workaround around our rule, which makes sense for other reasons, but is sometimes challenging.

916
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:20,407
And I'm not going to be here to do it, but I am saying to my committee members, this is an interesting dilemma.

917
01:37:22,397 --> 01:37:27,842
In this particular instance, we knew the agenda item was on there, we could have added our own agenda.

918
01:37:27,862 --> 01:37:40,974
So I think you're right, and I think we as a team, and particularly this is an area that myself and the Buildings and Grounds Department are responsible for, we have to be a little more forward leaning in making sure that you have that information.

919
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:46,518
Because I guarantee you that when there's something like this particular problem, it's going to get to the committee.

920
01:37:46,718 --> 01:37:49,881
I mean, it's going to get, you know, it's not a surprise.

921
01:37:49,981 --> 01:37:50,621
Sure.

922
01:37:51,242 --> 01:37:59,188
And so, and it also leads us to just ask the question right now, is there, are we experiencing, there's always leaks?

923
01:37:59,548 --> 01:37:59,729
Yeah.

924
01:37:59,989 --> 01:38:06,334
Are we experiencing anything else that you've got your eye on, that you're concerned about in another?

925
01:38:08,248 --> 01:38:15,934
Yes, I mean, we have a number of infrastructure challenges, particularly with regards to the high school.

926
01:38:15,954 --> 01:38:26,562
So I don't know of a specific spot right now in which there's water coming down, but I know there are areas that need to be addressed in a very comprehensive fashion.

927
01:38:26,982 --> 01:38:29,004
So this is- Let me define my question.

928
01:38:29,124 --> 01:38:33,367
In terms of, this seems like possibly this is a roofing issue, is that?

929
01:38:34,588 --> 01:38:35,228
It's been years.

930
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:37,070
Say it again?

931
01:38:37,765 --> 01:38:39,787
So I'll let you finish, but then.

932
01:38:41,689 --> 01:38:42,350
Is this a roofing?

933
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:44,132
It's a reoccurring leak problem.

934
01:38:44,152 --> 01:38:48,957
I'm not sure if it would be considered walls or roofs, but I believe where the two meet, essentially.

935
01:38:49,057 --> 01:38:50,559
That's not my area of expertise.

936
01:38:50,999 --> 01:38:59,368
It's probably obvious, but it's an infrastructure issue that I believe is presumed to be a design flaw.

937
01:39:01,755 --> 01:39:06,639
But it's not one, I just also want to be clear, this is not something that happens on a weekly basis.

938
01:39:07,319 --> 01:39:20,929
There have been instances in which situations like this at the McGlynn and at least one other school that have happened, as I understand it, historically, and we do our best to respond, but I think it's certainly

939
01:39:22,103 --> 01:39:27,287
It's somewhere between, I don't want to say it's isolated because I don't want to suggest it's the only time that we've ever had a situation like this.

940
01:39:27,887 --> 01:39:32,410
It's not, I have no evidence to suggest that it's rampant.

941
01:39:32,891 --> 01:39:36,793
Specifically, this isn't something which is going to be solved by putting on a new roof.

942
01:39:36,914 --> 01:39:38,515
Is this saying we need a new roof?

943
01:39:39,075 --> 01:39:40,276
I don't know the answer to that right now.

944
01:39:41,775 --> 01:39:46,038
So I think that's part of why we need the testing to take place to understand the extent of it.

945
01:39:46,338 --> 01:39:53,242
So that will be part of the assessment to determine whether it's a new roof or a piece of a particular piece of the infrastructure.

946
01:39:53,262 --> 01:39:53,622
I don't know.

947
01:39:53,642 --> 01:39:55,463
It's just something that we need to do more testing on.

948
01:39:55,783 --> 01:39:55,903
Okay.

949
01:39:55,943 --> 01:39:56,824
All right.

950
01:39:57,004 --> 01:39:57,364
Thank you.

951
01:39:57,544 --> 01:39:57,764
Thank you.

952
01:39:57,804 --> 01:39:58,085
Sorry.

953
01:39:58,105 --> 01:40:02,527
I wish I had more specifics, but I think when the testing is done, we should be able to have more details.

954
01:40:03,808 --> 01:40:05,409
Member McStone, then Member McLaughlin.

955
01:40:06,353 --> 01:40:14,480
Mr. Murphy, I know it was long before you got here, but the teachers from those classrooms have been emailing for years that periodically they had flooding.

956
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:23,627
So I am a little upset that it took a parent to come here with pictures to finally get the ball rolling.

957
01:40:23,787 --> 01:40:32,454
And this is long before you were here, Mr. Murphy, but I guess moving forward and Kathy and I can both speak from being on the building and grounds committee over the years, that

958
01:40:34,856 --> 01:40:46,541
not administrators, teachers or staff members would complain of a building issue and it never was addressed until it seems like a parent came and then it was addressed.

959
01:40:46,561 --> 01:41:00,367
So I'm trying to figure out moving forward, how does the school committee, when we hear of these concerns, get the physical building concerns addressed without having to have a parent come out on a school night, take photocopies

960
01:41:01,775 --> 01:41:07,177
18 pitches times the eight of us here to move forward on our physical structures.

961
01:41:07,577 --> 01:41:09,978
So I think there are two answers to that.

962
01:41:10,658 --> 01:41:20,602
One, as I think you've heard me say before, I think we do need a more extensive and more strategic capital repairs calendar.

963
01:41:20,642 --> 01:41:29,485
That's, as I mentioned last week, the documents that you received last week, was it sort of the first sort of step in that process of just identifying broadly

964
01:41:30,065 --> 01:41:34,208
the list of things that we know need to be addressed from a structural perspective.

965
01:41:34,228 --> 01:41:43,715
I think that's step one, and I think that leads to a capital improvements process consistent with how the city has started to look at their capital repairs in strategic planning.

966
01:41:44,035 --> 01:41:55,943
And I think we need to do that, and I think we have to do it built into a calendar that we know on either a quarterly or a semiannual basis, you're being updated so that you know what's in the pipeline and what needs to be addressed.

967
01:41:56,764 --> 01:41:57,965
The second thing I would say though is that

968
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:05,928
Because the problem has persisted, I don't think necessarily suggest that there was no response.

969
01:42:05,968 --> 01:42:22,814
And as you said, this was before my time, but I can tell you that there are a number of instances in which there have been reoccurring problems and challenges that the district through the buildings and grounds department has addressed, but has not had the capacity to address the underlying structural issues.

970
01:42:23,254 --> 01:42:32,982
And so I think that's an important point because I have not been witness to situations in which situations like this have been ignored.

971
01:42:33,603 --> 01:42:45,453
I have seen a number of situations in which a situation like this has been addressed with a band-aid level solution that then inevitably reoccurs.

972
01:42:46,053 --> 01:42:51,338
And I think that, to go back to my first point with regard to a capital repair strategic planning process,

973
01:42:51,677 --> 01:42:59,585
I think that's how we get away from that mandate type approach.

974
01:43:01,427 --> 01:43:01,787
Thank you.

975
01:43:02,568 --> 01:43:13,398
I just a couple of comments I guess on to the chair and some of the discussion that's been had I think that to the chair again to member band includes point about a family.

976
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,181
Community member coming up and

977
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:32,140
sharing information with us, which I think is a very difficult thing to do for a lot of people, not to mention the photocopying and everything else, but getting up to the podium and being on the screen and having your back to people and, you know, facing us can be very intimidating and so

978
01:43:32,943 --> 01:43:40,929
I applaud anyone who's able to get up there and do that, and especially to point out things constructively in the way that the person did last week.

979
01:43:40,989 --> 01:43:53,698
So I think if I'm not mistaken, and I'm not an expert, but I do believe in Robert's rules of order, which is the governance that we are held to, you can suspend the rules and ask that an imminent issue be addressed.

980
01:43:54,419 --> 01:44:00,143
And again, we can double check on that, but just to, again, through the chair, to member Van de Kloot's point,

981
01:44:00,608 --> 01:44:04,692
there are ways that issues can be addressed if they are imminent on the floor.

982
01:44:04,892 --> 01:44:10,997
So I think we can look into that ourselves and the training around Robert's Rules of Order is really critical for the body.

983
01:44:12,038 --> 01:44:20,126
And then I would also mention that the good of the order that's supposed to be on our monthly meetings is another way that we can sort of address some of these issues potentially.

984
01:44:21,046 --> 01:44:23,308
So that should be on the first meeting, I believe of the month.

985
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:25,490
And then I just wanted to mention

986
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,161
So for the, sorry, I just lost my train of thought.

987
01:44:32,221 --> 01:44:43,103
Oh, as for the building and ground subcommittee, I know that, again, through the chair, Member McStone was talking about the work that Member Kretz and Member McStone do through that subcommittee.

988
01:44:43,623 --> 01:44:51,264
And I think that there are opportunities to work with stakeholders in the community to be part of the subcommittee for regular updates.

989
01:44:51,324 --> 01:44:56,165
So that's part of what I know some of the other subcommittees are doing, just in terms of regular updates for buildings.

990
01:44:56,657 --> 01:45:01,599
where then there could be some feedback in the report back to the rest of the committee.

991
01:45:01,699 --> 01:45:05,660
If that's a process that wants to be established, it could be done potentially through the subcommittee.

992
01:45:06,161 --> 01:45:07,101
Thank you for listening.

993
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:09,362
Thank you, Member Van de Kloet and then Member Roussel.

994
01:45:09,662 --> 01:45:10,862
Yeah, I just want to go back.

995
01:45:11,002 --> 01:45:17,585
In fact, as I recall, as my brain fog lifts, Mia's absolutely right, my colleague, Ms.

996
01:45:17,605 --> 01:45:22,867
Mastones, because I do, in fact, remember that we fixed this problem before.

997
01:45:25,928 --> 01:45:47,042
And that, you know, that's part of the problem is that we fix problems, and they happen again, and they happen again and with all good intentions that people thought that they got to the root of it the last time we had put together, if we, if we go back at least two, four years when we were doing the.

998
01:45:48,963 --> 01:45:54,889
planning over what would infrastructure planning over the next couple of years, what project we would see.

999
01:45:55,529 --> 01:46:04,398
At that time, the roofs were on that saying well they probably have a shelf life of another five years or so well that's back for at least four.

1000
01:46:05,038 --> 01:46:06,059
years, if I recall.

1001
01:46:06,139 --> 01:46:09,641
So I think that document is one that should surface again.

1002
01:46:09,701 --> 01:46:15,684
It does exist and that those were items of concern back then.

1003
01:46:15,984 --> 01:46:19,106
And again, it's difficult because they're big ticket items.

1004
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:21,047
Thank you.

1005
01:46:21,327 --> 01:46:22,628
Member Rousseau.

1006
01:46:23,219 --> 01:46:23,619
Thank you.

1007
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:30,063
I just want to clarify that Robert rules of order is part of our charter actually in the city that that's how we will operate.

1008
01:46:31,124 --> 01:46:38,308
But open meeting law supplants Robert rules and every every way we cannot suspend the law.

1009
01:46:39,248 --> 01:46:45,892
We could suspend Robert rules of order, but the law does make it quite clear that we can't discuss something that on the agenda.

1010
01:46:46,993 --> 01:46:50,895
Unless it's an emergency and emergency a leak that was already done.

1011
01:46:51,485 --> 01:46:54,108
There's nobody who believes that would be considered an emergency.

1012
01:46:54,568 --> 01:46:59,674
If we had a fire in the school building this morning, we can talk about it tonight.

1013
01:46:59,854 --> 01:47:00,855
That's an emergency.

1014
01:47:01,796 --> 01:47:12,368
But a leak that is no longer happening, I certainly wouldn't want to be at the attorney general's office trying to explain why that's considered an emergency and that the law should be suspended.

1015
01:47:13,459 --> 01:47:21,484
So I just wanted to clarify that, no, we cannot discuss or suspend the rules because suspending the rules does not suspend the law.

1016
01:47:22,324 --> 01:47:23,185
Point of information.

1017
01:47:23,205 --> 01:47:27,567
Point of information, member McLaughlin.

1018
01:47:28,388 --> 01:47:34,331
And I guess the question to that is whether that folks knew that that leak was fixed or not, and whether that would constitute an emergency.

1019
01:47:34,371 --> 01:47:36,792
And I think that the body votes on that, not an individual.

1020
01:47:37,313 --> 01:47:41,555
So I would say that it could be put to the body for a question for suspension.

1021
01:47:41,961 --> 01:47:51,066
could be pushed to the body for a vote but I think the administration's heard us loud and clear, you know resident has an issue that is, we have an answer to.

1022
01:47:52,778 --> 01:47:57,219
put it on as an agenda item or in the superintendent's updates so that we can discuss.

1023
01:47:57,339 --> 01:47:58,800
If I could go just one little part.

1024
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:01,781
It's not if a resident has an issue.

1025
01:48:02,241 --> 01:48:18,525
It's asking the administration that if something like this occurs again, where children are moved out of the classroom because of a major issue like this, that you included in the report of the superintendent.

1026
01:48:18,545 --> 01:48:20,126
Because I think that's the easiest way to

1027
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:23,101
to have it on the agenda.

1028
01:48:23,441 --> 01:48:27,563
Or have it as a report that we can discuss.

1029
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:28,823
That's just my thought.

1030
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:29,564
Member Graham.

1031
01:48:30,644 --> 01:48:45,811
I think last week we also talked about revising the ongoing process of capital planning, and we talked about doing that in January, February, pre-budget time, which I still think is a good time to do it.

1032
01:48:46,325 --> 01:48:53,527
And I think we need to start to be exceedingly clear about when we're putting band-aids on things and when we're fixing things systemically.

1033
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:58,549
So if we say we fix something three times, we put three band-aids on, we did not fix it.

1034
01:48:58,569 --> 01:49:08,312
And I think it's misleading and problematic when we tell the community we spent money and fix something, and then we have to tell them we need more money because we actually, turns out we didn't fix it.

1035
01:49:08,692 --> 01:49:09,512
It calls to question

1036
01:49:10,352 --> 01:49:14,114
the competence of us as a district, which I think is hugely problematic.

1037
01:49:14,994 --> 01:49:23,299
I think there's lots of cases where things that are unforeseen happen and band-aids are the actual only thing you can do in the moment so that you can continue to operate.

1038
01:49:23,859 --> 01:49:34,144
But as a committee, we need to get serious about all the things that require money in this district, roofs among them.

1039
01:49:34,425 --> 01:49:37,266
We have a whole bunch of buildings with end-of-life roofs.

1040
01:49:39,227 --> 01:49:42,591
The community is going to be shocked when we have roof problems.

1041
01:49:43,251 --> 01:49:49,438
If we don't start to tell folks proactively what our plan is to fix the roofs and replace them.

1042
01:49:49,538 --> 01:49:52,862
So I think, you know, I know all of this costs money.

1043
01:49:53,002 --> 01:50:01,351
I know that's wildly unpopular to discuss, but I think our kids deserve to go to school and buildings that don't have roof problems that don't have leaks.

1044
01:50:01,965 --> 01:50:10,529
and that we are committed to the amount of preventative maintenance that allows us to make the most out of the life of our infrastructure.

1045
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:18,853
And when that life is over, we need to be in a position to take care of it before it's five years past the end of life.

1046
01:50:20,134 --> 01:50:26,777
So that we are not faced with situations like we frankly are right now across a myriad of issues where we have

1047
01:50:27,792 --> 01:50:36,146
things that need to be replaced and haven't been so to me like it's we can't keep saying we fix things if we put band-aids on them.

1048
01:50:38,274 --> 01:51:00,164
We have to do capital planning in a serious way and in a thoughtful way so that we can contemplate the real cost of things and then we can communicate that through the budget process, through the capital improvement process, to the mayor, to the community, and to all the other people who are gonna ask to support us financially.

1049
01:51:00,264 --> 01:51:07,548
So it's past time for us to do this and we need to start expeditiously.

1050
01:51:09,031 --> 01:51:09,351
Thank you.

1051
01:51:09,932 --> 01:51:10,212
Thank you.

1052
01:51:10,352 --> 01:51:30,014
Thank you, Mr. We have new business motion for updated budget schedule to ensure competitive hiring practices, whereas Medford public schools has historically conducted the annual budgeting process commencing in April and concluding in June, whereas there's a substantive substantive increase in code related funding and fiscal year 22.

1053
01:51:31,512 --> 01:51:43,770
Whereas hiring practices in many districts are finalized by March, April, you resolve the Medford Public Schools budgeting process commence in January and conclude in March with budget recommendations presented to the City Council in March.

1054
01:51:44,290 --> 01:51:46,113
Submitted by Member McLaughlin and Member Rousseau.

1055
01:51:46,874 --> 01:51:48,196
Member McLaughlin?

1056
01:51:49,928 --> 01:51:50,328
Thank you.

1057
01:51:50,348 --> 01:51:58,790
I think the motion speaks for itself and especially after just hearing from Member Graham about the issues needed to address the budget.

1058
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:08,252
I think it's imperative that we address the budget sooner and get on a cycle that we have competitive hiring processes for our staff.

1059
01:52:11,333 --> 01:52:11,953
Member Van de Kloet.

1060
01:52:12,738 --> 01:52:36,892
I just would like to ask the administration as to whether a timetable like this is doable, realistic, and what, if not, what would be realistic given the obvious desire of the committee to move the budget discussions up earlier.

1061
01:52:38,754 --> 01:52:40,295
So in response to that,

1062
01:52:43,263 --> 01:52:56,374
The third bullet about whereas hiring practices in many districts are finalized in March and April, it would be our desire to be able to be equally competitive with other districts.

1063
01:52:57,315 --> 01:53:11,007
A lot of the strongest candidates are scooped up right in the middle of whether they're new graduates, but they're scooped up much earlier than when we have access to trying to recruit competitive candidates.

1064
01:53:11,747 --> 01:53:26,090
It's going to take a lot, a lot of work for us to be able to move the timetable up, but I think it will put us in a stronger, more strategic position to be able to recruit stronger talent to bring to Medford.

1065
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:35,832
So we will work hard to meet the new deadline, but in the end it will benefit us as a district.

1066
01:53:39,910 --> 01:53:45,813
has, if I may, from the chair, has the budget discussion started internally?

1067
01:53:45,833 --> 01:53:48,614
Is this, like, January date feasible, or?

1068
01:53:48,634 --> 01:53:52,276
I just want to make sure we're not setting anybody up for failure.

1069
01:53:52,336 --> 01:53:55,717
Like, would February- Mr. Murphy, would you- February, or?

1070
01:53:56,457 --> 01:54:08,263
I just want to be realistic, because I know the city's gonna, side's gonna have to give a number, and that's gonna, we usually do that in January, so I just need to get on this myself.

1071
01:54:08,283 --> 01:54:08,963
Just your microphone.

1072
01:54:14,153 --> 01:54:14,613
Thank you, Mayor.

1073
01:54:15,494 --> 01:54:23,801
I think what I would say is that our budget process is a continuous one, and so it's ongoing throughout the year, and I think it's necessary.

1074
01:54:24,802 --> 01:54:43,797
I take the motion based on what I've read on the agenda to indicate that the school committee would like the public discussion and examination of the district's budgetary priorities to occur earlier in the year, which is something that the administration has spoken about with regularity, about the need to do that.

1075
01:54:44,528 --> 01:54:57,883
With respect to the hiring process, I would actually say that there's going to be variables that are beyond our control with respect to the budget process both at the city and state level, frankly great potentially the federal level.

1076
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:14,564
And so I think it would be more accurate to say that we are, whether it's through this motion or just through the practices that we're attempting to develop that we forecasted last during last year's budget process to decouple the budget process with the hiring process.

1077
01:55:17,255 --> 01:55:29,881
year in and year out, generally, how many positions we're going to hire for and on occasion there's a question about well, this is going to be a staffing strategy that we're going to pursue, if we have the budgetary capacity for it.

1078
01:55:30,241 --> 01:55:35,183
And in those instances we likely would need to wait until final adoption of the budget

1079
01:55:35,723 --> 01:55:47,206
which for whatever process plays out at the school committee level, we'll need, as I said, we'll need the city and the state to finalize their processes before we can truly make those types of commitments.

1080
01:55:47,766 --> 01:55:58,348
But at the same time, every year there are, at the beginning of the budget process, we know whether it's because it's top priority of the committee or because we have a general understanding as to what our capacity will be,

1081
01:55:58,845 --> 01:56:02,447
We know, or frankly because we know there are impending vacancies that will need to be replaced.

1082
01:56:02,987 --> 01:56:14,773
We know that there are staffing priorities that we can pursue by changing our recruitment strategies, and those timelines that are not frankly interwoven with the budget, and I think that that's something

1083
01:56:15,645 --> 01:56:34,760
it's imperative that we do that's what's going to put us in a position to be more competitive and if the committee would like us to present publicly on budgetary priorities earlier in the year, we can absolutely do that understanding that there are variables and judgments that evolve over time.

1084
01:56:35,305 --> 01:56:49,890
I don't know if the budgetary priorities, which reflected a significant increase in investment in FY 22, would have been the same if we were somehow locked into priorities as early as March.

1085
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,350
I suspect they wouldn't be.

1086
01:56:51,871 --> 01:56:58,253
But that doesn't mean that we can't begin that process, begin that public discussion, and begin that scrutiny earlier.

1087
01:56:58,713 --> 01:57:01,234
And as a general rule, I think it's a good idea that we do that.

1088
01:57:02,886 --> 01:57:08,510
The answer to the mayor's question is that yes, the budget process has started in the sense that it's never stopped.

1089
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:29,106
In terms of the more formal public process in terms of the presentations to the school committee or to subcommittees or to committees of the whole, I would suggest that I think we need direction from the committee as to exactly what form you want those to take, because it's not gonna have any impact in terms of the quality of our advocacy

1090
01:57:29,928 --> 01:57:39,275
our budget number or our hiring process, if we just take everything that we used to do in April and May and move it up to January and February, that's gonna be irrelevant.

1091
01:57:39,595 --> 01:57:48,061
It's not gonna be problematic, and I don't have any objection to this motion, but it's the other practices that we'll have to adjust in order to truly put us in a more competitive position.

1092
01:57:49,502 --> 01:57:49,842
Thank you.

1093
01:57:49,862 --> 01:57:52,885
Okay, motion on the floor, Mayor?

1094
01:57:52,965 --> 01:57:55,086
Member Grim.

1095
01:57:56,547 --> 01:57:57,468
So I agree with you.

1096
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,168
I think

1097
01:57:59,637 --> 01:58:06,765
There is no reason that the committee is prohibiting you all from hiring the best candidates.

1098
01:58:06,985 --> 01:58:10,529
And if that's not happening, that's a process issue that can be fixed.

1099
01:58:10,849 --> 01:58:13,752
And you actually don't need our permission to do that.

1100
01:58:13,832 --> 01:58:17,797
So I hope that you will because having competitive hiring process is

1101
01:58:19,008 --> 01:58:22,770
more important than it's ever been in the right now.

1102
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:26,252
So I think that's critically important.

1103
01:58:26,812 --> 01:58:30,334
Two years ago, when we kicked off the budget process, we had a committee of the whole.

1104
01:58:30,414 --> 01:58:35,777
And one of the things we did in that committee of the whole was talk about what should the process look like and be.

1105
01:58:36,598 --> 01:58:43,841
And I'm not personally wed to the way that we handle our budget meetings or historically have.

1106
01:58:45,560 --> 01:59:01,073
I think that if we want to have a discussion about how we want that public process to work and where and when it happens, what I would suggest is that we have a committee of the whole that is dedicated to that discussion.

1107
01:59:01,893 --> 01:59:04,636
We all agree on what that's going to look like so that when you

1108
01:59:05,316 --> 01:59:06,677
give us documentation.

1109
01:59:06,857 --> 01:59:09,038
It meets sort of what we were expecting it to meet.

1110
01:59:09,398 --> 01:59:17,863
And we can talk about a reasonable schedule that does not include having five meetings in the month of May to jam this in.

1111
01:59:19,384 --> 01:59:24,868
And maybe it does or doesn't include 25 or 30 administrators coming before us.

1112
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:31,191
So I think there's a whole bunch of opportunity for better process than we have today.

1113
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:33,673
And I am open to that discussion in January.

1114
01:59:34,994 --> 01:59:50,649
If, if we want to schedule that amended, as we approve this in concept but have a committee of the whole meeting in January to discuss the, how the process will lay out, I think I, I think I appreciate that I think it's a, it's a, it's a

1115
01:59:51,254 --> 01:59:54,255
I think it's a good suggestion, a good point by Ms.

1116
01:59:54,275 --> 01:59:54,455
Graham.

1117
01:59:54,475 --> 02:00:10,041
What I would suggest is that at the Committee of the Whole, the administration bring forth an initial presentation for the committee to consider, and then I think that will help to have a thoughtful discussion about what the budget process as a whole could look like.

1118
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:16,504
I think as a general rule, I hear agreement with regard to the resolution that the committee wants the process earlier in the year.

1119
02:00:17,024 --> 02:00:20,245
As I said, I think that's something that the administration has spoken about with

1120
02:00:20,585 --> 02:00:28,712
that we think we should do that, but understand that the finalization of the budget involves variables that are beyond our control.

1121
02:00:28,852 --> 02:00:38,840
And what I don't want is for the community to have a misunderstanding as to what the school administration or the school committee can do as early as March.

1122
02:00:39,861 --> 02:00:46,967
We can identify priorities, we can advocate for them, and as you did last year, you can take a vote to make a request to the municipal government.

1123
02:00:47,447 --> 02:00:56,409
but the state allocation and the municipal allocation ultimately lives in a different body, and we just have to be clear and transparent about that.

1124
02:00:56,949 --> 02:01:16,334
But yeah, I think preparing for a committee of the whole meeting in January that starts with essentially a proposal as to what the budget process could look like, hand that to the school committee, allow you to discuss to make sure that it's consistent with your expectations and the expectations of the community, and then we execute that process with an understanding that

1125
02:01:16,774 --> 02:01:21,456
we want as much of it sort of front-loaded as possible so we have as clear a picture as possible by March.

1126
02:01:21,916 --> 02:01:29,838
I think both gets to the essence of the resolution before you and some of the better practices that we've all said that we want to pursue in future budget years.

1127
02:01:30,979 --> 02:01:33,679
Great, so motion for approval as amended.

1128
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:44,683
I'd like to restate the motion then so that it's that the motion is as is with an amendment that it commences with a committee of the whole meeting

1129
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:49,564
that will lay out a proposed process for the January through March.

1130
02:01:50,024 --> 02:01:54,107
So that's for Susie's notification if she's taking notes over there.

1131
02:01:54,147 --> 02:01:54,908
Is that acceptable?

1132
02:01:57,410 --> 02:02:02,314
Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Grimm.

1133
02:02:03,114 --> 02:02:03,775
All those in favor?

1134
02:02:04,535 --> 02:02:04,735
Aye.

1135
02:02:04,816 --> 02:02:05,216
Opposed?

1136
02:02:05,836 --> 02:02:06,497
Motion passes.

1137
02:02:07,854 --> 02:02:09,936
Number eight, reports requested.

1138
02:02:10,016 --> 02:02:14,600
Report on superintendent's goals tabled, which was tabled on November 8th, 2021.

1139
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:22,967
Yes, it's tabled, and I will try to bring it forward at our next December meeting.

1140
02:02:23,328 --> 02:02:25,770
Main table, okay, thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1141
02:02:27,251 --> 02:02:28,412
We have condolences.

1142
02:02:28,812 --> 02:02:33,717
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Anthony Tony Martin,

1143
02:02:34,466 --> 02:02:38,879
Brother-in-law of school committee member Kathy Kratz, if we all may rise for a moment of silence.

1144
02:02:56,365 --> 02:03:00,812
Our next regularly scheduled meeting is Monday, December 6th, 2021.

1145
02:03:01,273 --> 02:03:04,678
