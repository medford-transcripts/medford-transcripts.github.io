    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=211.743s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=212.784s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=213.244s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=216.206s">Six</a>  in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=219.328s">Board</a>  of subcommittees, we do not have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=222.77s">Next</a>  up we have report of superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=225.171s">Superintendent's</a>  updates and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=227.452s">Dr.</a>  Maurice Edward-Vinson.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=245.254s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=246.215s">I'd</a>  like to start with a public health update. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=251.278s">As</a>  we noted in the last two school committee meetings, I will be incorporating updates on public health and COVID-19 in my remarks going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=264.206s">But</a>  of course, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=266.288s">Hines,</a>  Mr. Murphy, and other team members are available to answer any questions you might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=275.393s">Members,</a>  you've received our COVID-19 update memo in your email packets, and that document is also posted on the district website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=287.639s">We</a>  did see a slight uptick in positivity in last week's surveillance testing, after we had dropped a minuscule 0.37% the week before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=299.854s">Our</a>  1.54% positivity was reflective of both the concerning community-wide numbers and a cluster identified in a program unaffiliated with Medford Public Schools that our health services team immediately notified the Board of Health about last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=320.593s">Despite</a>  the uptick in positive cases, we were very happy to report <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=327.497s">that</a>  we maxed out participation in our NPS students-only COVID-19 vaccination clinic that was held at the Andrews Middle School last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=340.0s">Through</a>  our partnership with the Board of Health, we will be holding a second vaccination clinic for students ages five to 11 this coming Saturday, November 20th, from 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=353.664s">to</a>  1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=355.085s">at</a>  Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=357.526s">Please</a>  be sure to sign up and we'll have additional communication about this event in the coming days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=364.71s">It</a>  will be on the four-year side, so coming in through the main entrance, that is one piece of information for people to be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=375.577s">Finally,</a>  with respect to public health, today we issued a survey to both staff and parents and caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=385.02s">The</a>  survey which I have referenced in my last few Friday updates to the community was commissioned by Tufts University, who as you know, they have partnered with us to have one of the most successful coven testing programs in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=403.42s">The</a>  researchers at Tufts University are seeking to obtain data related to the barriers that districts faced in getting students back into school and how we can operate on a more equitable basis when it comes to COVID-19 and public health in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=422.133s">The</a>  surveys are voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=426.015s">of</a>  course, but all NPS community members are encouraged to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=431.979s">So</a>  please check your email for that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=437.303s">Also,</a>  being that November is the month of Thanksgiving, I have notes of gratitude to share with all of you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=449.31s">A</a>  special thank you to the families of the five to 11 year old students who participated in a very successful COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=458.277s">Again,</a>  that was held last Wednesday at the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=464.642s">Nearly</a>  300 students received their vaccinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=470.207s">But</a>  we also want to send out some special thank yous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=474.53s">First</a>  to the Medford Public Schools nursing team, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=478.686s">The</a>  city's Board of Health team who worked really hard to make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=485.048s">I</a>  would also like to thank our own CTE vocational health assisting students who are actively involved in supporting the vaccination clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=496.537s">It</a>  is so wonderful to know that we are providing our health assisting students with real life experiences and training. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=505.387s">And</a>  we are so grateful to be holding a second clinic this Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=513.407s">I</a>  do wanna just make note that we were expecting 300 vaccinations for this coming Saturday, and we are going to have an increased number, possibly doubling that number if we could get up to 500 participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=531.194s">So</a>  I do wanna just say that in that section here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=535.386s">I</a>  also wanna send a sincere thanks to all of our veterans who came to Medford High School last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=542.289s">They</a>  took time out of their busy schedules to make presentations to all of our humanities classes on Wednesday, November 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=551.893s">We</a>  truly appreciate their service and we were so glad to have been able to welcome them back into our classrooms this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=561.176s">So</a>  upcoming events, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=563.882s">This</a>  Saturday, mark your calendars, the COVID-19 vaccination clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=568.864s">Please</a>  note that it is a location change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=571.446s">I</a>  did say at the high school, it will not be at the Andrew School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=575.508s">It</a>  is at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=577.849s">And</a>  since the Medford Board of Health secured an additional 600 vaccines, which is fabulous news, we are really excited about increasing the amount of participation on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=592.339s">So</a>  please go back to the registration portal and sign up for a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=597.011s">We</a>  will also have walk-in appointments available. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=600.339s">So</a>  please do not miss out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=604.067s">In</a>  that same vein of talking about the vaccination clinics, medical help is wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=609.768s">We</a>  are looking for registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, and doctors who are authorized to administer shots to come out and help. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=621.811s">Please</a>  reach out to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=623.891s">Avery</a>  Hines, our health services director at 781-393-2292. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=631.334s">or</a>  you can email her at ahines, H-I-N-E-S, at medford.k12.ma.us if you are interested in volunteering at the vaccination clinic this Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=649.078s">Also</a>  on this Saturday, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=651.885s">The</a>  Greater Boston Girls on the Run event will be taking place in Medford at Hornell Stadium between 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=659.891s">and</a>  11 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=660.932s">I</a>  believe we are expecting nearly 1,000 runners, and Mayor will be participating in running of her team, so we wish them a successful run this Saturday between 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=674.844s">and</a>  11 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=678.057s">On</a>  Sunday, November 21st, our Mustang football team will be hosting the alumni

dismissed at 1130 and noon on Wednesday for early dismissal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=814.244s">Friday,</a>  November 26th, there is no school, so it is a long weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=819.709s">On</a>  Sunday, November 28th, the Mustang Band parents begin hosting their annual Christmas tree and wreath sale at the high school parking lot from 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=831.879s">to</a>  5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=835.534s">on</a>  Tuesday, November 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=839.178s">Medford</a>  High School will be hosting their first night of parent-teacher conferences, and those will take place in the gymnasium from 6 to 8 p.m. <a

the unique contributions made by our first Americans for the growth and establishment of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=925.921s">President</a>  Biden noted in the annual

World War I and World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=948.395s">This</a>  month and every month, we honor the precious, strong, and enduring cultures and contributions of all Native Americans and recommit ourselves to fulfilling the promise of our nation together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=962.131s">Lastly,</a>  since we will not meet again before Thanksgiving, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=966.849s">I</a>  would like to take this opportunity to wish all of our families an enjoyable holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=973.294s">At</a>  the same time, Thanksgiving needs to be celebrated safely, and I am asking that all students, staff, and families rededicate themselves to our effective COVID prevention measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=989.776s">It</a>  is important that we remain vigilant in our COVID awareness as we go into the Thanksgiving holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=996.802s">Outside</a>  of school activities could greatly impact our exposure within school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1004.069s">So</a>  please remember to wear a mask, meet with friends and family outdoors when possible, and stay home if you're feeling ill or recently exposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1016.982s">So</a>  in closing, I do wanna just share one final announcement that this Wednesday, we will be hosting a small clinic, vaccination clinic at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1032.078s">This</a>  is in partnership with an organization that also was part of the stop the spread sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1041.75s">This</a>  vaccination clinic will be taking place between 1230 and 2pm on the vocational side of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1051.122s">And</a>  the preferred age group is for individuals who are over 18 years old or meet qualifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1061.506s">We</a>  did ask if there were going to be additional offerings, and we will get final information for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1070.791s">There</a>  is a possibility that we may have some Pfizer vaccinations available for students that are 12 and older. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1081.261s">So</a>  we will have final details on that very small vaccination clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1087.227s">which</a>  is hoping to vaccinate approximately 80 individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1093.17s">We</a>  will have the final details on that tomorrow, and we will advertise it widely tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1100.253s">That</a>  will take place on Wednesday, which is early release day at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1105.495s">And</a>  those are my announcements for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1108.357s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1110.395s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1112.116s">If</a>  I may, just from the chair, the vaccine clinic on Saturday, because of the girls on the run race, we have moved that to the high school, which you pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1119.86s">We</a>  just want to make sure people got a response that it would be at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1123.962s">That's</a>  not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1125.043s">The</a>  vaccine clinic is at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1127.204s">Change</a>  of location. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1131.146s">Next</a>  up, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1132.943s">The</a>  MCAS Alternative Report, Director of Pupil Services, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1136.905s">Joan</a>  Bowen, will report on the district's result for the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1141.826s">The</a>  MCAS is administered to our students with significant disabilities who are unable to participate in the standard MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1152.285s">alternative</a>  assessment monitors student progress over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1155.728s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1155.888s">Bowen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1156.409s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1157.75s">Tonight</a>  I will be presenting on the MCAS alternative assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1163.555s">As</a>  you know, students in Massachusetts are required to take the MCAS test and they can take it in three ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1170.28s">So</a>  the routine standard MCAS test, also the standard MCAS test with accommodations or the MCAS alternative assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1181.034s">Students</a>  with disabilities take the standard computer-based or paper and pencil MCAS test, either with or without accommodations, at the grade level specified for assessment in that subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1194.228s">But</a>  there are a small number of students with disabilities, with significant disabilities, who are unable to take the standard MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1202.357s">Those</a>  are our students who take the alternate assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1206.866s">And</a>  this is about 1% statewide of all students with the most significant disabilities that take the assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1214.112s">Medford</a>  Public Schools had 17 students participate this year in the alternate assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1220.514s">And</a>  they all consist of a portfolio of specific materials that's collected throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1227.536s">And</a>  when I say the school year, it's typically September to March, and then the portfolio is sent into the, to DESE, where they score it and then send the results back late in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1240.836s">For</a>  each student that is on an IEP or a 504, their team decides how, not whether they'll participate in the MCAS assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1251.189s">The</a>  teams make the determination using the guidelines found in the principal's manual for the MCAS alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1258.398s">And</a>  our special education teams follow this decision-making tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1262.822s">I've</a>  included it in your packet and it's just a flow chart that they go through at every team meeting to indicate or to decide which student will be participating in the standard MCAS and which students will be participating in the alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1280.596s">And</a>  then they have to make that decision for each content area that the student will be taking the MCAS testing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1289.729s">So</a>  part of the process is we have our teachers go to the training through DESE in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1297.133s">There</a>  are sessions throughout the school year that the teachers can go on to get further training or to have their students portfolios looked at and get feedback from DESE representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1309.981s">So</a>  once we identify the students going through the decision-making flowchart, each teacher will provide the student with a skill survey for each strand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1321.985s">So</a>  they have to do this for English, for math, and if appropriate, for science, depending on the grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1327.988s">So</a>  for English, there's one reading and one language strand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1331.189s">In</a>  math, there's three strands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1334.37s">In</a>  science, there's three strands as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1337.833s">Based</a>  on the results of the skills survey, they select entry points or access skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1344.317s">And</a>  then the students participate in the same content areas as the grade level pair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1348.62s">So</a>  if we're starting at grade three, it would be math and English. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1352.743s">We</a>  also have our veteran teachers who have experience compiling and creating the MCAS alternative assessments, work with our newer special education teachers who are required to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1367.064s">So</a>  once the student is identified and the skill surveys is completed, the teacher has to set up the folder or the binder that will be presented to DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1378.016s">They</a>  select the measurable outcomes and classroom assessment activities, and they compile a binder following the DESE guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1387.603s">In</a>  your packet, I provided you with an example from DESE, and it starts with the strand cover sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1394.228s">And</a>  this just is one strand or an example of a strand that the teachers need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1399.932s">So</a>  they have to provide the cover sheet, which tells the learning standard that the work samples will be addressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1409.277s">They</a>  have to do include the skills survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1411.658s">There's</a>  a bar graph with student performance that looks at accuracy and independence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1418.421s">And</a>  then there's also work samples that go along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1421.222s">So</a>  this is not a Metro public school student. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1423.363s">This</a>  is just a sample from the department of education. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1425.964s">I</a>  mean, Jesse, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1427.794s">But</a>  this is the kind of work that the teachers are required to do for each one of their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1434.681s">Once</a>  it's completed, the teacher meets with the guardian or caregiver and they review the binder and the parents sign off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1441.964s">Once</a>  we receive the parent's signature, it's sent to DESE, where they look at it, they score it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1448.047s">We</a>  get preliminary results in mid to late August, and then we get the final report at the same time the standard MCAS scores come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1458.711s">And</a>  then the parents and guardians and caregivers also receive a breakdown of what the scores are, what they mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1470.279s">And</a>  there also is a scoring rubric, which I included in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1474.722s">So</a>  they're looking at five different areas when they score a student's learning standard and materials that are sent in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1482.627s">They</a>  wanna look at the level of complexity, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1485.887s">A</a>  demonstration of skills and concepts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1489.269s">The</a>  level of independence that the student has exhibited when completing an assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1495.193s">Do</a>  they need hand over hand? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1496.734s">Do</a>  they need visuals? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1498.175s">Do</a>  they need prompting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1500.346s">self-evaluation,</a>  this is the student providing feedback on how they felt that they did on the actual task that was at hand, and then generalized performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1512.975s">And</a>  that's a demonstration of knowledge and skills that they have provided samples. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1520.0s">And</a>  then I broke it down per schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1522.834s">Mr.</a>  Cushing, Dr. Cushing, if you could go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1526.757s">By</a>  each school and the grade level that the students participated in, the content area, if you can go to the next slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1540.069s">So</a>  this is the Roberts Elementary School, and there were two students in grade three and two students in grade four. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1547.195s">And</a>  this is the achievement level that they received in those two areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1552.855s">The</a>  next is the McGlynn Elementary School, and I broke it down the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1557.478s">So</a>  we had three students at the McGlynn Elementary School that participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1562.061s">There's</a>  a grade three student, a grade four student, and a grade five student. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1568.886s">If</a>  you go to the next, which is McGlynn Middle School, which is the next two pages, we had sixth, seventh, and eighth graders, sixth and seventh graders participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1579.662s">And</a>  they also participated in English, math, and some participated in science as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1584.706s">And</a>  the last is Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1587.709s">We</a>  had three students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1589.79s">We</a>  had two ninth graders who took the science and then one 10th grader who took the ELA and math. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1596.125s">There</a>  are several students that received an incomplete, if you see that on the chart, and we are looking at that right now with the teachers to determine why that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1606.495s">Sometimes</a>  the learning standard doesn't match the curriculum framework, or there was not enough evidence that was submitted to support the student being able to receive the achievement of emerging, progressing, that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1623.443s">So</a>  these are the scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1624.924s">I</a>  do wanna let people know that we did not include the out-of-district results in this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1629.886s">We</a>  are still collecting those, and I will be able to follow up with those results as soon as we receive them from all of the out-of-district schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1640.31s">But</a>  the next steps for us is we continue to make these determinations on what students require the MCAS Alt Assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1648.933s">Staff</a>  will continue to receive support from DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1652.719s">We</a>  are scheduling check-ins with the special education coordinators for their specific staff who will be completing the ALT assessments, just to check their progress, answer any questions, make sure they're on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1666.165s">The</a>  completed binders should be done by mid-March for the final review from the special education coordinators. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1673.208s">And</a>  then we will obtain parent signatures and submit to DESE by the deadline of March 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1682.512s">Anyone</a>  has any questions?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1685.593s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1688.294s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1688.794s">Thank</a>  you for putting this report together, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1691.395s">Bowen,</a>  especially in the short amount of time that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1694.536s">So</a>  I appreciate that this will be <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1696.248s">an</a>  ongoing report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1698.449s">It's</a>  interesting information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1700.55s">So</a>  17 students in the district entirely participate in the ALT based on the grade levels for MCAS requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1710.236s">And</a>  when you say a review with the binder with the parent and that there's a signature <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1715.202s">required</a>  in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1716.784s">Do</a>  you know, like, have folks, because that's sort of the first I'm hearing about the review of the binder with parent and signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1723.55s">So</a>  is there communication with CPAC around how that's working and whether that's working or with your coordinators around how that's working?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1730.697s">So</a>  I believe the signature is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1733.137s">So</a>  last year was very different with COVID and some parents may not have been able to come in to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1740.199s">So</a>  they might've reviewed it via Zoom and then had the parents sign off on a different, like a separate sheet and send it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1747.36s">But</a>  I know that's something that we are required to do is to, to meet with the parent and to review the whole binder to make sure that they understand why we're doing the MCAS and all the hard work that the student has done throughout the year.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1760.383s">Yeah,</a>  that sounds like a really valuable process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1762.505s">I'm</a>  just, I want to make sure that it's happening for parents because it's, yeah, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1766.269s">And</a>  we'll also, maybe we can check in with CPAC and ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1770.294s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1771.315s">And</a>  is the review with the binder and the signature happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1775.599s">And</a>  when you get the OO at a district, can you check? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1778.543s">if</a>  the review with the parent for the binder is happening with signatures on that as well, just to make sure.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1783.029s">Yeah,</a>  the other district should be meeting with the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1785.292s">If</a>  they're not, we need to know about that because they are submitting the documentation and the evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1790.56s">So</a>  we want to make sure that parents are aware that it's being sent in.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1793.87s">I</a>  couldn't agree more. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1794.631s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1795.371s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1795.971s">And</a>  where did the portfolios live once they're finished?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1798.933s">So</a>  once the portfolios come back, we've set it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1801.895s">So</a>  we, there's a cover sheet that provides us with the students results. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1807.098s">We</a>  put that in their special education binder, and then we send the portfolio home because it is their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1813.803s">It</a>  is their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1815.024s">So</a>  we want the parents to have it.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1816.965s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1817.405s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1819.847s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1820.647s">I</a>  think that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=1821.548s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
