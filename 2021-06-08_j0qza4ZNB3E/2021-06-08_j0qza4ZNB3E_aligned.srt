1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,251
committee approval, be it resolved that the chairman select the members who will actually make the presentation to the school committee.

2
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:19,695
The chairman determined the presentation teams outline who will speak about which slide the committee assigned members to assist in logistics of the presentation with city hall staff.

3
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:28,017
The committee will send a message to the school committee asking for the appropriate time and approve approved length for the presentation.

4
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,321
offered by Ron Jovino.

5
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:33,925
Can I get a second on that?

6
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:47,203
Can I ask just was that about the length of the

7
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:51,809
those about the length of the presentation before we present it?

8
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,571
It's not about the length.

9
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:01,933
It's a kite before the horse, because once we have approved the presentation, hopefully today,

10
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:20,098
I just wanted to figure out how we're presenting it in front of, you know, the logistics, who's talking, who's, you know, who do we have to coordinate the slides with, how the presentation, it's just basic stuff that we just, I don't wanna walk away today without having, you know, an idea of who's talking and who's doing what.

11
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:24,561
I think once we approve, no words can be changed, but just who wants to do it.

12
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:26,903
Well, but then do we know how long we have?

13
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:31,186
Because if they're like, you have 30 seconds, which- They mentioned last night, 30 minutes.

14
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:34,474
Oh, OK.

15
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,815
They were warned 30 minutes.

16
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,436
They don't believe us, but we have plenty of time.

17
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,476
It won't be 30 minutes.

18
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:42,617
I think 30 minutes is fine, as long as they don't go crazy with questions.

19
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:44,518
Yeah, that's up to them, right?

20
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:44,738
Right.

21
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:46,178
OK.

22
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:47,559
Mr. Lister, this is Matt.

23
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:47,779
Yes.

24
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,520
So I thought we kind of semi-determined this.

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,802
I thought you, Mr. Lister, were going to kind of lead the charge, and then the people who wrote their sections were going to present.

26
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:57,482
Point of order.

27
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:59,783
We need a second before we continue discussion.

28
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,731
I'll second the motion.

29
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:04,811
Thank you.

30
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:07,273
All right.

31
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:09,014
Is my question valid then, Mr. McCabe?

32
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:16,037
I thought we talked about Mr. Lister being the lead presenter, and then people were doing their sections.

33
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:18,919
Maybe that's what Ron is getting to.

34
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,701
I don't know.

35
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:23,261
Maybe.

36
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:25,422
I think that's an assumption.

37
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:26,803
I don't think we've actually decided.

38
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:35,424
you know, my resolution is more about anybody who wants to be involved should at least be able to volunteer and Jim can make that decision.

39
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:48,687
I believe that we had spoken about possibly the chair presenting the process portion and then having

40
00:02:49,989 --> 00:03:02,351
those who volunteered to speak and voted for the names to speak, but I'm not certain how applicable that would be now.

41
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:17,574
Just through the chair, I mean, my resolution is a basic logistic one so that we have in writing who's doing what, how do we get the slides up with the city hall meeting, just those things.

42
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:18,754
I don't, it's not about

43
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:26,230
anything more than I just want to, I know we've talked about it, but we haven't really decided who the ones that will be talking are.

44
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,576
So, and this is all after there was a presentation approved.

45
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:36,665
So this, if we approve it just means we're going to talk about it after the presentation is voted on.

46
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:46,981
Mr. sure if I could speak on it as well just through the chair thank Ron for putting out the logistics I think it's very important to get those on paper.

47
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:53,990
I agree with most of almost all of this the only change I would suggest, perhaps as a friendly amendment is that.

48
00:03:54,551 --> 00:04:10,764
people volunteer we've done everything on a volunteer basis now so if people are interested in presenting that they volunteer and that there's more than one volunteer that we just put it to a simple vote, since we've all sort of gotten to know each other so well and work together so so well on this committee.

49
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:12,926
I would accept that.

50
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:28,245
So just to clarify with that friendly amendment, that would mean that people would volunteer.

51
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:40,269
And then if there's more than one person volunteering for the same section, there would be a simple vote of the whole committee as to who would be the person to present.

52
00:04:43,237 --> 00:05:01,021
Yeah, I do think that we have a chairman and that chairman should drive this whole process, but let's hope that we don't run into... People who are passionate about a slide should be able to say, I'm passionate about a slide and we move forward.

53
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,221
It shouldn't be anything but that.

54
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:05,742
But yes, I agree, volunteers are the way to go.

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,204
And I was just saying, you know, to put into a vote to sort of continue this collaborative process with no disrespect to the chair, his ability to make a decision.

56
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:31,729
You're muted, Jim.

57
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:35,818
Doesn't work that way, huh?

58
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:36,338
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,220
Myself, I like, I've talked to Ron about doing part of the presentation.

60
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,021
And I think that Dr. Caldara, we've talked about her doing her rubric.

61
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,562
So those would be two people that I would like to do most of the presentation.

62
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:55,064
And then if anybody wants to volunteer to participate, we can find a place for them.

63
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:56,144
Okay?

64
00:05:58,685 --> 00:05:59,325
We good with that?

65
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:02,926
Patrick has his hand up.

66
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:04,567
Patrick, go ahead.

67
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:13,330
Yeah, the concern that I have is just get the cart before the horse a little bit here with the first whereas.

68
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,612
The whereas says we've already agreed on the presentation, which we haven't, so.

69
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:19,834
We haven't because we keep stalling, I guess.

70
00:06:19,894 --> 00:06:21,014
We're too slow with that.

71
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:29,600
So we can't, I don't think that we can vote on an amendment saying we've agreed to the presentation when we haven't, so.

72
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:34,403
I would like to make a motion to accept the presentation

73
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:36,947
except supply to anyone.

74
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:42,290
Is there a second so we can get this over with and then we can finish what we need to do.

75
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,671
Mr. Lister, I just have to say I am not in a hurry.

76
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:53,376
And also the fact that you're, you're describing how we're working together on each slide and stalling.

77
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,856
It's just, I don't feel that way at all.

78
00:06:54,916 --> 00:07:00,859
So I just want to make sure I watched the school committee last night and I was, we were criticized for taking so long.

79
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,580
Well,

80
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:05,354
We're trying to obstruct this, I guess.

81
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:08,496
I think we're doing good due diligence.

82
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,357
I agree.

83
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:15,361
I think voting on it right now to just pass it all, I wouldn't mind reviewing the last couple of slides that we haven't really looked at.

84
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,443
There's enough.

85
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:18,984
I've looked at it independently.

86
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:25,089
I move to table my resolution and get to Patrick's resolution.

87
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,130
That's important, too.

88
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,492
I can second that motion to the table.

89
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:29,653
OK.

90
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:31,274
The second resolution.

91
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:51,891
If the committee is unable to agree upon a full presentation by 530, the committee's presentation will include pages one through eight of the presentation, which we reviewed last week and a nine slide with the three names proposed and nothing else offered by Patrick McCabe.

92
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:57,256
Do I get a second on that?

93
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,637
I second.

94
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:05,080
A point of information, if we're not in a rush to push this through, then what's the point of this resolution?

95
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:15,566
Mr. Havestro just said that he had no intentions of rushing this through, but it seems like if we're just going to vote at 530, regardless on the slides, we're kind of being contradictory.

96
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:16,326
Right.

97
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:21,529
So I think it's because we all feel like the presentation is done.

98
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,871
It's just, we haven't actually formally reviewed it together.

99
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:28,853
And I know I would like to do that.

100
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:42,432
Curt Brown, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- John Gerstle, COB OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown,

101
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:47,307
just everybody has a chance to look at it this weekend, right Mr. Chair?

102
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,289
We should be able to get this done in an hour and 15 minutes.

103
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:58,774
If not, I mean, you know, the mayor had said we could have another meeting this week if we had to, not that I want to, I would, I'd like to wrap it up tonight.

104
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:00,716
I think the presentation looks great.

105
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:02,317
Point of information.

106
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:05,834
Yes, I would like to just offer a friendly amendment.

107
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:13,019
Patrick's, uh, you know, it looks like we are we maybe Dr Cushing knows, but it looks like the next event here is 6 30.

108
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:21,305
I would hate to think we lock ourselves into 5 30 and have one slide left and we have to scrap the whole thing.

109
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:25,128
So, um, I'm just offering a friendly.

110
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:28,050
Maybe we go to, um, 6 15 to make it, uh,

111
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:33,733
more palatable, but we need to move the vote or else we're going to waste more time here.

112
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:40,142
Sorry to interrupt, but this Zoom channel is wide open this evening.

113
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,045
Okay.

114
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:53,923
You know, I'll be doing double duty at seven o'clock for the National Junior Honor Society at the McGlynn, but this, we do not have the issue that we had last week.

115
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,065
And I also wanna say, I apologize for having to cut everybody off.

116
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:02,248
It was the budget hearing for our $68.2 million budget for next year.

117
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:05,590
So I apologize for anyone that was cut off.

118
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:07,151
Thank you.

119
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,992
Jim, Jim, do you have a question?

120
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,471
Um, so this is Danny.

121
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:22,157
So you, you said, you know, the information out over the weekend, uh, you know, I know I reviewed it and I'm sure some of the other folks reviewed it.

122
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:30,081
Maybe it's just a simple of question of, you know, you asking, was there anyone that wanted to change on something?

123
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,383
And if there was, then we proceed and go through it.

124
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:37,786
But if there was no one that had a specific change, then why can't we just move it along?

125
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:42,043
All right, well, first, I agree, but first we have Patrick's motion.

126
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:49,266
If you want to continue on with this, we got to vote it up or down, and then we can continue on and get into the slides, hopefully.

127
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:53,607
And if anybody has a slide that they want to pick out, we can work on it.

128
00:10:55,107 --> 00:11:06,211
To Ron's question of the friendly amendment, Ron, my concern is, you know, if we're saying 615, then we have to vote on your

129
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,819
you know, your amendment as well.

130
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:17,023
So, um, if you're, you know, if you're agreeable to six o'clock, I'll, I'll accept that as a friendly amendment instead of five 30.

131
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:17,383
Yeah.

132
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:20,264
I just want to move the question.

133
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:21,525
Yes, that's fine.

134
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:23,246
Okay.

135
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,968
Weren't we just told that we didn't have any time restraints tonight?

136
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:27,708
Right.

137
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:34,892
So it's a yes or no vote on whether we, uh, ended at hard at six o'clock.

138
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:35,332
Right.

139
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,032
Okay, it's a yes or no vote whether we end at six o'clock.

140
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,934
Not in the meeting, but at six o'clock.

141
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:43,175
And the deliberation.

142
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:46,556
And the deliberation on the slides.

143
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:47,457
Correct.

144
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:52,700
But let me just be clear that it ends the slide and it also cuts out the information.

145
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,601
So that's what we're voting on.

146
00:11:55,301 --> 00:12:00,544
Right, but there's still a discussion about who presents the first eight slides and the ninth slide.

147
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,405
Yeah, I agree.

148
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:02,965
Yeah.

149
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:04,266
Okay.

150
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:07,956
Bri, yes or no?

151
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:09,016
Yes.

152
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,239
Dan?

153
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:15,760
No.

154
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:17,861
Erin?

155
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:20,043
No.

156
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:22,164
Beth?

157
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:29,448
Beth, do you hear?

158
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:32,990
Yes.

159
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,271
I'm sorry, yes.

160
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:39,329
Dr. Grace?

161
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:40,490
Yes.

162
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:43,932
Ken Mallon?

163
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:44,793
Yes.

164
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:48,375
Kristen Scalise?

165
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:49,336
Yes.

166
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:52,778
Laura Rotolo?

167
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:53,658
Yes.

168
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,720
Lee?

169
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:58,301
Yes.

170
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:01,123
Lewin Tapa?

171
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:07,667
Oh, okay.

172
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:09,415
Oh, he's on now.

173
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:10,036
Yup.

174
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:11,656
Maria Rosha.

175
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:12,797
Yes.

176
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:14,978
Melissa Miguel.

177
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:16,838
No.

178
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,299
Patrick McCabe.

179
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:19,920
Yes.

180
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,421
Paul Donato.

181
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:23,201
No.

182
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,302
Ron Giovino.

183
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:26,422
Yes.

184
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:29,003
Seth Hill.

185
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:30,724
Yes.

186
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:33,105
Kathy Kay.

187
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:33,905
Yes.

188
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:36,787
Matt Haberstraw.

189
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:37,547
Yes.

190
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:42,882
And I'll call him Mackenzie.

191
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:43,743
Yes.

192
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:46,646
It was before.

193
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:47,587
Yes.

194
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:49,910
And Jim Lister.

195
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,510
No.

196
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:13,295
Yep, 15 in the affirmative and six in the negative.

197
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:18,589
So we ended at six, one way or the other, okay?

198
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:27,763
Now, Mr. Chairman, may I make a motion to have the presentation the way it is so we don't delay anymore.

199
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:34,167
We can discuss whatever you'd like to discuss afterwards, but we can accept the presentation as it is.

200
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:40,812
So this way there's no argument or no discussion about eight slides, nine slides.

201
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,555
It's the 20 slides minus the 21, slide 21, and then just...

202
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,013
then we can nitpick through every slide afterwards.

203
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:52,594
Can I get a second on that?

204
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:55,915
Well, I object to this, Mr. Rustin.

205
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:57,396
Well, let's get a second.

206
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,398
If we're going to discuss it, we need a second.

207
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:03,300
If we don't get a second, we won't go any further.

208
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,201
Can I ask a point of information?

209
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:05,861
Yes.

210
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:10,464
When I looked at the slides, there were 27 slides, and I'm hearing a number of 21.

211
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,478
When I looked at it, did things change?

212
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:16,679
How many slides are there that we're talking about right now?

213
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:27,323
Point of information, those slides after slide 21 were left there as part of the discussion from the editing issue that we had, which is no longer.

214
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:34,146
So those, if everybody agrees, those are invalid slides and those were just there for, so it's 21 slides right now.

215
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:37,429
Okay, that's what I wanted to know, because some of the information was repeated.

216
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,631
Yeah, those additional ones about- I wanna know how many I'm voting on.

217
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:44,273
Those additional slides about Jean Barry Sutherland are deleted.

218
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:46,254
The end.

219
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,676
So my motion was seconded, Mr. Chairman.

220
00:15:51,356 --> 00:16:03,482
Okay, so now- We can discuss the slides, but let's just approve the entire process, and then we can go through slide by slide if you'd like, but at least we know that the 20 slides have been approved.

221
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:11,415
How can we approve the 20 slides without, I know that we were specifically asked not to edit, but to make comments.

222
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:16,898
And I know I made a couple and I would, I'm assuming people left comments that we should read.

223
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:19,380
So now's the time.

224
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:21,803
Right.

225
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,965
I just thought we would start where we left off last week.

226
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,406
There's not that much more to do.

227
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:29,148
It will take us longer.

228
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,029
We're interested in saving time.

229
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:40,376
I sent it out to all of you so you could look at each slide, make your own notes, and then while we're here right now, we'll discuss what certain slide you want to discuss.

230
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:44,158
If there's a slide that no one has a problem with, we don't even need to look at it.

231
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:45,039
We'll accept it.

232
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:52,809
I was at the school committee meeting last night, Mr. Chairman, and I was, you know, disappointed that they said that we were trying to stall the process.

233
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:58,677
Well, right now is a motion on the floor, not to stall the process any longer.

234
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:02,903
We can discuss like Brie said, individual slides or individual comments.

235
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:07,225
but at least we can agree on the 20 slides to go forward.

236
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,827
So now we don't have to worry about a six o'clock deadline.

237
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:13,729
We don't have to worry about anything because the 20 slides have been approved.

238
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,010
I just think that's just watching things.

239
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,011
I just want to begin where we left off.

240
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:20,832
A lot of us have notes for different slides.

241
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:21,733
I don't see any reason.

242
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:25,015
Thank you for your report from the school committee.

243
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,496
I didn't watch the school committee.

244
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:28,277
I'm not delaying any process.

245
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,858
I don't think you are either, Mr. Donato.

246
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,160
And I think we should just review the slides where we left off.

247
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,320
There's not that much more to go.

248
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,102
Yes, I've reviewed it, but I think people want to discuss it.

249
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:38,404
Point of order.

250
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:58,878
trying to just count through 20 slides, 21 slides, I'm like, you know, I printed what was sent by the chair, I have 30 something slides, I recognize that some of them were what were added at the end that weren't for Ron.

251
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,939
But my last slide that says thank you,

252
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,630
That's 27, I believe.

253
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,831
I'm still trying to count.

254
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:12,155
So I think that we need to go through specifically slide by slide.

255
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,878
We're going to have 20 slides, 18 slides, 21 slides, whatever it is.

256
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:21,821
There's no other way in which to do it other than just doing it step by step.

257
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:28,926
I just don't want the school committee to think that we're stalling the process because I think that we amazingly- This process is our own.

258
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:29,847
I'm sorry to interrupt.

259
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:33,848
We are, we have a motion.

260
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:35,529
So you'd vote no on the motion then.

261
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:38,930
So don't want to just take the whole thing.

262
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:47,052
It was a point of order that that motion can't stand as is because we don't actually know what the motion is.

263
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,852
What 20 slides are we actually talking about?

264
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:54,374
Which specific 20 slides is the motion?

265
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:56,234
Paul, would you like to repeat your motion?

266
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:01,608
Yes, there are 22 slides.

267
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:06,550
We're going to say because the thank you, after you look, the thank you would be slide number 22.

268
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,931
The thank you is slide 20.

269
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:11,833
It is 22, sorry.

270
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:12,653
Thank you.

271
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:14,274
Slide 22 says thank you.

272
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,855
The one prior to it is 21.

273
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:23,239
I'm just asking that if we could delete slide 21 off the whole process,

274
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:31,632
and keep those other slides, which are 20 slides, with the thank you, end with the thank you.

275
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,033
Just remove slide 21, that's all I'm saying.

276
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:42,016
And we could say, yes, and now you wanna individually, like Matt, and I agree with you, Matt, we can go through each individual slide.

277
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:49,839
But in case we go past 6.15 or six o'clock, at least we know that these 20 slides are approved.

278
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:54,270
that we've all looked at and we've had all weekend to look at them.

279
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,232
The school committee thinks that we're stalling the process.

280
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:58,493
And I don't want that.

281
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:06,619
We've done such an amazing job on this presentation and it should be seen in its entirety.

282
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:11,022
And I don't wanna see just eight slides be presented to the school committee.

283
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:14,665
I think that these 20 slides should be approved.

284
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,466
That's just my opinion.

285
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,789
Point of information to the motion maker.

286
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:24,657
Paul, I hear you, I listened to that stuff last night as well.

287
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:45,168
I think what I would ask you to do is table it, and at any point between now and our deliberations till 5.59, I think that's a valid proposal, but it sounds like just the feel of the room says we need to go through these, even though we've all committed to six o'clock, I hope we do it with great speed.

288
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,870
But I'm just asking to consider it, you don't need to.

289
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:57,117
I'm not sure Mr. Lister who shared her screen before and was making corrections and what slide we are stopped off.

290
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,917
I think it was nine or 10 or something like that.

291
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:02,878
And since a lot of us have looked at already, I think it's just going to go a lot faster.

292
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:05,479
The last time many of us didn't even see what was there.

293
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:13,800
So let me just, we can get done while you want to withdraw your motion.

294
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:17,221
I'll cable it until five 45, Mr. Chairman.

295
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:18,362
All right.

296
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:19,222
Very good.

297
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:20,082
Thank you.

298
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:26,850
Okay, all right, the last time we were here, who put it up on the screen for us?

299
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,531
I did, Kristen.

300
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:30,873
Can you put it up again for us, Kristen, please?

301
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:31,713
Yes.

302
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,836
And I believe we were at page eight.

303
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:46,044
We had just moved the former slide up to eight, and then we went with, we are back on nine, but we went with Melissa.

304
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,427
good to put it in the different alphabetical order.

305
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,929
So now slide nine starts with Missituck.

306
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:55,911
So we will run back into Belinda.

307
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,573
We can go through that quickly.

308
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,074
And this is Kathy Kay.

309
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:07,681
I just have a small amendment that I think we need to make to slide number four, because it talked about the number of meetings and the dates that we had, and we've now had one more meeting.

310
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:08,882
So that would need to be updated.

311
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:12,965
Can everyone see my screen?

312
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:13,605
Yep.

313
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:14,286
Yeah.

314
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:17,988
You can see I made that comment as well.

315
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:22,031
So I think we're on the same page that we just need to add this last meeting, hopefully.

316
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,812
Okay, so just change this to eighth.

317
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,356
And have we met six times now.

318
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:29,797
This is our sixth.

319
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:31,418
I think so.

320
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,362
The only thing I wanted to say, too, is we don't have our names anywhere in this.

321
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,102
And maybe that's by design.

322
00:22:42,623 --> 00:22:44,204
But I think our names should be.

323
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,485
First slide.

324
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:47,025
First one.

325
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:49,306
Is it?

326
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,707
I don't remember seeing it when I looked it over.

327
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:51,067
Yes.

328
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:54,609
All right.

329
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:55,569
I apologize.

330
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:58,390
Thank you.

331
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:01,392
OK, so.

332
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:04,425
that we took care of.

333
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,006
We switched the order.

334
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:07,686
Excuse me on that one.

335
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:08,707
Back up on that one.

336
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,669
We took out additional recommendations.

337
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:12,289
Yes.

338
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:12,909
Bottom line.

339
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,350
Did we?

340
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:14,991
Yes.

341
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:16,672
It's in the minutes of the last minute.

342
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:17,172
Yes, we did.

343
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:23,376
Sorry, my cursor is having weird issues.

344
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:28,038
You're doing a great job, Kristen.

345
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:28,358
Thank you.

346
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,940
I'm just running a lot of apps right now.

347
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,481
I don't know how

348
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:35,533
My computer wants to keep up, but we'll see.

349
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,056
I think we did edit this bullet.

350
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,037
Yes.

351
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:43,937
Yes.

352
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:45,998
We did not change.

353
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:47,599
I think we're on.

354
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:48,079
We agreed.

355
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,400
Okay.

356
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,741
So now nine is the new first slide for MESA talk.

357
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:53,522
Yes.

358
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:54,602
Cause we switched the order.

359
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:56,303
Let me see if I can make this.

360
00:23:58,724 --> 00:23:58,885
Nope.

361
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:01,806
Anyone have any problems with this slide?

362
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:24,699
I have a comment, not a problem, just I added a suggestion for, I think, a first sentence which I took out of that book that's called the, by Michael M. Coates, I think it's called Our Medford, just to give a little context and the line would read, the first known people on the land, now called Medford, were members of the Pawtucket tribe.

363
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,384
That was not, the Pawtucket tribe was not mentioned anywhere, so I thought that would give good context.

364
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,362
So you want to say the Massachusetts and Pawtucket tribes?

365
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:50,306
My understanding, please, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, is that the Massachusetts tribe encompasses many other tribes, including the Pawtucket.

366
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:55,048
When I looked at the website of the Massachusetts tribe, it looks like the Pawtucket was in there.

367
00:24:55,689 --> 00:25:04,493
And looking at this book by Mr. Coates, it looks like the 30 or 40 Native Americans who lived here were part of the Pawtucket tribe.

368
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:05,766
That is correct.

369
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:07,347
Everybody please correct me.

370
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,808
Erin has her hand up and she might know.

371
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:12,929
Okay, Erin.

372
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,631
I actually had a comment on a previous slide.

373
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:30,076
First, or maybe at another point, but I was curious about the process for the children's input and whether that was something we were going to add.

374
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,757
But as to this question,

375
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:45,965
I think that, yes, the Pawtucket peoples encompassed many different tribes.

376
00:25:46,146 --> 00:26:00,813
And also, because it's a river, it's also a place where many other tribes had territory as well, because of the river route.

377
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,515
So I don't know if you want to put that in there too.

378
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:10,146
how that might be put into the slide.

379
00:26:11,627 --> 00:26:16,152
I couldn't trace the naming of the river to any one particular tribe.

380
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:22,137
In all the places where it talked about it being named, it just talks about it being named by the native peoples who lived here.

381
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,606
Because like you said, the river spans many communities and many tribes at the time, right?

382
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:43,637
point of information, my research shows that Medford was purchased from the wife of the chief of the Pawtuckets, so I think it's valid to put Pawtucket in there.

383
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:55,567
I think you could probably put both, just to be sure.

384
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:01,672
I'm just typing, I have no knowledge

385
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:08,854
I think Massachusetts is the Massachusetts tribe does not have an S at the end.

386
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:28,744
Another point is in that last slide, it says the location of our school.

387
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:35,023
Could we change that to of the Hicks Ave School?

388
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:46,329
I believe that using our is a bit confusing, although it is a presentation about renaming this school, but just the pronoun our seems odd.

389
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,471
I'm sorry, which slide?

390
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:51,931
The previous one to this?

391
00:27:52,812 --> 00:27:59,735
No, on this, on the first Missituck, on that last bullet point where it says the location of our school,

392
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,327
Oh, I guess it does seem a little strange since we all didn't go to elementary school there.

393
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:09,850
Maybe just put the?

394
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,311
Yeah, take out the word our and put in the word the.

395
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,674
You can call it Kathy K's school.

396
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:22,658
She's responsible.

397
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:43,047
Another point in the bullet point saying colonists moved here because of the river and built great ships.

398
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:46,708
Could we remove the word great?

399
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:50,288
That's just a personal thing for me.

400
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:56,390
It just seems like an unnecessary adjective there.

401
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:01,751
Unless that's a quote.

402
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:04,277
by the way.

403
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,058
I know.

404
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:14,759
It just, it, it feels like the, in the context, but it would be fine to keep as well.

405
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:17,040
I'm okay.

406
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,500
If that word is removed as well, because it does put value.

407
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:28,022
Well, our ships were valued over the world and how fast they moved.

408
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:29,442
So I have no problem with great.

409
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:47,119
I would actually prefer, maybe I have less of a problem with the word great than I do with essential, considering the type of trade that was happening at the time.

410
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,421
What if we just said clipper ships?

411
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:53,485
Sailing ships?

412
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:54,927
Is that what they built?

413
00:29:56,018 --> 00:29:58,760
We were a very famous method for building clipper ships.

414
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:04,565
They were able to go to China to get spices and silk.

415
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:12,110
And so anyway, Magoon was a big ship builder, for example.

416
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:16,534
Anyone who grew up on Magoon Ave?

417
00:30:16,574 --> 00:30:23,199
You could say great clipper ships that were renowned around the world.

418
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:25,708
or renowned ships.

419
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,669
Right, renowned ships around the world.

420
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,151
And never get rid of essentials trade.

421
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,613
And you can say used for trade around the world and take out the word essential as well.

422
00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:34,753
Exactly.

423
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:39,356
So built great clipper ships that were renowned around the world.

424
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,718
Maybe you have a better example, I'm not sure.

425
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,773
And they were also used for the triangle trade too, so I think.

426
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,494
Right, that's the.

427
00:30:52,614 --> 00:31:00,977
Like maybe not saying that it was, I agree, maybe not placing that value on it because it doesn't have the same value for everybody.

428
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:07,199
I'm fine.

429
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:08,699
I feel like I missed something.

430
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,361
Well, I did use the word renowned, but I'm okay with this sentence the way it is if it sounds.

431
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:14,521
Renowned clipper ships?

432
00:31:16,102 --> 00:31:16,402
I don't know.

433
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:20,955
Great keeps it on two lines, and doesn't force it down to three.

434
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:21,956
I think it's fine.

435
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:23,376
It could just be clipper ships.

436
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:25,297
It could just be clipper ships.

437
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:26,878
It could be just clipper ships.

438
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:28,738
I'm fine with any version of this, by the way.

439
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,939
I'm sure some people think it's great.

440
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,960
Our ships were great.

441
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,240
We know our ships were great.

442
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:36,001
Can we just all call them?

443
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,241
Go to the school committee.

444
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,103
Everybody knows our ships were great.

445
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:52,471
Yeah I believe that we shouldn't be placing on not necessarily undue but controversial or subjective value on these.

446
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:08,484
Although great ships is also a category of ship not necessarily referring to fine building but I think a great ship is a like a class of

447
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,433
I think that's true.

448
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:17,135
I think great ship actually refers to the class of ship it was.

449
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:21,696
But I think if we're saying clipper ship, shouldn't that be enough?

450
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:23,136
Yeah.

451
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:28,978
I also think it's less likely to be misinterpreted as putting value.

452
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:31,759
I think this sentence is fine.

453
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,919
I think we can, personally, I think we can move on.

454
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,440
But this is just me and our teacher.

455
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:44,958
Correction, and that is on the last bullet point.

456
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:50,843
I think the school name was Mystic School and not The Mystic School.

457
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,705
There's too many thes.

458
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:56,067
So just get rid of that.

459
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,309
Just called Mystic School.

460
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:02,192
It's my recollection of what was scraped off the building.

461
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:07,232
And do we even need the first word that there?

462
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:10,034
The school was first built in the location of the school?

463
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:13,397
Originally called Mystic School after the river.

464
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:14,518
Could be a comma.

465
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:15,379
Yes.

466
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:18,321
What about the school that was first built on Hicks Ave?

467
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,264
Because we have the school and the school.

468
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:22,085
That works too.

469
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,626
I like Hicks Ave.

470
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:24,987
Was it always Hicks Ave?

471
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:27,489
Yes.

472
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,450
OK.

473
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:33,841
You're very good at this editing thing.

474
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:37,442
Lifelong admin.

475
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:41,344
Thank you.

476
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:46,785
Next slide.

477
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:47,745
Next slide.

478
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:51,326
Oops, sorry.

479
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:53,407
There we go.

480
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:56,448
If I may, Lisa just made a comment that Clipperships is two words.

481
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:57,988
Oh, thank you.

482
00:33:58,809 --> 00:33:59,069
Really?

483
00:33:59,129 --> 00:33:59,689
Oh, OK.

484
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,498
No, I don't think that it is, Kathy.

485
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:05,660
I think it was just an autocorrect.

486
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,601
Yeah, I think that's it.

487
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:10,264
I can double check, but I'm not too sure.

488
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,725
I think it's one word, but I'm not sure.

489
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:13,547
It does have a red line underneath it.

490
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:14,748
Clippership drive is one word.

491
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:16,089
Clippership is one word.

492
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:16,669
Oh, wait a minute.

493
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,591
Is it like, should it be capitalized?

494
00:34:18,611 --> 00:34:21,474
I was just going to say, is it like a proper noun?

495
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:22,154
No.

496
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:24,056
All right.

497
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:25,077
Someone else Google.

498
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,579
I think that's the anomaly of the software.

499
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:27,779
Yeah.

500
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:32,689
Someone make sure I'm not a sailor.

501
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:36,693
I won't pretend to know.

502
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:42,497
I think it's lowercase.

503
00:34:42,638 --> 00:34:43,158
Okay.

504
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:53,306
Let's move on.

505
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:56,289
Point of information, I think Jim Lister was kicked off the meeting.

506
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:57,750
I'm told he has no power.

507
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,454
I'm not sure if we can proceed without the chair.

508
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:04,276
I just want to let everybody know.

509
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:09,039
Tell him he can dial in by phone.

510
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,241
Yes, he did not reach out to me.

511
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:13,501
Someone else did.

512
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:14,462
Jim, are you here?

513
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:15,662
Oh, no.

514
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:20,205
Hopefully he remembers that from a couple of meetings we had, right?

515
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:23,602
I know, cause it happened to me and that's what I had to do when he walked me through it.

516
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:32,124
So hopefully, um, put in the chat, the, uh, the phone number that he can dial in, but he probably can't see the chat.

517
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:32,444
Right.

518
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:35,785
I can text him if you'd like.

519
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:36,165
Okay.

520
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:36,785
Sorry.

521
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:42,786
If any school committee members are listening, this is not a stall tactic.

522
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,107
Thank you, Matt.

523
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:46,247
Thank you, Matt.

524
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,921
You could have voted already.

525
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:58,262
So according to Marine Insight website, clippership is two words.

526
00:35:58,922 --> 00:35:59,483
Oh, man.

527
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:00,803
Really?

528
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:04,764
Every resource that I attack says two words as well.

529
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:05,925
There we go.

530
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:09,005
We'll rename the street and give you credit.

531
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:09,886
All right.

532
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,707
Are we all serving on the street renaming committee?

533
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:17,028
I want to sign that nomination, Paul.

534
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:32,139
Point of information for for Melissa, Jim had contacted you the last time around, with by text message I believe.

535
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:42,885
know whether or not you might still have that within your cell phone to actually just get right back to him.

536
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:47,828
I tend to delete my text messages, so let me see if I can scroll back.

537
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:49,629
But yes, I will try and send that to him.

538
00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:53,412
I just wanted to make sure we weren't breaking any rules by continuing without him.

539
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:56,975
Oh, you have a quorum, so it's fine.

540
00:36:57,395 --> 00:36:57,795
Perfect.

541
00:36:57,935 --> 00:36:58,956
All right, I'll work on that.

542
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:02,238
All right, Melissa, I'll leave that up to you then.

543
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,200
No problem.

544
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:09,310
I just asked Lisa to put it in the chat if she's available to have the phone number.

545
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,112
I would just suggest that we continue with friendly amendments.

546
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:15,754
And if a vote has to happen, Jim should be here.

547
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:16,855
OK.

548
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:18,096
Yes.

549
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:19,097
I second that.

550
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:22,839
We just spent 28 minutes on the one slide.

551
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:25,721
So we've all committed to 6 o'clock ending this.

552
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:27,042
So just keep that in mind, too.

553
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:31,365
But if we're all ever in tributaries come up, we are going to kill it.

554
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:35,014
I'd like the school committee to see this.

555
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:43,300
I think we should, as much as wordsmithing can be really great, I think this is where we're getting bogged down.

556
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:53,647
So let's look for big and rather large things that need to be corrected and kind of stick with that.

557
00:37:54,327 --> 00:38:01,632
If we're dealing with particular words, unless they're offensive, let's try and keep moving forward.

558
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:07,537
20 minutes on a slide is a really long time.

559
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:14,464
I also would suggest too that our procedure has been the person who writes these has the opportunity to approve friendly amendments.

560
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:17,427
So I would consider doing that again.

561
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:23,514
And if we run into a hit a wall, then we have to vote, but I don't know who the author is in this case.

562
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:28,196
I'll take this slide just so we can keep moving.

563
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:36,000
I just wanted to ask that I think the third bullet was already stated on the slide before.

564
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,301
Oh, that's true.

565
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:51,928
Should we, since this slide is pretty crowded, should we maybe delete, remove, put this full sentence since we just agreed on it onto the next slide and remove it from here?

566
00:38:52,655 --> 00:38:54,121
I think that's a great idea.

567
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:54,744
Great idea.

568
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:55,106
Absolutely.

569
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:12,616
While you're pasting that, I will go over my comment.

570
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:19,997
Before Jim had asked us not to edit the slides, I'm just saying I made this edit before that.

571
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:30,379
That last line originally said, acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of Columbus, which we discussed last week.

572
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:35,560
I did remove Columbus from that and I changed the wording to say,

573
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,890
colonization and the theft of Native American lands.

574
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:53,878
Just after sitting with the feedback from Ron, Paul, and Danny, I kind of came to the same realization that that's not doing any good at this point.

575
00:39:54,278 --> 00:40:03,264
So I'm good to use the more neutral language there for the sense of healing the rift, moving forward.

576
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:05,224
all of that.

577
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,825
So as long as people are okay with that change.

578
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,206
Thank you, Brie.

579
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:10,626
I like that change.

580
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,407
I think it's great, Brie.

581
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:13,167
This is Danny.

582
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:14,088
I think it's great.

583
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:14,928
Thank you.

584
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:16,029
Cool.

585
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:23,052
So removing the last bullet point or... No, no, no.

586
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:23,892
It's already been changed.

587
00:40:23,912 --> 00:40:24,192
Oh, right.

588
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:26,433
We changed it from... Okay, great.

589
00:40:27,513 --> 00:40:29,234
I believe Jim is back on.

590
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:30,415
Okay, good.

591
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:31,495
Yay.

592
00:40:32,135 --> 00:40:33,296
I think this looks good.

593
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:33,816
I like the

594
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:37,468
acknowledge all of the different ways the river is used.

595
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,589
I like it.

596
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:43,031
Next slide, folks.

597
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:43,691
Next slide.

598
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:51,276
Can we, sorry, can we resolve the comments as we go?

599
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:52,336
Sure.

600
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,778
So we, yeah, so we know.

601
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:55,478
Cool.

602
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:03,343
Now we have other slides, maybe

603
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:09,366
reducing the quotes or editing them just because they're very long.

604
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:14,548
And it's a lot for the, you know, to read.

605
00:41:14,568 --> 00:41:21,070
I think the school committee can handle reading this.

606
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,571
I don't think the point is to read the quotes.

607
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:25,932
I think the point is to just give a visual.

608
00:41:26,912 --> 00:41:27,373
I agree.

609
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:27,773
I think

610
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:35,382
What I did in my writing is they're just gonna be up there and the speaker notes, which you all got to see is a summary of what's there.

611
00:41:35,402 --> 00:41:36,802
I don't think we need to read those either.

612
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:38,083
Okay.

613
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:42,946
I also like the idea of, these are quotes from people in the community.

614
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:44,426
I do too.

615
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:45,527
Passionately.

616
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,348
I think it's good to include that.

617
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:49,149
I'm gonna make this a capital.

618
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:58,971
I'm back.

619
00:42:00,612 --> 00:42:01,073
Hello.

620
00:42:02,474 --> 00:42:03,475
What page are we on?

621
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:03,475
20?

622
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:07,640
I lost my power.

623
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:10,483
The power blinked off here and I lost everything.

624
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:11,564
Oh no.

625
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:12,525
This looks good.

626
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:15,769
Can we move to the next one?

627
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:16,410
Yes.

628
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:18,332
Everyone likes this.

629
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:31,315
I thought this was, who wrote this?

630
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,516
I thought this was a nice slide.

631
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:37,280
I believe that was me.

632
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:48,109
I put a lot of, the non-Jean Barry Sutherland, I at least did a lot of the initial starting work to get it going.

633
00:42:48,129 --> 00:42:49,870
Great.

634
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:55,255
Should this be tied mills for the corn, tobacco, grain, wood, and textile industries?

635
00:42:57,228 --> 00:43:02,970
I think we're talking about language like that, but I think that's what also Grace warned us against spending too much time on that.

636
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:07,151
So, well, again, if it's school committee, we should probably have, they migrate us.

637
00:43:08,011 --> 00:43:14,773
And is the, is that last already mentioned on another slide about the poem and the, I don't think so.

638
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:15,334
Okay.

639
00:43:16,854 --> 00:43:23,136
We might take out the word from that next line and it's grammatical.

640
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:29,885
I just make a suggestion that everybody can go to their, you know, the grammatical stuff.

641
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:34,908
We can just put comments in there and then we can clean it up as Grace had said.

642
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:42,434
I'm fine with 12.

643
00:43:43,715 --> 00:43:44,095
It's good.

644
00:43:44,816 --> 00:43:46,637
Is it over the river and through the wood or woods?

645
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:53,643
I think it varies on the version and in and out.

646
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:54,664
Okay.

647
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:56,024
Whatever you decide.

648
00:43:56,985 --> 00:43:58,005
Okay, moving on.

649
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:58,826
I like it.

650
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:02,667
Agreed.

651
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,130
Anybody else?

652
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,091
Okay, can we go to the next slide?

653
00:44:15,593 --> 00:44:16,574
We should probably

654
00:44:17,173 --> 00:44:18,694
And again, we can do this after.

655
00:44:18,714 --> 00:44:26,479
I would just say we should, the font name, but we can change that after.

656
00:44:26,919 --> 00:44:28,020
Did you say the same font?

657
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,041
Yes.

658
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:31,242
Yeah, I noticed that on slide 17 too.

659
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:36,265
Yeah, but we can do that after, but we can make the font consistent.

660
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:39,888
Yeah, there were some font and spacing issues through here, so.

661
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,831
I think it's true, but it's not plural.

662
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:52,031
It's all interesting.

663
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:53,411
Okay.

664
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:58,833
According to the title of the Thanksgiving poem by Lydia Maria Child, if that's what you're referring to.

665
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:07,254
And it's not grandmother's house, it's grandfather's house, the original, but I don't know where I can't really, it's on my phone.

666
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:10,275
So I can't really see.

667
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:15,616
But the name of the poems over the river and through the wood, singular.

668
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:17,849
Thanks.

669
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,470
And then we switched to grandma.

670
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:25,432
All right, any comments?

671
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,713
I think we reviewed this one last time, didn't we?

672
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:30,753
Because it used to be before.

673
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:33,474
And we know all the stats are accurate, right?

674
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:36,375
Because I don't know when she taught where and that sort of stuff.

675
00:45:38,496 --> 00:45:40,036
OK, we ready to go to the next one?

676
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:42,897
Please.

677
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:43,837
Yes.

678
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:45,278
Thank you.

679
00:45:55,742 --> 00:45:59,943
You know, if we could just resolve that space issue in the last bullet between the two last bullets.

680
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:05,825
I mean, is there a reason why there's a, there you go, thank you.

681
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:22,471
Do we think that that last bullet point, I kind of feel as if listing things like a loving wife, a caring daughter, friendly neighbor, beloved teacher,

682
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:52,661
It feels sort of unnecessary in a presentation regarding her merits as a name for the school specifically in that it feels as though it's more like a list of positive attributes of Jean as opposed to a list of her contributions in a way.

683
00:46:54,446 --> 00:46:58,409
particularly be a loving wife, a caring daughter, friendly neighbor.

684
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:00,751
I have information.

685
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:06,155
If you read the speaker notes, you'll see full explanations.

686
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:11,299
I have spent, I heard your comments, Maria, and I agree with what you said.

687
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:19,325
The substance now, if you read the speaker's notes, talks about a loving wife, an unbelievably friendly neighbor.

688
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:21,007
I don't think those words are

689
00:47:21,827 --> 00:47:24,968
used enough in society, and I'm not changing them unless there's a vote.

690
00:47:25,088 --> 00:47:39,292
So I think those are good, and I think my speaker notes definitely justify everything was said there, from the children going to the neighborhood, from her husband's notes, both at the city council meeting and in our

691
00:47:41,944 --> 00:47:42,905
public information.

692
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:47,369
So there's plenty of evidence there, and I would encourage everybody to read the speaker's notes.

693
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:47,869
Thank you.

694
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:53,474
I'm not saying that she was not a loving wife, a caring daughter, or a friendly neighbor.

695
00:47:53,554 --> 00:48:05,025
I just think that it's not necessary to list those when I feel as though the rest of the bullet points are the evidence that point towards that.

696
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:05,885
It just feels

697
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:12,285
it doesn't feel necessary to be listing that here.

698
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:14,686
I understand your point.

699
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:18,448
I just, we will disagree on this one and agree to disagree on that.

700
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:24,810
If you want to put it up, I'm not, I wouldn't accept that as a friendly amendment, but if you want to put it to a vote, go right ahead.

701
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:30,153
I think it shows her, um, you know, her character, part of her character.

702
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:34,394
So I think, um, I think it's a good thing.

703
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:39,490
I mean, I think the rest of the bullet points do.

704
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,411
Did we lose Kristen?

705
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:43,572
We might've, we can keep talking.

706
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:44,933
You did for a minute.

707
00:48:44,953 --> 00:48:45,713
I think I'm back.

708
00:48:47,273 --> 00:48:48,454
Like a horror movie here.

709
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,336
Yeah.

710
00:48:54,376 --> 00:49:02,138
So I think that translates with everything that Ron said, because a number of people who worked with her, such as myself, I know, I'm sorry.

711
00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:07,459
But I think that's the first thing you would say about her, that she's a warm person.

712
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:10,660
So I don't know if that would be better, all encompassing.

713
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,060
I don't know.

714
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,421
Just very easy to talk to, very approachable.

715
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:14,461
A

716
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:21,740
The helper, you know, look for the helpers you'd look for gene.

717
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,603
If I may, if I may, this is.

718
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:26,345
Oh, sorry.

719
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:32,932
Just full disclosure guys I am having contractions.

720
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:35,835
Oh, I am trying to get through this meeting.

721
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:36,816
Oh my god.

722
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:48,756
Kind of speaking chair to Maria would these would those words that I agree.

723
00:49:48,776 --> 00:49:54,904
Oh, I heard through from a lot of different people who wrote in about gene Barry.

724
00:49:57,592 --> 00:50:19,197
If we were to add words about maybe Belinda Sutton, about like strength and perseverance and toss in a few more adjectives that speak to her character, would it feel better about leaving adjectives that mean a lot to people about Jean Barry Sutherland?

725
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:24,739
Point of information, how would we get those characteristics from,

726
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:45,778
Belinda Sutton when we don't have any personal... Well, I think the argument that she wrote her own terms of her own freedom, freed herself, fought for her rights after the things that we do know about her implies a certain level of strength and perseverance.

727
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:51,221
She did it all through the system, which was... I don't think we wanna make any assumptions about her.

728
00:50:51,401 --> 00:50:54,763
I mean, it's kind of alarming to me that we don't even have any documentation

729
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,790
that email that Beth sent us.

730
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,291
So I'm already hesitant about what we're including.

731
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:02,151
Like we don't even know if this person actually really existed.

732
00:51:02,171 --> 00:51:08,413
Point of information, Belinda Sutton is coming up.

733
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:12,033
We'll have a chance to talk about this at that slide.

734
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,794
Can we move on to the next slide, Mr. Chairman?

735
00:51:15,474 --> 00:51:17,434
Can I just ask who's having contractions?

736
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:18,535
Because I don't know who's talking.

737
00:51:19,135 --> 00:51:19,715
That's Brie.

738
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,335
That's Brie.

739
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:30,381
Point of information, Bree, you understand that the child is much more important than this presentation.

740
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:31,402
Yes, I agree.

741
00:51:33,204 --> 00:51:35,467
I'm sorry, Mr. Lister, can I speak?

742
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:39,833
So I understand Maria's feelings about this kind of emotionally overly wrought

743
00:51:40,393 --> 00:51:52,143
thing of a person I've never met either, but I'm more questioning, maybe Ron can answer this, can you give me an example of her being an innovator for special education?

744
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:57,227
And point of information, first to say emotionally awry, I take offense to.

745
00:51:57,327 --> 00:51:59,849
So let's try to keep it as not comments.

746
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:08,014
Yes, coming in the next slide, you will understand how exceptional she was with dealing with special education.

747
00:52:08,474 --> 00:52:09,575
All that comes in here.

748
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:10,976
She was an advocate.

749
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:14,378
The next slides will explain that, Matt.

750
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:15,839
I appreciate what you're saying.

751
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,444
All this stuff is not, I clarify by saying when I got here, I did not know who Jean Barry Sutherland was.

752
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:28,871
I know she was not the favorite choice here, but what I've done, but what I've done is I've reached out.

753
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:30,353
I've done my research.

754
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:32,015
I've gone back to the organization.

755
00:52:32,055 --> 00:52:35,620
She were part of I reached out to family friends through Facebook.

756
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,724
I'm very confident in the statements I made and

757
00:52:39,944 --> 00:52:43,226
You know, I'm not an emotionally overwrought person.

758
00:52:43,306 --> 00:52:52,752
So these are statistics that will be backed up and you'll understand the special education above all when I prove, when I show you the information that's coming out.

759
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:57,354
Can I address Ron's comments, please?

760
00:52:57,694 --> 00:53:03,978
I apologize for describing these words as emotionally wrought, but they are emotionally more, you know,

761
00:53:04,718 --> 00:53:05,299
Cuddled in that.

762
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,580
Passionate advocate.

763
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,843
Most special education teacher I know are passionate about it all the time.

764
00:53:10,863 --> 00:53:11,303
So I don't know.

765
00:53:11,883 --> 00:53:25,613
And yeah, there should be some real innovation that can be really documented as far as going forward in the Medford public schools, because that's a highly controversial subject, special education.

766
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:40,734
Matt, just don't put, I don't wanna be a spoiler alert here, but the information that got me to that was from the assistant director of special education for the Medford Public Schools at the time that Jean Barry Sutherland was principal.

767
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:47,875
So you'll read more about this, but I'm quite confident when I say she was very passionate.

768
00:53:49,155 --> 00:53:51,036
All right.

769
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:51,496
I'm sorry.

770
00:53:55,165 --> 00:54:01,868
just building on that, Ron, I understand there's passion, but then there's also innovation.

771
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:04,929
So innovation implies something specifically new.

772
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:13,513
And I didn't read through your deck, specifically on, I'm sorry, who else is speaking?

773
00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:15,434
I'm sorry, this is Lisa.

774
00:54:15,474 --> 00:54:18,955
Nobody's going through the chair, so people are just talking and I don't know who's talking.

775
00:54:19,236 --> 00:54:20,076
So it's- This is Seth.

776
00:54:21,437 --> 00:54:23,759
I understand, but it's not just, it wasn't just you, Seth.

777
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:29,024
It's just, I think that Ron, Matt, somebody before Matt, because everyone's jumping in.

778
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:30,566
So please go to the chair.

779
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:31,006
Thank you.

780
00:54:31,026 --> 00:54:32,367
All right, go ahead, Seth.

781
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:33,228
Okay.

782
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:34,349
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

783
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:53,992
My question, through the chair for Ron, builds upon what Matt was saying, specifically in the language that is being used.

784
00:54:54,833 --> 00:55:01,478
And I can understand passion and advocacy, and those would be

785
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:06,026
things that I would recognize and would expect.

786
00:55:07,526 --> 00:55:10,488
Innovation is something specifically different.

787
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:26,235
And in reading through, I see examples of passion and advocacy, but I don't necessarily see specific representation of innovation.

788
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:29,697
And I would love to- It has no impact on the presentation.

789
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:31,878
Let's remove and innovator just to move on.

790
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:50,674
Um, if I may speak, I this is Maria, by the way, I don't, I take issue with the fact that we're listing these different aspects of genes legacy.

791
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:55,899
And Ron, you have repeatedly stated that there's evidence for that.

792
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:57,961
Two points.

793
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,823
First is that

794
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:06,042
The evidence should serve and stand on its own.

795
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:18,146
I don't think that we need to be listing these things because they are things that become clear through the evidence that you provide, which are Jeanne's actions.

796
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,647
You have great things here.

797
00:56:21,627 --> 00:56:26,369
That's undeniable, anti-smoking campaigns, dog park advocate, et cetera, et cetera.

798
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:41,713
However, I think that that is more demonstrative of Jean being a friendly neighbor and beloved teacher than having to list that out, in my opinion.

799
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:52,203
Second, I would also say that in order to make these sort of

800
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:04,578
not necessarily generalizations, but very concrete, concrete assumptions.

801
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:20,332
That's not necessarily the word I'm trying to use, but about Jean's character based strictly on anecdotal evidence seems problematic to me.

802
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:25,505
I appreciate your opinion, but I couldn't disagree with you more.

803
00:57:25,565 --> 00:57:33,816
This is what separates Jean Barry Sutherland as a citizen of Medford and a very strong role model.

804
00:57:34,352 --> 00:57:39,533
and also her impact on the history of the city has yet to be decided.

805
00:57:40,013 --> 00:57:42,314
And I understand what you're saying.

806
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:43,874
It's been clear in all your comments.

807
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:45,295
I understand your point.

808
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:50,416
I am not gonna neutralize Jean Barry Sutherland to make her equal to the other two candidates.

809
00:57:50,796 --> 00:57:52,396
This is part of who she is.

810
00:57:52,816 --> 00:57:54,797
Can I make a suggestion to the chair that might?

811
00:57:56,397 --> 00:58:03,283
make more people feel better about this statement is because she was a wife, she was a daughter, she was a neighbor, she was a teacher.

812
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:07,306
Those are characteristics that do make her valuable for a person to consider.

813
00:58:07,386 --> 00:58:18,495
So would it sound better or would people feel better or more comfortable, I should say, if we said Jean was a well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader, full stop.

814
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,817
She was a passionate advocate and

815
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:28,094
I thought if we just said we were gonna take out innovator for the needs of all the Medford children and their families.

816
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:31,796
So you're still stating what her characteristics are.

817
00:58:32,156 --> 00:58:42,421
We're saying she was well-loved based on all the reading we did about her, because it comes clear when you read the comments that community members have written about Jean repeatedly, many of them.

818
00:58:43,201 --> 00:58:44,622
That would just be my suggestion.

819
00:58:45,782 --> 00:58:46,383
I like that.

820
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:52,924
All right, Lee, did you want to speak?

821
00:58:53,645 --> 00:58:56,307
Yeah, I like Kathy's suggestion as well.

822
00:58:56,447 --> 00:59:02,152
And I just really wanted to remind this group that we're presenting all three of these names.

823
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:07,216
We're championing all three of these names for the school committee to make a decision about.

824
00:59:07,636 --> 00:59:12,460
So we want to sell all of these, I believe, as being the output of our work.

825
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:17,367
And so just looking at the time, we do need to move through this.

826
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,429
We haven't agreed on the changes that I'm seeing being made here.

827
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:22,071
Sorry, I got excited.

828
00:59:22,571 --> 00:59:23,111
I need a vote.

829
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:24,092
Let's just have a vote.

830
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:27,115
We're not going to change, sorry, Ron, without a vote.

831
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:30,578
So if we need to vote, we should just vote and move on.

832
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:33,660
Or otherwise, just, I think, move on.

833
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:36,903
I don't want to curtail discussion, but I want to share.

834
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:38,645
I'm ready for a vote.

835
00:59:39,085 --> 00:59:39,906
I'm ready for the vote.

836
00:59:39,946 --> 00:59:41,347
I'm not removing it without a vote.

837
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:43,500
All right, I got a few more hands up.

838
00:59:44,921 --> 00:59:45,462
Patrick.

839
00:59:48,304 --> 00:59:50,206
Yeah, I passed.

840
00:59:50,266 --> 00:59:51,747
I was going to say the same thing as Lee.

841
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:56,031
I mean, our job here is not to advocate for one person over another.

842
00:59:56,091 --> 01:00:03,297
We need to make sure all three candidates that we put forward have an appropriate response.

843
01:00:03,777 --> 01:00:04,298
Correct.

844
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:07,300
OK, thank you.

845
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:10,463
Laura, did you have your hand up?

846
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:12,537
All right, that was all.

847
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:14,118
Okay, sorry.

848
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,700
Am I missing anybody else?

849
01:00:23,484 --> 01:00:28,287
Okay, so Ron, you want us to vote on it the way it is?

850
01:00:28,347 --> 01:00:29,467
No, just take it off.

851
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:40,394
I just wanted to be known in public that I am not happy with this change, but in the interest of time and not having anything about Jean Barry Sutherland, I agree to take all those emotional adjectives off.

852
01:00:40,868 --> 01:00:41,708
I want to take that off.

853
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:42,769
I would put it to a vote.

854
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:44,810
Yeah, put it to a vote, Ron.

855
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,891
Put it to a vote.

856
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:47,672
I would leave it the way it is, Ron.

857
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:49,132
You work really hard on this.

858
01:00:49,192 --> 01:00:50,393
I'm sorry, my name is Paul.

859
01:00:51,133 --> 01:00:54,955
Hi, this is Ron.

860
01:00:55,496 --> 01:00:55,796
Jim?

861
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:56,676
Yes.

862
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:58,797
Hi, this is Melissa through the chair.

863
01:01:00,819 --> 01:01:09,203
So as a parent who entrusts her two children to the Medford public school system every day, I think that these attributes are key.

864
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:13,130
to explaining or that you'd wanna see in a teacher.

865
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:21,473
I'd have to say this, in all the years that my children have gone through the Medford school systems, they have not all been loving and caring and advocates for the children.

866
01:01:21,973 --> 01:01:34,937
So I think if we're looking to name a school after an educator and such a champion for the children and families of Medford, it's extremely important that this person does hold those qualities and we make sure that we highlight those qualities.

867
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:48,114
So there's a former principal of the Columbus School who could tell you that I have had many meetings with her about a teacher who was none of these qualities and who had no business being in the Medford school system.

868
01:01:49,235 --> 01:02:02,863
So I think if you're speaking about an educator, it's absolutely important that to me, when my children are going to this place five, six, seven hours a day, and I'm entrusting them for the care of my child every day, that they should have these qualities.

869
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:06,130
So I think it's key that these are on here.

870
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,590
And I want to back Ron and his work on this slide.

871
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:09,511
Very good.

872
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:10,091
Thank you.

873
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:11,351
Let's just move the vote, please.

874
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:12,152
All right.

875
01:02:12,172 --> 01:02:13,332
What are we voting on?

876
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:17,794
Is this to remove the bullet point or to move the adjectives?

877
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:23,335
Are we voting to accept Kathy's suggestion or are we moving to remove the bullet point or to remove the adjectives?

878
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:36,830
Removing the adjectives.

879
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:38,332
Point of order.

880
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:39,813
The motion is by Kathy.

881
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:45,018
Can we have Kathy say what her motion is, the amendment to this slide?

882
01:02:46,299 --> 01:02:46,799
Kathy.

883
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:47,920
Yes, sure I can.

884
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:56,848
My suggestion was that we write, Jean was a well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader.

885
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:05,696
and then you put a period, she was a passionate advocate for special education and the needs of all Medford children and their families.

886
01:03:06,297 --> 01:03:14,602
So we're still saying she was well-loved, but rather than those other adjectives, we're still leaving her characteristics of being a wife, a daughter, a neighbor, a teacher.

887
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,225
This is Paul, I second Kathy's comments.

888
01:03:20,907 --> 01:03:22,147
Do I need to go a roll call?

889
01:03:22,187 --> 01:03:23,468
Is there anyone that objects to this?

890
01:03:23,488 --> 01:03:25,710
I believe Ron does.

891
01:03:26,889 --> 01:03:29,311
I think they both say nice things about her.

892
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:37,298
No, listen, if it says well-loved, that encompasses well-loved daughter, well-loved neighbor, that's fine with me.

893
01:03:37,978 --> 01:03:41,161
Okay, can we make those changes and we can okay this slide?

894
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:52,450
Is there still a motion to accept or remove that last bullet?

895
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:53,131
I'm just confused.

896
01:03:54,517 --> 01:03:55,798
No, there wasn't a motion for that.

897
01:03:55,858 --> 01:03:59,999
There was a motion to accept the whole slide as it was.

898
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:06,042
Thank you, Ron, for allowing us to change the slide.

899
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:08,423
Yes, thank you, Ron, for your flexibility.

900
01:04:08,483 --> 01:04:09,884
I really appreciate it.

901
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:12,645
There's so much more you guys are going to love too.

902
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,165
Let's just move on to the next slide.

903
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,366
Sorry, Kathy, can you say the end again?

904
01:04:16,406 --> 01:04:17,747
Well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor.

905
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:19,908
Well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher.

906
01:04:24,102 --> 01:04:25,463
end community leader, period.

907
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:38,886
And then I think if you start a new sentence, she was a passionate advocate, because that even makes it stronger, it's got its own sentence, I think.

908
01:04:39,306 --> 01:04:40,827
It's true, it highlights that more.

909
01:04:41,147 --> 01:04:43,727
Education and the needs of all men for children and their families.

910
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:45,368
That might even be another bullet.

911
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:48,009
Okay, yeah, I can see that.

912
01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:48,989
Anybody else?

913
01:04:50,509 --> 01:04:50,709
Bullet?

914
01:04:58,305 --> 01:04:59,165
This slide looks good.

915
01:05:00,846 --> 01:05:01,646
Ron, are you happy?

916
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:02,467
I would move on.

917
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:03,767
All right.

918
01:05:04,928 --> 01:05:05,328
Thank you.

919
01:05:06,788 --> 01:05:07,549
Thanks again, Ron.

920
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:09,309
Thank you, Ron.

921
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,431
Just a description of the slide before you all start.

922
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:15,392
Actually, I apologize.

923
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:17,593
I had another point.

924
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:27,857
Someone asked if we could make a motion to remove and to make that motion to remove those last two bullet points.

925
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,581
And what would be the point of that?

926
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:31,143
Just point of clarification.

927
01:05:32,484 --> 01:05:33,165
Point of order.

928
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:35,207
He needs a second before we discuss.

929
01:05:35,327 --> 01:05:38,570
Yeah.

930
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,652
Anybody want to second that motion?

931
01:05:40,672 --> 01:05:42,954
I'll second it.

932
01:05:47,443 --> 01:06:00,327
The point is that you already have the evidence that she was well loved and that she was a passionate advocate, particularly in the positive role model slide.

933
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:05,549
I think that that does come through clearly through the quotes that you have.

934
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:14,612
I feel like it would be redundant to have that information here if you're already going to make the case for it and

935
01:06:15,032 --> 01:06:42,229
future slides um anything else anybody else on that okay we'll vote on it you had a first and a second so the motion is to remove the bullet point right yes

936
01:06:42,975 --> 01:06:44,617
We go back and look at the slide please.

937
01:06:45,258 --> 01:06:45,979
yeah.

938
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:48,242
I thought we moved on.

939
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:52,568
emotion was made.

940
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:53,309
The last two.

941
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:09,018
Jean was a well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader, as well as she was a passionate advocate for special education and the needs of all Medford children and their families.

942
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:17,122
Point of information to the chair, if we just spent all that time correcting those, how are we even discussing this right now?

943
01:07:17,502 --> 01:07:19,984
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.

944
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:25,286
A motion was made and seconded, meaning that we will vote for it.

945
01:07:29,469 --> 01:07:30,169
Chair Jim.

946
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:30,889
Yes.

947
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:41,654
So, the next slide that's being referred to that is going to be quotes on the community we had said during reviewing the mistletoe ones that we don't believe anybody's going to read that.

948
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:47,800
So I think it's unfair to infer that they're going to suddenly read them for gene and pull these out.

949
01:07:47,900 --> 01:08:01,103
I think the point of this slide, the way it was for Mr. Tuck, is to highlight the information that's on the next slide that people already said that they're not going to read.

950
01:08:01,563 --> 01:08:02,503
So I was speaking.

951
01:08:02,523 --> 01:08:04,904
So I'll say it again.

952
01:08:05,024 --> 01:08:10,645
So this slide, just as when we talked about for the Mr. Tuck slide, was to kind of summarize

953
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:13,690
what was on the community feedback slide.

954
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:25,157
And it's unfair to summarize it on the Missituck slide, but remove it from Jean, assuming that people are gonna read through it for Jean and pull out these points.

955
01:08:28,519 --> 01:08:31,480
That's not the slide that we're discussing.

956
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,243
She's discussing the bottom two bullet points on the slide before that.

957
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:44,787
Okay, but then we're saying that the next slide after that, it gives this, we'll be able to infer these two bullet points from the next slide.

958
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:57,997
Yes, and if you look through the speaker notes of the next slide, it does make, it does summarize what these quotes say, making very clear exactly what those two bullet points

959
01:08:58,857 --> 01:09:04,839
say, meaning that to have them would be redundant based on the speaker notes of the next slide.

960
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,740
So point of question, people reading on the slide versus what they're listening.

961
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,381
I think when people are going to be able to read it for themselves, I think it's important that this is here.

962
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:22,203
And I think if we're moving stuff from here, we need to go back to miss the talk and remove information that could be inferred and not in the speaker notes.

963
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:23,263
Point of order.

964
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:24,944
Can we move the question?

965
01:09:24,964 --> 01:09:25,864
If you

966
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:31,806
If through the chair, if Melissa takes issue with my motion, then she can vote now.

967
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:34,007
Okay.

968
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:36,148
It was a point of clarification, actually.

969
01:09:36,168 --> 01:09:37,809
So I'm asking for clarification.

970
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:45,652
Are we going to take a vote if these two bullets should stay or leave?

971
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:46,292
Is that where?

972
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:47,293
Yes.

973
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:51,555
Ready?

974
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:53,596
Ready.

975
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:57,871
No.

976
01:10:02,935 --> 01:10:05,677
Mr. Chair, can you clarify a yes and no vote, please?

977
01:10:06,838 --> 01:10:08,820
Yes is remove, a no is stay.

978
01:10:10,221 --> 01:10:10,941
No is a stay.

979
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:12,082
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

980
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:13,964
Dan?

981
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:14,825
No.

982
01:10:16,146 --> 01:10:16,486
Erin?

983
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:17,627
No.

984
01:10:19,168 --> 01:10:19,528
Beth?

985
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:21,250
No.

986
01:10:22,831 --> 01:10:23,191
Grace?

987
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:24,372
No.

988
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:25,873
Ken?

989
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:26,754
No.

990
01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:28,717
Kristen.

991
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:29,658
No.

992
01:10:31,058 --> 01:10:31,499
Laura.

993
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:32,859
Abstain.

994
01:10:32,879 --> 01:10:33,360
Mr. Chair.

995
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:34,540
Okay.

996
01:10:35,281 --> 01:10:35,581
Lee.

997
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:36,781
No.

998
01:10:39,303 --> 01:10:39,603
Lou.

999
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:40,383
No.

1000
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:42,344
Maria Rosha.

1001
01:10:43,725 --> 01:10:44,045
Yes.

1002
01:10:45,526 --> 01:10:46,386
Melissa Miguel.

1003
01:10:47,067 --> 01:10:47,287
No.

1004
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:48,648
Patrick.

1005
01:10:49,408 --> 01:10:49,608
Nope.

1006
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:51,909
Paul Donato.

1007
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:52,670
No.

1008
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:54,831
Ron Jovino.

1009
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:55,851
No.

1010
01:10:56,832 --> 01:10:57,112
Seth.

1011
01:10:58,502 --> 01:10:58,882
of state.

1012
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:01,723
Kathy Kaye?

1013
01:11:02,243 --> 01:11:02,463
No.

1014
01:11:03,743 --> 01:11:04,623
Matt Habistro?

1015
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:05,443
No.

1016
01:11:07,744 --> 01:11:09,104
Janelle Garland McKenzie?

1017
01:11:09,924 --> 01:11:10,144
No.

1018
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:12,545
Josie DeFore?

1019
01:11:13,265 --> 01:11:13,585
Yes.

1020
01:11:15,485 --> 01:11:16,186
Jim Lister, no.

1021
01:11:16,286 --> 01:11:17,946
Okay, let's move to the next slide.

1022
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:18,986
Thank you.

1023
01:11:21,867 --> 01:11:23,987
How much time was wasted on that, Mr. Chair?

1024
01:11:24,607 --> 01:11:24,967
I don't know.

1025
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:27,068
Actually, your question was a waste of time.

1026
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:30,948
Just a description of this, Jim, if I may.

1027
01:11:30,988 --> 01:11:31,648
This is Ron.

1028
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:42,353
Again, the intent is just to show this slide, capture all the stuff, and then the speaker notes are really what I'd like you to all focus on or have focused on yet.

1029
01:11:45,054 --> 01:11:47,154
Can we scroll it down so we can see the speaker notes?

1030
01:11:47,234 --> 01:11:47,695
I don't know.

1031
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:48,275
Maybe I can't.

1032
01:11:49,255 --> 01:11:50,916
I can lift it a little.

1033
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:56,378
Thank you, Kristen.

1034
01:11:56,886 --> 01:11:57,530
Can you see that?

1035
01:11:57,892 --> 01:11:58,738
Yes, thank you.

1036
01:11:58,818 --> 01:11:59,321
Thank you, Christian.

1037
01:12:28,653 --> 01:12:30,134
Mr. Lister, this is Matt Haberstow.

1038
01:12:30,194 --> 01:12:30,994
I think this is great.

1039
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:32,295
It's all quotes.

1040
01:12:32,335 --> 01:12:33,356
I think this is great, too.

1041
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:36,477
We had so many nice things to choose from.

1042
01:12:36,537 --> 01:12:39,499
Great.

1043
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:51,185
I'd like to make the point that in the Missituck slide, including the quotes, the quotes are not summarized as they are here.

1044
01:12:52,005 --> 01:12:52,586
And so

1045
01:12:54,506 --> 01:13:04,416
I believe that either we should include that summary in the MISUTUG slide or remove the summary in this slide.

1046
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:09,579
We can go ahead and sorry, it's grace caldera here.

1047
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:19,921
Um, I wrote like some of the initial script stuff, so we can go ahead and include that summary in both mistook as well as Belinda.

1048
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:24,522
Um, so that it equals what Ron has, um, written here.

1049
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:25,783
That's totally fine.

1050
01:13:26,523 --> 01:13:26,823
Okay.

1051
01:13:27,423 --> 01:13:27,763
Thank you.

1052
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,904
All right.

1053
01:13:29,944 --> 01:13:30,964
We all sit with this slide.

1054
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:34,025
Can we go to the next?

1055
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:35,105
Yes.

1056
01:13:55,038 --> 01:14:06,103
I had a comment on that piece stating educator advocate for special education represented Medford internationally.

1057
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:16,168
In terms of formatting, Ron, would you be okay if we made that into a bullet point instead of having it as a subtitle?

1058
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:20,989
That was the one piece I did not put there.

1059
01:14:21,049 --> 01:14:24,771
That was Grace's, so I just left it there, that's fine.

1060
01:14:30,394 --> 01:14:35,777
Ron, can you expand on, I don't know, I'm just having a hard time with this innovator thing.

1061
01:14:36,217 --> 01:14:37,178
Yeah, we can eliminate it.

1062
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:40,079
We eliminated it two slides ago, so I'm okay with it.

1063
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,622
It doesn't make or break Gene Barry Sutherland, so you can take innovator off.

1064
01:14:45,182 --> 01:14:47,704
Okay, and Ron, I'm sorry, Mr. Lister's Matt Haberstroh.

1065
01:14:48,629 --> 01:14:49,133
Thank you, Lisa.

1066
01:14:51,971 --> 01:15:01,417
But I don't, so was Jean Barry Sutherland a special education educator or was she just an advocate for special education, which is state law.

1067
01:15:01,557 --> 01:15:04,478
You have to have special education in elementary schools.

1068
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:06,199
That's a good question, Matt.

1069
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:13,544
And Jean Barry Sutherland was principal and part of her role was to handle special ed.

1070
01:15:13,784 --> 01:15:16,806
And Dr. Kay can relate to this, I'm sure.

1071
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:18,527
But what was unique about her

1072
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:31,356
is the ability to really delve into their IEPs, make sure that they were there at all the meetings, individual meetings, as she also met with the consultants from the school.

1073
01:15:31,796 --> 01:15:39,181
And she also invited special education students from around Medford to her school to share the programs.

1074
01:15:39,221 --> 01:15:45,046
And I will say this, if you all remember the brown envelope that arrived at my mailbox,

1075
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:48,998
The mystery envelope.

1076
01:15:49,018 --> 01:15:53,467
Yeah, so this is the stuff that I got in the envelope.

1077
01:15:54,153 --> 01:15:58,635
And one is this letter from- Out of order, Mr. Chair, that is out of order.

1078
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:00,656
None of us have seen what is inside that envelope.

1079
01:16:00,976 --> 01:16:03,757
I'm sorry, through the chair to Ron, none of us have seen that.

1080
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:07,059
Laura, I understand what you're saying.

1081
01:16:07,419 --> 01:16:10,300
Research is all-encompassing.

1082
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,202
When I did research, I'm just telling you, here's what's here.

1083
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:18,584
The proof is here, signed off by the assistant director of special education.

1084
01:16:19,124 --> 01:16:21,565
So I didn't hide this stuff.

1085
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:23,406
This is factual stuff.

1086
01:16:23,971 --> 01:16:26,433
Okay, I'm curious, Mr. Chair.

1087
01:16:26,473 --> 01:16:32,118
Barry Sutherland did start off her career as a special education teacher.

1088
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:36,381
And I believe Kathy Kay can attest to that if I'm not correct.

1089
01:16:37,362 --> 01:16:38,823
Actually, I cannot.

1090
01:16:38,923 --> 01:16:40,725
Jean was two principals before me.

1091
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,448
She was a lovely woman, and I did get to meet her, but I don't know what her past was.

1092
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:45,108
Sorry.

1093
01:16:45,229 --> 01:16:52,074
Mr. Lister, just a point of information, or maybe I can ask Ron too, but special education is state law.

1094
01:16:53,592 --> 01:16:56,054
you don't necessarily advocate it, you're told to do it.

1095
01:16:56,875 --> 01:17:00,198
And I'm sorry, Matt, I do have to disagree.

1096
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:03,782
You do need to advocate many, many times for special education children.

1097
01:17:04,503 --> 01:17:04,783
Okay.

1098
01:17:05,463 --> 01:17:06,404
As a principal, definitely.

1099
01:17:06,424 --> 01:17:10,548
I could just jump in when Jean first started.

1100
01:17:10,568 --> 01:17:17,015
Now, maybe Kathy, you do know this, but I'm not sure special education was a separate

1101
01:17:18,869 --> 01:17:25,393
a major study at that time when she began, because I think she started teaching in the late 60s, early 70s.

1102
01:17:25,493 --> 01:17:31,917
So I'm not sure if that was a special, I don't know if major is the right word.

1103
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:33,397
Kathy, you could help me there.

1104
01:17:33,437 --> 01:17:33,858
I don't know.

1105
01:17:35,339 --> 01:17:39,141
I don't want to quote years when IDA and all that sort of stuff came in.

1106
01:17:39,181 --> 01:17:40,642
Actually, Janelle, you might know better than me.

1107
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:48,046
But I would have to say, in all the roles she played at some point, special education would have played an important part, especially as a principal.

1108
01:17:51,906 --> 01:17:54,147
Okay, I see a couple of raised hands.

1109
01:17:58,548 --> 01:17:59,569
Lee, did you wanna speak?

1110
01:18:00,549 --> 01:18:08,291
Yeah, I was just gonna comment on this on the last bullet point, which I like, but I wanted to just note the language about a true role model.

1111
01:18:08,611 --> 01:18:11,232
The previous slide was the role model slide.

1112
01:18:11,773 --> 01:18:15,934
And we did talk about her role as a role model on that slide.

1113
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:19,195
So I'm not sure that it's necessary on this one.

1114
01:18:21,007 --> 01:18:23,508
about provide for the children an excellent example?

1115
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:26,108
Provide an example?

1116
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:27,309
This is Ron.

1117
01:18:28,009 --> 01:18:28,969
I hear you, Lee.

1118
01:18:29,029 --> 01:18:32,550
I mean, when I wrote this, this was kind of like the summary page for the presentation.

1119
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:44,374
So, and we've already changed it from a historical hero to a role model, but whatever word you want to use, these words are not significant to the essence of what it is, but that's where it came from.

1120
01:18:44,774 --> 01:18:47,454
It was like a summary page, but I appreciate what you're saying.

1121
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:59,931
I think it has more impact if we, this is just my opinion, it's Kristen's policy, if we are using different language a little bit on each slide, just so it doesn't sound repetitive.

1122
01:18:59,972 --> 01:19:07,901
So if we said role model, the last one, maybe say example, or obviously I need a thesaurus because that's who I think of.

1123
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,201
Point of information, if I may, Mr. Lister, it's Kathy Kay.

1124
01:19:13,362 --> 01:19:21,745
So what came through from the children's comments was that she definitely had a connection to the school that we're in right now.

1125
01:19:21,946 --> 01:19:24,727
She had a direct connection more than the other two names.

1126
01:19:25,147 --> 01:19:31,950
And I don't know if that's, I can't recall if I saw that on any of the other slides, but I think it is something that's important just to make sure we include.

1127
01:19:33,715 --> 01:19:43,460
Just a point of information, I think it's the original slide that Grace wrote talking about the fact that she was the first principal and really shaped the culture of the school.

1128
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,941
I think that was Grace's words.

1129
01:19:48,722 --> 01:19:54,225
I think, yeah, just as long as it's there, I think it's important because the kids noted that, which I thought was pretty impressive.

1130
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,266
Kathy, can I ask, did they have fun in the vote?

1131
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:03,095
You know, I don't know because we're doing a lot of remote stuff and they did it in their classroom.

1132
01:20:03,115 --> 01:20:07,196
So I got many of them back and I can tell you what the results are later if you'd like to hear.

1133
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:08,357
Go ahead.

1134
01:20:08,377 --> 01:20:08,797
I'd love to.

1135
01:20:08,857 --> 01:20:10,418
I did it in my classroom.

1136
01:20:10,658 --> 01:20:11,558
I'm a special ed teacher.

1137
01:20:12,879 --> 01:20:14,940
They did have fun reading the information.

1138
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,140
Oh, that's nice.

1139
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:16,980
I like that.

1140
01:20:17,681 --> 01:20:18,021
All right.

1141
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:18,401
Sorry.

1142
01:20:19,121 --> 01:20:21,562
I'm sorry, Mr. Lister.

1143
01:20:21,742 --> 01:20:25,804
So is the line an educator, innovator, repetitive, or just

1144
01:20:28,049 --> 01:20:28,970
I feel like we could take that out.

1145
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,073
Cause now educator is the first bullet point.

1146
01:20:33,014 --> 01:20:36,217
And then we have advocate for special education, which I do like keeping.

1147
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:38,058
Oh, we have that in that one too.

1148
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,780
Oh, I'm okay with that.

1149
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:47,867
A couple of raised hands here before we go Maria Rosha.

1150
01:20:48,788 --> 01:20:49,088
Yeah.

1151
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:51,150
I have several comments.

1152
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:52,412
I would say that,

1153
01:20:53,405 --> 01:21:08,392
The majority of these bullet points are information that was already stated, particularly, which was already commented on, educator and innovator, advocate for special education, which is in slide 14.

1154
01:21:09,633 --> 01:21:18,517
I would also say that that first slide, with the exception of represented Medford internationally, can we remove that because it is repetitive?

1155
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:28,262
Point of information again, I use this slide as a summary under the Medford proud history.

1156
01:21:30,483 --> 01:21:32,504
You know, the other ones were under role model.

1157
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:42,987
You know, so I think it's, you know, it's repetitive maybe, but it's the essence of, you know, this is an example of how she impacted Medford's history, so.

1158
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:43,687
Also,

1159
01:21:49,762 --> 01:22:09,467
Well, to your point, can we still remove educator advocate for special education, and had an amazing impact on Medford community and future generations because that's stated on later slides and our later bullet points and this is a bullet point now.

1160
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,805
I hear what you're saying that bullet point is the key summary statement.

1161
01:22:14,845 --> 01:22:22,315
So as far as her history and how she impacted the proud history, I don't believe the word redundant is correctly used.

1162
01:22:24,464 --> 01:22:33,415
But it literally says educator then and educator and innovator, two bullet points later.

1163
01:22:34,156 --> 01:22:35,778
Advocate for special education.

1164
01:22:35,798 --> 01:22:37,760
Point of information, we're removing that.

1165
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:41,204
Those things are being removed because of the first slide.

1166
01:22:41,405 --> 01:22:43,207
You were talking about a previous slide, I believe.

1167
01:22:43,849 --> 01:22:45,650
No, I was talking about this slide.

1168
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:51,073
Yeah, no, I thought we already proved getting rid of educator and innovator on slide three.

1169
01:22:51,473 --> 01:22:52,153
Thank you, Kristin.

1170
01:22:52,293 --> 01:22:56,275
Let's get rid of them if we're going to get rid of them.

1171
01:22:56,295 --> 01:23:01,838
I'd also say helped make a major difference in Medford.

1172
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:12,623
I think it would be more appropriate to say in Medford public schools, since the majority of the things that were mentioned was specific to the schools.

1173
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:14,551
point of information.

1174
01:23:14,851 --> 01:23:16,272
We have substance abuse.

1175
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,714
We have the summer food program.

1176
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:22,698
We have how she closed down a convenience store.

1177
01:23:23,418 --> 01:23:25,060
Those are citywide issues.

1178
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,161
Not be okay.

1179
01:23:26,181 --> 01:23:27,442
Japan, which is worldwide.

1180
01:23:28,062 --> 01:23:28,983
Point of information.

1181
01:23:29,003 --> 01:23:31,665
She was one of the founders of the jingle bell run to wasn't she?

1182
01:23:31,945 --> 01:23:32,165
Yes.

1183
01:23:32,706 --> 01:23:33,226
Take it easy.

1184
01:23:33,306 --> 01:23:34,748
Yeah, I think we can leave that in.

1185
01:23:35,048 --> 01:23:35,548
Anything else?

1186
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:38,110
All right.

1187
01:23:38,791 --> 01:23:40,232
Uh, Seth, did you have your hand up?

1188
01:23:41,453 --> 01:23:42,254
I did, Mr. Sherry.

1189
01:23:42,274 --> 01:23:42,534
Thank you.

1190
01:23:47,605 --> 01:24:15,053
what Ron was saying and sort of one of the lenses that we can look at in order to advocate for Jean Barry Sutherland is not just a woman that did a job well, but what about this woman was something that wasn't just her doing her job, but actually doing

1191
01:24:16,892 --> 01:24:44,438
more than what her job was, which one would hope as an employee of Medford public school system that all of our educators and administrators are doing their best and being held accountable by the community.

1192
01:24:44,518 --> 01:24:45,298
The reason that she's

1193
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:59,439
you know, one of the three names that we're putting forward and on this slide are not just because of her job, but specifically because of who she was.

1194
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,680
Okay, thank you.

1195
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,181
Oh, one point of clarification.

1196
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:13,643
Are we removing and had an amazing impact on the Medford community and future generations from that first slide?

1197
01:25:15,745 --> 01:25:18,147
since that's encompassed by the last one?

1198
01:25:21,069 --> 01:25:21,869
I don't believe so.

1199
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:23,470
I think it's fine.

1200
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:24,791
All right.

1201
01:25:25,431 --> 01:25:26,272
We're good with this.

1202
01:25:26,632 --> 01:25:27,373
Go to the next one.

1203
01:25:27,953 --> 01:25:31,095
The impact should be lowercase, just FYI.

1204
01:25:31,135 --> 01:25:34,257
Yeah, it's because we moved it down from being a title.

1205
01:25:35,058 --> 01:25:37,039
Can we make it a separate bullet point?

1206
01:25:37,819 --> 01:25:39,841
It just feels odd to have it there.

1207
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:44,584
I remind you, we're trying to finish this tonight.

1208
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:50,778
533.

1209
01:25:46,816 --> 01:25:50,778
Yeah, you know, so.

1210
01:25:51,358 --> 01:25:52,098
This is Brady.

1211
01:25:52,278 --> 01:25:54,679
I just, I had one comment if I, if I may.

1212
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:55,799
Please go ahead.

1213
01:25:55,959 --> 01:25:56,559
How you feeling?

1214
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,620
I'm all right.

1215
01:26:01,561 --> 01:26:10,064
Um, the last bullet point still feels like when Ron was summarizing everything, is there a way to, um, make it more.

1216
01:26:11,893 --> 01:26:13,014
the Medford history.

1217
01:26:13,854 --> 01:26:27,243
And I also, I don't want to get into the weeds on this, but the use of true role model in that last bullet, again, I want to go back to what Lee was saying, and that we're trying to, we're supporting all three of these names.

1218
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:37,549
Out of information, Brie, I don't know if you were attending to your child, but we're leaving that up to Kristen just to change that name.

1219
01:26:37,589 --> 01:26:39,771
We agree that true role model needs to be changed.

1220
01:26:40,693 --> 01:26:41,713
Oh, OK.

1221
01:26:44,814 --> 01:26:49,075
I would say example or a- I trust you.

1222
01:26:50,555 --> 01:26:51,716
Someone good for children.

1223
01:26:51,736 --> 01:26:55,617
Next slide, maybe.

1224
01:26:55,637 --> 01:26:56,917
OK.

1225
01:26:56,957 --> 01:26:58,637
Are we ready?

1226
01:27:02,178 --> 01:27:06,399
An example of someone who not only helped make a difference.

1227
01:27:10,441 --> 01:27:11,101
I like that, yeah.

1228
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:12,402
Yeah, very good.

1229
01:27:12,422 --> 01:27:13,323
We can still comment.

1230
01:27:13,843 --> 01:27:17,685
Bri, do you have anything you want to say just in case the lead?

1231
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:20,847
Oh, I'm still still here.

1232
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:21,548
I'm good.

1233
01:27:22,068 --> 01:27:22,328
Okay.

1234
01:27:23,429 --> 01:27:26,471
Okay, so I think we did a lot of this Belinda Sutton last time.

1235
01:27:27,151 --> 01:27:29,212
And I think we came to some really good agreements.

1236
01:27:31,734 --> 01:27:35,196
Except I think we were still talking about this picture from the museum, maybe.

1237
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:36,677
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1238
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,599
Yeah, that was correct.

1239
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:44,822
I think what we learned is that there is no picture based on the conversation I was watching.

1240
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:46,183
Yeah, no portraits.

1241
01:27:46,463 --> 01:27:46,783
No.

1242
01:27:48,904 --> 01:27:49,744
This is Matt Haberstow.

1243
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:54,306
Yes, I wrongly identified a picture that was on the front page of the transcript that Ms.

1244
01:27:54,366 --> 01:27:55,527
Fuller corrected me on.

1245
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:56,167
Thank you very much.

1246
01:27:57,568 --> 01:28:00,449
So I think this is a fine picture for what we have.

1247
01:28:00,829 --> 01:28:02,450
I like the slide.

1248
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:05,711
Yeah, I think we all liked this last time, right?

1249
01:28:06,252 --> 01:28:06,352
Yep.

1250
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:10,151
Yes, agreed, move on, Mr. Chair.

1251
01:28:10,872 --> 01:28:12,493
I'd like to say something on that slide.

1252
01:28:12,513 --> 01:28:14,455
If I may, Mr. Chair.

1253
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:31,410
Just in response to a statement made earlier by a member of the committee questioning whether Belinda Sutton even existed, I would like to suggest that we add that the petition that Belinda Sutton wrote was made with the Massachusetts legislature.

1254
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:32,851
It is on file.

1255
01:28:33,371 --> 01:28:35,313
with the Massachusetts State Archives.

1256
01:28:35,734 --> 01:28:38,076
You could see it for yourself if you'd like to go see it.

1257
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:43,361
You can read about it in many of the sources that were given to us by the community members.

1258
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:50,588
So I'd like to maybe add a bullet point to that and just to say for the record that I found that statement to be incredibly offensive.

1259
01:28:54,212 --> 01:28:59,056
Just to add to that, Laura, I would, I think we have a picture of the petition.

1260
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:03,100
So that might not be a bad thing to put up there in that slide.

1261
01:29:05,682 --> 01:29:06,723
That might be history.

1262
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:10,026
I don't know if it's on this overview slide and maybe somewhere else down.

1263
01:29:10,146 --> 01:29:13,168
I don't think we have it.

1264
01:29:13,288 --> 01:29:15,110
It's on slide 20.

1265
01:29:16,331 --> 01:29:17,272
That's the petition.

1266
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:21,916
Through the chair, Jim, if I may speak, Laura's referring to the comments that I made.

1267
01:29:22,659 --> 01:29:24,740
And I will proudly own that comment.

1268
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:37,787
My comment was not meant to offend anyone, but it's very difficult when you don't have photos, a birth certificate and everything is signed with the X to really know who wrote and signed that.

1269
01:29:38,768 --> 01:29:40,108
And that was my only point.

1270
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:42,850
It could have been anybody.

1271
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,751
It could have been Ronald McDonald who signed it.

1272
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:48,933
We don't know because there's no proof that she even existed.

1273
01:29:48,973 --> 01:29:50,394
It could have been up a made up name,

1274
01:29:52,122 --> 01:29:53,725
extremely offensive.

1275
01:29:54,888 --> 01:29:59,217
There are a lot of people in this country who that would apply to, I think.

1276
01:29:59,906 --> 01:30:01,547
Point of information to the chair.

1277
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:03,948
Go ahead, Grace.

1278
01:30:04,189 --> 01:30:21,118
The comments that were just made about whether or not she existed are highly offensive to many who have ancestors who were enslaved, where there is no documentation of their existence because they were bought and sold like cattle.

1279
01:30:22,019 --> 01:30:28,403
And they were not granted an education as to which they could be able to sign their name.

1280
01:30:28,983 --> 01:30:46,974
So pointing that out highlights the fact that they were merely property, and also points out the fact that what Belinda was able to accomplish, and the fact that we do have documents, not only in the state legislature, but also

1281
01:30:48,414 --> 01:30:56,076
We have record of baptism of her children are highly remarkable and very unique.

1282
01:30:56,576 --> 01:31:07,919
And they are the only documents that we have of the life of what it was like as a enslaved woman in the colonies during this time.

1283
01:31:09,259 --> 01:31:12,220
And so I would just like to point out that.

1284
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,000
Thank you.

1285
01:31:13,421 --> 01:31:13,841
Thank you.

1286
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:15,181
Thank you.

1287
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:17,928
Seth, you have your hand up.

1288
01:31:20,089 --> 01:31:23,130
Yes, I'm actually bringing a formal motion of censure.

1289
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:32,374
Unless Melissa wants to run her words back.

1290
01:31:33,174 --> 01:31:41,758
So I am calling a motion for censure to committee member Melissa McGill for

1291
01:31:42,881 --> 01:31:49,905
the words that she just used comparing Melinda Sutton to Ronald McDonald and others.

1292
01:31:50,885 --> 01:31:52,366
I'm sorry, I'm emotional.

1293
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:55,367
This is- In the event of time, I'll pull it back.

1294
01:31:55,447 --> 01:31:56,768
I'll pull it back, Seth, okay?

1295
01:31:56,788 --> 01:32:00,210
In the event of time so that we don't get- No, not in the event of time.

1296
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:03,251
Not in the event of time.

1297
01:32:03,431 --> 01:32:05,212
Let's not go in this direction, okay?

1298
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:08,194
No, I am seriously going this direction.

1299
01:32:08,214 --> 01:32:10,335
I said that I would pull the comments back.

1300
01:32:10,355 --> 01:32:11,976
I will second that motion.

1301
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:12,596
Thank you.

1302
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:18,528
I said what I said, and now I said I will pull the comments back.

1303
01:32:19,029 --> 01:32:20,810
My concerns still stand.

1304
01:32:21,051 --> 01:32:21,311
Thank you.

1305
01:32:21,391 --> 01:32:24,234
There is a motion on the floor that will be voted on.

1306
01:32:29,459 --> 01:32:30,800
Any more discussion on the motion?

1307
01:32:31,401 --> 01:32:37,347
As a point of clarification, I don't even want to press my unmute button here, however,

1308
01:32:39,082 --> 01:32:44,864
Melissa was offered an opportunity to retract and apologize.

1309
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:46,484
That's how I interpreted it.

1310
01:32:47,205 --> 01:32:50,866
I would just love to see that before we move forward.

1311
01:32:50,906 --> 01:32:52,286
If she doesn't want to, that's fine.

1312
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:53,086
We'll move to the vote.

1313
01:32:54,207 --> 01:32:59,208
I have not heard a retraction or an apology for it.

1314
01:32:59,368 --> 01:32:59,868
I hear you.

1315
01:33:00,249 --> 01:33:01,289
I understand you, Seth.

1316
01:33:01,449 --> 01:33:03,950
I'm just saying, first, we offered her to do that.

1317
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:06,210
You asked me to retract the statement, Seth.

1318
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:07,191
Did you or did you not?

1319
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:08,111
Can you please clarify?

1320
01:33:08,737 --> 01:33:09,518
I said I would like it.

1321
01:33:09,778 --> 01:33:16,442
I heard, I don't, I didn't say that I actually have heard it.

1322
01:33:17,283 --> 01:33:25,428
So I said that I retract the statement about the fifth time I've said it now.

1323
01:33:25,949 --> 01:33:28,310
And which exact statements are you retracting?

1324
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:32,333
My comments about Belinda Sutton not being an existing, a real person.

1325
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:33,754
I take those comments back.

1326
01:33:35,106 --> 01:33:42,069
All right, then I still have a vote of censure against you because you have compared her to Ronald McDonald.

1327
01:33:42,469 --> 01:33:44,450
I didn't compare her to Ronald McDonald.

1328
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:45,611
It's not what I said.

1329
01:33:45,651 --> 01:33:48,412
It could have been that anybody could have written these.

1330
01:33:49,932 --> 01:34:02,578
And it's my concern that we don't have- From a point of- I'm sorry, we have had a person resign from this committee over whether

1331
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:19,684
they actually compared one of our names that we are going to be putting forward, what sort of language was being used.

1332
01:34:19,704 --> 01:34:21,505
Wait, what comparison was made by the committee member?

1333
01:34:21,685 --> 01:34:22,545
Point of clarification.

1334
01:34:22,585 --> 01:34:24,486
What comparison was made by the committee member?

1335
01:34:24,946 --> 01:34:25,946
Through the chair, please.

1336
01:34:26,467 --> 01:34:28,567
Through the chair, point of clarification.

1337
01:34:28,587 --> 01:34:30,228
I will not back down.

1338
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:31,888
I call for the vote.

1339
01:34:31,908 --> 01:34:33,449
I'm asking for a point of clarification.

1340
01:34:34,173 --> 01:34:38,035
Because we're comparing another comment to mine, so I need to know what that comment is.

1341
01:34:39,336 --> 01:34:47,701
So I can't recall what other comparison was made of one other name being brought here by a former committee member.

1342
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:54,244
I'm asking what that comparison is.

1343
01:34:54,785 --> 01:34:56,105
Point of order.

1344
01:34:56,706 --> 01:34:58,927
Those comments were never on the record here.

1345
01:34:58,947 --> 01:35:02,369
The comments that were just brought forward are on the record.

1346
01:35:03,894 --> 01:35:04,074
Okay.

1347
01:35:04,094 --> 01:35:05,695
All right.

1348
01:35:05,715 --> 01:35:07,235
I'll go through a vote.

1349
01:35:07,255 --> 01:35:09,796
All right.

1350
01:35:10,876 --> 01:35:11,737
What are we voting on?

1351
01:35:11,777 --> 01:35:13,177
Cause I retracted my comments.

1352
01:35:13,217 --> 01:35:14,798
So I just need a point of clarification.

1353
01:35:15,758 --> 01:35:17,799
We're voting on the motion to center you.

1354
01:35:18,959 --> 01:35:19,379
Okay.

1355
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:25,302
This is free.

1356
01:35:26,642 --> 01:35:26,922
Yes.

1357
01:35:30,563 --> 01:35:30,984
Dan.

1358
01:35:31,864 --> 01:35:31,984
No.

1359
01:35:33,832 --> 01:35:34,192
Aaron.

1360
01:35:35,453 --> 01:35:35,714
Yes.

1361
01:35:38,216 --> 01:35:38,496
Beth.

1362
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:40,557
Yes.

1363
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:43,099
Grace.

1364
01:35:44,521 --> 01:35:44,841
Yes.

1365
01:35:46,522 --> 01:35:46,882
Ken.

1366
01:35:47,663 --> 01:35:47,963
Yes.

1367
01:35:49,565 --> 01:35:50,105
Kristen.

1368
01:35:52,006 --> 01:35:52,347
Yes.

1369
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:54,568
Laura.

1370
01:35:55,409 --> 01:35:55,689
Yes.

1371
01:35:58,011 --> 01:35:58,371
Lee.

1372
01:36:00,453 --> 01:36:00,753
Yes.

1373
01:36:01,794 --> 01:36:02,094
Lou.

1374
01:36:02,615 --> 01:36:02,755
No.

1375
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,041
Maria.

1376
01:36:07,022 --> 01:36:07,303
Yes.

1377
01:36:10,285 --> 01:36:10,846
Patrick.

1378
01:36:11,346 --> 01:36:11,626
Yes.

1379
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:16,211
Paul.

1380
01:36:16,891 --> 01:36:17,211
No.

1381
01:36:19,293 --> 01:36:19,734
Ron.

1382
01:36:20,394 --> 01:36:20,955
Abstain.

1383
01:36:23,137 --> 01:36:23,457
Seth.

1384
01:36:24,698 --> 01:36:24,918
Yes.

1385
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,701
Kathy Kay.

1386
01:36:28,421 --> 01:36:28,802
Abstain.

1387
01:36:33,433 --> 01:36:33,753
Matt?

1388
01:36:34,593 --> 01:36:34,873
Yes.

1389
01:36:38,774 --> 01:36:39,174
Janelle?

1390
01:36:40,735 --> 01:36:40,955
Yes.

1391
01:36:42,575 --> 01:36:43,176
Josie?

1392
01:36:44,476 --> 01:36:44,776
Yes.

1393
01:36:46,196 --> 01:36:47,757
And Jim, no.

1394
01:36:49,317 --> 01:36:57,379
So we have 14 to 4 to abstain.

1395
01:36:57,439 --> 01:36:58,219
Yeah, 14, 2 to abstain and 4.

1396
01:37:02,785 --> 01:37:05,266
Okay, so we can- Mr. Chairman?

1397
01:37:05,606 --> 01:37:05,867
Yes.

1398
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:13,150
If I may, it's 5.45 and my original motion from 4 p.m.

1399
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:14,551
Yes.

1400
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:15,931
Is now back on the floor.

1401
01:37:18,273 --> 01:37:19,993
Okay, we'll take a vote on that.

1402
01:37:20,614 --> 01:37:24,856
I think we're really close because we did most of these Belinda Sutton's already.

1403
01:37:24,976 --> 01:37:27,757
I think we could really get to that.

1404
01:37:28,398 --> 01:37:28,938
So we're ready.

1405
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:31,219
We're like four slides short, let's go.

1406
01:37:31,732 --> 01:37:33,433
and we've reviewed them already, so.

1407
01:37:34,034 --> 01:37:36,035
Yeah, I- Slide 21, Mr. Chair.

1408
01:37:36,296 --> 01:37:45,523
Yeah, we have a motion on the floor and we had it seconded to accept all the slides up to 20 as they are now.

1409
01:37:46,103 --> 01:37:47,184
So I'll call the vote.

1410
01:37:47,524 --> 01:37:48,785
Just in case, Mr. Chairman.

1411
01:37:50,186 --> 01:37:51,768
I think we've done through 20, right?

1412
01:37:52,228 --> 01:37:52,428
Right.

1413
01:37:52,468 --> 01:37:52,949
Last meeting?

1414
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,811
Right, we did those first last meeting.

1415
01:37:55,931 --> 01:37:59,994
Mr. Lister, would Mr. Donato reconsider his motion?

1416
01:38:00,034 --> 01:38:00,835
Because we're almost done.

1417
01:38:02,403 --> 01:38:02,863
to redraw it.

1418
01:38:02,963 --> 01:38:03,484
Mr. Donovan.

1419
01:38:05,425 --> 01:38:06,725
Seven more minutes, Paul.

1420
01:38:06,765 --> 01:38:07,386
Seven more minutes.

1421
01:38:09,066 --> 01:38:09,507
We can do it.

1422
01:38:11,428 --> 01:38:13,188
I'll give it five more minutes, Mr. Chair.

1423
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:13,909
All right.

1424
01:38:14,509 --> 01:38:14,769
All right.

1425
01:38:14,829 --> 01:38:15,370
Thank you.

1426
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:16,570
Thank you, Paul.

1427
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:20,572
Mr. Hi, this is Kristen.

1428
01:38:20,612 --> 01:38:24,474
I think we all agreed on this slide 17 last time in the most part.

1429
01:38:24,494 --> 01:38:27,616
Okay, move on.

1430
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:28,256
Next one.

1431
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:34,593
We did review this language too, I think in the last meeting.

1432
01:38:35,814 --> 01:38:38,417
Yes, we changed it to European colonization.

1433
01:38:38,617 --> 01:38:39,418
So we did get through this.

1434
01:38:41,055 --> 01:38:43,677
Yes, Mr. Chair, we can move on to the next slide.

1435
01:38:43,697 --> 01:38:45,197
Mr. Chair, I just had a comment.

1436
01:38:45,678 --> 01:38:48,820
I don't know if I missed it.

1437
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:52,702
Just to add that she petitioned to be paid for her labor and won.

1438
01:38:52,762 --> 01:38:57,485
Her example of perseverance and triumph against almost impossible odds is an inspiration to all.

1439
01:38:57,505 --> 01:39:01,927
And that is reflected later on as well in the comments from the community.

1440
01:39:02,548 --> 01:39:06,590
But I thought that at least we should talk about the fact that she petitioned and won.

1441
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:07,991
Don't we say that?

1442
01:39:08,011 --> 01:39:08,351
I'm sorry.

1443
01:39:09,997 --> 01:39:11,257
Don't we say that in slide 20?

1444
01:39:11,297 --> 01:39:12,218
Yes, we do.

1445
01:39:13,158 --> 01:39:14,418
Sorry, could you go back, Kristen?

1446
01:39:14,898 --> 01:39:18,239
Oh, back or forward?

1447
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:19,359
Forward.

1448
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:20,760
Sorry.

1449
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:23,460
I believe it's here.

1450
01:39:28,382 --> 01:39:29,442
Yes.

1451
01:39:29,462 --> 01:39:30,342
Yeah, the 1783 petition.

1452
01:39:30,362 --> 01:39:37,704
So just specifically about being paid for the work, I'm sorry if I'm not seeing it.

1453
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:42,595
It doesn't say what the petition is, right?

1454
01:39:43,996 --> 01:39:44,696
Oh, I see.

1455
01:39:47,478 --> 01:39:51,801
So somewhere, I'd like to say that the petition was to be paid for her labor and that it was successful.

1456
01:39:51,821 --> 01:39:54,563
It seems like it should be on this slide.

1457
01:39:54,643 --> 01:39:55,403
I'm fine either way.

1458
01:39:57,605 --> 01:40:03,108
Her public assertion of her right to be paid for her labor has given her a place in history?

1459
01:40:03,809 --> 01:40:03,889
Yes.

1460
01:40:03,929 --> 01:40:04,969
I would be okay with that.

1461
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:07,411
Yeah, that sounds good.

1462
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:22,001
I think, this is Beth Fuller, I think actually that the petition to the legislature was to be paid the amount that was given to her in the will of Isaac Royal Jr.

1463
01:40:23,962 --> 01:40:27,463
And she was seeking to be paid out that money.

1464
01:40:30,704 --> 01:40:32,745
But wasn't it for her public, for her labor?

1465
01:40:32,765 --> 01:40:36,186
It was slightly different than being paid for her labor.

1466
01:40:36,266 --> 01:40:38,167
She was given money.

1467
01:40:39,684 --> 01:40:43,366
in his will, and she was seeking to have that restored to her.

1468
01:40:44,226 --> 01:40:45,247
I think Beth is right.

1469
01:40:45,607 --> 01:40:47,288
I remember reading that.

1470
01:40:47,568 --> 01:40:48,868
I don't believe that's true.

1471
01:40:48,908 --> 01:40:58,893
In the historical society, I thought that they said they assumed that she was paid the amount that was in the will, but then she went for reparations for her labor.

1472
01:41:01,674 --> 01:41:03,515
No, that's not what I recall.

1473
01:41:04,509 --> 01:41:05,110
This is Lee.

1474
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:15,957
My understanding, Mr. Lister, my understanding is that she, in order to be free, she had to be paid a pension, essentially, a wage to sustain herself.

1475
01:41:16,078 --> 01:41:18,039
And so that's what she was suing for.

1476
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,041
She also sued for an extension of the pension.

1477
01:41:21,101 --> 01:41:24,083
That's really what the key piece was.

1478
01:41:24,504 --> 01:41:31,709
I think the pension was agreed to, but she wasn't, she went to appeal to get extension for what she deserved.

1479
01:41:31,789 --> 01:41:33,190
She had to go back five times.

1480
01:41:35,052 --> 01:41:36,878
So how do we rewrite this sentence?

1481
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:37,942
I have no idea.

1482
01:41:38,223 --> 01:41:38,765
Lee, can you?

1483
01:41:41,547 --> 01:41:46,288
My recommendation is say her public assertion of her right to be paid reparations for her labor.

1484
01:41:46,928 --> 01:41:49,289
It wasn't reparations.

1485
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:49,829
It's 5.50.

1486
01:41:50,129 --> 01:41:51,590
The five minutes are up.

1487
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:52,830
It's time for a vote.

1488
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:54,250
I'm sorry.

1489
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:55,230
Enough is enough.

1490
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:58,371
You guys wanted to play around, and I said this from the beginning.

1491
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:00,632
The game is over.

1492
01:42:01,372 --> 01:42:02,792
Time for a vote.

1493
01:42:03,192 --> 01:42:09,434
Mr. Lister, I'm wondering if Mr. Donato would not characterize what we're doing as playing around.

1494
01:42:10,097 --> 01:42:12,139
It's just a phrase, I'm sure.

1495
01:42:12,179 --> 01:42:14,061
All right.

1496
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:17,223
I would be fine with just going back to her public assertion of her rights.

1497
01:42:17,523 --> 01:42:21,067
The school committee said that we were stalling.

1498
01:42:22,628 --> 01:42:23,649
We're almost there, Paul.

1499
01:42:26,952 --> 01:42:28,393
We all set with this slide, are we?

1500
01:42:29,214 --> 01:42:29,474
No.

1501
01:42:29,774 --> 01:42:30,715
Oh, that's beautiful.

1502
01:42:31,335 --> 01:42:37,581
I make a motion to move to the next slide, Mr. Chair.

1503
01:42:40,461 --> 01:42:42,082
Motion to move to the next slide, Mr. Chair.

1504
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:43,542
We're all set with this slide, right?

1505
01:42:43,562 --> 01:42:43,602
No.

1506
01:42:43,862 --> 01:42:44,722
No, Mr. Chairman.

1507
01:42:44,762 --> 01:42:46,443
This was not the slide we were talking about.

1508
01:42:46,483 --> 01:42:48,824
The motion to move to the next slide, Mr. Chair.

1509
01:42:49,204 --> 01:42:51,385
We were talking about slide 18.

1510
01:42:52,385 --> 01:42:55,406
The word reparation is not even mentioned.

1511
01:42:55,426 --> 01:42:57,687
Listen, we've gone past the time we set.

1512
01:42:58,167 --> 01:42:58,287
Yep.

1513
01:42:58,307 --> 01:43:00,108
And we were going to vote on the slides.

1514
01:43:00,188 --> 01:43:02,588
So let's vote on whether we're going to accept them all now.

1515
01:43:03,449 --> 01:43:03,889
I'm sorry.

1516
01:43:03,909 --> 01:43:08,390
The motion, Mr. Chair, is whether we are going to vote to accept them all, right?

1517
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:09,671
The motion on the table is

1518
01:43:11,423 --> 01:43:18,168
Correct, at this time we were gonna vote- I'll accept the slide 21, yes, that's the original motion at 4.05 PM.

1519
01:43:18,508 --> 01:43:19,429
Can I ask a question?

1520
01:43:19,489 --> 01:43:20,129
This is Kristen.

1521
01:43:20,589 --> 01:43:20,970
Yes.

1522
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:29,536
If we do this vote and we vote for it, but they don't kick us off this channel for another 10 minutes, can we still finish up?

1523
01:43:30,057 --> 01:43:32,258
I can stay here till 11.59.

1524
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:38,343
We can stay here all night if we have to, but we made a commitment

1525
01:43:39,028 --> 01:43:40,569
Point of information to the chair.

1526
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:41,250
Yes.

1527
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:44,493
There's a lot of things going on and we see the finish line.

1528
01:43:45,093 --> 01:43:45,814
I hear you.

1529
01:43:45,914 --> 01:43:51,599
The issue is that in eight minutes, we use no slides but the first eight.

1530
01:43:52,480 --> 01:44:01,728
If we take two more minutes to figure out one word and include reparations in here, I think we all approve, everybody wins, and then we start, then we end this conversation.

1531
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:06,280
Can we end it with the... Further point of order, Mr. Chair.

1532
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,482
Motion to end debate requires two thirds.

1533
01:44:12,123 --> 01:44:15,985
Sure, we can stall some more, according to the school committee.

1534
01:44:17,286 --> 01:44:19,087
We're not stalling, we're working.

1535
01:44:19,147 --> 01:44:20,308
We're trying to get it done, Paul.

1536
01:44:20,348 --> 01:44:21,228
We're trying to get it done.

1537
01:44:22,749 --> 01:44:23,930
That's not the word he used.

1538
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:25,631
Can we go to 20, please?

1539
01:44:26,411 --> 01:44:27,291
That's where we're at, right?

1540
01:44:27,892 --> 01:44:29,953
We also did not look at this

1541
01:44:30,643 --> 01:44:35,046
quote page, but I think we all saw these in the last meeting.

1542
01:44:36,727 --> 01:44:50,236
If I may say in slide 18, I believe that we should include the sentence regarding her example of perseverance and triumph against almost impossible odds as an inspiration to all.

1543
01:44:50,256 --> 01:44:55,720
I feel as though based on the wording of other

1544
01:44:56,906 --> 01:45:03,128
named suggestions, I feel like that would be a fair assessment of her accomplishments to include.

1545
01:45:04,148 --> 01:45:05,168
I like that suggestion.

1546
01:45:05,188 --> 01:45:06,709
I'm sorry, Mr. Lister's Matt Haberster.

1547
01:45:06,769 --> 01:45:08,009
I like that suggestion by Maria.

1548
01:45:08,049 --> 01:45:09,049
I think that's a good idea.

1549
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:21,233
I also think, sorry, this is Kristen Scalise, I think would be a good idea to, I do like the idea of adding an explanation of what she actually petitioned the legislature for to explain it more.

1550
01:45:21,293 --> 01:45:25,554
And we do have room on this slide, whereas we don't have as much room on slide

1551
01:45:26,258 --> 01:45:32,783
All right, listen, I'm not going to stop you here unless, Patrick, are you going to give us a little time here?

1552
01:45:33,643 --> 01:45:34,204
Absolutely.

1553
01:45:34,244 --> 01:45:35,425
I mean, we have the finish line.

1554
01:45:35,465 --> 01:45:40,068
The whole idea of doing this was to push the pace, so we're- All right, you're going to give us time.

1555
01:45:40,128 --> 01:45:42,990
We're not going to cover the time and you're going to tell me it's over.

1556
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:47,673
No, I mean, we should take our lead from the New Hampshire legislature and we can stop the clock.

1557
01:45:47,954 --> 01:45:50,535
It's currently 5.54 and it will stay 5.54 until we're done.

1558
01:45:53,379 --> 01:45:56,041
Okay, just pasting this in this is not permanent.

1559
01:45:56,662 --> 01:45:57,462
Nobody panic.

1560
01:45:58,023 --> 01:46:00,165
This is Paul through the chair, Patrick.

1561
01:46:00,225 --> 01:46:00,645
Thank you.

1562
01:46:01,546 --> 01:46:02,006
Absolutely.

1563
01:46:02,046 --> 01:46:05,729
Paul point of clarification really quick.

1564
01:46:07,771 --> 01:46:12,074
I don't think that's the comment Maria was talking about to go here.

1565
01:46:12,154 --> 01:46:13,875
I think that's more of a historical thing.

1566
01:46:13,895 --> 01:46:21,079
I think Maria was talking about Laura's, the strength and perseverance.

1567
01:46:21,999 --> 01:46:24,441
That is how she could bring the community together.

1568
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:27,243
Well, that's all in there, isn't it?

1569
01:46:28,483 --> 01:46:30,344
But she's saying strike the first sentence.

1570
01:46:31,145 --> 01:46:31,645
Oh, I see.

1571
01:46:31,705 --> 01:46:32,906
For example, yeah, right.

1572
01:46:34,009 --> 01:46:39,431
Whatever that other quote Maria was suggesting Some strength perseverance.

1573
01:46:39,712 --> 01:46:46,855
I don't know that seems more like I'm bringing the community together thing Whereas her specific petition seemed more like her historic.

1574
01:46:47,215 --> 01:46:54,238
It's the second sentence Isn't it Bri right here her example of perseverance and triumph against almost impossible odds is an inspiration to all.

1575
01:46:54,998 --> 01:46:58,220
Oh Maybe I I was asking for clarification from Maria.

1576
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,140
Yes.

1577
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,741
That is what I was referring to.

1578
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:01,541
Okay, okay

1579
01:47:04,552 --> 01:47:09,374
I'll have to figure out later how to make the background not the wrong color.

1580
01:47:11,955 --> 01:47:14,597
So we're saying to remove the first sentence.

1581
01:47:14,937 --> 01:47:15,117
Right.

1582
01:47:15,237 --> 01:47:16,477
So start at her example.

1583
01:47:16,898 --> 01:47:17,038
Correct.

1584
01:47:17,078 --> 01:47:18,358
And put that in the historical.

1585
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:25,461
Cut.

1586
01:47:28,182 --> 01:47:28,823
That's wonderful.

1587
01:47:29,643 --> 01:47:30,984
OK.

1588
01:47:31,184 --> 01:47:32,344
I'll fix the background after.

1589
01:47:32,364 --> 01:47:33,945
That's what she's all about.

1590
01:47:35,031 --> 01:47:35,791
Yeah, I agree.

1591
01:47:37,532 --> 01:47:37,792
Okay.

1592
01:47:38,552 --> 01:47:41,093
All right, we're all set with this slide?

1593
01:47:41,113 --> 01:47:41,913
19 is okay, right?

1594
01:47:41,953 --> 01:47:43,113
We're okay with these long quotes?

1595
01:47:43,453 --> 01:47:46,494
I think long, but if someone wants to read them, they can.

1596
01:47:46,554 --> 01:47:50,015
If they don't read them, they don't, but they're- We went through this.

1597
01:47:50,515 --> 01:47:53,276
Yeah, we went through this last time.

1598
01:47:53,556 --> 01:48:01,118
The slide 20 is where some of us are advocating for the word reparations, which is- I don't, I think it was, oh, I'm sorry, sorry.

1599
01:48:01,518 --> 01:48:01,978
Oh, go ahead.

1600
01:48:02,278 --> 01:48:03,259
I'm sorry, I'm talking on my own.

1601
01:48:05,256 --> 01:48:14,963
I saw that scholars likened her petition to what future reparations were, but they stopped short of calling it reparations.

1602
01:48:15,203 --> 01:48:16,244
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1603
01:48:16,324 --> 01:48:17,705
I have not been to the royal house yet.

1604
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:18,926
Coronavirus stopped me.

1605
01:48:21,348 --> 01:48:23,149
This is Lee.

1606
01:48:23,189 --> 01:48:28,993
We typically refer to it really as a petition for a pension, which is so that she could

1607
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:35,463
pay bills so that she could eat, so that she could raise her children, not necessarily reparations, but sustenance.

1608
01:48:37,904 --> 01:48:51,091
One of the information I just think there was in the writings, there is something that said, likens it to, she possibly could be the first one to have received reparations, but I like Lee's explanation better.

1609
01:48:52,301 --> 01:48:58,105
Yeah, and I do see, I think there is a connection to reparations, personally, but in terms of the petition.

1610
01:48:58,385 --> 01:49:06,290
From the Royal House website, it says, Belinda Sutton's eloquent petition of 1783 is among the earliest narratives by an African American woman.

1611
01:49:07,031 --> 01:49:11,994
It has been seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

1612
01:49:13,195 --> 01:49:16,557
Right, seen by some, so not definitive.

1613
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:19,559
If we quote the whole thing, I wouldn't.

1614
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:21,180
Can we put that?

1615
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:31,847
Well, could you put something after rare document common seen as, however, Patrick just said, seen as the first example of reparation or something of that nature?

1616
01:49:31,867 --> 01:49:33,488
I don't know how that's an opinion.

1617
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:35,149
That's, that's right.

1618
01:49:35,169 --> 01:49:43,896
It is an opinion, but we have a lot of opinions in a lot of these slides, right?

1619
01:49:44,816 --> 01:49:45,156
I don't know.

1620
01:49:45,417 --> 01:49:48,599
It feels like it could go there, but I'm willing to listen to the group.

1621
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:51,601
I'm fine with putting it there.

1622
01:49:55,025 --> 01:50:07,834
I feel strongly that the word reparations, if you want to qualify that by saying some commentators as the first call, but I believe strongly that the word reparation should be there.

1623
01:50:09,215 --> 01:50:15,900
If it is there, I think we do need to have the full quote context.

1624
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:17,321
I'm okay with that quote.

1625
01:50:18,122 --> 01:50:24,246
I mean, seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

1626
01:50:25,302 --> 01:50:29,765
Can you put that in there, Kristen, and see how it looks behind where it documents?

1627
01:50:32,427 --> 01:50:33,808
By some, was it scholars?

1628
01:50:34,508 --> 01:50:40,032
Her petition has been seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

1629
01:50:40,052 --> 01:50:42,514
It's an exact quote from the Royal House.

1630
01:50:44,455 --> 01:50:46,176
Ah, so that's a modern interpretation.

1631
01:50:47,197 --> 01:50:53,461
I think that sounds, the way you have it worded, taking it from the Royal House side is helpful.

1632
01:50:54,094 --> 01:50:59,856
We can also put an official citation, which I can't do now off the top of my head.

1633
01:51:01,096 --> 01:51:02,717
I'll agree to that, Patrick.

1634
01:51:03,297 --> 01:51:07,558
I just think that this is what makes it so rare, exceedingly rare.

1635
01:51:08,058 --> 01:51:08,539
It's true.

1636
01:51:08,779 --> 01:51:11,399
I'm sorry, can someone repeat the end of it again for me?

1637
01:51:11,659 --> 01:51:14,140
Patrick, one more time.

1638
01:51:15,061 --> 01:51:15,461
Sorry.

1639
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:22,863
It has been seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

1640
01:51:25,796 --> 01:51:26,437
Thank you, Patrick.

1641
01:51:27,338 --> 01:51:29,301
And then clarification through the chair.

1642
01:51:29,662 --> 01:51:29,962
Yes.

1643
01:51:31,384 --> 01:51:36,671
One of the lines there says the best known resident of the Royal estate is Belinda Sutton.

1644
01:51:36,972 --> 01:51:38,955
We know much more about her than we do.

1645
01:51:40,825 --> 01:51:42,987
of those experienced slavery.

1646
01:51:43,807 --> 01:51:47,530
I'm just curious, is that factual information?

1647
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:55,995
Point of information, as I wrote most of the slide, that was taken directly from the Royal House website.

1648
01:51:57,616 --> 01:52:00,538
And I even put royalhouse.org.

1649
01:52:00,638 --> 01:52:02,219
Yeah, I see that, I see that.

1650
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:04,140
I was just curious, that's all.

1651
01:52:04,621 --> 01:52:05,962
Yeah.

1652
01:52:05,982 --> 01:52:09,604
Kristen, if we need an extra line, we could get rid of that MA on the...

1653
01:52:10,114 --> 01:52:12,595
like fourth line that's just hanging out there.

1654
01:52:12,695 --> 01:52:14,636
That's a good point, we know which method.

1655
01:52:14,656 --> 01:52:15,716
We know which method, not memory.

1656
01:52:15,756 --> 01:52:16,516
We're not Oregon.

1657
01:52:16,536 --> 01:52:17,637
We're not Oregon.

1658
01:52:18,357 --> 01:52:27,641
Okay, so we can go back and put like a link or a document name there just so people know we're citing and it's not our opinion.

1659
01:52:28,561 --> 01:52:29,641
Is everyone comfortable with that?

1660
01:52:29,761 --> 01:52:33,483
I'm comfortable, we're moving on, right?

1661
01:52:33,823 --> 01:52:36,564
Mr. Donahue is looking at his watch, so I gotta move on.

1662
01:52:37,284 --> 01:52:39,485
He has a much better sense of time than we all do, I think.

1663
01:52:39,707 --> 01:52:42,327
Thank you, Matt.

1664
01:52:42,447 --> 01:52:43,588
This slide is fine.

1665
01:52:43,688 --> 01:52:44,748
I agree with it.

1666
01:52:44,808 --> 01:52:45,368
Yeah, let's go.

1667
01:52:45,728 --> 01:52:47,648
Okay, I like the next one.

1668
01:52:49,409 --> 01:52:51,849
This is where I have issues, Mr. Chair.

1669
01:52:56,390 --> 01:53:01,631
I believe this is not in our scope.

1670
01:53:01,731 --> 01:53:05,251
I believe this is not in our scope.

1671
01:53:05,291 --> 01:53:08,292
The school committee, this can be something that goes to the school committee on its own.

1672
01:53:08,973 --> 01:53:09,213
Yes.

1673
01:53:09,573 --> 01:53:10,554
Point of information.

1674
01:53:10,614 --> 01:53:26,323
I think this was added prior to last meeting when there was that resolution that was put forth with the recommendations, considering we didn't vote on the recommendations, we can just scrap this slide because it- Yeah.

1675
01:53:27,004 --> 01:53:28,264
Thank you very much.

1676
01:53:28,465 --> 01:53:31,987
Yeah, I think we kind of agreed to do that and it never got around to it.

1677
01:53:32,067 --> 01:53:33,487
It's all I asked for at 4.05 PM.

1678
01:53:37,193 --> 01:53:39,275
Does anyone know how to remove a slide?

1679
01:53:39,635 --> 01:53:42,378
Should I just delete the whole thing or should I figure this out later?

1680
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:43,518
Just delete right here?

1681
01:53:43,779 --> 01:53:43,979
Yep.

1682
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,701
Hey, thank you.

1683
01:53:46,741 --> 01:53:48,903
Thank you very much.

1684
01:53:50,064 --> 01:53:50,905
Sorry, this is Brie.

1685
01:53:51,025 --> 01:54:01,114
I have one more quick thing that I just, when we were talking about the quotes, there was something made about adding summaries to Misituk and Bolivda Sutton.

1686
01:54:03,601 --> 01:54:07,284
that were added for like Jean Barry or vice versa?

1687
01:54:08,885 --> 01:54:10,126
I think Grace said that.

1688
01:54:10,146 --> 01:54:11,187
Yes.

1689
01:54:11,207 --> 01:54:19,853
So the script right now doesn't have any summaries in them for Missitook and for Belinda Sutton.

1690
01:54:20,453 --> 01:54:21,774
Oh, OK.

1691
01:54:22,515 --> 01:54:25,016
And I mean, right now, hold on.

1692
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:26,457
Let me pull it up.

1693
01:54:26,938 --> 01:54:30,641
Right now, it just kind of says, these are responses that were taken.

1694
01:54:33,402 --> 01:54:49,251
whoever is either presenting on the slide, or I can go ahead and go in and just pull some of the main points from both of them to make sure that's also incorporated for everybody else.

1695
01:54:49,651 --> 01:54:59,116
Mr. Chair, I would like to make a motion to accept the presentation as is right now, like we tried at 4.05, Mr. Chairman.

1696
01:55:00,997 --> 01:55:01,337
Please.

1697
01:55:01,777 --> 01:55:02,598
Can I get a second?

1698
01:55:03,797 --> 01:55:05,758
I second, Kathy Kaye.

1699
01:55:06,119 --> 01:55:07,019
Thank you, Kathy.

1700
01:55:07,419 --> 01:55:08,220
Any discussion?

1701
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:11,322
All those in favor?

1702
01:55:11,642 --> 01:55:12,583
Patrick has his.

1703
01:55:13,303 --> 01:55:13,763
Aye.

1704
01:55:14,324 --> 01:55:14,844
Patrick?

1705
01:55:15,304 --> 01:55:16,905
No, I didn't lower it.

1706
01:55:19,027 --> 01:55:19,747
Thank you, Patrick.

1707
01:55:20,187 --> 01:55:20,948
Aye is my.

1708
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:24,226
All right.

1709
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:31,389
Mr. Lister, I was just going to say, we're accepting it as is with the caveat that Grace is going to add summaries.

1710
01:55:31,889 --> 01:55:32,170
Yes.

1711
01:55:32,210 --> 01:55:33,810
Script for those two.

1712
01:55:35,131 --> 01:55:35,391
Yes.

1713
01:55:35,711 --> 01:55:40,893
There's also citations like this one right in front of us that we have to add.

1714
01:55:41,694 --> 01:55:49,197
And I might do another run through on just grammar, capitalization, spacing, but no change of content at all.

1715
01:55:49,617 --> 01:55:50,038
Thank you.

1716
01:55:50,178 --> 01:55:51,098
If everyone's OK with that.

1717
01:55:51,853 --> 01:55:59,356
Once it's completed, if you notify everybody, they can go take a look and then make comments.

1718
01:55:59,376 --> 01:56:00,457
I think that's okay.

1719
01:56:00,617 --> 01:56:02,858
I still put a comment, just a great job.

1720
01:56:04,178 --> 01:56:09,000
I think I'm just going to, it's just going to be a great job.

1721
01:56:10,821 --> 01:56:13,682
I'm going to consistency.

1722
01:56:14,442 --> 01:56:14,723
All right.

1723
01:56:14,783 --> 01:56:19,665
Subcommittee of the subcommittee on this presentation.

1724
01:56:20,245 --> 01:56:20,525
I think

1725
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:25,483
I think we were blessed with three really great options.

1726
01:56:25,543 --> 01:56:27,425
So there was really no way to go wrong.

1727
01:56:28,906 --> 01:56:30,467
Okay.

1728
01:56:31,007 --> 01:56:33,329
Motion adjourned.

1729
01:56:33,369 --> 01:56:34,210
No, we have to vote on it.

1730
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:35,791
Oh, okay.

1731
01:56:36,251 --> 01:56:37,993
I'm rushing.

1732
01:56:38,313 --> 01:56:39,073
We voted on this.

1733
01:56:39,153 --> 01:56:40,535
Everyone's in favor of this, right?

1734
01:56:40,555 --> 01:56:41,896
I don't have to take a roll call.

1735
01:56:41,956 --> 01:56:42,716
There was no one opposed.

1736
01:56:42,736 --> 01:56:43,497
We need a roll call.

1737
01:56:44,028 --> 01:56:45,608
No, probably should have a vote.

1738
01:56:45,729 --> 01:56:46,069
I'll vote.

1739
01:56:46,109 --> 01:56:47,029
It's your final vote.

1740
01:56:47,349 --> 01:56:48,609
All right.

1741
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:50,710
Before we vote.

1742
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:53,011
It's not the final vote.

1743
01:56:53,171 --> 01:56:55,651
We have to go back to Ron's thing about picking people.

1744
01:56:57,112 --> 01:57:00,633
And so I want to know if you want to know what the votes were at the Columbus.

1745
01:57:01,433 --> 01:57:01,653
Yes.

1746
01:57:02,033 --> 01:57:02,613
Oh, yeah.

1747
01:57:03,974 --> 01:57:05,634
Can I just intercede one thing?

1748
01:57:05,934 --> 01:57:07,235
I just want everybody to know that

1749
01:57:09,103 --> 01:57:14,187
that the Google Drive will be included to all school committee members as they requested that.

1750
01:57:15,308 --> 01:57:19,291
So they'll receive it Friday for Monday's meeting, just so everyone's aware.

1751
01:57:19,551 --> 01:57:25,875
Not the presentation, but everything else that's in the drive, they have requested to see.

1752
01:57:25,975 --> 01:57:27,997
So I just wanted to be clear about that.

1753
01:57:28,057 --> 01:57:29,958
And I wasn't in the beginning of the meeting, so.

1754
01:57:30,919 --> 01:57:33,981
Lisa, is that in person or is it on Zoom?

1755
01:57:35,182 --> 01:57:37,504
It's in person and it will be on Zoom as well.

1756
01:57:38,339 --> 01:57:39,120
What time, six?

1757
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:42,243
I'm not sure, they were discussing the time.

1758
01:57:42,423 --> 01:57:45,926
People wanted six and people wanted seven, so I'm not sure where they landed.

1759
01:57:45,946 --> 01:57:48,208
All right, so we'll get that information from Susan.

1760
01:57:48,268 --> 01:57:56,136
It has to be posted by Thursday at 4.30, so it'll be on the website as soon as Thursday at 4.30.

1761
01:57:58,918 --> 01:58:04,062
We know before he and Kathy, obviously, you know, I could spread it around, but I know that we're going back and forth about the time.

1762
01:58:04,082 --> 01:58:06,324
I'm not sure if there's executive session first.

1763
01:58:06,404 --> 01:58:09,646
Will Susie let the committee of us, you know, this committee here know?

1764
01:58:10,447 --> 01:58:10,687
Yes.

1765
01:58:11,288 --> 01:58:12,509
Yeah.

1766
01:58:13,349 --> 01:58:13,730
Thank you.

1767
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:15,751
Sorry for the interruption.

1768
01:58:15,791 --> 01:58:19,634
I just wanted to be clear with everybody because that was brought up after the meeting last night.

1769
01:58:20,215 --> 01:58:20,495
Okay.

1770
01:58:20,915 --> 01:58:21,215
Thanks.

1771
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:21,976
Thank you.

1772
01:58:32,711 --> 01:59:00,741
everybody hear me yes okay yes all right back to uh back to the vote of the presentation as is mr chair we we already took that we're all in favor of that we don't need to do a roll call all right okay i think we did i think lisa asked us to do that yes yeah she thought this was going to be the final vote but we can take it she thought another point of information it's not as is as was noted there are

Uh, minor, a few minor things.

01:59:05,334 --> 01:59:08,114
So, um, okay.

1775
01:59:09,294 --> 01:59:10,534
All right, Brie.

1776
01:59:10,895 --> 01:59:11,515
Yes or no.

1777
01:59:11,535 --> 01:59:12,395
You all set with this?

1778
01:59:12,435 --> 01:59:12,695
Yes.

1779
01:59:13,475 --> 01:59:14,395
Well, sorry.

1780
01:59:14,495 --> 01:59:21,936
Is the vote to not as is it's with these few things that we've all like font inserting links, adding summaries.

1781
01:59:22,276 --> 01:59:22,677
Correct.

1782
01:59:22,777 --> 01:59:23,357
That's the vote.

1783
01:59:23,957 --> 01:59:24,177
Yes.

1784
01:59:24,237 --> 01:59:26,057
No content by grace.

1785
01:59:26,577 --> 01:59:26,857
Got it.

1786
01:59:28,097 --> 01:59:28,297
Okay.

1787
01:59:28,337 --> 01:59:28,537
Yes.

1788
01:59:29,378 --> 01:59:29,818
Dan.

1789
01:59:30,978 --> 01:59:31,218
Yes.

1790
01:59:32,805 --> 01:59:33,165
Erin.

1791
01:59:35,387 --> 01:59:35,647
Yes.

Beth.

1793
01:59:38,429 --> 01:59:38,689
Yes.

1794
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:41,190
Dr. Caldera.

1795
01:59:41,871 --> 01:59:42,171
Yes.

1796
01:59:42,591 --> 01:59:45,213
Do you prefer Dr. Caldera or Dr. Grace?

1797
01:59:46,774 --> 01:59:52,117
Generally go by Dr. Caldera, but you know, Dr. Grace works too, whatever.

1798
01:59:53,278 --> 01:59:53,578
Okay.

1799
01:59:53,858 --> 01:59:54,239
Thank you.

1800
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:56,260
Sorry.

1801
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:56,680
So late.

1802
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,561
I'm asking Ken.

1803
01:59:59,282 --> 01:59:59,522
Yes.

1804
02:00:00,723 --> 02:00:01,123
Kristen.

1805
02:00:02,912 --> 02:00:03,172
Yes.

1806
02:00:04,833 --> 02:00:05,233
Laura.

1807
02:00:05,973 --> 02:00:06,253
Yes.

1808
02:00:07,954 --> 02:00:08,254
Lee.

1809
02:00:08,934 --> 02:00:09,234
Yes.

1810
02:00:10,795 --> 02:00:11,095
Lou.

1811
02:00:11,575 --> 02:00:11,875
Yes.

1812
02:00:13,436 --> 02:00:13,956
Maria.

1813
02:00:14,796 --> 02:00:15,096
Yes.

1814
02:00:16,537 --> 02:00:17,097

1815
02:00:17,597 --> 02:00:17,857

02:00:20,278 --> 02:00:20,638
Yes.

1818
02:00:21,518 --> 02:00:21,919
Ron.

1819
02:00:22,539 --> 02:00:22,859
Yes.

1820

Sorry.

02:00:29,961 --> 02:00:30,361
Thank you.

1826
02:00:30,722 --> 02:00:31,042
Matt.

1827
02:00:31,742 --> 02:00:31,942
Yes.

1828
02:00:33,902 --> 02:00:34,322
Janelle.

1829
02:00:35,003 --> 02:00:35,203
Yes.

1830
02:00:35,924 --> 02:00:36,484
Josie.

1831
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:37,846
Yes.

1832
02:00:39,507 --> 02:00:39,947
Myself.

1833
02:00:40,027 --> 02:00:40,288
Yes.

1834
02:00:40,468 --> 02:00:40,808
All right.

1835
02:00:41,249 --> 02:00:42,329
So that was unanimous.

1836
02:00:43,290 --> 02:00:43,611
Okay.

1837
02:00:44,431 --> 02:00:46,413
So the next thing is Ron's motion.

1838
02:00:46,433 --> 02:00:50,937
Let me read it again.

1839
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,042
Whereas the final presentation

1840
02:00:57,642 --> 02:01:00,125
has received final advisory committee approval.

1841
02:01:00,645 --> 02:01:06,512
Be it resolved that the chairman select the members who will actually make the presentation to the school committee.

1842
02:01:07,233 --> 02:01:12,539
Chairman, determine the presentation teams outline who will speak about which slide.

1843
02:01:16,018 --> 02:01:20,421
The committee assigned members to assist in logistics of the presentation with city hall staff.

1844
02:01:21,002 --> 02:01:30,488
The committee will send the message to the school committee asking for an appropriate time and approved length of for the presentation offered by Ron second.

1845
02:01:30,969 --> 02:01:33,050
There was a friendly, there was a friendly amendment.

1846
02:01:33,070 --> 02:01:40,396
Yeah, I believe that was mine just that people volunteer and if there's more than one volunteer that we vote.

1847
02:01:42,957 --> 02:01:43,318
Correct.

1848
02:01:44,879 --> 02:01:45,139
Okay.

1849
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:56,102
So to do it formally correct, the first motion would be a motion to take it off the table.

1850
02:01:59,623 --> 02:02:01,324
I make a motion to take it off the table.

1851
02:02:03,185 --> 02:02:03,625
Second.

1852
02:02:06,706 --> 02:02:07,026
Okay.

1853
02:02:07,847 --> 02:02:09,527
Point of clarification, I'm confused.

1854
02:02:09,567 --> 02:02:10,708
What are we taking off the table?

1855
02:02:10,848 --> 02:02:12,769
Just putting this light.

1856
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:14,509
We need to take it off the table.

1857
02:02:14,569 --> 02:02:17,971
It's on the table right now with your friendly amendment.

1858
02:02:18,891 --> 02:02:22,152
All right, everyone in favor of taking it off the table, signify by saying aye.

1859
02:02:22,832 --> 02:02:22,952
Aye.

1860
02:02:23,613 --> 02:02:23,753
Aye.

1861
02:02:23,853 --> 02:02:24,773
Anyone opposed?

1862
02:02:24,793 --> 02:02:24,913
No.

1863
02:02:26,834 --> 02:02:27,434
Did I hear a no?

1864
02:02:28,114 --> 02:02:28,354
Me.

1865
02:02:28,494 --> 02:02:30,055
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

1866
02:02:30,075 --> 02:02:32,095
Voting to take my friendly amendment off the table?

1867
02:02:32,575 --> 02:02:32,816
No.

1868
02:02:33,556 --> 02:02:37,217
The motion itself off the table and then- The motion was put on the table.

1869
02:02:37,277 --> 02:02:41,138
We're now taking it off the table so that we can continue to discuss it.

1870
02:02:42,299 --> 02:02:43,179
Okay, thank you.

1871
02:02:48,632 --> 02:02:50,853
I lost everybody, I lost my video, okay.

1872
02:02:52,214 --> 02:02:57,297
All right, so we have a motion, we have a second, and we have an amendment.

1873
02:02:58,698 --> 02:03:01,440
So we have a second on the amendment, we wanna vote the amendment.

1874
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:04,061
I was accepted as a friendly amendment.

1875
02:03:04,081 --> 02:03:05,802
Friendly amendment, sorry, okay.

1876
02:03:06,583 --> 02:03:08,504
So we have any more discussion on the motion?

1877
02:03:14,067 --> 02:03:14,407
Okay.

1878
02:03:14,868 --> 02:03:17,269
Is this about who is presenting

1879
02:03:17,665 --> 02:03:19,246
or how we're going to choose presenters?

1880
02:03:19,906 --> 02:03:20,147
Yes.

1881
02:03:20,707 --> 02:03:20,947
Okay.

1882
02:03:23,249 --> 02:03:23,609
Okay.

1883
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:27,771
So all those in favor signify by saying aye.

1884
02:03:27,791 --> 02:03:27,851
Aye.

1885
02:03:29,452 --> 02:03:29,793
Aye.

1886
02:03:30,033 --> 02:03:30,853
Anyone opposed?

1887
02:03:33,315 --> 02:03:33,635
Okay.

1888
02:03:35,036 --> 02:03:37,638
So do we have volunteers for the presentation?

1889
02:03:43,982 --> 02:03:44,802
I volunteer Ron.

1890
02:03:45,262 --> 02:03:46,023
I nominate Ron.

1891
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:52,048
My feeling was Ron and Dr. Caldara, myself.

1892
02:03:52,168 --> 02:04:07,543
I would like to- Ron and Dr. Grace are the two, besides you, Mr. Chairman, are the two most trusted people on the, not trusted- Can I just make, so I have a list here of every slide.

1893
02:04:08,104 --> 02:04:12,007
I have a list of, you know, somebody's going to have to manage the slide deck because apparently

1894
02:04:12,912 --> 02:04:15,553
they don't supply the laptop where they have to do that too.

1895
02:04:15,653 --> 02:04:16,953
So that's another position.

1896
02:04:17,013 --> 02:04:24,335
But I certainly would be honored to represent this group in any way you want.

1897
02:04:25,496 --> 02:04:30,737
I kind of have a involvement with Jean Barry Sutherland.

1898
02:04:30,777 --> 02:04:34,098
So I would appreciate your confidence to let me present what I wrote.

1899
02:04:36,471 --> 02:04:46,617
I think somebody has to introduce, and I'm fine with just getting up there, but I think Jim should be talking a little bit about the mission.

1900
02:04:46,998 --> 02:04:51,740
I think Dr. Caldera certainly knows the rubric better than anybody.

1901
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:55,763
I think there's pieces that everybody can get involved with.

1902
02:04:55,803 --> 02:04:58,405
Again, we are struggling with time, as I keep hearing.

1903
02:04:59,465 --> 02:05:03,168
Last night, they talked about 30 minutes, but that's plenty of time for us.

1904
02:05:03,228 --> 02:05:05,029
But if anybody has...

1905
02:05:05,851 --> 02:05:21,024
you know, if anybody wants to, you know, volunteer to pick up a piece here, if there's some piece of the process that you were involved with, and maybe the people who created the survey want to talk about the public participation, just to get your face out there.

1906
02:05:21,104 --> 02:05:22,425
If not, that's fine, too.

1907
02:05:24,346 --> 02:05:31,352
My recommendation would be if one of the two people who selected Misatok as their first choice would present on Misatok.

1908
02:05:32,816 --> 02:05:37,019
One of the 12 who picked Belinda Sutton would present on Belinda Sutton.

1909
02:05:39,482 --> 02:05:40,222
That's a good idea.

1910
02:05:40,242 --> 02:05:42,704
So do we have volunteers?

1911
02:05:44,386 --> 02:05:48,329
I volunteer to run the slide deck since I think I found my groove.

1912
02:05:50,883 --> 02:05:57,207
Point of information, we're probably gonna need our own equipment for that, just so you know.

1913
02:05:58,928 --> 02:06:00,269
We have to supply a laptop.

1914
02:06:00,789 --> 02:06:04,692
Yeah, I would talk to Lisa, probably, because she could best answer that.

1915
02:06:05,712 --> 02:06:07,233
Lisa text messaged me.

1916
02:06:07,293 --> 02:06:11,856
At the mayor's office, they should have one for you for the presentation.

1917
02:06:11,916 --> 02:06:16,899
And if they don't, then I can work with Dr. Cushing to have one for the evening.

1918
02:06:16,959 --> 02:06:19,661
But since we're at City Hall,

1919
02:06:20,627 --> 02:06:24,791
Um, it's probably better if they have equipment for us, they should have one.

1920
02:06:24,851 --> 02:06:28,515
If they don't, then, um, I'll speak to Dr. Cushing.

1921
02:06:28,555 --> 02:06:32,659
So if somebody can just touch base with the mayor's office on that, and then let me know, that would be great.

1922
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:34,541
I can bring a laptop.

1923
02:06:34,741 --> 02:06:38,145
I do not have, um, I'm working out of my home.

1924
02:06:38,305 --> 02:06:40,787
I do not have, um, like projector hookups.

1925
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:44,191
Does Peter have his hand up?

1926
02:06:46,914 --> 02:06:51,958
So if you can hear me, you don't need to worry about bringing a computer or anything like that.

1927
02:06:52,218 --> 02:06:53,099
It's Google Slides.

1928
02:06:53,139 --> 02:06:56,621
Just share it with me five minutes before you want to present.

1929
02:06:57,042 --> 02:06:59,023
And I can present it through Zoom.

1930
02:06:59,203 --> 02:07:00,264
And then the way that

1931
02:07:00,868 --> 02:07:07,731
Medford Community Media has set up the chambers in a really awesome way is it will present to two flat screen televisions.

1932
02:07:07,771 --> 02:07:08,652
We don't need projectors.

1933
02:07:08,672 --> 02:07:09,412
We don't need anything.

1934
02:07:09,492 --> 02:07:11,133
And you don't need to bring a laptop.

1935
02:07:11,213 --> 02:07:12,394
You can just bring yourselves.

1936
02:07:13,694 --> 02:07:19,657
And you can give me a thumbs up when you're on the next slide, or I'll just follow along.

1937
02:07:19,738 --> 02:07:24,760
And if I advance too fast, you can tell me to go back, and I'll be happy to do it however you want.

1938
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:28,202
You can also bring a computer, but you don't need to do that.

1939
02:07:29,142 --> 02:07:29,402
All right.

1940
02:07:29,643 --> 02:07:30,263
Thank you.

1941
02:07:31,195 --> 02:07:31,655
Sounds great.

1942
02:07:32,095 --> 02:07:39,357
Another question is, do we, Lisa can probably answer this, should we be bringing a hard copy of the presentation too?

1943
02:07:40,977 --> 02:07:47,619
The school committee will probably want one, yes, or we can email it to them after the fact, but they might want one of them.

1944
02:07:48,139 --> 02:07:49,560
So I don't know how we do that.

1945
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:52,900
But if you can't, you can't, then we can just email it to them.

1946
02:07:53,561 --> 02:07:55,661
We do that all the time.

1947
02:07:56,221 --> 02:07:58,982
On Monday, I can make sure that there are printed copies available.

1948
02:08:00,506 --> 02:08:00,866
Thank you.

1949
02:08:00,886 --> 02:08:01,806
Maria has her hand up.

1950
02:08:03,547 --> 02:08:05,928
Oh, I was just volunteering to present.

1951
02:08:07,788 --> 02:08:08,368
Who do you want?

1952
02:08:09,649 --> 02:08:10,629
You want Belinda Sutton?

1953
02:08:11,009 --> 02:08:11,289
Yes.

1954
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:13,770
Anybody else want Belinda?

1955
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:17,951
There's also an opportunity to share because there's four slides.

1956
02:08:18,611 --> 02:08:22,092
So we don't have to just, if anybody else is interested, anybody?

1957
02:08:22,112 --> 02:08:25,833
I would love Maria to do it.

1958
02:08:26,774 --> 02:08:28,094
Okay, done.

1959
02:08:31,923 --> 02:08:32,103
Okay.

1960
02:08:32,543 --> 02:08:33,664
What was that, Ken?

1961
02:08:34,444 --> 02:08:36,325
Belinda Sutton will be done by Maria.

1962
02:08:36,865 --> 02:08:37,085
Okay.

1963
02:08:38,305 --> 02:08:39,206
Yeah, very good.

1964
02:08:42,307 --> 02:08:45,028
I just want to thank the volunteers, especially Maria.

1965
02:08:45,468 --> 02:08:49,229
I think it's great to have a young person up there presenting this important information to our city.

1966
02:08:49,249 --> 02:08:51,190
So I think really fantastic.

1967
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:53,090
What about the oldest person, Matt?

1968
02:08:53,611 --> 02:08:56,212
Well, he may be one of the oldest persons, but I'm not either.

1969
02:08:57,252 --> 02:08:58,232
Good point.

1970
02:08:58,292 --> 02:08:58,892
Thank you, Ryan.

1971
02:08:58,913 --> 02:08:59,333
Good point.

1972
02:09:01,186 --> 02:09:02,667
Good point.

1973
02:09:02,727 --> 02:09:04,749
Okay, so we have Belinda.

1974
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:10,714
I can take Misitech if nobody else is going to, since I will already be there.

1975
02:09:11,194 --> 02:09:12,035
Yeah, good point.

1976
02:09:12,395 --> 02:09:16,299
So I think- I think Grace is in the process, right?

1977
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:24,886
Yeah, I think Grace, if you could do, you probably are gonna do, I mean, you're comfortable with doing rubric, obviously.

1978
02:09:25,106 --> 02:09:29,490
I don't think we should trust that to, you're the expert on it, so.

1979
02:09:30,578 --> 02:09:32,980
Yeah, I can do the rubric and I can do MISITUC, that's fine.

1980
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:38,204
Okay, I'm just thinking logistics, if you're up there, do you wanna take the next three tips?

1981
02:09:40,386 --> 02:09:40,886
The next?

1982
02:09:42,067 --> 02:09:44,629
Well, from rubric down to MISITUC.

1983
02:09:45,710 --> 02:09:47,091
Oh, from rubric down to MISITUC.

1984
02:09:47,131 --> 02:09:48,352
Do you wanna share some of that?

1985
02:09:49,213 --> 02:09:52,976
I'm happy to share it or I can do the whole thing, it doesn't really matter.

1986
02:09:52,996 --> 02:09:56,919
I guess the question is, does anybody have a burning desire to be part of this?

1987
02:09:56,959 --> 02:09:59,441
Because there's plenty of slides to share.

1988
02:10:04,577 --> 02:10:07,639
I have no burning desire to present.

1989
02:10:07,699 --> 02:10:12,783
I will do it if we need people, but it wouldn't be my first choice of activity.

1990
02:10:13,284 --> 02:10:15,025
How many volunteers do we have so far?

1991
02:10:15,045 --> 02:10:23,751
I'm going to nominate Erin for Misituk because that was her first choice, I believe, if I'm remembering correctly.

1992
02:10:23,771 --> 02:10:29,736
Okay, we have Grace who's already volunteered for Misituk, but Erin, do you want to

1993
02:10:31,886 --> 02:10:33,027
appreciate your confidence.

1994
02:10:34,008 --> 02:10:38,011
It's, I'm not sure that it's not my first choice to want to present.

1995
02:10:38,391 --> 02:10:42,554
Again, if I, if there is no one else who wants to do it, then I will.

1996
02:10:43,134 --> 02:10:45,576
Well, we do have Grace who's volunteered for this attack.

1997
02:10:45,596 --> 02:10:46,257
So okay.

1998
02:10:46,657 --> 02:10:47,217
Thank you, Grace.

1999
02:10:47,397 --> 02:10:47,998
That's okay.

2000
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:51,340
Anybody else want to slide?

2001
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,982
I think this is a great team.

2002
02:10:54,002 --> 02:10:55,443
Thank you all for doing it.

2003
02:10:55,904 --> 02:10:57,205
I'll take the one that says thank you.

2004
02:11:00,552 --> 02:11:02,093
I kind of wanted that one, Paul.

2005
02:11:02,333 --> 02:11:02,634
All right.

2006
02:11:03,054 --> 02:11:04,355
Who's going to introduce, Jim?

2007
02:11:04,375 --> 02:11:05,896
I was going to share that with you, Paul.

2008
02:11:06,176 --> 02:11:06,436
Yes.

2009
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:15,421
All right, so I've got, so Dr. Caldera will do the, from rubric right through Ms.

2010
02:11:15,461 --> 02:11:17,162
Satak, is that fair to say?

2011
02:11:18,623 --> 02:11:20,364
Yep, I can do that, that's not a problem.

2012
02:11:20,604 --> 02:11:21,205
Thank you.

2013
02:11:21,265 --> 02:11:22,205
Seth has his hand up.

2014
02:11:22,745 --> 02:11:23,046
Seth?

2015
02:11:24,166 --> 02:11:25,047
Yeah, thank you.

2016
02:11:26,573 --> 02:11:31,957
So I can't commit because I don't know the schedule of my daughter.

2017
02:11:33,037 --> 02:11:45,125
But one of the things that might be an influence on my availability is actually whether or not my daughter would like to accompany me to the meeting.

2018
02:11:45,426 --> 02:11:50,469
And if that would be the case, then I would like to be

2019
02:11:54,879 --> 02:11:58,000
I can offer you this, I can offer you this, Seth.

2020
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:04,763
You can talk about, you know, the first four slides are agenda, which I probably will do.

2021
02:12:05,243 --> 02:12:07,924
Then mission would probably be Jim, in my mind.

2022
02:12:08,185 --> 02:12:19,910
But background and receiving and reviewing public, I think that we can put you down and if for some reason you don't show up, you know, we can, you know, make a quick substitution if you want to.

2023
02:12:23,717 --> 02:12:28,840
All right, so I'm going to put myself in as just the intro, if that's okay.

2024
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:33,142
Then Jim- May I ask what the date of this is again, Thursday?

2025
02:12:33,422 --> 02:12:33,782
Monday.

2026
02:12:34,162 --> 02:12:35,303
Oh, next Monday at?

2027
02:12:36,223 --> 02:12:37,404
They don't really know yet.

2028
02:12:37,844 --> 02:12:38,284
Oh, okay.

2029
02:12:38,605 --> 02:12:39,665
After the workday?

2030
02:12:39,685 --> 02:12:42,186
Yeah, six o'clock, six at least.

2031
02:12:42,907 --> 02:12:45,728
Earliest is six, seven is more- That would be nice.

2032
02:12:46,889 --> 02:12:50,731
Okay, so I'm going to put Seth in there for background.

2033
02:12:52,172 --> 02:12:54,633
and receiving and reviewing public.

2034
02:12:55,614 --> 02:12:56,814
So you can prepare that.

2035
02:12:57,875 --> 02:13:03,138
So that's all the slides, but anybody can, if anybody had, again, I don't want to dictate this.

2036
02:13:03,198 --> 02:13:04,798
I'm just trying to do this to get it moving.

2037
02:13:06,059 --> 02:13:11,702
And then we just wrap it up at the end with the, you know, if they have questions or comments, I don't know.

2038
02:13:11,722 --> 02:13:15,764
Hopefully we don't have to wake them up at slide 21, but who knows?

2039
02:13:16,424 --> 02:13:20,266
So Kristen, you're going to do the slide deck.

2040
02:13:21,328 --> 02:13:26,731
Oh, no, it seems like the school, they have a mechanism for doing that with the school.

2041
02:13:27,372 --> 02:13:28,653
I can be ready to jump in.

2042
02:13:28,913 --> 02:13:32,655
Yeah, so I would suggest that we get there early.

2043
02:13:32,695 --> 02:13:40,900
And if anybody has any style issues with how we're going to do this, I assume you'd get up, you give your address, and move on.

2044
02:13:42,161 --> 02:13:43,582
So that was easier than I expected.

2045
02:13:43,622 --> 02:13:44,042
That's good.

2046
02:13:44,062 --> 02:13:45,443
All right.

2047
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:49,637
I just have one final question before we adjourn.

2048
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,885
Directed to Brie.

2049
02:13:53,346 --> 02:13:56,032
Brie, would you be open to the school committee naming your baby?

2050
02:14:00,686 --> 02:14:08,014
We could meet on Tuesday to start it.

2051
02:14:08,314 --> 02:14:13,980
I will take your public input, but I will set up a Google for it.

2052
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,282
We already have a list of 18 names.

2053
02:14:16,402 --> 02:14:17,023
I mean, come on.

2054
02:14:19,165 --> 02:14:19,505
All right.

2055
02:14:19,565 --> 02:14:20,186
Good luck.

2056
02:14:20,466 --> 02:14:21,947
Did you want to hear the results from this?

2057
02:14:22,047 --> 02:14:22,527
Yes.

2058
02:14:22,627 --> 02:14:23,528
Yes.

2059
02:14:23,748 --> 02:14:25,689
Yes, please.

2060
02:14:26,050 --> 02:14:26,590
Okay.

2061
02:14:26,610 --> 02:14:28,832
So we have 393 students enrolled at the Columbus.

2062
02:14:29,272 --> 02:14:32,354
I received votes from 277 of them.

2063
02:14:33,735 --> 02:14:35,976
And in alphabetical order.

2064
02:14:37,117 --> 02:14:38,418
Mr. Tuck received 100 and 107 votes.

2065
02:14:43,666 --> 02:14:51,202
Jean Barry Sutherland Elementary School received 84 votes and the Belinda Sutton Elementary School received 86 votes.

2066
02:14:53,581 --> 02:14:58,225
So I did share those with the school committee as well as Mr. Lister earlier today.

2067
02:14:58,405 --> 02:14:59,786
Jim, were you able to open those later on?

2068
02:15:00,207 --> 02:15:01,047
I was, thank you.

2069
02:15:01,067 --> 02:15:08,193
Okay, and so what we did, and I counted them and then I had Mrs. Sherman-Hudson count them independently in another room for accuracy.

2070
02:15:09,314 --> 02:15:17,361
And then what we did was we just took some of the comments that the students said about the names and forwarded those with the information for the school committee to deliberate as well.

2071
02:15:19,863 --> 02:15:20,303
So that's that.

2072
02:15:20,343 --> 02:15:22,045
Does anybody have any questions they wanna ask me about?

2073
02:15:22,773 --> 02:15:23,593
Thank you for that effort.

2074
02:15:23,714 --> 02:15:24,154
That was great.

2075
02:15:24,634 --> 02:15:25,074
Thank you.

2076
02:15:25,475 --> 02:15:26,095
It was our pleasure.

2077
02:15:26,115 --> 02:15:29,757
And thank you for all the help everybody on this committee for, you know, making this happen.

2078
02:15:29,977 --> 02:15:30,357
We'll see.

2079
02:15:30,918 --> 02:15:32,338
I'm excited to see what the result would be.

2080
02:15:32,999 --> 02:15:34,039
I hope the kids enjoyed it.

2081
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:35,520
Now.

2082
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:39,242
Can I speak motion to adjourn?

2083
02:15:39,462 --> 02:15:40,043
All right.

2084
02:15:40,183 --> 02:15:40,823
Just very quickly.

2085
02:15:40,863 --> 02:15:42,284
I just want to really thank everybody.

2086
02:15:42,304 --> 02:15:45,926
I want to thank the chair, um, the school committee for having the faith in us.

2087
02:15:46,226 --> 02:15:50,209
Um, it hasn't been easy, but I know I've learned a lot and I really appreciate everybody's hard work.

2088
02:15:50,269 --> 02:15:51,009
So thank you all.

2089
02:15:51,886 --> 02:15:52,187
Same.

2090
02:15:52,448 --> 02:15:52,910
Thank you.

2091
02:15:53,331 --> 02:15:53,732
Ditto.

2092
02:15:53,873 --> 02:15:54,274
Thank you.

2093
02:15:55,157 --> 02:15:56,983
Everybody is always welcome in my backyard.
