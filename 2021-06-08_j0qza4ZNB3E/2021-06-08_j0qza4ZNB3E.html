    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=0.089s">committee</a>  approval, be it resolved that the chairman select the members who will actually make the presentation to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=7.291s">The</a>  chairman determined the presentation teams outline who will speak about which slide the committee assigned members to assist in logistics of the presentation with city hall staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=21.575s">The</a>  committee will send a message to the school committee asking for the appropriate time and approve approved length for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=29.119s">offered</a>  by Ron Jovino. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=32.744s">Can</a>  I get a second on that?</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=43.298s">Can</a>  I ask just was that about the length of the <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=48.908s">those</a>  about the length of the presentation before we present it?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=51.829s">It's</a>  not about the length. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=56.691s">It's</a>  a kite before the horse, because once we have approved the presentation, hopefully today, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=63.567s">I</a>  just wanted to figure out how we're presenting it in front of, you know, the logistics, who's talking, who's, you know, who do we have to coordinate the slides with, how the presentation, it's just basic stuff that we just, I don't wanna walk away today without having, you know, an idea of who's talking and who's doing what. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=80.138s">I</a>  think once we approve, no words can be changed, but just who wants to do it.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=84.962s">Well,</a>  but then do we know how long we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=86.923s">Because</a>  if they're like, you have 30 seconds, which- They mentioned last night, 30 minutes.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=93.514s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=94.514s">They</a>  were warned 30 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=95.995s">They</a>  don't believe us, but we have plenty of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=98.456s">It</a>  won't be 30 minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=99.536s">I</a>  think 30 minutes is fine, as long as they don't go crazy with questions.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=103.177s">Yeah,</a>  that's up to them, right?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=104.558s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=106.018s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=106.258s">Mr.</a>  Lister, this is Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=107.579s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=108.899s">So</a>  I thought we kind of semi-determined this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=110.58s">I</a>  thought you, Mr. Lister, were going to kind of lead the charge, and then the people who wrote their sections were going to present.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=116.922s">Point</a>  of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=117.522s">We</a>  need a second before we continue discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=122.17s">I'll</a>  second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=124.491s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=127.033s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=127.373s">Is</a>  my question valid then, Mr. McCabe? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=130.474s">I</a>  thought we talked about Mr. Lister being the lead presenter, and then people were doing their sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=137.498s">Maybe</a>  that's what Ron is getting to.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=138.959s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=142.881s">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=144.381s">I</a>  think that's an assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=145.442s">I</a>  don't think we've actually decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=147.622s">you</a>  know, my resolution is more about anybody who wants to be involved should at least be able to volunteer and Jim can make that decision.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=158.004s">I</a>  believe that we had spoken about possibly the chair presenting the process portion and then having <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=169.989s">those</a>  who volunteered to speak and voted for the names to speak, but I'm not certain how applicable that would be now.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=185.412s">Just</a>  through the chair, I mean, my resolution is a basic logistic one so that we have in writing who's doing what, how do we get the slides up with the city hall meeting, just those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=197.654s">I</a>  don't, it's not about <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=199.801s">anything</a>  more than I just want to, I know we've talked about it, but we haven't really decided who the ones that will be talking are. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=206.31s">So,</a>  and this is all after there was a presentation approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=210.616s">So</a>  this, if we approve it just means we're going to talk about it after the presentation is voted on.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=218.41s">Mr.</a>  sure if I could speak on it as well just through the chair thank Ron for putting out the logistics I think it's very important to get those on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=227.001s">I</a>  agree with most of almost all of this the only change I would suggest, perhaps as a friendly amendment is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=234.551s">people</a>  volunteer we've done everything on a volunteer basis now so if people are interested in presenting that they volunteer and that there's more than one volunteer that we just put it to a simple vote, since we've all sort of gotten to know each other so well and work together so so well on this committee.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=252.205s">I</a>  would accept that.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=260.723s">So</a>  just to clarify with that friendly amendment, that would mean that people would volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=268.525s">And</a>  then if there's more than one person volunteering for the same section, there would be a simple vote of the whole committee as to who would be the person to present.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=283.237s">Yeah,</a>  I do think that we have a chairman and that chairman should drive this whole process, but let's hope that we don't run into... People who are passionate about a slide should be able to say, I'm passionate about a slide and we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=301.061s">It</a>  shouldn't be anything but that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=303.321s">But</a>  yes, I agree, volunteers are the way to go.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=314.4s">And</a>  I was just saying, you know, to put into a vote to sort of continue this collaborative process with no disrespect to the chair, his ability to make a decision.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=331.049s">You're</a>  muted, Jim.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=334.858s">Doesn't</a>  work that way, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=335.878s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=337.079s">Myself,</a>  I like, I've talked to Ron about doing part of the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=341.26s">And</a>  I think that Dr. Caldara, we've talked about her doing her rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=345.041s">So</a>  those would be two people that I would like to do most of the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=349.022s">And</a>  then if anybody wants to volunteer to participate, we can find a place for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=355.804s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=358.685s">We</a>  good with that?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=361.766s">Patrick</a>  has his hand up.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=363.747s">Patrick,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=365.805s">Yeah,</a>  the concern that I have is just get the cart before the horse a little bit here with the first whereas. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=373.37s">The</a>  whereas says we've already agreed on the presentation, which we haven't, so.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=377.772s">We</a>  haven't because we keep stalling, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=379.894s">We're</a>  too slow with that.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=382.015s">So</a>  we can't, I don't think that we can vote on an amendment saying we've agreed to the presentation when we haven't, so.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=390.981s">I</a>  would like to make a motion to accept the presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=395.566s">except</a>  supply to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=396.967s">Is</a>  there a second so we can get this over with and then we can finish what we need to do.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=402.97s">Mr.</a>  Lister, I just have to say I am not in a hurry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=406.092s">And</a>  also the fact that you're, you're describing how we're working together on each slide and stalling. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=413.436s">It's</a>  just, I don't feel that way at all.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=414.916s">So</a>  I just want to make sure I watched the school committee last night and I was, we were criticized for taking so long.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=421.38s">Well,</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=421.991s">We're</a>  trying to obstruct this, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=425.374s">I</a>  think we're doing good due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=428.916s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=429.777s">I</a>  think voting on it right now to just pass it all, I wouldn't mind reviewing the last couple of slides that we haven't really looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=435.482s">There's</a>  enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=437.923s">I've</a>  looked at it independently.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=441.526s">I</a>  move to table my resolution and get to Patrick's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=445.229s">That's</a>  important, too.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=446.39s">I</a>  can second that motion to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=449.372s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=450.193s">The</a>  second resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=454.815s">If</a>  the committee is unable to agree upon a full presentation by 530, the committee's presentation will include pages one through eight of the presentation, which we reviewed last week and a nine slide with the three names proposed and nothing else offered by Patrick McCabe. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=476.135s">Do</a>  I get a second on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=477.276s">I</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=480.137s">A</a>  point of information, if we're not in a rush to push this through, then what's the point of this resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=486.1s">Mr.</a>  Havestro just said that he had no intentions of rushing this through, but it seems like if we're just going to vote at 530, regardless on the slides, we're kind of being contradictory. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=496.106s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=496.906s">So</a>  I think it's because we all feel like the presentation is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=502.289s">It's</a>  just, we haven't actually formally reviewed it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=505.891s">And</a>  I know I would like to do that.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=510.469s">Curt</a>  Brown, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- John Gerstle, COB OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown,</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=523.544s">just</a>  everybody has a chance to look at it this weekend, right Mr. Chair?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=527.767s">We</a>  should be able to get this done in an hour and 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=530.369s">If</a>  not, I mean, you know, the mayor had said we could have another meeting this week if we had to, not that I want to, I would, I'd like to wrap it up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=538.995s">I</a>  think the presentation looks great.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=541.436s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=543.052s">Yes,</a>  I would like to just offer a friendly amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=545.954s">Patrick's,</a>  uh, you know, it looks like we are we maybe Dr Cushing knows, but it looks like the next event here is 6 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=553.179s">I</a>  would hate to think we lock ourselves into 5 30 and have one slide left and we have to scrap the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=561.445s">So,</a>  um, I'm just offering a friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=565.248s">Maybe</a>  we go to, um, 6 15 to make it, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=570.168s">more</a>  palatable, but we need to move the vote or else we're going to waste more time here.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=573.993s">Sorry</a>  to interrupt, but this Zoom channel is wide open this evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=581.364s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=584.898s">You</a>  know, I'll be doing double duty at seven o'clock for the National Junior Honor Society at the McGlynn, but this, we do not have the issue that we had last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=594.083s">And</a>  I also wanna say, I apologize for having to cut everybody off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=597.645s">It</a>  was the budget hearing for our $68.2 million budget for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=602.748s">So</a>  I apologize for anyone that was cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=606.951s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=607.171s">Jim,</a>  Jim, do you have a question?</p>

    <p>[Dan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=610.45s">Um,</a>  so this is Danny. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=612.611s">So</a>  you, you said, you know, the information out over the weekend, uh, you know, I know I reviewed it and I'm sure some of the other folks reviewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=622.277s">Maybe</a>  it's just a simple of question of, you know, you asking, was there anyone that wanted to change on something? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=630.161s">And</a>  if there was, then we proceed and go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=632.963s">But</a>  if there was no one that had a specific change, then why can't we just move it along?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=638.362s">All</a>  right, well, first, I agree, but first we have Patrick's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=642.683s">If</a>  you want to continue on with this, we got to vote it up or down, and then we can continue on and get into the slides, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=649.966s">And</a>  if anybody has a slide that they want to pick out, we can work on it.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=655.107s">To</a>  Ron's question of the friendly amendment, Ron, my concern is, you know, if we're saying 615, then we have to vote on your <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=667.318s">you</a>  know, your amendment as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=668.899s">So,</a>  um, if you're, you know, if you're agreeable to six o'clock, I'll, I'll accept that as a friendly amendment instead of five 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=677.083s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=679.004s">I</a>  just want to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=680.585s">Yes,</a>  that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=682.866s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=683.726s">Weren't</a>  we just told that we didn't have any time restraints tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=687.508s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=689.609s">So</a>  it's a yes or no vote on whether we, uh, ended at hard at six o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=695.172s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=696.451s">Okay,</a>  it's a yes or no vote whether we end at six o'clock.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=699.833s">Not</a>  in the meeting, but at six o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=702.214s">And</a>  the deliberation.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=703.835s">And</a>  the deliberation on the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=707.197s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=707.497s">But</a>  let me just be clear that it ends the slide and it also cuts out the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=713.3s">So</a>  that's what we're voting on.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=715.301s">Right,</a>  but there's still a discussion about who presents the first eight slides and the ninth slide.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=721.044s">Yeah,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=722.725s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=724.026s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=726.715s">Bri,</a>  yes or no?</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=823.483s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=825.845s">It</a>  was before.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=827.267s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=829.129s">And</a>  Jim Lister. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=830.39s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=851.089s">Yep,</a>  15 in the affirmative and six in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=854.418s">So</a>  we ended at six, one way or the other, okay?</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=861.178s">Now,</a>  Mr. Chairman, may I make a motion to have the presentation the way it is so we don't delay anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=868.143s">We</a>  can discuss whatever you'd like to discuss afterwards, but we can accept the presentation as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=874.608s">So</a>  this way there's no argument or no discussion about eight slides, nine slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=881.172s">It's</a>  the 20 slides minus the 21, slide 21, and then just... <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=886.65s">then</a>  we can nitpick through every slide afterwards.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=891.353s">Can</a>  I get a second on that?</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=892.614s">Well,</a>  I object to this, Mr. Rustin.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=896.336s">Well,</a>  let's get a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=897.476s">If</a>  we're going to discuss it, we need a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=899.418s">If</a>  we don't get a second, we won't go any further.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=903.88s">Can</a>  I ask a point of information?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=905.641s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=906.302s">When</a>  I looked at the slides, there were 27 slides, and I'm hearing a number of 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=912.577s">When</a>  I looked at it, did things change? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=914.778s">How</a>  many slides are there that we're talking about right now?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=916.699s">Point</a>  of information, those slides after slide 21 were left there as part of the discussion from the editing issue that we had, which is no longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=927.383s">So</a>  those, if everybody agrees, those are invalid slides and those were just there for, so it's 21 slides right now.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=934.648s">Okay,</a>  that's what I wanted to know, because some of the information was repeated. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=937.529s">Yeah,</a>  those additional ones about- I wanna know how many I'm voting on.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=940.851s">Those</a>  additional slides about Jean Barry Sutherland are deleted. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=945.973s">The</a>  end.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=947.914s">So</a>  my motion was seconded, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=951.356s">Okay,</a>  so now- We can discuss the slides, but let's just approve the entire process, and then we can go through slide by slide if you'd like, but at least we know that the 20 slides have been approved.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=964.431s">How</a>  can we approve the 20 slides without, I know that we were specifically asked not to edit, but to make comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=971.535s">And</a>  I know I made a couple and I would, I'm assuming people left comments that we should read.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=976.918s">So</a>  now's the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=981.383s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=981.863s">I</a>  just thought we would start where we left off last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=985.205s">There's</a>  not that much more to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=986.426s">It</a>  will take us longer.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=989.268s">We're</a>  interested in saving time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=991.089s">I</a>  sent it out to all of you so you could look at each slide, make your own notes, and then while we're here right now, we'll discuss what certain slide you want to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1000.696s">If</a>  there's a slide that no one has a problem with, we don't even need to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1004.358s">We'll</a>  accept it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1005.499s">I</a>  was at the school committee meeting last night, Mr. Chairman, and I was, you know, disappointed that they said that we were trying to stall the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1013.19s">Well,</a>  right now is a motion on the floor, not to stall the process any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1019.098s">We</a>  can discuss like Brie said, individual slides or individual comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1023.143s">but</a>  at least we can agree on the 20 slides to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1027.605s">So</a>  now we don't have to worry about a six o'clock deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1029.847s">We</a>  don't have to worry about anything because the 20 slides have been approved.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1034.209s">I</a>  just think that's just watching things. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1037.05s">I</a>  just want to begin where we left off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1039.031s">A</a>  lot of us have notes for different slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1040.872s">I</a>  don't see any reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1043.034s">Thank</a>  you for your report from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1045.155s">I</a>  didn't watch the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1046.936s">I'm</a>  not delaying any process. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1048.317s">I</a>  don't think you are either, Mr. Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1049.918s">And</a>  I think we should just review the slides where we left off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1052.2s">There's</a>  not that much more to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1053.741s">Yes,</a>  I've reviewed it, but I think people want to discuss it.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1057.903s">Point</a>  of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1059.491s">trying</a>  to just count through 20 slides, 21 slides, I'm like, you know, I printed what was sent by the chair, I have 30 something slides, I recognize that some of them were what were added at the end that weren't for Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1079.978s">But</a>  my last slide that says thank you, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1084.029s">That's</a>  27, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1085.67s">I'm</a>  still trying to count. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1087.392s">So</a>  I think that we need to go through specifically slide by slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1093.135s">We're</a>  going to have 20 slides, 18 slides, 21 slides, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1097.438s">There's</a>  no other way in which to do it other than just doing it step by step.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1102.862s">I</a>  just don't want the school committee to think that we're stalling the process because I think that we amazingly- This process is our own.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1109.046s">I'm</a>  sorry to interrupt.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1112.128s">We</a>  are, we have a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1113.888s">So</a>  you'd vote no on the motion then. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1116.229s">So</a>  don't want to just take the whole thing.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1120.41s">It</a>  was a point of order that that motion can't stand as is because we don't actually know what the motion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1127.652s">What</a>  20 slides are we actually talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1130.052s">Which</a>  specific 20 slides is the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1134.774s">Paul,</a>  would you like to repeat your motion?</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1138.646s">Yes,</a>  there are 22 slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1142.048s">We're</a>  going to say because the thank you, after you look, the thank you would be slide number 22.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1147.471s">The</a>  thank you is slide 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1150.672s">It</a>  is 22, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1152.293s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1152.773s">Slide</a>  22 says thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1154.914s">The</a>  one prior to it is 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1157.516s">I'm</a>  just asking that if we could delete slide 21 off the whole process, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1164.249s">and</a>  keep those other slides, which are 20 slides, with the thank you, end with the thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1172.572s">Just</a>  remove slide 21, that's all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1175.073s">And</a>  we could say, yes, and now you wanna individually, like Matt, and I agree with you, Matt, we can go through each individual slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1182.656s">But</a>  in case we go past 6.15 or six o'clock, at least we know that these 20 slides are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1190.987s">that</a>  we've all looked at and we've had all weekend to look at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1194.49s">The</a>  school committee thinks that we're stalling the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1197.492s">And</a>  I don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1198.573s">We've</a>  done such an amazing job on this presentation and it should be seen in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1207.459s">And</a>  I don't wanna see just eight slides be presented to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1211.382s">I</a>  think that these 20 slides should be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1215.125s">That's</a>  just my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1216.867s">Point</a>  of information to the motion maker. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1221.015s">Paul,</a>  I hear you, I listened to that stuff last night as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1226.078s">I</a>  think what I would ask you to do is table it, and at any point between now and our deliberations till 5.59, I think that's a valid proposal, but it sounds like just the feel of the room says we need to go through these, even though we've all committed to six o'clock, I hope we do it with great speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1245.828s">But</a>  I'm just asking to consider it, you don't need to.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1251.195s">I'm</a>  not sure Mr. Lister who shared her screen before and was making corrections and what slide we are stopped off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1257.177s">I</a>  think it was nine or 10 or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1259.517s">And</a>  since a lot of us have looked at already, I think it's just going to go a lot faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1263.078s">The</a>  last time many of us didn't even see what was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1265.799s">So</a>  let me just, we can get done while you want to withdraw your motion.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1274.621s">I'll</a>  cable it until five 45, Mr. Chairman.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1277.381s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1278.802s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1279.742s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1280.925s">Okay,</a>  all right, the last time we were here, who put it up on the screen for us?</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1287.69s">I</a>  did, Kristen.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1288.971s">Can</a>  you put it up again for us, Kristen, please?</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1291.353s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1291.873s">And</a>  I believe we were at page eight.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1294.896s">We</a>  had just moved the former slide up to eight, and then we went with, we are back on nine, but we went with Melissa. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1306.624s">good</a>  to put it in the different alphabetical order. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1310.467s">So</a>  now slide nine starts with Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1313.029s">So</a>  we will run back into Belinda. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1316.352s">We</a>  can go through that quickly.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1317.933s">And</a>  this is Kathy Kay. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1319.114s">I</a>  just have a small amendment that I think we need to make to slide number four, because it talked about the number of meetings and the dates that we had, and we've now had one more meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1327.721s">So</a>  that would need to be updated.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1331.844s">Can</a>  everyone see my screen?</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1333.445s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1334.166s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1335.806s">You</a>  can see I made that comment as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1338.048s">So</a>  I think we're on the same page that we just need to add this last meeting, hopefully.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1342.091s">Okay,</a>  so just change this to eighth.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1346.995s">And</a>  have we met six times now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1348.376s">This</a>  is our sixth.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1351.078s">I</a>  think so.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1355.72s">The</a>  only thing I wanted to say, too, is we don't have our names anywhere in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1360.002s">And</a>  maybe that's by design. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1362.623s">But</a>  I think our names should be.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1364.224s">First</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1366.545s">First</a>  one.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1369.106s">Is</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1369.326s">I</a>  don't remember seeing it when I looked it over.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1370.927s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1371.087s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1374.969s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1375.589s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1380.692s">OK,</a>  so. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1383.524s">that</a>  we took care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1384.445s">We</a>  switched the order.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1386.026s">Excuse</a>  me on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1387.927s">Back</a>  up on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1389.748s">We</a>  took out additional recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1392.049s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1392.349s">Bottom</a>  line. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1394.05s">Did</a>  we? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1394.771s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1395.471s">It's</a>  in the minutes of the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1396.692s">Yes,</a>  we did.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1399.833s">Sorry,</a>  my cursor is having weird issues.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1406.737s">You're</a>  doing a great job, Kristen. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1408.058s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1408.599s">I'm</a>  just running a lot of apps right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1411.96s">I</a>  don't know how <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1413.752s">My</a>  computer wants to keep up, but we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1419.535s">I</a>  think we did edit this bullet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1422.797s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1423.617s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1425.278s">We</a>  did not change.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1426.018s">I</a>  think we're on.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1427.619s">We</a>  agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1428.099s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1429.48s">So</a>  now nine is the new first slide for MESA talk.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1433.282s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1433.622s">Cause</a>  we switched the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1435.403s">Let</a>  me see if I can make this.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1440.085s">Anyone</a>  have any problems with this slide?</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1442.742s">I</a>  have a comment, not a problem, just I added a suggestion for, I think, a first sentence which I took out of that book that's called the, by Michael M. Coates, I think it's called Our Medford, just to give a little context and the line would read, the first known people on the land, now called Medford, were members of the Pawtucket tribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1466.02s">That</a>  was not, the Pawtucket tribe was not mentioned anywhere, so I thought that would give good context.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1478.12s">So</a>  you want to say the Massachusetts and Pawtucket tribes?</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1482.782s">My</a>  understanding, please, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, is that the Massachusetts tribe encompasses many other tribes, including the Pawtucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1490.326s">When</a>  I looked at the website of the Massachusetts tribe, it looks like the Pawtucket was in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1495.689s">And</a>  looking at this book by Mr. Coates, it looks like the 30 or 40 Native Americans who lived here were part of the Pawtucket tribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1505.206s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1505.786s">Everybody</a>  please correct me.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1507.467s">Erin</a>  has her hand up and she might know.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1509.988s">Okay,</a>  Erin.</p>

    <p>[Genia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1514.77s">I</a>  actually had a comment on a previous slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1519.391s">First,</a>  or maybe at another point, but I was curious about the process for the children's input and whether that was something we were going to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1531.156s">But</a>  as to this question, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1535.68s">I</a>  think that, yes, the Pawtucket peoples encompassed many different tribes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1546.146s">And</a>  also, because it's a river, it's also a place where many other tribes had territory as well, because of the river route. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1561.333s">So</a>  I don't know if you want to put that in there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1565.902s">how</a>  that might be put into the slide.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1571.627s">I</a>  couldn't trace the naming of the river to any one particular tribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1577.132s">In</a>  all the places where it talked about it being named, it just talks about it being named by the native peoples who lived here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1585.28s">Because</a>  like you said, the river spans many communities and many tribes at the time, right?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1593.368s">point</a>  of information, my research shows that Medford was purchased from the wife of the chief of the Pawtuckets, so I think it's valid to put Pawtucket in there.</p>

    <p>[Genia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1609.982s">I</a>  think you could probably put both, just to be sure.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1620.171s">I'm</a>  just typing, I have no knowledge</p>

    <p>[Beth Fuller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1622.751s">I</a>  think Massachusetts is the Massachusetts tribe does not have an S at the end.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1644.002s">Another</a>  point is in that last slide, it says the location of our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1650.441s">Could</a>  we change that to of the Hicks Ave School? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1655.543s">I</a>  believe that using our is a bit confusing, although it is a presentation about renaming this school, but just the pronoun our seems odd.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1669.57s">I'm</a>  sorry, which slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1670.991s">The</a>  previous one to this?</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1672.812s">No,</a>  on this, on the first Missituk, on that last bullet point where it says the location of our school,</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1682.125s">Oh,</a>  I guess it does seem a little strange since we all didn't go to elementary school there.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1688.909s">Maybe</a>  just put the? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1690.31s">Yeah,</a>  take out the word our and put in the word the.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1695.153s">You</a>  can call it Kathy K's school.</p>

    <p>[Beth Fuller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1701.897s">She's</a>  responsible.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1713.705s">Another</a>  point in the bullet point saying colonists moved here because of the river and built great ships. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1724.187s">Could</a>  we remove the word great? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1727.868s">That's</a>  just a personal thing for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1730.348s">It</a>  just seems like an unnecessary adjective there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1740.771s">Unless</a>  that's a quote.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1743.797s">by</a>  the way.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1746.678s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1747.178s">It</a>  just, it, it feels like the, in the context, but it would be fine to keep as well.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1756.659s">I'm</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1757.06s">If</a>  that word is removed as well, because it does put value.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1763.061s">Well,</a>  our ships were valued over the world and how fast they moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1768.182s">So</a>  I have no problem with great.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1774.727s">I</a>  would actually prefer, maybe I have less of a problem with the word great than I do with essential, considering the type of trade that was happening at the time.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1787.82s">What</a>  if we just said clipper ships?</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1792.905s">Sailing</a>  ships? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1794.286s">Is</a>  that what they built?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1796.018s">We</a>  were a very famous method for building clipper ships. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1799.621s">They</a>  were able to go to China to get spices and silk. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1805.025s">And</a>  so anyway, Magoon was a big ship builder, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1813.491s">Anyone</a>  who grew up on Magoon Ave?</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1816.574s">You</a>  could say great clipper ships that were renowned around the world.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1824.227s">or</a>  renowned ships.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1826.128s">Right,</a>  renowned ships around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1828.049s">And</a>  never get rid of essentials trade.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1830.411s">And</a>  you can say used for trade around the world and take out the word essential as well.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1834.353s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1834.873s">So</a>  built great clipper ships that were renowned around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1841.157s">Maybe</a>  you have a better example, I'm not sure.</p>

    <p>[Genia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1847.512s">And</a>  they were also used for the triangle trade too, so I think.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1851.233s">Right,</a>  that's the.</p>

    <p>[Genia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1852.614s">Like</a>  maybe not saying that it was, I agree, maybe not placing that value on it because it doesn't have the same value for everybody.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1860.997s">I'm</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1867.219s">I</a>  feel like I missed something.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1869.86s">Well,</a>  I did use the word renowned, but I'm okay with this sentence the way it is if it sounds.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1873.441s">Renowned</a>  clipper ships? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1876.102s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1877.574s">Great</a>  keeps it on two lines, and doesn't force it down to three.</p>

    <p>[Lafleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1881.415s">I</a>  think it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1882.236s">It</a>  could just be clipper ships.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1883.956s">It</a>  could just be clipper ships. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1885.337s">It</a>  could be just clipper ships. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1886.898s">I'm</a>  fine with any version of this, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1889.919s">I'm</a>  sure some people think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1892.12s">Our</a>  ships were great. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1892.98s">We</a>  know our ships were great.</p>

    <p>[Lafleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1894.921s">Can</a>  we just all call them? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1896.061s">Go</a>  to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1897.762s">Everybody</a>  knows our ships were great.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1902.483s">Yeah</a>  I believe that we shouldn't be placing on not necessarily undue but controversial or subjective value on these.</p>

    <p>[Beth Fuller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1916.014s">Although</a>  great ships is also a category of ship not necessarily referring to fine building but I think a great ship is a like a class of</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1930.333s">I</a>  think that's true.</p>

    <p>[Beth Fuller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1932.093s">I</a>  think great ship actually refers to the class of ship it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1938.955s">But</a>  I think if we're saying clipper ship, shouldn't that be enough?</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1942.716s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1943.316s">I</a>  also think it's less likely to be misinterpreted as putting value.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1950.558s">I</a>  think this sentence is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1951.799s">I</a>  think we can, personally, I think we can move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1953.959s">But</a>  this is just me and our teacher.</p>

    <p>[Beth Fuller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1961.135s">Correction,</a>  and that is on the last bullet point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1965.859s">I</a>  think the school name was Mystic School and not The Mystic School. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1971.904s">There's</a>  too many thes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1974.966s">So</a>  just get rid of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1977.088s">Just</a>  called Mystic School. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1978.669s">It's</a>  my recollection of what was scraped off the building.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1984.269s">And</a>  do we even need the first word that there? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1987.292s">The</a>  school was first built in the location of the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1991.335s">Originally</a>  called Mystic School after the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1993.877s">Could</a>  be a comma. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1995.199s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1995.479s">What</a>  about the school that was first built on Hicks Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=1999.362s">Because</a>  we have the school and the school.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2001.464s">That</a>  works too.</p>

    <p>[Lafleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2002.105s">I</a>  like Hicks Ave.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2004.026s">Was</a>  it always Hicks Ave?</p>

    <p>[Beth Fuller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2007.249s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2008.31s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2012.401s">You're</a>  very good at this editing thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2016.362s">Lifelong</a>  admin.</p>

    <p>[Beth Fuller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2020.863s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2026.265s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2027.185s">Next</a>  slide.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2029.586s">Oops,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2031.787s">There</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2033.627s">If</a>  I may, Lisa just made a comment that Clipperships is two words. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2037.168s">Oh,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2038.809s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2039.129s">Oh,</a>  OK.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2041.536s">No,</a>  I don't think that it is, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2043.558s">I</a>  think it was just an autocorrect.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2046.42s">Yeah,</a>  I think that's it.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2047.681s">I</a>  can double check, but I'm not too sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2050.284s">I</a>  think it's one word, but I'm not sure.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2052.165s">It</a>  does have a red line underneath it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2053.567s">Clippership</a>  drive is one word. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2055.048s">Clippership</a>  is one word.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2056.129s">Oh,</a>  wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2056.77s">Is</a>  it like, should it be capitalized?</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2058.611s">I</a>  was just going to say, is it like a proper noun?</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2061.714s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2062.174s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2064.136s">Someone</a>  else Google.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2065.097s">I</a>  think that's the anomaly of the software. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2067.619s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2070.147s">Someone</a>  make sure I'm not a sailor. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2075.472s">I</a>  won't pretend to know.</p>

    <p>[Beth Fuller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2076.713s">I</a>  think it's lowercase. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2082.638s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2083.378s">Let's</a>  move on.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2093.366s">Point</a>  of information, I think Jim Lister was kicked off the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2096.349s">I'm</a>  told he has no power. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2098.513s">I'm</a>  not sure if we can proceed without the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2100.514s">I</a>  just want to let everybody know.</p>

    <p>[Lafleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2104.296s">Tell</a>  him he can dial in by phone.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2110.66s">Yes,</a>  he did not reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2112.721s">Someone</a>  else did. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2113.801s">Jim,</a>  are you here? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2114.482s">Oh,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Lafleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2116.923s">Hopefully</a>  he remembers that from a couple of meetings we had, right?</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2121.021s">I</a>  know, cause it happened to me and that's what I had to do when he walked me through it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2123.622s">So</a>  hopefully, um, put in the chat, the, uh, the phone number that he can dial in, but he probably can't see the chat.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2132.164s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2134.024s">I</a>  can text him if you'd like.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2135.865s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2136.345s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2139.406s">If</a>  any school committee members are listening, this is not a stall tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2145.767s">Thank</a>  you, Matt.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2151.3s">You</a>  could have voted already.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2153.361s">So</a>  according to Marine Insight website, clippership is two words. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2158.922s">Oh,</a>  man. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2160.203s">Really?</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2161.223s">Every</a>  resource that I attack says two words as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2165.344s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2166.045s">We'll</a>  rename the street and give you credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2169.626s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2170.546s">Are</a>  we all serving on the street renaming committee?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2172.727s">I</a>  want to sign that nomination, Paul.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2178.544s">Point</a>  of information for for Melissa, Jim had contacted you the last time around, with by text message I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2195.219s">know</a>  whether or not you might still have that within your cell phone to actually just get right back to him.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2203.885s">I</a>  tend to delete my text messages, so let me see if I can scroll back. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2207.888s">But</a>  yes, I will try and send that to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2209.669s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure we weren't breaking any rules by continuing without him. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2215.334s">Oh,</a>  you have a quorum, so it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2217.395s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2217.935s">All</a>  right, I'll work on that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2220.777s">All</a>  right, Melissa, I'll leave that up to you then.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2223.74s">No</a>  problem.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2225.287s">I</a>  just asked Lisa to put it in the chat if she's available to have the phone number.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2229.85s">I</a>  would just suggest that we continue with friendly amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2233.713s">And</a>  if a vote has to happen, Jim should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2236.335s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2237.676s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2238.176s">I</a>  second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2239.397s">We</a>  just spent 28 minutes on the one slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2242.899s">So</a>  we've all committed to 6 o'clock ending this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2245.781s">So</a>  just keep that in mind, too.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2247.622s">But</a>  if we're all ever in tributaries come up, we are going to kill it.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2253.393s">I'd</a>  like the school committee to see this.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2255.875s">I</a>  think we should, as much as wordsmithing can be really great, I think this is where we're getting bogged down. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2263.84s">So</a>  let's look for big and rather large things that need to be corrected and kind of stick with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2274.327s">If</a>  we're dealing with particular words, unless they're offensive, let's try and keep moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2284.835s">20</a>  minutes on a slide is a really long time.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2287.958s">I</a>  also would suggest too that our procedure has been the person who writes these has the opportunity to approve friendly amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2295.105s">So</a>  I would consider doing that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2297.467s">And</a>  if we run into a hit a wall, then we have to vote, but I don't know who the author is in this case.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2304.994s">I'll</a>  take this slide just so we can keep moving.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2310.777s">I</a>  just wanted to ask that I think the third bullet was already stated on the slide before.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2316.02s">Oh,</a>  that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2322.023s">Should</a>  we, since this slide is pretty crowded, should we maybe delete, remove, put this full sentence since we just agreed on it onto the next slide and remove it from here?</p>

    <p>[Dan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2332.655s">I</a>  think that's a great idea.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2334.161s">Great</a>  idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2334.764s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2350.155s">While</a>  you're pasting that, I will go over my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2354.176s">Before</a>  Jim had asked us not to edit the slides, I'm just saying I made this edit before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2360.877s">That</a>  last line originally said, acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of Columbus, which we discussed last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2371.939s">I</a>  did remove Columbus from that and I changed the wording to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2376.707s">colonization</a>  and the theft of Native American lands. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2382.371s">Just</a>  after sitting with the feedback from Ron, Paul, and Danny, I kind of came to the same realization that that's not doing any good at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2394.278s">So</a>  I'm good to use the more neutral language there for the sense of healing the rift, moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2404.784s">all</a>  of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2405.504s">So</a>  as long as people are okay with that change.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2408.506s">Thank</a>  you, Brie. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2409.886s">I</a>  like that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2410.686s">I</a>  think it's great, Brie. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2412.547s">This</a>  is Danny.</p>

    <p>[Dan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2413.228s">I</a>  think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2414.488s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2415.428s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2418.39s">So</a>  removing the last bullet point or... No, no, no.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2423.172s">It's</a>  already been changed.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2423.912s">Oh,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2424.232s">We</a>  changed it from... Okay, great.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2427.513s">I</a>  believe Jim is back on.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2429.974s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2431.075s">Yay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2432.135s">I</a>  think this looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2433.336s">I</a>  like the <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2434.586s">acknowledge</a>  all of the different ways the river is used.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2437.768s">I</a>  like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2439.609s">Next</a>  slide, folks.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2443.171s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2448.014s">Can</a>  we, sorry, can we resolve the comments as we go? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2451.296s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2452.757s">So</a>  we, yeah, so we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2455.258s">Cool.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2460.981s">Now</a>  we have other slides, maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2464.324s">reducing</a>  the quotes or editing them just because they're very long. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2469.386s">And</a>  it's a lot for the, you know, to read.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2474.568s">I</a>  think the school committee can handle reading this.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2481.55s">I</a>  don't think the point is to read the quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2483.611s">I</a>  think the point is to just give a visual.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2486.912s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2487.473s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2488.638s">What</a>  I did in my writing is they're just gonna be up there and the speaker notes, which you all got to see is a summary of what's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2495.402s">I</a>  don't think we need to read those either.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2497.863s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2498.763s">I</a>  also like the idea of, these are quotes from people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2502.966s">I</a>  do too. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2504.807s">Passionately.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2506.107s">I</a>  think it's good to include that.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2507.748s">I'm</a>  gonna make this a capital.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2518.51s">I'm</a>  back. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2520.612s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2522.474s">What</a>  page are we on? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2525.978s">I</a>  lost my power. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2528.121s">The</a>  power blinked off here and I lost everything.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2531.044s">Oh</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2531.885s">This</a>  looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2532.565s">Can</a>  we move to the next one?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2536.169s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2537.551s">Everyone</a>  likes this.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2550.034s">I</a>  thought this was, who wrote this? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2551.415s">I</a>  thought this was a nice slide.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2555.739s">I</a>  believe that was me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2557.64s">I</a>  put a lot of, the non-Jean Barry Sutherland, I at least did a lot of the initial starting work to get it going.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2568.129s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2569.91s">Should</a>  this be tied mills for the corn, tobacco, grain, wood, and textile industries?</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2577.228s">I</a>  think we're talking about language like that, but I think that's what also Grace warned us against spending too much time on that.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2583.05s">So,</a>  well, again, if it's school committee, we should probably have, they migrate us.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2588.011s">And</a>  is the, is that last already mentioned on another slide about the poem and the, I don't think so.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2595.073s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2596.854s">We</a>  might take out the word from that next line and it's grammatical.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2604.761s">I</a>  just make a suggestion that everybody can go to their, you know, the grammatical stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2609.945s">We</a>  can just put comments in there and then we can clean it up as Grace had said.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2621.633s">I'm</a>  fine with 12.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2623.715s">It's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2624.816s">Is</a>  it over the river and through the wood or woods?</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2629.181s">I</a>  think it varies on the version and in and out.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2634.343s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2635.224s">Whatever</a>  you decide.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2636.985s">Okay,</a>  moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2638.465s">I</a>  like it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2642.367s">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2647.63s">Anybody</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2648.69s">Okay,</a>  can we go to the next slide?</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2655.593s">We</a>  should probably <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2657.173s">And</a>  again, we can do this after. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2658.714s">I</a>  would just say we should, the font name, but we can change that after.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2666.919s">Did</a>  you say the same font?</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2668.701s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2669.321s">Yeah,</a>  I noticed that on slide 17 too.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2671.542s">Yeah,</a>  but we can do that after, but we can make the font consistent.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2676.766s">Yeah,</a>  there were some font and spacing issues through here, so.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2686.71s">I</a>  think it's true, but it's not plural.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2691.111s">It's</a>  all interesting.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2692.551s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2693.771s">According</a>  to the title of the Thanksgiving poem by Lydia Maria Child, if that's what you're referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2700.833s">And</a>  it's not grandmother's house, it's grandfather's house, the original, but I don't know where I can't really, it's on my phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2707.314s">So</a>  I can't really see. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2710.675s">But</a>  the name of the poems over the river and through the wood, singular.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2717.449s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2719.23s">And</a>  then we switched to grandma.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2724.211s">All</a>  right, any comments?</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2726.072s">I</a>  think we reviewed this one last time, didn't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2728.773s">Because</a>  it used to be before.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2731.934s">And</a>  we know all the stats are accurate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2733.894s">Because</a>  I don't know when she taught where and that sort of stuff.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2738.496s">OK,</a>  we ready to go to the next one? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2742.517s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2743.257s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2744.958s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2755.742s">You</a>  know, if we could just resolve that space issue in the last bullet between the two last bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2761.244s">I</a>  mean, is there a reason why there's a, there you go, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2766.766s">Do</a>  we think that that last bullet point, I kind of feel as if listing things like a loving wife, a caring daughter, friendly neighbor, beloved teacher, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2784.705s">It</a>  feels sort of unnecessary in a presentation regarding her merits as a name for the school specifically in that it feels as though it's more like a list of positive attributes of Jean as opposed to a list of her contributions in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2814.446s">particularly</a>  be a loving wife, a caring daughter, friendly neighbor.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2818.429s">I</a>  have information. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2822.292s">If</a>  you read the speaker notes, you'll see full explanations. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2826.395s">I</a>  have spent, I heard your comments, Maria, and I agree with what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2831.319s">The</a>  substance now, if you read the speaker's notes, talks about a loving wife, an unbelievably friendly neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2839.666s">I</a>  don't think those words are <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2841.827s">used</a>  enough in society, and I'm not changing them unless there's a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2845.088s">So</a>  I think those are good, and I think my speaker notes definitely justify everything was said there, from the children going to the neighborhood, from her husband's notes, both at the city council meeting and in our <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2861.944s">public</a>  information. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2863.305s">So</a>  there's plenty of evidence there, and I would encourage everybody to read the speaker's notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2867.489s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2868.33s">I'm</a>  not saying that she was not a loving wife, a caring daughter, or a friendly neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2873.554s">I</a>  just think that it's not necessary to list those when I feel as though the rest of the bullet points are the evidence that point towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2885.225s">It</a>  just feels <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2888.403s">it</a>  doesn't feel necessary to be listing that here.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2892.305s">I</a>  understand your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2894.826s">I</a>  just, we will disagree on this one and agree to disagree on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2898.908s">If</a>  you want to put it up, I'm not, I wouldn't accept that as a friendly amendment, but if you want to put it to a vote, go right ahead.</p>

    <p>[Dan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2905.931s">I</a>  think it shows her, um, you know, her character, part of her character. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2911.293s">So</a>  I think, um, I think it's a good thing.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2916.169s">I</a>  mean, I think the rest of the bullet points do.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2919.59s">Did</a>  we lose Kristen? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2922.231s">We</a>  might've, we can keep talking.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2924.052s">You</a>  did for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2924.953s">I</a>  think I'm back.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2927.273s">Like</a>  a horror movie here.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2932.015s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2934.376s">So</a>  I think that translates with everything that Ron said, because a number of people who worked with her, such as myself, I know, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2942.598s">But</a>  I think that's the first thing you would say about her, that she's a warm person. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2947.499s">So</a>  I don't know if that would be better, all encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2950.7s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2951.74s">Just</a>  very easy to talk to, very approachable. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2954.441s">A</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2958.877s">The</a>  helper, you know, look for the helpers you'd look for gene.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2962.541s">If</a>  I may, if I may, this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2965.424s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2970.329s">Just</a>  full disclosure guys I am having contractions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2973.713s">Oh,</a>  I am trying to get through this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2976.175s">Oh</a>  my god. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2980.365s">Kind</a>  of speaking chair to Maria would these would those words that I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2988.776s">Oh,</a>  I heard through from a lot of different people who wrote in about gene Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=2997.592s">If</a>  we were to add words about maybe Belinda Sutton, about like strength and perseverance and toss in a few more adjectives that speak to her character, would it feel better about leaving adjectives that mean a lot to people about Jean Barry Sutherland?</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3021.198s">Point</a>  of information, how would we get those characteristics from,</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3026.206s">Belinda</a>  Sutton when we don't have any personal... Well, I think the argument that she wrote her own terms of her own freedom, freed herself, fought for her rights after the things that we do know about her implies a certain level of strength and perseverance.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3045.998s">She</a>  did it all through the system, which was... I don't think we wanna make any assumptions about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3051.401s">I</a>  mean, it's kind of alarming to me that we don't even have any documentation <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3055.39s">that</a>  email that Beth sent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3056.81s">So</a>  I'm already hesitant about what we're including. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3059.331s">Like</a>  we don't even know if this person actually really existed.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3062.171s">Point</a>  of information, Belinda Sutton is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3069.253s">We'll</a>  have a chance to talk about this at that slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3072.653s">Can</a>  we move on to the next slide, Mr. Chairman?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3075.474s">Can</a>  I just ask who's having contractions? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3077.454s">Because</a>  I don't know who's talking.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3079.135s">That's</a>  Brie.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3079.935s">That's</a>  Brie.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3082.07s">Point</a>  of information, Bree, you understand that the child is much more important than this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3090.401s">Yes,</a>  I agree.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3093.204s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. Lister, can I speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3095.827s">So</a>  I understand Maria's feelings about this kind of emotionally overly wrought <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3100.393s">thing</a>  of a person I've never met either, but I'm more questioning, maybe Ron can answer this, can you give me an example of her being an innovator for special education?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3113.284s">And</a>  point of information, first to say emotionally awry, I take offense to. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3117.327s">So</a>  let's try to keep it as not comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3120.589s">Yes,</a>  coming in the next slide, you will understand how exceptional she was with dealing with special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3128.474s">All</a>  that comes in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3130.015s">She</a>  was an advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3131.416s">The</a>  next slides will explain that, Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3134.398s">I</a>  appreciate what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3136.32s">All</a>  this stuff is not, I clarify by saying when I got here, I did not know who Jean Barry Sutherland was. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3143.345s">I</a>  know she was not the favorite choice here, but what I've done, but what I've done is I've reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3149.252s">I've</a>  done my research. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3150.574s">I've</a>  gone back to the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3152.055s">She</a>  were part of I reached out to family friends through Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3156.621s">I'm</a>  very confident in the statements I made and <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3159.944s">You</a>  know, I'm not an emotionally overwrought person. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3163.306s">So</a>  these are statistics that will be backed up and you'll understand the special education above all when I prove, when I show you the information that's coming out.</p>

    <p>[Matt Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3174.733s">Can</a>  I address Ron's comments, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3177.694s">I</a>  apologize for describing these words as emotionally wrought, but they are emotionally more, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3184.718s">Cuddled</a>  in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3186.62s">Passionate</a>  advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3188.061s">Most</a>  special education teacher I know are passionate about it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3190.863s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3191.883s">And</a>  yeah, there should be some real innovation that can be really documented as far as going forward in the Medford public schools, because that's a highly controversial subject, special education.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3207.331s">Matt,</a>  just don't put, I don't wanna be a spoiler alert here, but the information that got me to that was from the assistant director of special education for the Medford Public Schools at the time that Jean Barry Sutherland was principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3220.794s">So</a>  you'll read more about this, but I'm quite confident when I say she was very passionate.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3229.155s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3231.076s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3235.165s">just</a>  building on that, Ron, I understand there's passion, but then there's also innovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3241.928s">So</a>  innovation implies something specifically new. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3245.67s">And</a>  I didn't read through your deck, specifically on, I'm sorry, who else is speaking?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3254.453s">I'm</a>  sorry, this is Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3255.474s">Nobody's</a>  going through the chair, so people are just talking and I don't know who's talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3259.236s">So</a>  it's- This is Seth. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3261.437s">I</a>  understand, but it's not just, it wasn't just you, Seth. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3263.879s">It's</a>  just, I think that Ron, Matt, somebody before Matt, because everyone's jumping in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3269.104s">So</a>  please go to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3270.606s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3271.026s">All</a>  right, go ahead, Seth.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3273.008s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3273.609s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3279.699s">My</a>  question, through the chair for Ron, builds upon what Matt was saying, specifically in the language that is being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3294.833s">And</a>  I can understand passion and advocacy, and those would be <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3302.864s">things</a>  that I would recognize and would expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3307.526s">Innovation</a>  is something specifically different. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3311.208s">And</a>  in reading through, I see examples of passion and advocacy, but I don't necessarily see specific representation of innovation.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3326.775s">And</a>  I would love to- It has no impact on the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3329.757s">Let's</a>  remove and innovator just to move on.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3334.199s">Um,</a>  if I may speak, I this is Maria, by the way, I don't, I take issue with the fact that we're listing these different aspects of genes legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3351.215s">And</a>  Ron, you have repeatedly stated that there's evidence for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3357.12s">Two</a>  points. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3358.522s">First</a>  is that <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3362.38s">The</a>  evidence should serve and stand on its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3366.062s">I</a>  don't think that we need to be listing these things because they are things that become clear through the evidence that you provide, which are Jeanne's actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3378.666s">You</a>  have great things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3381.627s">That's</a>  undeniable, anti-smoking campaigns, dog park advocate, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3387.259s">However,</a>  I think that that is more demonstrative of Jean being a friendly neighbor and beloved teacher than having to list that out, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3402.053s">Second,</a>  I would also say that in order to make these sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3415.05s">not</a>  necessarily generalizations, but very concrete, concrete assumptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3424.839s">That's</a>  not necessarily the word I'm trying to use, but about Jean's character based strictly on anecdotal evidence seems problematic to me.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3442.301s">I</a>  appreciate your opinion, but I couldn't disagree with you more. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3445.565s">This</a>  is what separates Jean Barry Sutherland as a citizen of Medford and a very strong role model. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3454.352s">and</a>  also her impact on the history of the city has yet to be decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3460.013s">And</a>  I understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3462.374s">It's</a>  been clear in all your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3463.974s">I</a>  understand your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3465.835s">I</a>  am not gonna neutralize Jean Barry Sutherland to make her equal to the other two candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3470.796s">This</a>  is part of who she is.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3472.816s">Can</a>  I make a suggestion to the chair that might? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3476.397s">make</a>  more people feel better about this statement is because she was a wife, she was a daughter, she was a neighbor, she was a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3483.323s">Those</a>  are characteristics that do make her valuable for a person to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3487.386s">So</a>  would it sound better or would people feel better or more comfortable, I should say, if we said Jean was a well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader, full stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3499.095s">She</a>  was a passionate advocate and <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3502.251s">I</a>  thought if we just said we were gonna take out innovator for the needs of all the Medford children and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3509.735s">So</a>  you're still stating what her characteristics are. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3512.156s">We're</a>  saying she was well-loved based on all the reading we did about her, because it comes clear when you read the comments that community members have written about Jean repeatedly, many of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3523.201s">That</a>  would just be my suggestion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3525.782s">I</a>  like that.</p>

    <p>[Lafleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3531.223s">All</a>  right, Lee, did you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3533.645s">Yeah,</a>  I like Kathy's suggestion as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3536.447s">And</a>  I just really wanted to remind this group that we're presenting all three of these names. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3542.272s">We're</a>  championing all three of these names for the school committee to make a decision about. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3547.636s">So</a>  we want to sell all of these, I believe, as being the output of our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3553.163s">And</a>  so just looking at the time, we do need to move through this.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3557.787s">We</a>  haven't agreed on the changes that I'm seeing being made here.</p>

    <p>[Lafleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3560.489s">Sorry,</a>  I got excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3562.571s">I</a>  need a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3563.131s">Let's</a>  just have a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3564.112s">We're</a>  not going to change, sorry, Ron, without a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3567.175s">So</a>  if we need to vote, we should just vote and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3570.778s">Or</a>  otherwise, just, I think, move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3573.921s">I</a>  don't want to curtail discussion, but I want to share.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3577.604s">I'm</a>  ready for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3579.085s">I'm</a>  ready for the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3579.946s">I'm</a>  not removing it without a vote.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3582.139s">All</a>  right, I got a few more hands up. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3584.921s">Patrick.</a> </p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3588.304s">Yeah,</a>  I passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3590.266s">I</a>  was going to say the same thing as Lee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3591.787s">I</a>  mean, our job here is not to advocate for one person over another. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3596.091s">We</a>  need to make sure all three candidates that we put forward have an appropriate response.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3603.777s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3605.919s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3607.881s">Laura,</a>  did you have your hand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3611.817s">All</a>  right, that was all. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3613.438s">Okay,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3614.138s">Am</a>  I missing anybody else? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3623.484s">Okay,</a>  so Ron, you want us to vote on it the way it is?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3628.347s">No,</a>  just take it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3629.547s">I</a>  just wanted to be known in public that I am not happy with this change, but in the interest of time and not having anything about Jean Barry Sutherland, I agree to take all those emotional adjectives off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3640.868s">I</a>  want to take that off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3641.748s">I</a>  would put it to a vote.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3643.429s">Yeah,</a>  put it to a vote, Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3644.83s">Put</a>  it to a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3646.371s">I</a>  would leave it the way it is, Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3647.712s">You</a>  work really hard on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3649.192s">I'm</a>  sorry, my name is Paul.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3651.133s">Hi,</a>  this is Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3655.496s">Jim?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3656.336s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3657.237s">Hi,</a>  this is Melissa through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3660.819s">So</a>  as a parent who entrusts her two children to the Medford public school system every day, I think that these attributes are key. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3670.069s">to</a>  explaining or that you'd wanna see in a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3673.17s">I'd</a>  have to say this, in all the years that my children have gone through the Medford school systems, they have not all been loving and caring and advocates for the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3681.973s">So</a>  I think if we're looking to name a school after an educator and such a champion for the children and families of Medford, it's extremely important that this person does hold those qualities and we make sure that we highlight those qualities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3697.208s">So</a>  there's a former principal of the Columbus School who could tell you that I have had many meetings with her about a teacher who was none of these qualities and who had no business being in the Medford school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3709.235s">So</a>  I think if you're speaking about an educator, it's absolutely important that to me, when my children are going to this place five, six, seven hours a day, and I'm entrusting them for the care of my child every day, that they should have these qualities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3724.349s">So</a>  I think it's key that these are on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3726.17s">And</a>  I want to back Ron and his work on this slide.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3729.051s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3729.751s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3730.111s">Let's</a>  just move the vote, please.</p>

    <p>[Melissa Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3731.391s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3732.172s">What</a>  are we voting on?</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3733.792s">Is</a>  this to remove the bullet point or to move the adjectives?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3737.814s">Are</a>  we voting to accept Kathy's suggestion or are we moving to remove the bullet point or to remove the adjectives? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3755.589s">Removing</a>  the adjectives.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3757.731s">Point</a>  of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3758.392s">The</a>  motion is by Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3759.833s">Can</a>  we have Kathy say what her motion is, the amendment to this slide?</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3766.299s">Kathy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3767.12s">Yes,</a>  sure I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3768.841s">My</a>  suggestion was that we write, Jean was a well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3777.691s">and</a>  then you put a period, she was a passionate advocate for special education and the needs of all Medford children and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3786.297s">So</a>  we're still saying she was well-loved, but rather than those other adjectives, we're still leaving her characteristics of being a wife, a daughter, a neighbor, a teacher.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3796.584s">This</a>  is Paul, I second Kathy's comments.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3800.907s">Do</a>  I need to go a roll call? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3802.187s">Is</a>  there anyone that objects to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3803.488s">I</a>  believe Ron does.</p>

    <p>[Kristin Scalisi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3806.889s">I</a>  think they both say nice things about her.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3809.671s">No,</a>  listen, if it says well-loved, that encompasses well-loved daughter, well-loved neighbor, that's fine with me.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3817.978s">Okay,</a>  can we make those changes and we can okay this slide?</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3826.405s">Is</a>  there still a motion to accept or remove that last bullet? <a href="https://youtu.be/j0qza4ZNB3E&t=3832.61s">I'm</a>  just confused.</p>
