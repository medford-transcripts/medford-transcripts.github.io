1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,251
[SPEAKER_15]: committee approval, be it resolved that the chairman select the members who will actually make the presentation to the school committee.

2
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:19,695
[SPEAKER_15]: The chairman determined the presentation teams outline who will speak about which slide the committee assigned members to assist in logistics of the presentation with city hall staff.

3
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:28,017
[SPEAKER_15]: The committee will send a message to the school committee asking for the appropriate time and approve approved length for the presentation.

4
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,321
[SPEAKER_15]: offered by Ron Jovino.

5
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:33,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I get a second on that?

6
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:47,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask just was that about the length of the

7
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:51,809
[SPEAKER_11]: those about the length of the presentation before we present it?

8
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,571
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not about the length.

9
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:01,933
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a kite before the horse, because once we have approved the presentation, hopefully today,

10
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:20,098
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to figure out how we're presenting it in front of, you know, the logistics, who's talking, who's, you know, who do we have to coordinate the slides with, how the presentation, it's just basic stuff that we just, I don't wanna walk away today without having, you know, an idea of who's talking and who's doing what.

11
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:24,561
[SPEAKER_19]: I think once we approve, no words can be changed, but just who wants to do it.

12
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:26,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, but then do we know how long we have?

13
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:31,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they're like, you have 30 seconds, which- They mentioned last night, 30 minutes.

14
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:34,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, OK.

15
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,815
[SPEAKER_19]: They were warned 30 minutes.

16
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,436
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't believe us, but we have plenty of time.

17
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,476
[SPEAKER_19]: It won't be 30 minutes.

18
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:42,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I think 30 minutes is fine, as long as they don't go crazy with questions.

19
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:44,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's up to them, right?

20
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:44,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

21
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:46,178
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

22
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:47,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Lister, this is Matt.

23
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:47,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

24
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought we kind of semi-determined this.

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you, Mr. Lister, were going to kind of lead the charge, and then the people who wrote their sections were going to present.

26
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:57,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of order.

27
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:59,783
[SPEAKER_20]: We need a second before we continue discussion.

28
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,731
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll second the motion.

29
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:04,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

30
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:07,273
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

31
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:09,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Is my question valid then, Mr. McCabe?

32
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought we talked about Mr. Lister being the lead presenter, and then people were doing their sections.

33
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:18,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's what Ron is getting to.

34
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,701
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

35
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:23,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe.

36
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:25,422
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's an assumption.

37
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:26,803
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we've actually decided.

38
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:35,424
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, my resolution is more about anybody who wants to be involved should at least be able to volunteer and Jim can make that decision.

39
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:48,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that we had spoken about possibly the chair presenting the process portion and then having

40
00:02:49,989 --> 00:03:02,351
[SPEAKER_10]: those who volunteered to speak and voted for the names to speak, but I'm not certain how applicable that would be now.

41
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:17,574
[SPEAKER_19]: Just through the chair, I mean, my resolution is a basic logistic one so that we have in writing who's doing what, how do we get the slides up with the city hall meeting, just those things.

42
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:18,754
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't, it's not about

43
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:26,230
[SPEAKER_19]: anything more than I just want to, I know we've talked about it, but we haven't really decided who the ones that will be talking are.

44
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,576
[SPEAKER_19]: So, and this is all after there was a presentation approved.

45
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:36,665
[SPEAKER_19]: So this, if we approve it just means we're going to talk about it after the presentation is voted on.

46
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:46,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. sure if I could speak on it as well just through the chair thank Ron for putting out the logistics I think it's very important to get those on paper.

47
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:53,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with most of almost all of this the only change I would suggest, perhaps as a friendly amendment is that.

48
00:03:54,551 --> 00:04:10,764
[SPEAKER_09]: people volunteer we've done everything on a volunteer basis now so if people are interested in presenting that they volunteer and that there's more than one volunteer that we just put it to a simple vote, since we've all sort of gotten to know each other so well and work together so so well on this committee.

49
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:12,926
[SPEAKER_19]: I would accept that.

50
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:28,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to clarify with that friendly amendment, that would mean that people would volunteer.

51
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:40,269
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if there's more than one person volunteering for the same section, there would be a simple vote of the whole committee as to who would be the person to present.

52
00:04:43,237 --> 00:05:01,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I do think that we have a chairman and that chairman should drive this whole process, but let's hope that we don't run into... People who are passionate about a slide should be able to say, I'm passionate about a slide and we move forward.

53
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,221
[SPEAKER_19]: It shouldn't be anything but that.

54
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:05,742
[SPEAKER_19]: But yes, I agree, volunteers are the way to go.

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just saying, you know, to put into a vote to sort of continue this collaborative process with no disrespect to the chair, his ability to make a decision.

56
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:31,729
[SPEAKER_19]: You're muted, Jim.

57
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:35,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't work that way, huh?

58
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:36,338
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

59
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Myself, I like, I've talked to Ron about doing part of the presentation.

60
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,021
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that Dr. Caldara, we've talked about her doing her rubric.

61
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,562
[SPEAKER_15]: So those would be two people that I would like to do most of the presentation.

62
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:55,064
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if anybody wants to volunteer to participate, we can find a place for them.

63
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:56,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay?

64
00:05:58,685 --> 00:05:59,325
[SPEAKER_15]: We good with that?

65
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:02,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Patrick has his hand up.

66
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:04,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Patrick, go ahead.

67
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:13,330
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the concern that I have is just get the cart before the horse a little bit here with the first whereas.

68
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,612
[SPEAKER_20]: The whereas says we've already agreed on the presentation, which we haven't, so.

69
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:19,834
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't because we keep stalling, I guess.

70
00:06:19,894 --> 00:06:21,014
[SPEAKER_15]: We're too slow with that.

71
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:29,600
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can't, I don't think that we can vote on an amendment saying we've agreed to the presentation when we haven't, so.

72
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:34,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to make a motion to accept the presentation

73
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:36,947
[SPEAKER_04]: except supply to anyone.

74
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:42,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second so we can get this over with and then we can finish what we need to do.

75
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Lister, I just have to say I am not in a hurry.

76
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:53,376
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the fact that you're, you're describing how we're working together on each slide and stalling.

77
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I don't feel that way at all.

78
00:06:54,916 --> 00:07:00,859
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to make sure I watched the school committee last night and I was, we were criticized for taking so long.

79
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,

80
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:05,354
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to obstruct this, I guess.

81
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:08,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're doing good due diligence.

82
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

83
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:15,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I think voting on it right now to just pass it all, I wouldn't mind reviewing the last couple of slides that we haven't really looked at.

84
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,443
[SPEAKER_05]: There's enough.

85
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:18,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I've looked at it independently.

86
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:25,089
[SPEAKER_19]: I move to table my resolution and get to Patrick's resolution.

87
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,130
[SPEAKER_19]: That's important, too.

88
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,492
[SPEAKER_20]: I can second that motion to the table.

89
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:29,653
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

90
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:31,274
[SPEAKER_15]: The second resolution.

91
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:51,891
[SPEAKER_15]: If the committee is unable to agree upon a full presentation by 530, the committee's presentation will include pages one through eight of the presentation, which we reviewed last week and a nine slide with the three names proposed and nothing else offered by Patrick McCabe.

92
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:57,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I get a second on that?

93
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,637
[SPEAKER_15]: I second.

94
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:05,080
[SPEAKER_01]: A point of information, if we're not in a rush to push this through, then what's the point of this resolution?

95
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:15,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Havestro just said that he had no intentions of rushing this through, but it seems like if we're just going to vote at 530, regardless on the slides, we're kind of being contradictory.

96
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:16,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

97
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:21,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's because we all feel like the presentation is done.

98
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,871
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, we haven't actually formally reviewed it together.

99
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:28,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I would like to do that.

100
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:42,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Curt Brown, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- John Gerstle, COB OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Dave Kuntz, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown, OSBT- Curt Brown,

101
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:47,307
[SPEAKER_04]: just everybody has a chance to look at it this weekend, right Mr. Chair?

102
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,289
[SPEAKER_15]: We should be able to get this done in an hour and 15 minutes.

103
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:58,774
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, I mean, you know, the mayor had said we could have another meeting this week if we had to, not that I want to, I would, I'd like to wrap it up tonight.

104
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:00,716
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the presentation looks great.

105
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:02,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information.

106
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:05,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I would like to just offer a friendly amendment.

107
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:13,019
[SPEAKER_19]: Patrick's, uh, you know, it looks like we are we maybe Dr Cushing knows, but it looks like the next event here is 6 30.

108
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:21,305
[SPEAKER_19]: I would hate to think we lock ourselves into 5 30 and have one slide left and we have to scrap the whole thing.

109
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:25,128
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, I'm just offering a friendly.

110
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:28,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we go to, um, 6 15 to make it, uh,

111
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:33,733
[SPEAKER_19]: more palatable, but we need to move the vote or else we're going to waste more time here.

112
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:40,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry to interrupt, but this Zoom channel is wide open this evening.

113
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

114
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:53,923
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'll be doing double duty at seven o'clock for the National Junior Honor Society at the McGlynn, but this, we do not have the issue that we had last week.

115
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,065
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also wanna say, I apologize for having to cut everybody off.

116
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:02,248
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the budget hearing for our $68.2 million budget for next year.

117
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:05,590
[SPEAKER_16]: So I apologize for anyone that was cut off.

118
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:07,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

119
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim, Jim, do you have a question?

120
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so this is Danny.

121
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:22,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So you, you said, you know, the information out over the weekend, uh, you know, I know I reviewed it and I'm sure some of the other folks reviewed it.

122
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:30,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's just a simple of question of, you know, you asking, was there anyone that wanted to change on something?

123
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there was, then we proceed and go through it.

124
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:37,786
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there was no one that had a specific change, then why can't we just move it along?

125
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:42,043
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well, first, I agree, but first we have Patrick's motion.

126
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:49,266
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to continue on with this, we got to vote it up or down, and then we can continue on and get into the slides, hopefully.

127
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:53,607
[SPEAKER_15]: And if anybody has a slide that they want to pick out, we can work on it.

128
00:10:55,107 --> 00:11:06,211
[SPEAKER_20]: To Ron's question of the friendly amendment, Ron, my concern is, you know, if we're saying 615, then we have to vote on your

129
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,819
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, your amendment as well.

130
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:17,023
[SPEAKER_20]: So, um, if you're, you know, if you're agreeable to six o'clock, I'll, I'll accept that as a friendly amendment instead of five 30.

131
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:17,383
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

132
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:20,264
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to move the question.

133
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:21,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that's fine.

134
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:23,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

135
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Weren't we just told that we didn't have any time restraints tonight?

136
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:27,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

137
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:34,892
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a yes or no vote on whether we, uh, ended at hard at six o'clock.

138
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:35,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

139
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, it's a yes or no vote whether we end at six o'clock.

140
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Not in the meeting, but at six o'clock.

141
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:43,175
[SPEAKER_15]: And the deliberation.

142
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:46,556
[SPEAKER_20]: And the deliberation on the slides.

143
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:47,457
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

144
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:52,700
[SPEAKER_19]: But let me just be clear that it ends the slide and it also cuts out the information.

145
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,601
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what we're voting on.

146
00:11:55,301 --> 00:12:00,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, but there's still a discussion about who presents the first eight slides and the ninth slide.

147
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I agree.

148
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:02,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

149
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:04,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

150
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:07,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Bri, yes or no?

151
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:09,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

152
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan?

153
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:15,760
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

154
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:17,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Erin?

155
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:20,043
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

156
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:22,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Beth?

157
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:29,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Beth, do you hear?

158
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:32,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

159
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,271
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, yes.

160
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:39,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Grace?

161
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:40,490
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

162
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:43,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Ken Mallon?

163
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:44,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

164
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:48,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Kristen Scalise?

165
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:49,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

166
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:52,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Laura Rotolo?

167
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:53,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

168
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Lee?

169
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:58,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

170
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:01,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Lewin Tapa?

171
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:07,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

172
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:09,415
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, he's on now.

173
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:10,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Yup.

174
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:11,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Maria Rosha.

175
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:12,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

176
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:14,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Melissa Miguel.

177
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:16,838
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

178
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Patrick McCabe.

179
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:19,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

180
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul Donato.

181
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:23,201
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

182
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Ron Giovino.

183
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:26,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

184
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:29,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Seth Hill.

185
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:30,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

186
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:33,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Kathy Kay.

187
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:33,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

188
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:36,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Matt Haberstraw.

189
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:37,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

190
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:42,882
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll call him Mackenzie.

191
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:43,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

192
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:46,646
[SPEAKER_15]: It was before.

193
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:47,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

194
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:49,910
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jim Lister.

195
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,510
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

196
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:13,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, 15 in the affirmative and six in the negative.

197
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:18,589
[SPEAKER_15]: So we ended at six, one way or the other, okay?

198
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:27,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Mr. Chairman, may I make a motion to have the presentation the way it is so we don't delay anymore.

199
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:34,167
[SPEAKER_04]: We can discuss whatever you'd like to discuss afterwards, but we can accept the presentation as it is.

200
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:40,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So this way there's no argument or no discussion about eight slides, nine slides.

201
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 20 slides minus the 21, slide 21, and then just...

202
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,013
[SPEAKER_04]: then we can nitpick through every slide afterwards.

203
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:52,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I get a second on that?

204
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:55,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I object to this, Mr. Rustin.

205
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:57,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let's get a second.

206
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,398
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're going to discuss it, we need a second.

207
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:03,300
[SPEAKER_15]: If we don't get a second, we won't go any further.

208
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I ask a point of information?

209
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:05,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

210
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:10,464
[SPEAKER_12]: When I looked at the slides, there were 27 slides, and I'm hearing a number of 21.

211
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,478
[SPEAKER_12]: When I looked at it, did things change?

212
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:16,679
[SPEAKER_12]: How many slides are there that we're talking about right now?

213
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:27,323
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, those slides after slide 21 were left there as part of the discussion from the editing issue that we had, which is no longer.

214
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:34,146
[SPEAKER_19]: So those, if everybody agrees, those are invalid slides and those were just there for, so it's 21 slides right now.

215
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:37,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that's what I wanted to know, because some of the information was repeated.

216
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, those additional ones about- I wanna know how many I'm voting on.

217
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:44,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Those additional slides about Jean Barry Sutherland are deleted.

218
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:46,254
[SPEAKER_19]: The end.

219
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So my motion was seconded, Mr. Chairman.

220
00:15:51,356 --> 00:16:03,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now- We can discuss the slides, but let's just approve the entire process, and then we can go through slide by slide if you'd like, but at least we know that the 20 slides have been approved.

221
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:11,415
[SPEAKER_07]: How can we approve the 20 slides without, I know that we were specifically asked not to edit, but to make comments.

222
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:16,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I made a couple and I would, I'm assuming people left comments that we should read.

223
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:19,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So now's the time.

224
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:21,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

225
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought we would start where we left off last week.

226
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,406
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not that much more to do.

227
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:29,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It will take us longer.

228
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,029
[SPEAKER_15]: We're interested in saving time.

229
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:40,376
[SPEAKER_15]: I sent it out to all of you so you could look at each slide, make your own notes, and then while we're here right now, we'll discuss what certain slide you want to discuss.

230
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:44,158
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's a slide that no one has a problem with, we don't even need to look at it.

231
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:45,039
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll accept it.

232
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:52,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the school committee meeting last night, Mr. Chairman, and I was, you know, disappointed that they said that we were trying to stall the process.

233
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:58,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, right now is a motion on the floor, not to stall the process any longer.

234
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:02,903
[SPEAKER_04]: We can discuss like Brie said, individual slides or individual comments.

235
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:07,225
[SPEAKER_04]: but at least we can agree on the 20 slides to go forward.

236
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we don't have to worry about a six o'clock deadline.

237
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:13,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to worry about anything because the 20 slides have been approved.

238
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that's just watching things.

239
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to begin where we left off.

240
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:20,832
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us have notes for different slides.

241
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:21,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any reason.

242
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:25,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your report from the school committee.

243
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't watch the school committee.

244
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:28,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not delaying any process.

245
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you are either, Mr. Donato.

246
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we should just review the slides where we left off.

247
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,320
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not that much more to go.

248
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I've reviewed it, but I think people want to discuss it.

249
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:38,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of order.

250
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:58,878
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to just count through 20 slides, 21 slides, I'm like, you know, I printed what was sent by the chair, I have 30 something slides, I recognize that some of them were what were added at the end that weren't for Ron.

251
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,939
[SPEAKER_03]: But my last slide that says thank you,

252
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,630
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 27, I believe.

253
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still trying to count.

254
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:12,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that we need to go through specifically slide by slide.

255
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,878
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have 20 slides, 18 slides, 21 slides, whatever it is.

256
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:21,821
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no other way in which to do it other than just doing it step by step.

257
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:28,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want the school committee to think that we're stalling the process because I think that we amazingly- This process is our own.

258
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:29,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to interrupt.

259
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:33,848
[SPEAKER_15]: We are, we have a motion.

260
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:35,529
[SPEAKER_15]: So you'd vote no on the motion then.

261
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:38,930
[SPEAKER_15]: So don't want to just take the whole thing.

262
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:47,052
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a point of order that that motion can't stand as is because we don't actually know what the motion is.

263
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: What 20 slides are we actually talking about?

264
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:54,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Which specific 20 slides is the motion?

265
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:56,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul, would you like to repeat your motion?

266
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:01,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there are 22 slides.

267
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:06,550
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to say because the thank you, after you look, the thank you would be slide number 22.

268
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,931
[SPEAKER_07]: The thank you is slide 20.

269
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:11,833
[SPEAKER_07]: It is 22, sorry.

270
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:12,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

271
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:14,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Slide 22 says thank you.

272
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,855
[SPEAKER_04]: The one prior to it is 21.

273
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:23,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just asking that if we could delete slide 21 off the whole process,

274
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:31,632
[SPEAKER_04]: and keep those other slides, which are 20 slides, with the thank you, end with the thank you.

275
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remove slide 21, that's all I'm saying.

276
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:42,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could say, yes, and now you wanna individually, like Matt, and I agree with you, Matt, we can go through each individual slide.

277
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:49,839
[SPEAKER_04]: But in case we go past 6.15 or six o'clock, at least we know that these 20 slides are approved.

278
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:54,270
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've all looked at and we've had all weekend to look at them.

279
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,232
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee thinks that we're stalling the process.

280
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:58,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want that.

281
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:06,619
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done such an amazing job on this presentation and it should be seen in its entirety.

282
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:11,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't wanna see just eight slides be presented to the school committee.

283
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:14,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that these 20 slides should be approved.

284
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,466
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my opinion.

285
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information to the motion maker.

286
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:24,657
[SPEAKER_19]: Paul, I hear you, I listened to that stuff last night as well.

287
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:45,168
[SPEAKER_19]: I think what I would ask you to do is table it, and at any point between now and our deliberations till 5.59, I think that's a valid proposal, but it sounds like just the feel of the room says we need to go through these, even though we've all committed to six o'clock, I hope we do it with great speed.

288
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,870
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm just asking to consider it, you don't need to.

289
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:57,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure Mr. Lister who shared her screen before and was making corrections and what slide we are stopped off.

290
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was nine or 10 or something like that.

291
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:02,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And since a lot of us have looked at already, I think it's just going to go a lot faster.

292
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:05,479
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time many of us didn't even see what was there.

293
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:13,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me just, we can get done while you want to withdraw your motion.

294
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:17,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll cable it until five 45, Mr. Chairman.

295
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:18,362
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

296
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:19,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

297
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:20,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

298
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:26,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, all right, the last time we were here, who put it up on the screen for us?

299
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I did, Kristen.

300
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:30,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you put it up again for us, Kristen, please?

301
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:31,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

302
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,836
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe we were at page eight.

303
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:46,044
[SPEAKER_11]: We had just moved the former slide up to eight, and then we went with, we are back on nine, but we went with Melissa.

304
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,427
[SPEAKER_11]: good to put it in the different alphabetical order.

305
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,929
[SPEAKER_11]: So now slide nine starts with Missituk.

306
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:55,911
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will run back into Belinda.

307
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,573
[SPEAKER_11]: We can go through that quickly.

308
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is Kathy Kay.

309
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:07,681
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have a small amendment that I think we need to make to slide number four, because it talked about the number of meetings and the dates that we had, and we've now had one more meeting.

310
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:08,882
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would need to be updated.

311
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:12,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Can everyone see my screen?

312
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:13,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

313
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:14,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

314
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:17,988
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see I made that comment as well.

315
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:22,031
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we're on the same page that we just need to add this last meeting, hopefully.

316
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so just change this to eighth.

317
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,356
[SPEAKER_09]: And have we met six times now.

318
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:29,797
[SPEAKER_09]: This is our sixth.

319
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:31,418
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so.

320
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,362
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing I wanted to say, too, is we don't have our names anywhere in this.

321
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe that's by design.

322
00:22:42,623 --> 00:22:44,204
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think our names should be.

323
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,485
[SPEAKER_15]: First slide.

324
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:47,025
[SPEAKER_15]: First one.

325
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:49,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it?

326
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,707
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember seeing it when I looked it over.

327
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:51,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

328
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:54,609
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

329
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:55,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize.

330
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:58,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

331
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:01,392
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so.

332
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:04,425
[SPEAKER_11]: that we took care of.

333
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,006
[SPEAKER_11]: We switched the order.

334
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:07,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me on that one.

335
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:08,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Back up on that one.

336
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,669
[SPEAKER_15]: We took out additional recommendations.

337
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:12,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

338
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:12,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Bottom line.

339
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Did we?

340
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:14,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

341
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:16,672
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in the minutes of the last minute.

342
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:17,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we did.

343
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:23,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, my cursor is having weird issues.

344
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:28,038
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing a great job, Kristen.

345
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:28,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

346
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,940
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just running a lot of apps right now.

347
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,481
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how

348
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:35,533
[SPEAKER_11]: My computer wants to keep up, but we'll see.

349
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,056
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we did edit this bullet.

350
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

351
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:43,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

352
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:45,998
[SPEAKER_11]: We did not change.

353
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:47,599
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're on.

354
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:48,079
[SPEAKER_11]: We agreed.

355
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

356
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,741
[SPEAKER_11]: So now nine is the new first slide for MESA talk.

357
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:53,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

358
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:54,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause we switched the order.

359
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:56,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see if I can make this.

360
00:23:58,724 --> 00:23:58,885
Nope.

361
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:01,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone have any problems with this slide?

362
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:24,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a comment, not a problem, just I added a suggestion for, I think, a first sentence which I took out of that book that's called the, by Michael M. Coates, I think it's called Our Medford, just to give a little context and the line would read, the first known people on the land, now called Medford, were members of the Pawtucket tribe.

363
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,384
[SPEAKER_09]: That was not, the Pawtucket tribe was not mentioned anywhere, so I thought that would give good context.

364
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So you want to say the Massachusetts and Pawtucket tribes?

365
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:50,306
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding, please, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, is that the Massachusetts tribe encompasses many other tribes, including the Pawtucket.

366
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:55,048
[SPEAKER_09]: When I looked at the website of the Massachusetts tribe, it looks like the Pawtucket was in there.

367
00:24:55,689 --> 00:25:04,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And looking at this book by Mr. Coates, it looks like the 30 or 40 Native Americans who lived here were part of the Pawtucket tribe.

368
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:05,766
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

369
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:07,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody please correct me.

370
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin has her hand up and she might know.

371
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:12,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Erin.

372
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,631
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually had a comment on a previous slide.

373
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:30,076
[SPEAKER_21]: First, or maybe at another point, but I was curious about the process for the children's input and whether that was something we were going to add.

374
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,757
[SPEAKER_21]: But as to this question,

375
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:45,965
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that, yes, the Pawtucket peoples encompassed many different tribes.

376
00:25:46,146 --> 00:26:00,813
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, because it's a river, it's also a place where many other tribes had territory as well, because of the river route.

377
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,515
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know if you want to put that in there too.

378
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:10,146
[SPEAKER_21]: how that might be put into the slide.

379
00:26:11,627 --> 00:26:16,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't trace the naming of the river to any one particular tribe.

380
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:22,137
[SPEAKER_09]: In all the places where it talked about it being named, it just talks about it being named by the native peoples who lived here.

381
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Because like you said, the river spans many communities and many tribes at the time, right?

382
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:43,637
[SPEAKER_19]: point of information, my research shows that Medford was purchased from the wife of the chief of the Pawtuckets, so I think it's valid to put Pawtucket in there.

383
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:55,567
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you could probably put both, just to be sure.

384
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:01,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just typing, I have no knowledge

385
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:08,854
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Massachusetts is the Massachusetts tribe does not have an S at the end.

386
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:28,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Another point is in that last slide, it says the location of our school.

387
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:35,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we change that to of the Hicks Ave School?

388
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:46,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that using our is a bit confusing, although it is a presentation about renaming this school, but just the pronoun our seems odd.

389
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, which slide?

390
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:51,931
[SPEAKER_11]: The previous one to this?

391
00:27:52,812 --> 00:27:59,735
[SPEAKER_10]: No, on this, on the first Missituk, on that last bullet point where it says the location of our school,

392
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I guess it does seem a little strange since we all didn't go to elementary school there.

393
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:09,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe just put the?

394
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, take out the word our and put in the word the.

395
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,674
[SPEAKER_11]: You can call it Kathy K's school.

396
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:22,658
[SPEAKER_13]: She's responsible.

397
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:43,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Another point in the bullet point saying colonists moved here because of the river and built great ships.

398
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:46,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we remove the word great?

399
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:50,288
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just a personal thing for me.

400
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:56,390
[SPEAKER_10]: It just seems like an unnecessary adjective there.

401
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:01,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless that's a quote.

402
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:04,277
[SPEAKER_17]: by the way.

403
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,058
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

404
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:14,759
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, it, it feels like the, in the context, but it would be fine to keep as well.

405
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:17,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm okay.

406
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,500
[SPEAKER_12]: If that word is removed as well, because it does put value.

407
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:28,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, our ships were valued over the world and how fast they moved.

408
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:29,442
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have no problem with great.

409
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:47,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I would actually prefer, maybe I have less of a problem with the word great than I do with essential, considering the type of trade that was happening at the time.

410
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,421
[SPEAKER_07]: What if we just said clipper ships?

411
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:53,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Sailing ships?

412
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:54,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what they built?

413
00:29:56,018 --> 00:29:58,760
[SPEAKER_08]: We were a very famous method for building clipper ships.

414
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:04,565
[SPEAKER_08]: They were able to go to China to get spices and silk.

415
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:12,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And so anyway, Magoon was a big ship builder, for example.

416
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:16,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone who grew up on Magoon Ave?

417
00:30:16,574 --> 00:30:23,199
[SPEAKER_05]: You could say great clipper ships that were renowned around the world.

418
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:25,708
[SPEAKER_12]: or renowned ships.

419
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, renowned ships around the world.

420
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And never get rid of essentials trade.

421
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,613
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can say used for trade around the world and take out the word essential as well.

422
00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:34,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

423
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:39,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So built great clipper ships that were renowned around the world.

424
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you have a better example, I'm not sure.

425
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,773
[SPEAKER_21]: And they were also used for the triangle trade too, so I think.

426
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, that's the.

427
00:30:52,614 --> 00:31:00,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Like maybe not saying that it was, I agree, maybe not placing that value on it because it doesn't have the same value for everybody.

428
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:07,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine.

429
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:08,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I missed something.

430
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I did use the word renowned, but I'm okay with this sentence the way it is if it sounds.

431
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:14,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Renowned clipper ships?

432
00:31:16,102 --> 00:31:16,402
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

433
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:20,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Great keeps it on two lines, and doesn't force it down to three.

434
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:21,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fine.

435
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:23,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It could just be clipper ships.

436
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:25,297
[SPEAKER_11]: It could just be clipper ships.

437
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:26,878
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be just clipper ships.

438
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:28,738
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fine with any version of this, by the way.

439
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure some people think it's great.

440
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Our ships were great.

441
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,240
[SPEAKER_11]: We know our ships were great.

442
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:36,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we just all call them?

443
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the school committee.

444
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows our ships were great.

445
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:52,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah I believe that we shouldn't be placing on not necessarily undue but controversial or subjective value on these.

446
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:08,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Although great ships is also a category of ship not necessarily referring to fine building but I think a great ship is a like a class of

447
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's true.

448
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:17,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I think great ship actually refers to the class of ship it was.

449
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:21,696
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think if we're saying clipper ship, shouldn't that be enough?

450
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:23,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

451
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:28,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I also think it's less likely to be misinterpreted as putting value.

452
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:31,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this sentence is fine.

453
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can, personally, I think we can move on.

454
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,440
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is just me and our teacher.

455
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:44,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Correction, and that is on the last bullet point.

456
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:50,843
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the school name was Mystic School and not The Mystic School.

457
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,705
[SPEAKER_13]: There's too many thes.

458
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:56,067
[SPEAKER_13]: So just get rid of that.

459
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Just called Mystic School.

460
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:02,192
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my recollection of what was scraped off the building.

461
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:07,232
[SPEAKER_12]: And do we even need the first word that there?

462
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:10,034
[SPEAKER_12]: The school was first built in the location of the school?

463
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:13,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Originally called Mystic School after the river.

464
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:14,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Could be a comma.

465
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:15,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

466
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:18,321
[SPEAKER_11]: What about the school that was first built on Hicks Ave?

467
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have the school and the school.

468
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:22,085
[SPEAKER_12]: That works too.

469
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Hicks Ave.

470
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:24,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it always Hicks Ave?

471
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:27,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

472
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,450
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

473
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:33,841
[SPEAKER_11]: You're very good at this editing thing.

474
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:37,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Lifelong admin.

475
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:41,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

476
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:46,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide.

477
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:47,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide.

478
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:51,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops, sorry.

479
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:53,407
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

480
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:56,448
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may, Lisa just made a comment that Clipperships is two words.

481
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:57,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, thank you.

482
00:33:58,809 --> 00:33:59,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

483
00:33:59,129 --> 00:33:59,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.

484
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,498
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think that it is, Kathy.

485
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:05,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was just an autocorrect.

486
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think that's it.

487
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:10,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I can double check, but I'm not too sure.

488
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,725
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's one word, but I'm not sure.

489
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:13,547
[SPEAKER_12]: It does have a red line underneath it.

490
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:14,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Clippership drive is one word.

491
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:16,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Clippership is one word.

492
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:16,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wait a minute.

493
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it like, should it be capitalized?

494
00:34:18,611 --> 00:34:21,474
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say, is it like a proper noun?

495
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:22,154
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

496
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:24,056
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

497
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:25,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone else Google.

498
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the anomaly of the software.

499
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:27,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

500
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:32,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone make sure I'm not a sailor.

501
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:36,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't pretend to know.

502
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:42,497
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's lowercase.

503
00:34:42,638 --> 00:34:43,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

504
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:53,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's move on.

505
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:56,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information, I think Jim Lister was kicked off the meeting.

506
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:57,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm told he has no power.

507
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if we can proceed without the chair.

508
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:04,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to let everybody know.

509
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:09,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell him he can dial in by phone.

510
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he did not reach out to me.

511
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:13,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else did.

512
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:14,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim, are you here?

513
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:15,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

514
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:20,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully he remembers that from a couple of meetings we had, right?

515
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:23,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, cause it happened to me and that's what I had to do when he walked me through it.

516
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:32,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully, um, put in the chat, the, uh, the phone number that he can dial in, but he probably can't see the chat.

517
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:32,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

518
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:35,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I can text him if you'd like.

519
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:36,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

520
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:36,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

521
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:42,786
[SPEAKER_05]: If any school committee members are listening, this is not a stall tactic.

522
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,107
Thank you, Matt.

523
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:46,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Matt.

524
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,921
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have voted already.

525
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:58,262
[SPEAKER_20]: So according to Marine Insight website, clippership is two words.

526
00:35:58,922 --> 00:35:59,483
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, man.

527
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:00,803
[SPEAKER_20]: Really?

528
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:04,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Every resource that I attack says two words as well.

529
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:05,925
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

530
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:09,005
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll rename the street and give you credit.

531
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

532
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we all serving on the street renaming committee?

533
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:17,028
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to sign that nomination, Paul.

534
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:32,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information for for Melissa, Jim had contacted you the last time around, with by text message I believe.

535
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:42,885
[SPEAKER_03]: know whether or not you might still have that within your cell phone to actually just get right back to him.

536
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:47,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to delete my text messages, so let me see if I can scroll back.

537
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:49,629
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I will try and send that to him.

538
00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:53,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure we weren't breaking any rules by continuing without him.

539
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:56,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you have a quorum, so it's fine.

540
00:36:57,395 --> 00:36:57,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

541
00:36:57,935 --> 00:36:58,956
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'll work on that.

542
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:02,238
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Melissa, I'll leave that up to you then.

543
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,200
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

544
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:09,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I just asked Lisa to put it in the chat if she's available to have the phone number.

545
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,112
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just suggest that we continue with friendly amendments.

546
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:15,754
[SPEAKER_19]: And if a vote has to happen, Jim should be here.

547
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:16,855
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

548
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:18,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

549
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:19,097
[SPEAKER_19]: I second that.

550
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:22,839
[SPEAKER_19]: We just spent 28 minutes on the one slide.

551
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:25,721
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've all committed to 6 o'clock ending this.

552
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:27,042
[SPEAKER_19]: So just keep that in mind, too.

553
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:31,365
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we're all ever in tributaries come up, we are going to kill it.

554
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:35,014
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like the school committee to see this.

555
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:43,300
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should, as much as wordsmithing can be really great, I think this is where we're getting bogged down.

556
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:53,647
[SPEAKER_22]: So let's look for big and rather large things that need to be corrected and kind of stick with that.

557
00:37:54,327 --> 00:38:01,632
[SPEAKER_22]: If we're dealing with particular words, unless they're offensive, let's try and keep moving forward.

558
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:07,537
[SPEAKER_22]: 20 minutes on a slide is a really long time.

559
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:14,464
[SPEAKER_19]: I also would suggest too that our procedure has been the person who writes these has the opportunity to approve friendly amendments.

560
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:17,427
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would consider doing that again.

561
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:23,514
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we run into a hit a wall, then we have to vote, but I don't know who the author is in this case.

562
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:28,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take this slide just so we can keep moving.

563
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:36,000
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to ask that I think the third bullet was already stated on the slide before.

564
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's true.

565
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:51,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we, since this slide is pretty crowded, should we maybe delete, remove, put this full sentence since we just agreed on it onto the next slide and remove it from here?

566
00:38:52,655 --> 00:38:54,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great idea.

567
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:54,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Great idea.

568
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:55,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

569
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:12,616
[SPEAKER_07]: While you're pasting that, I will go over my comment.

570
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:19,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Before Jim had asked us not to edit the slides, I'm just saying I made this edit before that.

571
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:30,379
[SPEAKER_07]: That last line originally said, acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of Columbus, which we discussed last week.

572
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:35,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I did remove Columbus from that and I changed the wording to say,

573
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,890
[SPEAKER_07]: colonization and the theft of Native American lands.

574
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:53,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Just after sitting with the feedback from Ron, Paul, and Danny, I kind of came to the same realization that that's not doing any good at this point.

575
00:39:54,278 --> 00:40:03,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm good to use the more neutral language there for the sense of healing the rift, moving forward.

576
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:05,224
[SPEAKER_07]: all of that.

577
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,825
[SPEAKER_07]: So as long as people are okay with that change.

578
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Brie.

579
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:10,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that change.

580
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great, Brie.

581
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:13,167
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Danny.

582
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:14,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great.

583
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:14,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

584
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:16,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

585
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:23,052
[SPEAKER_11]: So removing the last bullet point or... No, no, no.

586
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:23,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already been changed.

587
00:40:23,912 --> 00:40:24,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, right.

588
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:26,433
[SPEAKER_11]: We changed it from... Okay, great.

589
00:40:27,513 --> 00:40:29,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Jim is back on.

590
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:30,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

591
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:31,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

592
00:40:32,135 --> 00:40:33,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this looks good.

593
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:33,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the

594
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:37,468
[SPEAKER_11]: acknowledge all of the different ways the river is used.

595
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

596
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:43,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide, folks.

597
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:43,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.

598
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:51,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we, sorry, can we resolve the comments as we go?

599
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:52,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

600
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So we, yeah, so we know.

601
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:55,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

602
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:03,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have other slides, maybe

603
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:09,366
[SPEAKER_11]: reducing the quotes or editing them just because they're very long.

604
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:14,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a lot for the, you know, to read.

605
00:41:14,568 --> 00:41:21,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the school committee can handle reading this.

606
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,571
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think the point is to read the quotes.

607
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:25,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the point is to just give a visual.

608
00:41:26,912 --> 00:41:27,373
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree.

609
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:27,773
[SPEAKER_19]: I think

610
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:35,382
[SPEAKER_19]: What I did in my writing is they're just gonna be up there and the speaker notes, which you all got to see is a summary of what's there.

611
00:41:35,402 --> 00:41:36,802
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we need to read those either.

612
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:38,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

613
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:42,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I also like the idea of, these are quotes from people in the community.

614
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:44,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I do too.

615
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:45,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Passionately.

616
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's good to include that.

617
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:49,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna make this a capital.

618
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:58,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm back.

619
00:42:00,612 --> 00:42:01,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

620
00:42:02,474 --> 00:42:03,475
[SPEAKER_15]: What page are we on?

621
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:03,475
20?

622
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:07,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I lost my power.

623
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:10,483
[SPEAKER_15]: The power blinked off here and I lost everything.

624
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:11,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no.

625
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:12,525
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks good.

626
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:15,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we move to the next one?

627
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:16,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

628
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:18,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone likes this.

629
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:31,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was, who wrote this?

630
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was a nice slide.

631
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:37,280
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe that was me.

632
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:48,109
[SPEAKER_22]: I put a lot of, the non-Jean Barry Sutherland, I at least did a lot of the initial starting work to get it going.

633
00:42:48,129 --> 00:42:49,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

634
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:55,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Should this be tied mills for the corn, tobacco, grain, wood, and textile industries?

635
00:42:57,228 --> 00:43:02,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're talking about language like that, but I think that's what also Grace warned us against spending too much time on that.

636
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:07,151
[SPEAKER_11]: So, well, again, if it's school committee, we should probably have, they migrate us.

637
00:43:08,011 --> 00:43:14,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And is the, is that last already mentioned on another slide about the poem and the, I don't think so.

638
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:15,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

639
00:43:16,854 --> 00:43:23,136
[SPEAKER_03]: We might take out the word from that next line and it's grammatical.

640
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:29,885
[SPEAKER_19]: I just make a suggestion that everybody can go to their, you know, the grammatical stuff.

641
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:34,908
[SPEAKER_19]: We can just put comments in there and then we can clean it up as Grace had said.

642
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:42,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine with 12.

643
00:43:43,715 --> 00:43:44,095
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good.

644
00:43:44,816 --> 00:43:46,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it over the river and through the wood or woods?

645
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:53,643
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it varies on the version and in and out.

646
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:54,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

647
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:56,024
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever you decide.

648
00:43:56,985 --> 00:43:58,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, moving on.

649
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:58,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.

650
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:02,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.

651
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else?

652
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, can we go to the next slide?

653
00:44:15,593 --> 00:44:16,574
[SPEAKER_11]: We should probably

654
00:44:17,173 --> 00:44:18,694
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, we can do this after.

655
00:44:18,714 --> 00:44:26,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just say we should, the font name, but we can change that after.

656
00:44:26,919 --> 00:44:28,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you say the same font?

657
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

658
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:31,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I noticed that on slide 17 too.

659
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:36,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but we can do that after, but we can make the font consistent.

660
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:39,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there were some font and spacing issues through here, so.

661
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's true, but it's not plural.

662
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:52,031
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all interesting.

663
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:53,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

664
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:58,833
[SPEAKER_08]: According to the title of the Thanksgiving poem by Lydia Maria Child, if that's what you're referring to.

665
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:07,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not grandmother's house, it's grandfather's house, the original, but I don't know where I can't really, it's on my phone.

666
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:10,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't really see.

667
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:15,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But the name of the poems over the river and through the wood, singular.

668
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:17,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

669
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,470
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we switched to grandma.

670
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:25,432
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, any comments?

671
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we reviewed this one last time, didn't we?

672
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:30,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it used to be before.

673
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:33,474
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know all the stats are accurate, right?

674
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:36,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't know when she taught where and that sort of stuff.

675
00:45:38,496 --> 00:45:40,036
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, we ready to go to the next one?

676
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:42,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Please.

677
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:43,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

678
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:45,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

679
00:45:55,742 --> 00:45:59,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if we could just resolve that space issue in the last bullet between the two last bullets.

680
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:05,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is there a reason why there's a, there you go, thank you.

681
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:22,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we think that that last bullet point, I kind of feel as if listing things like a loving wife, a caring daughter, friendly neighbor, beloved teacher,

682
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:52,661
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels sort of unnecessary in a presentation regarding her merits as a name for the school specifically in that it feels as though it's more like a list of positive attributes of Jean as opposed to a list of her contributions in a way.

683
00:46:54,446 --> 00:46:58,409
[SPEAKER_10]: particularly be a loving wife, a caring daughter, friendly neighbor.

684
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:00,751
[SPEAKER_19]: I have information.

685
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:06,155
[SPEAKER_19]: If you read the speaker notes, you'll see full explanations.

686
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:11,299
[SPEAKER_19]: I have spent, I heard your comments, Maria, and I agree with what you said.

687
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:19,325
[SPEAKER_19]: The substance now, if you read the speaker's notes, talks about a loving wife, an unbelievably friendly neighbor.

688
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:21,007
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think those words are

689
00:47:21,827 --> 00:47:24,968
[SPEAKER_19]: used enough in society, and I'm not changing them unless there's a vote.

690
00:47:25,088 --> 00:47:39,292
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think those are good, and I think my speaker notes definitely justify everything was said there, from the children going to the neighborhood, from her husband's notes, both at the city council meeting and in our

691
00:47:41,944 --> 00:47:42,905
[SPEAKER_19]: public information.

692
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:47,369
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's plenty of evidence there, and I would encourage everybody to read the speaker's notes.

693
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:47,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

694
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:53,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying that she was not a loving wife, a caring daughter, or a friendly neighbor.

695
00:47:53,554 --> 00:48:05,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that it's not necessary to list those when I feel as though the rest of the bullet points are the evidence that point towards that.

696
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:05,885
[SPEAKER_10]: It just feels

697
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:12,285
[SPEAKER_10]: it doesn't feel necessary to be listing that here.

698
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:14,686
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand your point.

699
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:18,448
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, we will disagree on this one and agree to disagree on that.

700
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:24,810
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to put it up, I'm not, I wouldn't accept that as a friendly amendment, but if you want to put it to a vote, go right ahead.

701
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it shows her, um, you know, her character, part of her character.

702
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:34,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, um, I think it's a good thing.

703
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:39,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think the rest of the bullet points do.

704
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we lose Kristen?

705
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:43,572
[SPEAKER_05]: We might've, we can keep talking.

706
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:44,933
[SPEAKER_11]: You did for a minute.

707
00:48:44,953 --> 00:48:45,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm back.

708
00:48:47,273 --> 00:48:48,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a horror movie here.

709
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

710
00:48:54,376 --> 00:49:02,138
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that translates with everything that Ron said, because a number of people who worked with her, such as myself, I know, I'm sorry.

711
00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:07,459
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's the first thing you would say about her, that she's a warm person.

712
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:10,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if that would be better, all encompassing.

713
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

714
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Just very easy to talk to, very approachable.

715
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:14,461
[SPEAKER_08]: A

716
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:21,740
[SPEAKER_08]: The helper, you know, look for the helpers you'd look for gene.

717
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,603
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, if I may, this is.

718
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:26,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

719
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:32,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Just full disclosure guys I am having contractions.

720
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:35,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I am trying to get through this meeting.

721
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:36,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

722
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:48,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of speaking chair to Maria would these would those words that I agree.

723
00:49:48,776 --> 00:49:54,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I heard through from a lot of different people who wrote in about gene Barry.

724
00:49:57,592 --> 00:50:19,197
[SPEAKER_07]: If we were to add words about maybe Belinda Sutton, about like strength and perseverance and toss in a few more adjectives that speak to her character, would it feel better about leaving adjectives that mean a lot to people about Jean Barry Sutherland?

725
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:24,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information, how would we get those characteristics from,

726
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:45,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Belinda Sutton when we don't have any personal... Well, I think the argument that she wrote her own terms of her own freedom, freed herself, fought for her rights after the things that we do know about her implies a certain level of strength and perseverance.

727
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:51,221
[SPEAKER_01]: She did it all through the system, which was... I don't think we wanna make any assumptions about her.

728
00:50:51,401 --> 00:50:54,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's kind of alarming to me that we don't even have any documentation

729
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,790
[SPEAKER_01]: that email that Beth sent us.

730
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm already hesitant about what we're including.

731
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:02,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't even know if this person actually really existed.

732
00:51:02,171 --> 00:51:08,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Belinda Sutton is coming up.

733
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:12,033
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have a chance to talk about this at that slide.

734
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we move on to the next slide, Mr. Chairman?

735
00:51:15,474 --> 00:51:17,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just ask who's having contractions?

736
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:18,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't know who's talking.

737
00:51:19,135 --> 00:51:19,715
[SPEAKER_19]: That's Brie.

738
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,335
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Brie.

739
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:30,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Bree, you understand that the child is much more important than this presentation.

740
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:31,402
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I agree.

741
00:51:33,204 --> 00:51:35,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Mr. Lister, can I speak?

742
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:39,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand Maria's feelings about this kind of emotionally overly wrought

743
00:51:40,393 --> 00:51:52,143
[SPEAKER_05]: thing of a person I've never met either, but I'm more questioning, maybe Ron can answer this, can you give me an example of her being an innovator for special education?

744
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:57,227
[SPEAKER_19]: And point of information, first to say emotionally awry, I take offense to.

745
00:51:57,327 --> 00:51:59,849
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's try to keep it as not comments.

746
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:08,014
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, coming in the next slide, you will understand how exceptional she was with dealing with special education.

747
00:52:08,474 --> 00:52:09,575
[SPEAKER_19]: All that comes in here.

748
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:10,976
[SPEAKER_19]: She was an advocate.

749
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:14,378
[SPEAKER_19]: The next slides will explain that, Matt.

750
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:15,839
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate what you're saying.

751
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,444
[SPEAKER_19]: All this stuff is not, I clarify by saying when I got here, I did not know who Jean Barry Sutherland was.

752
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:28,871
[SPEAKER_19]: I know she was not the favorite choice here, but what I've done, but what I've done is I've reached out.

753
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:30,353
[SPEAKER_19]: I've done my research.

754
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:32,015
[SPEAKER_19]: I've gone back to the organization.

755
00:52:32,055 --> 00:52:35,620
[SPEAKER_19]: She were part of I reached out to family friends through Facebook.

756
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,724
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm very confident in the statements I made and

757
00:52:39,944 --> 00:52:43,226
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I'm not an emotionally overwrought person.

758
00:52:43,306 --> 00:52:52,752
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are statistics that will be backed up and you'll understand the special education above all when I prove, when I show you the information that's coming out.

759
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:57,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I address Ron's comments, please?

760
00:52:57,694 --> 00:53:03,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize for describing these words as emotionally wrought, but they are emotionally more, you know,

761
00:53:04,718 --> 00:53:05,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuddled in that.

762
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Passionate advocate.

763
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Most special education teacher I know are passionate about it all the time.

764
00:53:10,863 --> 00:53:11,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

765
00:53:11,883 --> 00:53:25,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, there should be some real innovation that can be really documented as far as going forward in the Medford public schools, because that's a highly controversial subject, special education.

766
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:40,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Matt, just don't put, I don't wanna be a spoiler alert here, but the information that got me to that was from the assistant director of special education for the Medford Public Schools at the time that Jean Barry Sutherland was principal.

767
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:47,875
[SPEAKER_19]: So you'll read more about this, but I'm quite confident when I say she was very passionate.

768
00:53:49,155 --> 00:53:51,036
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

769
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:51,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

770
00:53:55,165 --> 00:54:01,868
[SPEAKER_03]: just building on that, Ron, I understand there's passion, but then there's also innovation.

771
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:04,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So innovation implies something specifically new.

772
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:13,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't read through your deck, specifically on, I'm sorry, who else is speaking?

773
00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:15,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, this is Lisa.

774
00:54:15,474 --> 00:54:18,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's going through the chair, so people are just talking and I don't know who's talking.

775
00:54:19,236 --> 00:54:20,076
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's- This is Seth.

776
00:54:21,437 --> 00:54:23,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand, but it's not just, it wasn't just you, Seth.

777
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:29,024
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, I think that Ron, Matt, somebody before Matt, because everyone's jumping in.

778
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:30,566
[SPEAKER_08]: So please go to the chair.

779
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:31,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

780
00:54:31,026 --> 00:54:32,367
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, go ahead, Seth.

781
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:33,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

782
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:34,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

783
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:53,992
[SPEAKER_03]: My question, through the chair for Ron, builds upon what Matt was saying, specifically in the language that is being used.

784
00:54:54,833 --> 00:55:01,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can understand passion and advocacy, and those would be

785
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:06,026
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I would recognize and would expect.

786
00:55:07,526 --> 00:55:10,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Innovation is something specifically different.

787
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:26,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And in reading through, I see examples of passion and advocacy, but I don't necessarily see specific representation of innovation.

788
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:29,697
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would love to- It has no impact on the presentation.

789
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:31,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's remove and innovator just to move on.

790
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:50,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, if I may speak, I this is Maria, by the way, I don't, I take issue with the fact that we're listing these different aspects of genes legacy.

791
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:55,899
[SPEAKER_10]: And Ron, you have repeatedly stated that there's evidence for that.

792
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:57,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Two points.

793
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,823
[SPEAKER_10]: First is that

794
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:06,042
[SPEAKER_10]: The evidence should serve and stand on its own.

795
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:18,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that we need to be listing these things because they are things that become clear through the evidence that you provide, which are Jeanne's actions.

796
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,647
[SPEAKER_10]: You have great things here.

797
00:56:21,627 --> 00:56:26,369
[SPEAKER_10]: That's undeniable, anti-smoking campaigns, dog park advocate, et cetera, et cetera.

798
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:41,713
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I think that that is more demonstrative of Jean being a friendly neighbor and beloved teacher than having to list that out, in my opinion.

799
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:52,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, I would also say that in order to make these sort of

800
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:04,578
[SPEAKER_10]: not necessarily generalizations, but very concrete, concrete assumptions.

801
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:20,332
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not necessarily the word I'm trying to use, but about Jean's character based strictly on anecdotal evidence seems problematic to me.

802
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:25,505
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate your opinion, but I couldn't disagree with you more.

803
00:57:25,565 --> 00:57:33,816
[SPEAKER_19]: This is what separates Jean Barry Sutherland as a citizen of Medford and a very strong role model.

804
00:57:34,352 --> 00:57:39,533
[SPEAKER_19]: and also her impact on the history of the city has yet to be decided.

805
00:57:40,013 --> 00:57:42,314
[SPEAKER_19]: And I understand what you're saying.

806
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:43,874
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been clear in all your comments.

807
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:45,295
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand your point.

808
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:50,416
[SPEAKER_19]: I am not gonna neutralize Jean Barry Sutherland to make her equal to the other two candidates.

809
00:57:50,796 --> 00:57:52,396
[SPEAKER_19]: This is part of who she is.

810
00:57:52,816 --> 00:57:54,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I make a suggestion to the chair that might?

811
00:57:56,397 --> 00:58:03,283
[SPEAKER_12]: make more people feel better about this statement is because she was a wife, she was a daughter, she was a neighbor, she was a teacher.

812
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:07,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are characteristics that do make her valuable for a person to consider.

813
00:58:07,386 --> 00:58:18,495
[SPEAKER_12]: So would it sound better or would people feel better or more comfortable, I should say, if we said Jean was a well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader, full stop.

814
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,817
[SPEAKER_12]: She was a passionate advocate and

815
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:28,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought if we just said we were gonna take out innovator for the needs of all the Medford children and their families.

816
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:31,796
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're still stating what her characteristics are.

817
00:58:32,156 --> 00:58:42,421
[SPEAKER_12]: We're saying she was well-loved based on all the reading we did about her, because it comes clear when you read the comments that community members have written about Jean repeatedly, many of them.

818
00:58:43,201 --> 00:58:44,622
[SPEAKER_12]: That would just be my suggestion.

819
00:58:45,782 --> 00:58:46,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I like that.

820
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:52,924
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Lee, did you want to speak?

821
00:58:53,645 --> 00:58:56,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like Kathy's suggestion as well.

822
00:58:56,447 --> 00:59:02,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just really wanted to remind this group that we're presenting all three of these names.

823
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:07,216
[SPEAKER_02]: We're championing all three of these names for the school committee to make a decision about.

824
00:59:07,636 --> 00:59:12,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to sell all of these, I believe, as being the output of our work.

825
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:17,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just looking at the time, we do need to move through this.

826
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,429
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't agreed on the changes that I'm seeing being made here.

827
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:22,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I got excited.

828
00:59:22,571 --> 00:59:23,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a vote.

829
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:24,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just have a vote.

830
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:27,115
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to change, sorry, Ron, without a vote.

831
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:30,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we need to vote, we should just vote and move on.

832
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:33,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Or otherwise, just, I think, move on.

833
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:36,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to curtail discussion, but I want to share.

834
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:38,645
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm ready for a vote.

835
00:59:39,085 --> 00:59:39,906
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm ready for the vote.

836
00:59:39,946 --> 00:59:41,347
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not removing it without a vote.

837
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:43,500
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I got a few more hands up.

838
00:59:44,921 --> 00:59:45,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Patrick.

839
00:59:48,304 --> 00:59:50,206
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I passed.

840
00:59:50,266 --> 00:59:51,747
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to say the same thing as Lee.

841
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:56,031
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, our job here is not to advocate for one person over another.

842
00:59:56,091 --> 01:00:03,297
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to make sure all three candidates that we put forward have an appropriate response.

843
01:00:03,777 --> 01:00:04,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

844
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:07,300
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, thank you.

845
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:10,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Laura, did you have your hand up?

846
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:12,537
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, that was all.

847
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:14,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, sorry.

848
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I missing anybody else?

849
01:00:23,484 --> 01:00:28,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so Ron, you want us to vote on it the way it is?

850
01:00:28,347 --> 01:00:29,467
[SPEAKER_19]: No, just take it off.

851
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:40,394
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to be known in public that I am not happy with this change, but in the interest of time and not having anything about Jean Barry Sutherland, I agree to take all those emotional adjectives off.

852
01:00:40,868 --> 01:00:41,708
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to take that off.

853
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:42,769
[SPEAKER_19]: I would put it to a vote.

854
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:44,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, put it to a vote, Ron.

855
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it to a vote.

856
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:47,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I would leave it the way it is, Ron.

857
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:49,132
[SPEAKER_04]: You work really hard on this.

858
01:00:49,192 --> 01:00:50,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, my name is Paul.

859
01:00:51,133 --> 01:00:54,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Ron.

860
01:00:55,496 --> 01:00:55,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim?

861
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:56,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

862
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:58,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Melissa through the chair.

863
01:01:00,819 --> 01:01:09,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a parent who entrusts her two children to the Medford public school system every day, I think that these attributes are key.

864
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:13,130
[SPEAKER_01]: to explaining or that you'd wanna see in a teacher.

865
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:21,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to say this, in all the years that my children have gone through the Medford school systems, they have not all been loving and caring and advocates for the children.

866
01:01:21,973 --> 01:01:34,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if we're looking to name a school after an educator and such a champion for the children and families of Medford, it's extremely important that this person does hold those qualities and we make sure that we highlight those qualities.

867
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:48,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a former principal of the Columbus School who could tell you that I have had many meetings with her about a teacher who was none of these qualities and who had no business being in the Medford school system.

868
01:01:49,235 --> 01:02:02,863
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you're speaking about an educator, it's absolutely important that to me, when my children are going to this place five, six, seven hours a day, and I'm entrusting them for the care of my child every day, that they should have these qualities.

869
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:06,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's key that these are on here.

870
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to back Ron and his work on this slide.

871
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:09,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

872
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:10,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

873
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:11,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just move the vote, please.

874
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:12,152
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

875
01:02:12,172 --> 01:02:13,332
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we voting on?

876
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:17,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this to remove the bullet point or to move the adjectives?

877
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:23,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we voting to accept Kathy's suggestion or are we moving to remove the bullet point or to remove the adjectives?

878
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:36,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Removing the adjectives.

879
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:38,332
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of order.

880
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:39,813
[SPEAKER_20]: The motion is by Kathy.

881
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:45,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we have Kathy say what her motion is, the amendment to this slide?

882
01:02:46,299 --> 01:02:46,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Kathy.

883
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:47,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, sure I can.

884
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:56,848
[SPEAKER_12]: My suggestion was that we write, Jean was a well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader.

885
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:05,696
[SPEAKER_12]: and then you put a period, she was a passionate advocate for special education and the needs of all Medford children and their families.

886
01:03:06,297 --> 01:03:14,602
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're still saying she was well-loved, but rather than those other adjectives, we're still leaving her characteristics of being a wife, a daughter, a neighbor, a teacher.

887
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,225
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Paul, I second Kathy's comments.

888
01:03:20,907 --> 01:03:22,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I need to go a roll call?

889
01:03:22,187 --> 01:03:23,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone that objects to this?

890
01:03:23,488 --> 01:03:25,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe Ron does.

891
01:03:26,889 --> 01:03:29,311
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they both say nice things about her.

892
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:37,298
[SPEAKER_19]: No, listen, if it says well-loved, that encompasses well-loved daughter, well-loved neighbor, that's fine with me.

893
01:03:37,978 --> 01:03:41,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, can we make those changes and we can okay this slide?

894
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:52,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there still a motion to accept or remove that last bullet?

895
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:53,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just confused.

896
01:03:54,517 --> 01:03:55,798
[SPEAKER_15]: No, there wasn't a motion for that.

897
01:03:55,858 --> 01:03:59,999
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a motion to accept the whole slide as it was.

898
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:06,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ron, for allowing us to change the slide.

899
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:08,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you, Ron, for your flexibility.

900
01:04:08,483 --> 01:04:09,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it.

901
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:12,645
[SPEAKER_19]: There's so much more you guys are going to love too.

902
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's just move on to the next slide.

903
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Kathy, can you say the end again?

904
01:04:16,406 --> 01:04:17,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor.

905
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:19,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher.

906
01:04:24,102 --> 01:04:25,463
[SPEAKER_12]: end community leader, period.

907
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:38,886
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think if you start a new sentence, she was a passionate advocate, because that even makes it stronger, it's got its own sentence, I think.

908
01:04:39,306 --> 01:04:40,827
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true, it highlights that more.

909
01:04:41,147 --> 01:04:43,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Education and the needs of all men for children and their families.

910
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:45,368
[SPEAKER_12]: That might even be another bullet.

911
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:48,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yeah, I can see that.

912
01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:48,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else?

913
01:04:50,509 --> 01:04:50,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Bullet?

914
01:04:58,305 --> 01:04:59,165
[SPEAKER_05]: This slide looks good.

915
01:05:00,846 --> 01:05:01,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Ron, are you happy?

916
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:02,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I would move on.

917
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:03,767
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

918
01:05:04,928 --> 01:05:05,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

919
01:05:06,788 --> 01:05:07,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, Ron.

920
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:09,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ron.

921
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a description of the slide before you all start.

922
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:15,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I apologize.

923
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:17,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I had another point.

924
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:27,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone asked if we could make a motion to remove and to make that motion to remove those last two bullet points.

925
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,581
[SPEAKER_19]: And what would be the point of that?

926
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:31,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Just point of clarification.

927
01:05:32,484 --> 01:05:33,165
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of order.

928
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:35,207
[SPEAKER_20]: He needs a second before we discuss.

929
01:05:35,327 --> 01:05:38,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

930
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody want to second that motion?

931
01:05:40,672 --> 01:05:42,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second it.

932
01:05:47,443 --> 01:06:00,327
[SPEAKER_10]: The point is that you already have the evidence that she was well loved and that she was a passionate advocate, particularly in the positive role model slide.

933
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:05,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that that does come through clearly through the quotes that you have.

934
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:14,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like it would be redundant to have that information here if you're already going to make the case for it and

935
01:06:15,032 --> 01:06:42,229
[SPEAKER_15]: future slides um anything else anybody else on that okay we'll vote on it you had a first and a second so the motion is to remove the bullet point right yes

936
01:06:42,975 --> 01:06:44,617
[SPEAKER_03]: We go back and look at the slide please.

937
01:06:45,258 --> 01:06:45,979
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah.

938
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:48,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we moved on.

939
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:52,568
[SPEAKER_03]: emotion was made.

940
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:53,309
[SPEAKER_10]: The last two.

941
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:09,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean was a well-loved wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader, as well as she was a passionate advocate for special education and the needs of all Medford children and their families.

942
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:17,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information to the chair, if we just spent all that time correcting those, how are we even discussing this right now?

943
01:07:17,502 --> 01:07:19,984
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.

944
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:25,286
[SPEAKER_10]: A motion was made and seconded, meaning that we will vote for it.

945
01:07:29,469 --> 01:07:30,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair Jim.

946
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:30,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

947
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:41,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the next slide that's being referred to that is going to be quotes on the community we had said during reviewing the mistletoe ones that we don't believe anybody's going to read that.

948
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:47,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's unfair to infer that they're going to suddenly read them for gene and pull these out.

949
01:07:47,900 --> 01:08:01,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the point of this slide, the way it was for Mr. Tuck, is to highlight the information that's on the next slide that people already said that they're not going to read.

950
01:08:01,563 --> 01:08:02,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was speaking.

951
01:08:02,523 --> 01:08:04,904
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll say it again.

952
01:08:05,024 --> 01:08:10,645
[SPEAKER_01]: So this slide, just as when we talked about for the Mr. Tuck slide, was to kind of summarize

953
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:13,690
[SPEAKER_01]: what was on the community feedback slide.

954
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:25,157
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unfair to summarize it on the Missituk slide, but remove it from Jean, assuming that people are gonna read through it for Jean and pull out these points.

955
01:08:28,519 --> 01:08:31,480
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not the slide that we're discussing.

956
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,243
[SPEAKER_20]: She's discussing the bottom two bullet points on the slide before that.

957
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:44,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but then we're saying that the next slide after that, it gives this, we'll be able to infer these two bullet points from the next slide.

958
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:57,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and if you look through the speaker notes of the next slide, it does make, it does summarize what these quotes say, making very clear exactly what those two bullet points

959
01:08:58,857 --> 01:09:04,839
[SPEAKER_10]: say, meaning that to have them would be redundant based on the speaker notes of the next slide.

960
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So point of question, people reading on the slide versus what they're listening.

961
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when people are going to be able to read it for themselves, I think it's important that this is here.

962
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:22,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we're moving stuff from here, we need to go back to miss the talk and remove information that could be inferred and not in the speaker notes.

963
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:23,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of order.

964
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:24,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we move the question?

965
01:09:24,964 --> 01:09:25,864
[SPEAKER_10]: If you

966
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:31,806
[SPEAKER_10]: If through the chair, if Melissa takes issue with my motion, then she can vote now.

967
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:34,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

968
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:36,148
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a point of clarification, actually.

969
01:09:36,168 --> 01:09:37,809
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm asking for clarification.

970
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:45,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to take a vote if these two bullets should stay or leave?

971
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:46,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that where?

972
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:47,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

973
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:51,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Ready?

974
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:53,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Ready.

975
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:57,871
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

976
01:10:02,935 --> 01:10:05,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chair, can you clarify a yes and no vote, please?

977
01:10:06,838 --> 01:10:08,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes is remove, a no is stay.

978
01:10:10,221 --> 01:10:10,941
[SPEAKER_04]: No is a stay.

979
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:12,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

980
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:13,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan?

981
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:14,825
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

982
01:10:16,146 --> 01:10:16,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Erin?

983
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:17,627
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

984
01:10:19,168 --> 01:10:19,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Beth?

985
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:21,250
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

986
01:10:22,831 --> 01:10:23,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Grace?

987
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:24,372
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

988
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:25,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Ken?

989
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:26,754
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:28,717

01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:29,658

[SPEAKER_15]: Jim Lister, no.

1021
01:11:16,286 --> 01:11:17,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, let's move to the next slide.

1022
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:18,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1023
01:11:21,867 --> 01:11:23,987
[SPEAKER_04]: How much time was wasted on that, Mr. Chair?

1024
01:11:24,607 --> 01:11:24,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1025
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:27,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, your question was a waste of time.

1026
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:30,948
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a description of this, Jim, if I may.

1027
01:11:30,988 --> 01:11:31,648
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Ron.

1028
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:42,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, the intent is just to show this slide, capture all the stuff, and then the speaker notes are really what I'd like you to all focus on or have focused on yet.

1029
01:11:45,054 --> 01:11:47,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we scroll it down so we can see the speaker notes?

1030
01:11:47,234 --> 01:11:47,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1031
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:48,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can't.

1032
01:11:49,255 --> 01:11:50,916
[SPEAKER_11]: I can lift it a little.

1033
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:56,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Kristen.

1034
01:11:56,886 --> 01:11:57,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you see that?

1035
01:11:57,892 --> 01:11:58,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

1036
01:11:58,818 --> 01:11:59,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Christian.

1037
01:12:28,653 --> 01:12:30,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Lister, this is Matt Haberstow.

1038
01:12:30,194 --> 01:12:30,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is great.

1039
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:32,295
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all quotes.

1040
01:12:32,335 --> 01:12:33,356
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is great, too.

1041
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:36,477
[SPEAKER_11]: We had so many nice things to choose from.

1042
01:12:36,537 --> 01:12:39,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1043
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:51,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to make the point that in the Missituk slide, including the quotes, the quotes are not summarized as they are here.

1044
01:12:52,005 --> 01:12:52,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And so

1045
01:12:54,506 --> 01:13:04,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that either we should include that summary in the MISUTUG slide or remove the summary in this slide.

1046
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:09,579
[SPEAKER_22]: We can go ahead and sorry, it's grace caldera here.

1047
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:19,921
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I wrote like some of the initial script stuff, so we can go ahead and include that summary in both mistook as well as Belinda.

1048
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:24,522
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so that it equals what Ron has, um, written here.

1049
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:25,783
[SPEAKER_22]: That's totally fine.

1050
01:13:26,523 --> 01:13:26,823
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1051
01:13:27,423 --> 01:13:27,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1052
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,904
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1053
01:13:29,944 --> 01:13:30,964
[SPEAKER_15]: We all sit with this slide.

1054
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:34,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we go to the next?

1055
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:35,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1056
01:13:55,038 --> 01:14:06,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a comment on that piece stating educator advocate for special education represented Medford internationally.

1057
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:16,168
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of formatting, Ron, would you be okay if we made that into a bullet point instead of having it as a subtitle?

1058
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:20,989
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the one piece I did not put there.

1059
01:14:21,049 --> 01:14:24,771
[SPEAKER_19]: That was Grace's, so I just left it there, that's fine.

1060
01:14:30,394 --> 01:14:35,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Ron, can you expand on, I don't know, I'm just having a hard time with this innovator thing.

1061
01:14:36,217 --> 01:14:37,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we can eliminate it.

1062
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:40,079
[SPEAKER_19]: We eliminated it two slides ago, so I'm okay with it.

1063
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,622
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't make or break Gene Barry Sutherland, so you can take innovator off.

1064
01:14:45,182 --> 01:14:47,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and Ron, I'm sorry, Mr. Lister's Matt Haberstroh.

1065
01:14:48,629 --> 01:14:49,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Lisa.

1066
01:14:51,971 --> 01:15:01,417
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't, so was Jean Barry Sutherland a special education educator or was she just an advocate for special education, which is state law.

1067
01:15:01,557 --> 01:15:04,478
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have special education in elementary schools.

1068
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:06,199
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a good question, Matt.

1069
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:13,544
[SPEAKER_19]: And Jean Barry Sutherland was principal and part of her role was to handle special ed.

1070
01:15:13,784 --> 01:15:16,806
[SPEAKER_19]: And Dr. Kay can relate to this, I'm sure.

1071
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:18,527
[SPEAKER_19]: But what was unique about her

1072
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:31,356
[SPEAKER_19]: is the ability to really delve into their IEPs, make sure that they were there at all the meetings, individual meetings, as she also met with the consultants from the school.

1073
01:15:31,796 --> 01:15:39,181
[SPEAKER_19]: And she also invited special education students from around Medford to her school to share the programs.

1074
01:15:39,221 --> 01:15:45,046
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will say this, if you all remember the brown envelope that arrived at my mailbox,

1075
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:48,998
[SPEAKER_11]: The mystery envelope.

1076
01:15:49,018 --> 01:15:53,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so this is the stuff that I got in the envelope.

1077
01:15:54,153 --> 01:15:58,635
[SPEAKER_19]: And one is this letter from- Out of order, Mr. Chair, that is out of order.

1078
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:00,656
[SPEAKER_09]: None of us have seen what is inside that envelope.

1079
01:16:00,976 --> 01:16:03,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, through the chair to Ron, none of us have seen that.

1080
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:07,059
[SPEAKER_19]: Laura, I understand what you're saying.

1081
01:16:07,419 --> 01:16:10,300
[SPEAKER_19]: Research is all-encompassing.

1082
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,202
[SPEAKER_19]: When I did research, I'm just telling you, here's what's here.

1083
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:18,584
[SPEAKER_19]: The proof is here, signed off by the assistant director of special education.

1084
01:16:19,124 --> 01:16:21,565
[SPEAKER_19]: So I didn't hide this stuff.

1085
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:23,406
[SPEAKER_19]: This is factual stuff.

1086
01:16:23,971 --> 01:16:26,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm curious, Mr. Chair.

1087
01:16:26,473 --> 01:16:32,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Barry Sutherland did start off her career as a special education teacher.

1088
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:36,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe Kathy Kay can attest to that if I'm not correct.

1089
01:16:37,362 --> 01:16:38,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I cannot.

1090
01:16:38,923 --> 01:16:40,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Jean was two principals before me.

1091
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,448
[SPEAKER_12]: She was a lovely woman, and I did get to meet her, but I don't know what her past was.

1092
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:45,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1093
01:16:45,229 --> 01:16:52,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Lister, just a point of information, or maybe I can ask Ron too, but special education is state law.

1094
01:16:53,592 --> 01:16:56,054
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't necessarily advocate it, you're told to do it.

1095
01:16:56,875 --> 01:17:00,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, Matt, I do have to disagree.

1096
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:03,782
[SPEAKER_12]: You do need to advocate many, many times for special education children.

1097
01:17:04,503 --> 01:17:04,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1098
01:17:05,463 --> 01:17:06,404
[SPEAKER_12]: As a principal, definitely.

1099
01:17:06,424 --> 01:17:10,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I could just jump in when Jean first started.

1100
01:17:10,568 --> 01:17:17,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, maybe Kathy, you do know this, but I'm not sure special education was a separate

1101
01:17:18,869 --> 01:17:25,393
[SPEAKER_08]: a major study at that time when she began, because I think she started teaching in the late 60s, early 70s.

1102
01:17:25,493 --> 01:17:31,917
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure if that was a special, I don't know if major is the right word.

1103
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:33,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathy, you could help me there.

1104
01:17:33,437 --> 01:17:33,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1105
01:17:35,339 --> 01:17:39,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to quote years when IDA and all that sort of stuff came in.

1106
01:17:39,181 --> 01:17:40,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, Janelle, you might know better than me.

1107
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:48,046
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would have to say, in all the roles she played at some point, special education would have played an important part, especially as a principal.

1108
01:17:51,906 --> 01:17:54,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I see a couple of raised hands.

1109
01:17:58,548 --> 01:17:59,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Lee, did you wanna speak?

1110
01:18:00,549 --> 01:18:08,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just gonna comment on this on the last bullet point, which I like, but I wanted to just note the language about a true role model.

1111
01:18:08,611 --> 01:18:11,232
[SPEAKER_02]: The previous slide was the role model slide.

1112
01:18:11,773 --> 01:18:15,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did talk about her role as a role model on that slide.

1113
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:19,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure that it's necessary on this one.

1114
01:18:21,007 --> 01:18:23,508
[SPEAKER_11]: about provide for the children an excellent example?

1115
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:26,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Provide an example?

1116
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:27,309
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Ron.

1117
01:18:28,009 --> 01:18:28,969
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear you, Lee.

1118
01:18:29,029 --> 01:18:32,550
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, when I wrote this, this was kind of like the summary page for the presentation.

1119
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:44,374
[SPEAKER_19]: So, and we've already changed it from a historical hero to a role model, but whatever word you want to use, these words are not significant to the essence of what it is, but that's where it came from.

1120
01:18:44,774 --> 01:18:47,454
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like a summary page, but I appreciate what you're saying.

1121
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:59,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it has more impact if we, this is just my opinion, it's Kristen's policy, if we are using different language a little bit on each slide, just so it doesn't sound repetitive.

1122
01:18:59,972 --> 01:19:07,901
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we said role model, the last one, maybe say example, or obviously I need a thesaurus because that's who I think of.

1123
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of information, if I may, Mr. Lister, it's Kathy Kay.

1124
01:19:13,362 --> 01:19:21,745
[SPEAKER_12]: So what came through from the children's comments was that she definitely had a connection to the school that we're in right now.

1125
01:19:21,946 --> 01:19:24,727
[SPEAKER_12]: She had a direct connection more than the other two names.

1126
01:19:25,147 --> 01:19:31,950
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know if that's, I can't recall if I saw that on any of the other slides, but I think it is something that's important just to make sure we include.

1127
01:19:33,715 --> 01:19:43,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a point of information, I think it's the original slide that Grace wrote talking about the fact that she was the first principal and really shaped the culture of the school.

1128
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,941
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that was Grace's words.

1129
01:19:48,722 --> 01:19:54,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, yeah, just as long as it's there, I think it's important because the kids noted that, which I thought was pretty impressive.

1130
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Kathy, can I ask, did they have fun in the vote?

1131
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:03,095
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't know because we're doing a lot of remote stuff and they did it in their classroom.

1132
01:20:03,115 --> 01:20:07,196
[SPEAKER_12]: So I got many of them back and I can tell you what the results are later if you'd like to hear.

1133
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:08,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

1134
01:20:08,377 --> 01:20:08,797
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to.

1135
01:20:08,857 --> 01:20:10,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it in my classroom.

1136
01:20:10,658 --> 01:20:11,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a special ed teacher.

1137
01:20:12,879 --> 01:20:14,940
[SPEAKER_00]: They did have fun reading the information.

1138
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's nice.

1139
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:16,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.

1140
01:20:17,681 --> 01:20:18,021
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1141
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:18,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1142
01:20:19,121 --> 01:20:21,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Mr. Lister.

1143
01:20:21,742 --> 01:20:25,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So is the line an educator, innovator, repetitive, or just

1144
01:20:28,049 --> 01:20:28,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like we could take that out.

1145
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause now educator is the first bullet point.

1146
01:20:33,014 --> 01:20:36,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have advocate for special education, which I do like keeping.

1147
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:38,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we have that in that one too.

1148
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,780
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I'm okay with that.

1149
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:47,867
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple of raised hands here before we go Maria Rosha.

1150
01:20:48,788 --> 01:20:49,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1151
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:51,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I have several comments.

1152
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:52,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that,

1153
01:20:53,405 --> 01:21:08,392
[SPEAKER_10]: The majority of these bullet points are information that was already stated, particularly, which was already commented on, educator and innovator, advocate for special education, which is in slide 14.

1154
01:21:09,633 --> 01:21:18,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also say that that first slide, with the exception of represented Medford internationally, can we remove that because it is repetitive?

1155
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:28,262
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information again, I use this slide as a summary under the Medford proud history.

1156
01:21:30,483 --> 01:21:32,504
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, the other ones were under role model.

1157
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:42,987
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, so I think it's, you know, it's repetitive maybe, but it's the essence of, you know, this is an example of how she impacted Medford's history, so.

1158
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:43,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Also,

1159
01:21:49,762 --> 01:22:09,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, to your point, can we still remove educator advocate for special education, and had an amazing impact on Medford community and future generations because that's stated on later slides and our later bullet points and this is a bullet point now.

1160
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,805
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear what you're saying that bullet point is the key summary statement.

1161
01:22:14,845 --> 01:22:22,315
[SPEAKER_19]: So as far as her history and how she impacted the proud history, I don't believe the word redundant is correctly used.

1162
01:22:24,464 --> 01:22:33,415
[SPEAKER_10]: But it literally says educator then and educator and innovator, two bullet points later.

1163
01:22:34,156 --> 01:22:35,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Advocate for special education.

1164
01:22:35,798 --> 01:22:37,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, we're removing that.

1165
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:41,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Those things are being removed because of the first slide.

1166
01:22:41,405 --> 01:22:43,207
[SPEAKER_19]: You were talking about a previous slide, I believe.

1167
01:22:43,849 --> 01:22:45,650
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was talking about this slide.

1168
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:51,073
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no, I thought we already proved getting rid of educator and innovator on slide three.

1169
01:22:51,473 --> 01:22:52,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Kristin.

1170
01:22:52,293 --> 01:22:56,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get rid of them if we're going to get rid of them.

1171
01:22:56,295 --> 01:23:01,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd also say helped make a major difference in Medford.

1172
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:12,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be more appropriate to say in Medford public schools, since the majority of the things that were mentioned was specific to the schools.

1173
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:14,551
[SPEAKER_19]: point of information.

1174
01:23:14,851 --> 01:23:16,272
[SPEAKER_19]: We have substance abuse.

1175
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,714
[SPEAKER_19]: We have the summer food program.

1176
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:22,698
[SPEAKER_19]: We have how she closed down a convenience store.

1177
01:23:23,418 --> 01:23:25,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are citywide issues.

1178
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,161
[SPEAKER_19]: Not be okay.

1179
01:23:26,181 --> 01:23:27,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan, which is worldwide.

1180
01:23:28,062 --> 01:23:28,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

1181
01:23:29,003 --> 01:23:31,665
[SPEAKER_06]: She was one of the founders of the jingle bell run to wasn't she?

1182
01:23:31,945 --> 01:23:32,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1183
01:23:32,706 --> 01:23:33,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Take it easy.

1184
01:23:33,306 --> 01:23:34,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think we can leave that in.

1185
01:23:35,048 --> 01:23:35,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else?

1186
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:38,110
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1187
01:23:38,791 --> 01:23:40,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Seth, did you have your hand up?

1188
01:23:41,453 --> 01:23:42,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, Mr. Sherry.

1189
01:23:42,274 --> 01:23:42,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1190
01:23:47,605 --> 01:24:15,053
[SPEAKER_03]: what Ron was saying and sort of one of the lenses that we can look at in order to advocate for Jean Barry Sutherland is not just a woman that did a job well, but what about this woman was something that wasn't just her doing her job, but actually doing

1191
01:24:16,892 --> 01:24:44,438
[SPEAKER_03]: more than what her job was, which one would hope as an employee of Medford public school system that all of our educators and administrators are doing their best and being held accountable by the community.

1192
01:24:44,518 --> 01:24:45,298
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that she's

1193
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:59,439
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, one of the three names that we're putting forward and on this slide are not just because of her job, but specifically because of who she was.

1194
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:03,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

1195
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, one point of clarification.

1196
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:13,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we removing and had an amazing impact on the Medford community and future generations from that first slide?

1197
01:25:15,745 --> 01:25:18,147
[SPEAKER_10]: since that's encompassed by the last one?

1198
01:25:21,069 --> 01:25:21,869
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe so.

1199
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:23,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's fine.

1200
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:24,791
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1201
01:25:25,431 --> 01:25:26,272
[SPEAKER_15]: We're good with this.

1202
01:25:26,632 --> 01:25:27,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to the next one.

1203
01:25:27,953 --> 01:25:31,095
[SPEAKER_15]: The impact should be lowercase, just FYI.

1204
01:25:31,135 --> 01:25:34,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's because we moved it down from being a title.

1205
01:25:35,058 --> 01:25:37,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we make it a separate bullet point?

1206
01:25:37,819 --> 01:25:39,841
[SPEAKER_10]: It just feels odd to have it there.

1207
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:44,584
[SPEAKER_15]: I remind you, we're trying to finish this tonight.

1208
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:50,778
[SPEAKER_15]: 533.

1209
01:25:46,816 --> 01:25:50,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you know, so.

1210
01:25:51,358 --> 01:25:52,098
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Brady.

1211
01:25:52,278 --> 01:25:54,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I had one comment if I, if I may.

1212
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:55,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Please go ahead.

1213
01:25:55,959 --> 01:25:56,559
[SPEAKER_15]: How you feeling?

1214
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all right.

1215
01:26:01,561 --> 01:26:10,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the last bullet point still feels like when Ron was summarizing everything, is there a way to, um, make it more.

1216
01:26:11,893 --> 01:26:13,014
[SPEAKER_07]: the Medford history.

1217
01:26:13,854 --> 01:26:27,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also, I don't want to get into the weeds on this, but the use of true role model in that last bullet, again, I want to go back to what Lee was saying, and that we're trying to, we're supporting all three of these names.

1218
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:37,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Out of information, Brie, I don't know if you were attending to your child, but we're leaving that up to Kristen just to change that name.

1219
01:26:37,589 --> 01:26:39,771
[SPEAKER_19]: We agree that true role model needs to be changed.

1220
01:26:40,693 --> 01:26:41,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, OK.

1221
01:26:44,814 --> 01:26:49,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say example or a- I trust you.

1222
01:26:50,555 --> 01:26:51,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone good for children.

1223
01:26:51,736 --> 01:26:55,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide, maybe.

1224
01:26:55,637 --> 01:26:56,917
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1225
01:26:56,957 --> 01:26:58,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we ready?

1226
01:27:02,178 --> 01:27:06,399
[SPEAKER_11]: An example of someone who not only helped make a difference.

1227
01:27:10,441 --> 01:27:11,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that, yeah.

1228
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:12,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, very good.

1229
01:27:12,422 --> 01:27:13,323
[SPEAKER_11]: We can still comment.

1230
01:27:13,843 --> 01:27:17,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Bri, do you have anything you want to say just in case the lead?

1231
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:20,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm still still here.

1232
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:21,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good.

1233
01:27:22,068 --> 01:27:22,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1234
01:27:23,429 --> 01:27:26,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I think we did a lot of this Belinda Sutton last time.

1235
01:27:27,151 --> 01:27:29,212
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we came to some really good agreements.

1236
01:27:31,734 --> 01:27:35,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Except I think we were still talking about this picture from the museum, maybe.

1237
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:36,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

1238
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,599
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that was correct.

1239
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:44,822
[SPEAKER_19]: I think what we learned is that there is no picture based on the conversation I was watching.

1240
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:46,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no portraits.

1241
01:27:46,463 --> 01:27:46,783
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1242
01:27:48,904 --> 01:27:49,744
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Matt Haberstow.

1243
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:54,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I wrongly identified a picture that was on the front page of the transcript that Ms.

1244
01:27:54,366 --> 01:27:55,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuller corrected me on.

1245
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:56,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1246
01:27:57,568 --> 01:28:00,449
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this is a fine picture for what we have.

1247
01:28:00,829 --> 01:28:02,450
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the slide.

1248
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:05,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think we all liked this last time, right?

1249
01:28:06,252 --> 01:28:06,352
Yep.

1250
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:10,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, agreed, move on, Mr. Chair.

1251
01:28:10,872 --> 01:28:12,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to say something on that slide.

1252
01:28:12,513 --> 01:28:14,455
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, Mr. Chair.

1253
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:31,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in response to a statement made earlier by a member of the committee questioning whether Belinda Sutton even existed, I would like to suggest that we add that the petition that Belinda Sutton wrote was made with the Massachusetts legislature.

1254
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:32,851
[SPEAKER_09]: It is on file.

1255
01:28:33,371 --> 01:28:35,313
[SPEAKER_09]: with the Massachusetts State Archives.

1256
01:28:35,734 --> 01:28:38,076
[SPEAKER_09]: You could see it for yourself if you'd like to go see it.

1257
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:43,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You can read about it in many of the sources that were given to us by the community members.

1258
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:50,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to maybe add a bullet point to that and just to say for the record that I found that statement to be incredibly offensive.

1259
01:28:54,212 --> 01:28:59,056
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to add to that, Laura, I would, I think we have a picture of the petition.

1260
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:03,100
[SPEAKER_19]: So that might not be a bad thing to put up there in that slide.

1261
01:29:05,682 --> 01:29:06,723
[SPEAKER_19]: That might be history.

1262
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:10,026
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if it's on this overview slide and maybe somewhere else down.

1263
01:29:10,146 --> 01:29:13,168
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we have it.

1264
01:29:13,288 --> 01:29:15,110
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on slide 20.

1265
01:29:16,331 --> 01:29:17,272
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the petition.

1266
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:21,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the chair, Jim, if I may speak, Laura's referring to the comments that I made.

1267
01:29:22,659 --> 01:29:24,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will proudly own that comment.

1268
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:37,787
[SPEAKER_01]: My comment was not meant to offend anyone, but it's very difficult when you don't have photos, a birth certificate and everything is signed with the X to really know who wrote and signed that.

1269
01:29:38,768 --> 01:29:40,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my only point.

1270
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:42,850
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been anybody.

1271
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,751
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been Ronald McDonald who signed it.

1272
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:48,933
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know because there's no proof that she even existed.

1273
01:29:48,973 --> 01:29:50,394
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been up a made up name,

1274
01:29:52,122 --> 01:29:53,725
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely offensive.

1275
01:29:54,888 --> 01:29:59,217
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people in this country who that would apply to, I think.

1276
01:29:59,906 --> 01:30:01,547
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information to the chair.

1277
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:03,948
[SPEAKER_22]: Go ahead, Grace.

1278
01:30:04,189 --> 01:30:21,118
[SPEAKER_22]: The comments that were just made about whether or not she existed are highly offensive to many who have ancestors who were enslaved, where there is no documentation of their existence because they were bought and sold like cattle.

1279
01:30:22,019 --> 01:30:28,403
[SPEAKER_22]: And they were not granted an education as to which they could be able to sign their name.

1280
01:30:28,983 --> 01:30:46,974
[SPEAKER_22]: So pointing that out highlights the fact that they were merely property, and also points out the fact that what Belinda was able to accomplish, and the fact that we do have documents, not only in the state legislature, but also

1281
01:30:48,414 --> 01:30:56,076
[SPEAKER_22]: We have record of baptism of her children are highly remarkable and very unique.

1282
01:30:56,576 --> 01:31:07,919
[SPEAKER_22]: And they are the only documents that we have of the life of what it was like as a enslaved woman in the colonies during this time.

1283
01:31:09,259 --> 01:31:12,220
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I would just like to point out that.

1284
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,000
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1285
01:31:13,421 --> 01:31:13,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1286
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:15,181
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1287
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:17,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Seth, you have your hand up.

1288
01:31:20,089 --> 01:31:23,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm actually bringing a formal motion of censure.

1289
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:32,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless Melissa wants to run her words back.

1290
01:31:33,174 --> 01:31:41,758
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am calling a motion for censure to committee member Melissa McGill for

1291
01:31:42,881 --> 01:31:49,905
[SPEAKER_03]: the words that she just used comparing Melinda Sutton to Ronald McDonald and others.

1292
01:31:50,885 --> 01:31:52,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm emotional.

1293
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:55,367
[SPEAKER_01]: This is- In the event of time, I'll pull it back.

1294
01:31:55,447 --> 01:31:56,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull it back, Seth, okay?

1295
01:31:56,788 --> 01:32:00,210
[SPEAKER_01]: In the event of time so that we don't get- No, not in the event of time.

1296
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:03,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the event of time.

1297
01:32:03,431 --> 01:32:05,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not go in this direction, okay?

1298
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:08,194
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I am seriously going this direction.

1299
01:32:08,214 --> 01:32:10,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that I would pull the comments back.

1300
01:32:10,355 --> 01:32:11,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I will second that motion.

1301
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:12,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1302
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:18,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I said what I said, and now I said I will pull the comments back.

1303
01:32:19,029 --> 01:32:20,810
[SPEAKER_01]: My concerns still stand.

1304
01:32:21,051 --> 01:32:21,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1305
01:32:21,391 --> 01:32:24,234
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a motion on the floor that will be voted on.

1306
01:32:29,459 --> 01:32:30,800
[SPEAKER_19]: Any more discussion on the motion?

1307
01:32:31,401 --> 01:32:37,347
[SPEAKER_19]: As a point of clarification, I don't even want to press my unmute button here, however,

1308
01:32:39,082 --> 01:32:44,864
[SPEAKER_19]: Melissa was offered an opportunity to retract and apologize.

1309
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:46,484
[SPEAKER_19]: That's how I interpreted it.

1310
01:32:47,205 --> 01:32:50,866
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just love to see that before we move forward.

1311
01:32:50,906 --> 01:32:52,286
[SPEAKER_19]: If she doesn't want to, that's fine.

1312
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:53,086
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll move to the vote.

1313
01:32:54,207 --> 01:32:59,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard a retraction or an apology for it.

1314
01:32:59,368 --> 01:32:59,868
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear you.

1315
01:33:00,249 --> 01:33:01,289
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand you, Seth.

1316
01:33:01,449 --> 01:33:03,950
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just saying, first, we offered her to do that.

1317
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:06,210
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked me to retract the statement, Seth.

1318
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:07,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you or did you not?

1319
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:08,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you please clarify?

1320
01:33:08,737 --> 01:33:09,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I would like it.

1321
01:33:09,778 --> 01:33:16,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard, I don't, I didn't say that I actually have heard it.

1322
01:33:17,283 --> 01:33:25,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said that I retract the statement about the fifth time I've said it now.

1323
01:33:25,949 --> 01:33:28,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And which exact statements are you retracting?

1324
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:32,333
[SPEAKER_01]: My comments about Belinda Sutton not being an existing, a real person.

1325
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:33,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I take those comments back.

1326
01:33:35,106 --> 01:33:42,069
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, then I still have a vote of censure against you because you have compared her to Ronald McDonald.

1327
01:33:42,469 --> 01:33:44,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't compare her to Ronald McDonald.

1328
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:45,611
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what I said.

1329
01:33:45,651 --> 01:33:48,412
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been that anybody could have written these.

1330
01:33:49,932 --> 01:34:02,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's my concern that we don't have- From a point of- I'm sorry, we have had a person resign from this committee over whether

1331
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:19,684
[SPEAKER_03]: they actually compared one of our names that we are going to be putting forward, what sort of language was being used.

1332
01:34:19,704 --> 01:34:21,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, what comparison was made by the committee member?

1333
01:34:21,685 --> 01:34:22,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of clarification.

1334
01:34:22,585 --> 01:34:24,486
[SPEAKER_01]: What comparison was made by the committee member?

1335
01:34:24,946 --> 01:34:25,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Through the chair, please.

1336
01:34:26,467 --> 01:34:28,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the chair, point of clarification.

1337
01:34:28,587 --> 01:34:30,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not back down.

1338
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:31,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I call for the vote.

1339
01:34:31,908 --> 01:34:33,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking for a point of clarification.

1340
01:34:34,173 --> 01:34:38,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're comparing another comment to mine, so I need to know what that comment is.

1341
01:34:39,336 --> 01:34:47,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't recall what other comparison was made of one other name being brought here by a former committee member.

1342
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:54,244
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm asking what that comparison is.

1343
01:34:54,785 --> 01:34:56,105
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of order.

1344
01:34:56,706 --> 01:34:58,927
[SPEAKER_20]: Those comments were never on the record here.

1345
01:34:58,947 --> 01:35:02,369
[SPEAKER_20]: The comments that were just brought forward are on the record.

1346
01:35:03,894 --> 01:35:04,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1347
01:35:04,094 --> 01:35:05,695
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1348
01:35:05,715 --> 01:35:07,235
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go through a vote.

1349
01:35:07,255 --> 01:35:09,796
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1350
01:35:10,876 --> 01:35:11,737
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we voting on?

1351
01:35:11,777 --> 01:35:13,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I retracted my comments.

1352
01:35:13,217 --> 01:35:14,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just need a point of clarification.

1353
01:35:15,758 --> 01:35:17,799
[SPEAKER_15]: We're voting on the motion to center you.

1354
01:35:18,959 --> 01:35:19,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1355
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:25,302
[SPEAKER_01]: This is free.

1356
01:35:26,642 --> 01:35:26,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1357
01:35:30,563 --> 01:35:30,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan.

1358
01:35:31,864 --> 01:35:31,984
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1359
01:35:33,832 --> 01:35:34,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Aaron.

1360
01:35:35,453 --> 01:35:35,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1361
01:35:38,216 --> 01:35:38,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Beth.

1362
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:40,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1363
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:43,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Grace.

1364
01:35:44,521 --> 01:35:44,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1365
01:35:46,522 --> 01:35:46,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Ken.

1366
01:35:47,663 --> 01:35:47,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1367
01:35:49,565 --> 01:35:50,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Kristen.

1368
01:35:52,006 --> 01:35:52,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1369
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:54,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Laura.

1370
01:35:55,409 --> 01:35:55,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1371
01:35:58,011 --> 01:35:58,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Lee.

1372
01:36:00,453 --> 01:36:00,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1373
01:36:01,794 --> 01:36:02,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Lou.

1374
01:36:02,615 --> 01:36:02,755
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1375
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Maria.

1376
01:36:07,022 --> 01:36:07,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1377
01:36:10,285 --> 01:36:10,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Patrick.

1378
01:36:11,346 --> 01:36:11,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1379
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:16,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Paul.

1380
01:36:16,891 --> 01:36:17,211
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1381
01:36:19,293 --> 01:36:19,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron.

1382
01:36:20,394 --> 01:36:20,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Abstain.

1383
01:36:23,137 --> 01:36:23,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Seth.

1384
01:36:24,698 --> 01:36:24,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1385
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Kathy Kay.

1386
01:36:28,421 --> 01:36:28,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Abstain.

1387
01:36:33,433 --> 01:36:33,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt?

1388
01:36:34,593 --> 01:36:34,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1389
01:36:38,774 --> 01:36:39,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Janelle?

1390
01:36:40,735 --> 01:36:40,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1391
01:36:42,575 --> 01:36:43,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Josie?

1392
01:36:44,476 --> 01:36:44,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1393
01:36:46,196 --> 01:36:47,757
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jim, no.

1394
01:36:49,317 --> 01:36:57,379
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have 14 to 4 to abstain.

1395
01:36:57,439 --> 01:36:58,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 14, 2 to abstain and 4.

1396
01:37:02,785 --> 01:37:05,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so we can- Mr. Chairman?

1397
01:37:05,606 --> 01:37:05,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1398
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:13,150
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, it's 5.45 and my original motion from 4 p.m.

1399
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:14,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1400
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:15,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Is now back on the floor.

1401
01:37:18,273 --> 01:37:19,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we'll take a vote on that.

1402
01:37:20,614 --> 01:37:24,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're really close because we did most of these Belinda Sutton's already.

1403
01:37:24,976 --> 01:37:27,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we could really get to that.

1404
01:37:28,398 --> 01:37:28,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're ready.

1405
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:31,219
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like four slides short, let's go.

1406
01:37:31,732 --> 01:37:33,433
[SPEAKER_20]: and we've reviewed them already, so.

1407
01:37:34,034 --> 01:37:36,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I- Slide 21, Mr. Chair.

1408
01:37:36,296 --> 01:37:45,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we have a motion on the floor and we had it seconded to accept all the slides up to 20 as they are now.

1409
01:37:46,103 --> 01:37:47,184
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll call the vote.

1410
01:37:47,524 --> 01:37:48,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in case, Mr. Chairman.

1411
01:37:50,186 --> 01:37:51,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've done through 20, right?

1412
01:37:52,228 --> 01:37:52,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1413
01:37:52,468 --> 01:37:52,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Last meeting?

1414
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, we did those first last meeting.

1415
01:37:55,931 --> 01:37:59,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Lister, would Mr. Donato reconsider his motion?

1416
01:38:00,034 --> 01:38:00,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're almost done.

1417
01:38:02,403 --> 01:38:02,863
[SPEAKER_05]: to redraw it.

1418
01:38:02,963 --> 01:38:03,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Donovan.

1419
01:38:05,425 --> 01:38:06,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven more minutes, Paul.

1420
01:38:06,765 --> 01:38:07,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven more minutes.

1421
01:38:09,066 --> 01:38:09,507
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do it.

1422
01:38:11,428 --> 01:38:13,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it five more minutes, Mr. Chair.

1423
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:13,909
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1424
01:38:14,509 --> 01:38:14,769
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1425
01:38:14,829 --> 01:38:15,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1426
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:16,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Paul.

1427
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:20,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Hi, this is Kristen.

1428
01:38:20,612 --> 01:38:24,474
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we all agreed on this slide 17 last time in the most part.

1429
01:38:24,494 --> 01:38:27,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, move on.

1430
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:28,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Next one.

1431
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:34,593
[SPEAKER_11]: We did review this language too, I think in the last meeting.

1432
01:38:35,814 --> 01:38:38,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we changed it to European colonization.

1433
01:38:38,617 --> 01:38:39,418
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did get through this.

1434
01:38:41,055 --> 01:38:43,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. Chair, we can move on to the next slide.

1435
01:38:43,697 --> 01:38:45,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Chair, I just had a comment.

1436
01:38:45,678 --> 01:38:48,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I missed it.

1437
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:52,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to add that she petitioned to be paid for her labor and won.

1438
01:38:52,762 --> 01:38:57,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Her example of perseverance and triumph against almost impossible odds is an inspiration to all.

1439
01:38:57,505 --> 01:39:01,927
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is reflected later on as well in the comments from the community.

1440
01:39:02,548 --> 01:39:06,590
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought that at least we should talk about the fact that she petitioned and won.

1441
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:07,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't we say that?

1442
01:39:08,011 --> 01:39:08,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1443
01:39:09,997 --> 01:39:11,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we say that in slide 20?

1444
01:39:11,297 --> 01:39:12,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we do.

1445
01:39:13,158 --> 01:39:14,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, could you go back, Kristen?

1446
01:39:14,898 --> 01:39:18,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, back or forward?

1447
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:19,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Forward.

1448
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:20,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1449
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:23,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's here.

1450
01:39:28,382 --> 01:39:29,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1451
01:39:29,462 --> 01:39:30,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the 1783 petition.

1452
01:39:30,362 --> 01:39:37,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So just specifically about being paid for the work, I'm sorry if I'm not seeing it.

1453
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:42,595
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't say what the petition is, right?

1454
01:39:43,996 --> 01:39:44,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see.

1455
01:39:47,478 --> 01:39:51,801
[SPEAKER_09]: So somewhere, I'd like to say that the petition was to be paid for her labor and that it was successful.

1456
01:39:51,821 --> 01:39:54,563
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems like it should be on this slide.

1457
01:39:54,643 --> 01:39:55,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fine either way.

1458
01:39:57,605 --> 01:40:03,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Her public assertion of her right to be paid for her labor has given her a place in history?

1459
01:40:03,809 --> 01:40:03,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1460
01:40:03,929 --> 01:40:04,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be okay with that.

1461
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:07,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that sounds good.

1462
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:22,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, this is Beth Fuller, I think actually that the petition to the legislature was to be paid the amount that was given to her in the will of Isaac Royal Jr.

1463
01:40:23,962 --> 01:40:27,463
[SPEAKER_13]: And she was seeking to be paid out that money.

1464
01:40:30,704 --> 01:40:32,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But wasn't it for her public, for her labor?

1465
01:40:32,765 --> 01:40:36,186
[SPEAKER_13]: It was slightly different than being paid for her labor.

1466
01:40:36,266 --> 01:40:38,167
[SPEAKER_13]: She was given money.

1467
01:40:39,684 --> 01:40:43,366
[SPEAKER_13]: in his will, and she was seeking to have that restored to her.

1468
01:40:44,226 --> 01:40:45,247
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Beth is right.

1469
01:40:45,607 --> 01:40:47,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember reading that.

1470
01:40:47,568 --> 01:40:48,868
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't believe that's true.

1471
01:40:48,908 --> 01:40:58,893
[SPEAKER_20]: In the historical society, I thought that they said they assumed that she was paid the amount that was in the will, but then she went for reparations for her labor.

1472
01:41:01,674 --> 01:41:03,515
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's not what I recall.

1473
01:41:04,509 --> 01:41:05,110
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Lee.

1474
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:15,957
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding, Mr. Lister, my understanding is that she, in order to be free, she had to be paid a pension, essentially, a wage to sustain herself.

1475
01:41:16,078 --> 01:41:18,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what she was suing for.

1476
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,041
[SPEAKER_19]: She also sued for an extension of the pension.

1477
01:41:21,101 --> 01:41:24,083
[SPEAKER_19]: That's really what the key piece was.

1478
01:41:24,504 --> 01:41:31,709
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the pension was agreed to, but she wasn't, she went to appeal to get extension for what she deserved.

1479
01:41:31,789 --> 01:41:33,190
[SPEAKER_13]: She had to go back five times.

1480
01:41:35,052 --> 01:41:36,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do we rewrite this sentence?

1481
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:37,942
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no idea.

1482
01:41:38,223 --> 01:41:38,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Lee, can you?

1483
01:41:41,547 --> 01:41:46,288
[SPEAKER_20]: My recommendation is say her public assertion of her right to be paid reparations for her labor.

1484
01:41:46,928 --> 01:41:49,289
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't reparations.

1485
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 5.50.

1486
01:41:50,129 --> 01:41:51,590
[SPEAKER_04]: The five minutes are up.

1487
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:52,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for a vote.

1488
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:54,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1489
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:55,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough is enough.

1490
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:58,371
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys wanted to play around, and I said this from the beginning.

1491
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:00,632
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is over.

1492
01:42:01,372 --> 01:42:02,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Time for a vote.

1493
01:42:03,192 --> 01:42:09,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Lister, I'm wondering if Mr. Donato would not characterize what we're doing as playing around.

1494
01:42:10,097 --> 01:42:12,139
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a phrase, I'm sure.

1495
01:42:12,179 --> 01:42:14,061
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1496
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:17,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be fine with just going back to her public assertion of her rights.

1497
01:42:17,523 --> 01:42:21,067
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee said that we were stalling.

1498
01:42:22,628 --> 01:42:23,649
[SPEAKER_15]: We're almost there, Paul.

1499
01:42:26,952 --> 01:42:28,393
[SPEAKER_15]: We all set with this slide, are we?

1500
01:42:29,214 --> 01:42:29,474
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1501
01:42:29,774 --> 01:42:30,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's beautiful.

1502
01:42:31,335 --> 01:42:37,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I make a motion to move to the next slide, Mr. Chair.

1503
01:42:40,461 --> 01:42:42,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to move to the next slide, Mr. Chair.

1504
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:43,542
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all set with this slide, right?

1505
01:42:43,562 --> 01:42:43,602
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1506
01:42:43,862 --> 01:42:44,722
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Mr. Chairman.

1507
01:42:44,762 --> 01:42:46,443
[SPEAKER_04]: This was not the slide we were talking about.

1508
01:42:46,483 --> 01:42:48,824
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion to move to the next slide, Mr. Chair.

1509
01:42:49,204 --> 01:42:51,385
[SPEAKER_10]: We were talking about slide 18.

1510
01:42:52,385 --> 01:42:55,406
[SPEAKER_20]: The word reparation is not even mentioned.

1511
01:42:55,426 --> 01:42:57,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, we've gone past the time we set.

1512
01:42:58,167 --> 01:42:58,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1513
01:42:58,307 --> 01:43:00,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were going to vote on the slides.

1514
01:43:00,188 --> 01:43:02,588
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's vote on whether we're going to accept them all now.

1515
01:43:03,449 --> 01:43:03,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1516
01:43:03,909 --> 01:43:08,390
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion, Mr. Chair, is whether we are going to vote to accept them all, right?

1517
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:09,671
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion on the table is

1518
01:43:11,423 --> 01:43:18,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct, at this time we were gonna vote- I'll accept the slide 21, yes, that's the original motion at 4.05 PM.

1519
01:43:18,508 --> 01:43:19,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask a question?

1520
01:43:19,489 --> 01:43:20,129
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Kristen.

1521
01:43:20,589 --> 01:43:20,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1522
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:29,536
[SPEAKER_11]: If we do this vote and we vote for it, but they don't kick us off this channel for another 10 minutes, can we still finish up?

1523
01:43:30,057 --> 01:43:32,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I can stay here till 11.59.

1524
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:38,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We can stay here all night if we have to, but we made a commitment

1525
01:43:39,028 --> 01:43:40,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information to the chair.

1526
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1527
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:44,493
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of things going on and we see the finish line.

1528
01:43:45,093 --> 01:43:45,814
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear you.

1529
01:43:45,914 --> 01:43:51,599
[SPEAKER_19]: The issue is that in eight minutes, we use no slides but the first eight.

1530
01:43:52,480 --> 01:44:01,728
[SPEAKER_19]: If we take two more minutes to figure out one word and include reparations in here, I think we all approve, everybody wins, and then we start, then we end this conversation.

1531
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:06,280
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we end it with the... Further point of order, Mr. Chair.

1532
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to end debate requires two thirds.

1533
01:44:12,123 --> 01:44:15,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, we can stall some more, according to the school committee.

1534
01:44:17,286 --> 01:44:19,087
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not stalling, we're working.

1535
01:44:19,147 --> 01:44:20,308
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to get it done, Paul.

1536
01:44:20,348 --> 01:44:21,228
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to get it done.

1537
01:44:22,749 --> 01:44:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the word he used.

1538
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:25,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we go to 20, please?

1539
01:44:26,411 --> 01:44:27,291
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we're at, right?

1540
01:44:27,892 --> 01:44:29,953
[SPEAKER_11]: We also did not look at this

1541
01:44:30,643 --> 01:44:35,046
[SPEAKER_11]: quote page, but I think we all saw these in the last meeting.

1542
01:44:36,727 --> 01:44:50,236
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may say in slide 18, I believe that we should include the sentence regarding her example of perseverance and triumph against almost impossible odds as an inspiration to all.

1543
01:44:50,256 --> 01:44:55,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel as though based on the wording of other

1544
01:44:56,906 --> 01:45:03,128
[SPEAKER_10]: named suggestions, I feel like that would be a fair assessment of her accomplishments to include.

1545
01:45:04,148 --> 01:45:05,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that suggestion.

1546
01:45:05,188 --> 01:45:06,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Mr. Lister's Matt Haberster.

1547
01:45:06,769 --> 01:45:08,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that suggestion by Maria.

1548
01:45:08,049 --> 01:45:09,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good idea.

1549
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:21,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think, sorry, this is Kristen Scalise, I think would be a good idea to, I do like the idea of adding an explanation of what she actually petitioned the legislature for to explain it more.

1550
01:45:21,293 --> 01:45:25,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do have room on this slide, whereas we don't have as much room on slide

1551
01:45:26,258 --> 01:45:32,783
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, listen, I'm not going to stop you here unless, Patrick, are you going to give us a little time here?

1552
01:45:33,643 --> 01:45:34,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

1553
01:45:34,244 --> 01:45:35,425
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we have the finish line.

1554
01:45:35,465 --> 01:45:40,068
[SPEAKER_20]: The whole idea of doing this was to push the pace, so we're- All right, you're going to give us time.

1555
01:45:40,128 --> 01:45:42,990
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to cover the time and you're going to tell me it's over.

1556
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:47,673
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I mean, we should take our lead from the New Hampshire legislature and we can stop the clock.

1557
01:45:47,954 --> 01:45:50,535
[SPEAKER_20]: It's currently 5.54 and it will stay 5.54 until we're done.

1558
01:45:53,379 --> 01:45:56,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just pasting this in this is not permanent.

1559
01:45:56,662 --> 01:45:57,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody panic.

1560
01:45:58,023 --> 01:46:00,165
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Paul through the chair, Patrick.

1561
01:46:00,225 --> 01:46:00,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1562
01:46:01,546 --> 01:46:02,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1563
01:46:02,046 --> 01:46:05,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul point of clarification really quick.

1564
01:46:07,771 --> 01:46:12,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's the comment Maria was talking about to go here.

1565
01:46:12,154 --> 01:46:13,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's more of a historical thing.

1566
01:46:13,895 --> 01:46:21,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Maria was talking about Laura's, the strength and perseverance.

1567
01:46:21,999 --> 01:46:24,441
[SPEAKER_07]: That is how she could bring the community together.

1568
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:27,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's all in there, isn't it?

1569
01:46:28,483 --> 01:46:30,344
[SPEAKER_20]: But she's saying strike the first sentence.

1570
01:46:31,145 --> 01:46:31,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see.

1571
01:46:31,705 --> 01:46:32,906
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, yeah, right.

1572
01:46:34,009 --> 01:46:39,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever that other quote Maria was suggesting Some strength perseverance.

1573
01:46:39,712 --> 01:46:46,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that seems more like I'm bringing the community together thing Whereas her specific petition seemed more like her historic.

1574
01:46:47,215 --> 01:46:54,238
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the second sentence Isn't it Bri right here her example of perseverance and triumph against almost impossible odds is an inspiration to all.

1575
01:46:54,998 --> 01:46:58,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh Maybe I I was asking for clarification from Maria.

1576
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1577
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,741
[SPEAKER_10]: That is what I was referring to.

1578
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:01,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay

1579
01:47:04,552 --> 01:47:09,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have to figure out later how to make the background not the wrong color.

1580
01:47:11,955 --> 01:47:14,597
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're saying to remove the first sentence.

1581
01:47:14,937 --> 01:47:15,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1582
01:47:15,237 --> 01:47:16,477
[SPEAKER_11]: So start at her example.

1583
01:47:16,898 --> 01:47:17,038
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

1584
01:47:17,078 --> 01:47:18,358
[SPEAKER_20]: And put that in the historical.

1585
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:25,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Cut.

1586
01:47:28,182 --> 01:47:28,823
[SPEAKER_13]: That's wonderful.

1587
01:47:29,643 --> 01:47:30,984
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1588
01:47:31,184 --> 01:47:32,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll fix the background after.

1589
01:47:32,364 --> 01:47:33,945
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what she's all about.

1590
01:47:35,031 --> 01:47:35,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I agree.

1591
01:47:37,532 --> 01:47:37,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1592
01:47:38,552 --> 01:47:41,093
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we're all set with this slide?

1593
01:47:41,113 --> 01:47:41,913
[SPEAKER_05]: 19 is okay, right?

1594
01:47:41,953 --> 01:47:43,113
[SPEAKER_05]: We're okay with these long quotes?

1595
01:47:43,453 --> 01:47:46,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I think long, but if someone wants to read them, they can.

1596
01:47:46,554 --> 01:47:50,015
[SPEAKER_11]: If they don't read them, they don't, but they're- We went through this.

1597
01:47:50,515 --> 01:47:53,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we went through this last time.

1598
01:47:53,556 --> 01:48:01,118
[SPEAKER_05]: The slide 20 is where some of us are advocating for the word reparations, which is- I don't, I think it was, oh, I'm sorry, sorry.

1599
01:48:01,518 --> 01:48:01,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, go ahead.

1600
01:48:02,278 --> 01:48:03,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm talking on my own.

1601
01:48:05,256 --> 01:48:14,963
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw that scholars likened her petition to what future reparations were, but they stopped short of calling it reparations.

1602
01:48:15,203 --> 01:48:16,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

1603
01:48:16,324 --> 01:48:17,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not been to the royal house yet.

1604
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:18,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Coronavirus stopped me.

1605
01:48:21,348 --> 01:48:23,149
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Lee.

1606
01:48:23,189 --> 01:48:28,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We typically refer to it really as a petition for a pension, which is so that she could

1607
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:35,463
[SPEAKER_02]: pay bills so that she could eat, so that she could raise her children, not necessarily reparations, but sustenance.

1608
01:48:37,904 --> 01:48:51,091
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the information I just think there was in the writings, there is something that said, likens it to, she possibly could be the first one to have received reparations, but I like Lee's explanation better.

1609
01:48:52,301 --> 01:48:58,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I do see, I think there is a connection to reparations, personally, but in terms of the petition.

1610
01:48:58,385 --> 01:49:06,290
[SPEAKER_20]: From the Royal House website, it says, Belinda Sutton's eloquent petition of 1783 is among the earliest narratives by an African American woman.

1611
01:49:07,031 --> 01:49:11,994
[SPEAKER_20]: It has been seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

1612
01:49:13,195 --> 01:49:16,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, seen by some, so not definitive.

1613
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:19,559
[SPEAKER_11]: If we quote the whole thing, I wouldn't.

1614
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:21,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we put that?

1615
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:31,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, could you put something after rare document common seen as, however, Patrick just said, seen as the first example of reparation or something of that nature?

1616
01:49:31,867 --> 01:49:33,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how that's an opinion.

1617
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:35,149
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's right.

1618
01:49:35,169 --> 01:49:43,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an opinion, but we have a lot of opinions in a lot of these slides, right?

1619
01:49:44,816 --> 01:49:45,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1620
01:49:45,417 --> 01:49:48,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like it could go there, but I'm willing to listen to the group.

1621
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:51,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with putting it there.

1622
01:49:55,025 --> 01:50:07,834
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel strongly that the word reparations, if you want to qualify that by saying some commentators as the first call, but I believe strongly that the word reparation should be there.

1623
01:50:09,215 --> 01:50:15,900
[SPEAKER_11]: If it is there, I think we do need to have the full quote context.

1624
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:17,321
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm okay with that quote.

1625
01:50:18,122 --> 01:50:24,246
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

1626
01:50:25,302 --> 01:50:29,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you put that in there, Kristen, and see how it looks behind where it documents?

1627
01:50:32,427 --> 01:50:33,808
[SPEAKER_11]: By some, was it scholars?

1628
01:50:34,508 --> 01:50:40,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Her petition has been seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

1629
01:50:40,052 --> 01:50:42,514
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an exact quote from the Royal House.

1630
01:50:44,455 --> 01:50:46,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, so that's a modern interpretation.

1631
01:50:47,197 --> 01:50:53,461
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that sounds, the way you have it worded, taking it from the Royal House side is helpful.

1632
01:50:54,094 --> 01:50:59,856
[SPEAKER_11]: We can also put an official citation, which I can't do now off the top of my head.

1633
01:51:01,096 --> 01:51:02,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll agree to that, Patrick.

1634
01:51:03,297 --> 01:51:07,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that this is what makes it so rare, exceedingly rare.

1635
01:51:08,058 --> 01:51:08,539
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true.

1636
01:51:08,779 --> 01:51:11,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, can someone repeat the end of it again for me?

1637
01:51:11,659 --> 01:51:14,140
[SPEAKER_20]: Patrick, one more time.

1638
01:51:15,061 --> 01:51:15,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1639
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:22,863
[SPEAKER_20]: It has been seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

1640
01:51:25,796 --> 01:51:26,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Patrick.

1641
01:51:27,338 --> 01:51:29,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And then clarification through the chair.

1642
01:51:29,662 --> 01:51:29,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1643
01:51:31,384 --> 01:51:36,671
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the lines there says the best known resident of the Royal estate is Belinda Sutton.

1644
01:51:36,972 --> 01:51:38,955
[SPEAKER_06]: We know much more about her than we do.

1645
01:51:40,825 --> 01:51:42,987
[SPEAKER_06]: of those experienced slavery.

1646
01:51:43,807 --> 01:51:47,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious, is that factual information?

1647
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:55,995
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, as I wrote most of the slide, that was taken directly from the Royal House website.

1648
01:51:57,616 --> 01:52:00,538
[SPEAKER_22]: And I even put royalhouse.org.

1649
01:52:00,638 --> 01:52:02,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I see that, I see that.

1650
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:04,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just curious, that's all.

1651
01:52:04,621 --> 01:52:05,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1652
01:52:05,982 --> 01:52:09,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Kristen, if we need an extra line, we could get rid of that MA on the...

1653
01:52:10,114 --> 01:52:12,595
[SPEAKER_09]: like fourth line that's just hanging out there.

1654
01:52:12,695 --> 01:52:14,636
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good point, we know which method.

1655
01:52:14,656 --> 01:52:15,716
[SPEAKER_11]: We know which method, not memory.

1656
01:52:15,756 --> 01:52:16,516
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not Oregon.

1657
01:52:16,536 --> 01:52:17,637
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not Oregon.

1658
01:52:18,357 --> 01:52:27,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we can go back and put like a link or a document name there just so people know we're citing and it's not our opinion.

1659
01:52:28,561 --> 01:52:29,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Is everyone comfortable with that?

1660
01:52:29,761 --> 01:52:33,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm comfortable, we're moving on, right?

1661
01:52:33,823 --> 01:52:36,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Donahue is looking at his watch, so I gotta move on.

1662
01:52:37,284 --> 01:52:39,485
[SPEAKER_11]: He has a much better sense of time than we all do, I think.

1663
01:52:39,707 --> 01:52:42,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Matt.

1664
01:52:42,447 --> 01:52:43,588
[SPEAKER_04]: This slide is fine.

1665
01:52:43,688 --> 01:52:44,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with it.

1666
01:52:44,808 --> 01:52:45,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, let's go.

1667
01:52:45,728 --> 01:52:47,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I like the next one.

1668
01:52:49,409 --> 01:52:51,849
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where I have issues, Mr. Chair.

1669
01:52:56,390 --> 01:53:01,631
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe this is not in our scope.

1670
01:53:01,731 --> 01:53:05,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this is not in our scope.

1671
01:53:05,291 --> 01:53:08,292
[SPEAKER_15]: The school committee, this can be something that goes to the school committee on its own.

1672
01:53:08,973 --> 01:53:09,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1673
01:53:09,573 --> 01:53:10,554
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information.

1674
01:53:10,614 --> 01:53:26,323
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this was added prior to last meeting when there was that resolution that was put forth with the recommendations, considering we didn't vote on the recommendations, we can just scrap this slide because it- Yeah.

1675
01:53:27,004 --> 01:53:28,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1676
01:53:28,465 --> 01:53:31,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think we kind of agreed to do that and it never got around to it.

1677
01:53:32,067 --> 01:53:33,487
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all I asked for at 4.05 PM.

1678
01:53:37,193 --> 01:53:39,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anyone know how to remove a slide?

1679
01:53:39,635 --> 01:53:42,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I just delete the whole thing or should I figure this out later?

1680
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:43,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Just delete right here?

1681
01:53:43,779 --> 01:53:43,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1682
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, thank you.

1683
01:53:46,741 --> 01:53:48,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1684
01:53:50,064 --> 01:53:50,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, this is Brie.

1685
01:53:51,025 --> 01:54:01,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one more quick thing that I just, when we were talking about the quotes, there was something made about adding summaries to Missituk and Bolivda Sutton.

1686
01:54:03,601 --> 01:54:07,284
[SPEAKER_07]: that were added for like Jean Barry or vice versa?

1687
01:54:08,885 --> 01:54:10,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Grace said that.

1688
01:54:10,146 --> 01:54:11,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1689
01:54:11,207 --> 01:54:19,853
[SPEAKER_22]: So the script right now doesn't have any summaries in them for Missitook and for Belinda Sutton.

1690
01:54:20,453 --> 01:54:21,774
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, OK.

1691
01:54:22,515 --> 01:54:25,016
[SPEAKER_22]: And I mean, right now, hold on.

1692
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:26,457
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me pull it up.

1693
01:54:26,938 --> 01:54:30,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now, it just kind of says, these are responses that were taken.

1694
01:54:33,402 --> 01:54:49,251
[SPEAKER_22]: whoever is either presenting on the slide, or I can go ahead and go in and just pull some of the main points from both of them to make sure that's also incorporated for everybody else.

1695
01:54:49,651 --> 01:54:59,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chair, I would like to make a motion to accept the presentation as is right now, like we tried at 4.05, Mr. Chairman.

1696
01:55:00,997 --> 01:55:01,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

1697
01:55:01,777 --> 01:55:02,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I get a second?

1698
01:55:03,797 --> 01:55:05,758
[SPEAKER_15]: I second, Kathy Kaye.

1699
01:55:06,119 --> 01:55:07,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Kathy.

1700
01:55:07,419 --> 01:55:08,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Any discussion?

1701
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:11,322
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1702
01:55:11,642 --> 01:55:12,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Patrick has his.

1703
01:55:13,303 --> 01:55:13,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1704
01:55:14,324 --> 01:55:14,844
[SPEAKER_20]: Patrick?

1705
01:55:15,304 --> 01:55:16,905
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I didn't lower it.

1706
01:55:19,027 --> 01:55:19,747
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Patrick.

1707
01:55:20,187 --> 01:55:20,948
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye is my.

1708
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:24,226
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1709
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:31,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Lister, I was just going to say, we're accepting it as is with the caveat that Grace is going to add summaries.

1710
01:55:31,889 --> 01:55:32,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1711
01:55:32,210 --> 01:55:33,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Script for those two.

1712
01:55:35,131 --> 01:55:35,391
Yes.

1713
01:55:35,711 --> 01:55:40,893
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also citations like this one right in front of us that we have to add.

1714
01:55:41,694 --> 01:55:49,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And I might do another run through on just grammar, capitalization, spacing, but no change of content at all.

1715
01:55:49,617 --> 01:55:50,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1716
01:55:50,178 --> 01:55:51,098
[SPEAKER_11]: If everyone's OK with that.

1717
01:55:51,853 --> 01:55:59,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Once it's completed, if you notify everybody, they can go take a look and then make comments.

1718
01:55:59,376 --> 01:56:00,457
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's okay.

1719
01:56:00,617 --> 01:56:02,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I still put a comment, just a great job.

1720
01:56:04,178 --> 01:56:09,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm just going to, it's just going to be a great job.

1721
01:56:10,821 --> 01:56:13,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to consistency.

1722
01:56:14,442 --> 01:56:14,723
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1723
01:56:14,783 --> 01:56:19,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Subcommittee of the subcommittee on this presentation.

1724
01:56:20,245 --> 01:56:20,525
[SPEAKER_11]: I think

1725
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:25,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we were blessed with three really great options.

1726
01:56:25,543 --> 01:56:27,425
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was really no way to go wrong.

1727
01:56:28,906 --> 01:56:30,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1728
01:56:31,007 --> 01:56:33,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion adjourned.

1729
01:56:33,369 --> 01:56:34,210
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we have to vote on it.

1730
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:35,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1731
01:56:36,251 --> 01:56:37,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm rushing.

1732
01:56:38,313 --> 01:56:39,073
[SPEAKER_15]: We voted on this.

1733
01:56:39,153 --> 01:56:40,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's in favor of this, right?

1734
01:56:40,555 --> 01:56:41,896
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have to take a roll call.

1735
01:56:41,956 --> 01:56:42,716
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no one opposed.

1736
01:56:42,736 --> 01:56:43,497
[SPEAKER_15]: We need a roll call.

1737
01:56:44,028 --> 01:56:45,608
[SPEAKER_08]: No, probably should have a vote.

1738
01:56:45,729 --> 01:56:46,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll vote.

1739
01:56:46,109 --> 01:56:47,029
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your final vote.

1740
01:56:47,349 --> 01:56:48,609
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1741
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:50,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we vote.

1742
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:53,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the final vote.

1743
01:56:53,171 --> 01:56:55,651
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to go back to Ron's thing about picking people.

1744
01:56:57,112 --> 01:57:00,633
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I want to know if you want to know what the votes were at the Columbus.

1745
01:57:01,433 --> 01:57:01,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1746
01:57:02,033 --> 01:57:02,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1747
01:57:03,974 --> 01:57:05,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just intercede one thing?

1748
01:57:05,934 --> 01:57:07,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want everybody to know that

1749
01:57:09,103 --> 01:57:14,187
[SPEAKER_08]: that the Google Drive will be included to all school committee members as they requested that.

1750
01:57:15,308 --> 01:57:19,291
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'll receive it Friday for Monday's meeting, just so everyone's aware.

1751
01:57:19,551 --> 01:57:25,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the presentation, but everything else that's in the drive, they have requested to see.

1752
01:57:25,975 --> 01:57:27,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to be clear about that.

1753
01:57:28,057 --> 01:57:29,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wasn't in the beginning of the meeting, so.

1754
01:57:30,919 --> 01:57:33,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa, is that in person or is it on Zoom?

1755
01:57:35,182 --> 01:57:37,504
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in person and it will be on Zoom as well.

1756
01:57:38,339 --> 01:57:39,120
[SPEAKER_08]: What time, six?

1757
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:42,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure, they were discussing the time.

1758
01:57:42,423 --> 01:57:45,926
[SPEAKER_08]: People wanted six and people wanted seven, so I'm not sure where they landed.

1759
01:57:45,946 --> 01:57:48,208
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we'll get that information from Susan.

1760
01:57:48,268 --> 01:57:56,136
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to be posted by Thursday at 4.30, so it'll be on the website as soon as Thursday at 4.30.

1761
01:57:58,918 --> 01:58:04,062
[SPEAKER_08]: We know before he and Kathy, obviously, you know, I could spread it around, but I know that we're going back and forth about the time.

1762
01:58:04,082 --> 01:58:06,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if there's executive session first.

1763
01:58:06,404 --> 01:58:09,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Will Susie let the committee of us, you know, this committee here know?

1764
01:58:10,447 --> 01:58:10,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1765
01:58:11,288 --> 01:58:12,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1766
01:58:13,349 --> 01:58:13,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1767
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:15,751

02:00:31,742 --> 02:00:31,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1828
02:00:33,902 --> 02:00:34,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Janelle.

1829
02:00:35,003 --> 02:00:35,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1830
02:00:35,924 --> 02:00:36,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Josie.

1831
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:37,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1832
02:00:39,507 --> 02:00:39,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Myself.

1833
02:00:40,027 --> 02:00:40,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1834
02:00:40,468 --> 02:00:40,808
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1835
02:00:41,249 --> 02:00:42,329
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was unanimous.

1836
02:00:43,290 --> 02:00:43,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1837
02:00:44,431 --> 02:00:46,413
[SPEAKER_15]: So the next thing is Ron's motion.

1838
02:00:46,433 --> 02:00:50,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me read it again.

1839
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas the final presentation

1840
02:00:57,642 --> 02:01:00,125
[SPEAKER_15]: has received final advisory committee approval.

1841
02:01:00,645 --> 02:01:06,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the chairman select the members who will actually make the presentation to the school committee.

1842
02:01:07,233 --> 02:01:12,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Chairman, determine the presentation teams outline who will speak about which slide.

1843
02:01:16,018 --> 02:01:20,421
[SPEAKER_15]: The committee assigned members to assist in logistics of the presentation with city hall staff.

1844
02:01:21,002 --> 02:01:30,488
[SPEAKER_15]: The committee will send the message to the school committee asking for an appropriate time and approved length of for the presentation offered by Ron second.

1845
02:01:30,969 --> 02:01:33,050
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a friendly, there was a friendly amendment.

1846
02:01:33,070 --> 02:01:40,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I believe that was mine just that people volunteer and if there's more than one volunteer that we vote.

1847
02:01:42,957 --> 02:01:43,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

1848
02:01:44,879 --> 02:01:45,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1849
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:56,102
[SPEAKER_20]: So to do it formally correct, the first motion would be a motion to take it off the table.

1850
02:01:59,623 --> 02:02:01,324
[SPEAKER_20]: I make a motion to take it off the table.

1851
02:02:03,185 --> 02:02:03,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

1852
02:02:06,706 --> 02:02:07,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1853
02:02:07,847 --> 02:02:09,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of clarification, I'm confused.

1854
02:02:09,567 --> 02:02:10,708
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we taking off the table?

1855
02:02:10,848 --> 02:02:12,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Just putting this light.

1856
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:14,509
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to take it off the table.

1857
02:02:14,569 --> 02:02:17,971
[SPEAKER_20]: It's on the table right now with your friendly amendment.

1858
02:02:18,891 --> 02:02:22,152
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, everyone in favor of taking it off the table, signify by saying aye.

1859
02:02:22,832 --> 02:02:22,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1860
02:02:23,613 --> 02:02:23,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1861
02:02:23,853 --> 02:02:24,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone opposed?

1862
02:02:24,793 --> 02:02:24,913
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1863
02:02:26,834 --> 02:02:27,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I hear a no?

1864
02:02:28,114 --> 02:02:28,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Me.

1865
02:02:28,494 --> 02:02:30,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I'm confused.

1866
02:02:30,075 --> 02:02:32,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Voting to take my friendly amendment off the table?

1867
02:02:32,575 --> 02:02:32,816
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1868
02:02:33,556 --> 02:02:37,217
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion itself off the table and then- The motion was put on the table.

1869
02:02:37,277 --> 02:02:41,138
[SPEAKER_20]: We're now taking it off the table so that we can continue to discuss it.

1870
02:02:42,299 --> 02:02:43,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1871
02:02:48,632 --> 02:02:50,853
[SPEAKER_15]: I lost everybody, I lost my video, okay.

1872
02:02:52,214 --> 02:02:57,297
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so we have a motion, we have a second, and we have an amendment.

1873
02:02:58,698 --> 02:03:01,440
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a second on the amendment, we wanna vote the amendment.

1874
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:04,061
[SPEAKER_15]: I was accepted as a friendly amendment.

1875
02:03:04,081 --> 02:03:05,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Friendly amendment, sorry, okay.

1876
02:03:06,583 --> 02:03:08,504
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have any more discussion on the motion?

1877
02:03:14,067 --> 02:03:14,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1878
02:03:14,868 --> 02:03:17,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this about who is presenting

1879
02:03:17,665 --> 02:03:19,246
[SPEAKER_11]: or how we're going to choose presenters?

1880
02:03:19,906 --> 02:03:20,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1881
02:03:20,707 --> 02:03:20,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1882
02:03:23,249 --> 02:03:23,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1883
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:27,771
[SPEAKER_15]: So all those in favor signify by saying aye.

1884
02:03:27,791 --> 02:03:27,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1885
02:03:29,452 --> 02:03:29,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1886
02:03:30,033 --> 02:03:30,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone opposed?

1887
02:03:33,315 --> 02:03:33,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1888
02:03:35,036 --> 02:03:37,638
[SPEAKER_15]: So do we have volunteers for the presentation?

1889
02:03:43,982 --> 02:03:44,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I volunteer Ron.

1890
02:03:45,262 --> 02:03:46,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I nominate Ron.

1891
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:52,048
[SPEAKER_15]: My feeling was Ron and Dr. Caldara, myself.

1892
02:03:52,168 --> 02:04:07,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to- Ron and Dr. Grace are the two, besides you, Mr. Chairman, are the two most trusted people on the, not trusted- Can I just make, so I have a list here of every slide.

1893
02:04:08,104 --> 02:04:12,007
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a list of, you know, somebody's going to have to manage the slide deck because apparently

1894
02:04:12,912 --> 02:04:15,553
[SPEAKER_19]: they don't supply the laptop where they have to do that too.

1895
02:04:15,653 --> 02:04:16,953
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's another position.

1896
02:04:17,013 --> 02:04:24,335
[SPEAKER_19]: But I certainly would be honored to represent this group in any way you want.

1897
02:04:25,496 --> 02:04:30,737
[SPEAKER_19]: I kind of have a involvement with Jean Barry Sutherland.

1898
02:04:30,777 --> 02:04:34,098
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would appreciate your confidence to let me present what I wrote.

1899
02:04:36,471 --> 02:04:46,617
[SPEAKER_19]: I think somebody has to introduce, and I'm fine with just getting up there, but I think Jim should be talking a little bit about the mission.

1900
02:04:46,998 --> 02:04:51,740
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Dr. Caldera certainly knows the rubric better than anybody.

1901
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:55,763
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there's pieces that everybody can get involved with.

1902
02:04:55,803 --> 02:04:58,405
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we are struggling with time, as I keep hearing.

1903
02:04:59,465 --> 02:05:03,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Last night, they talked about 30 minutes, but that's plenty of time for us.

1904
02:05:03,228 --> 02:05:05,029
[SPEAKER_19]: But if anybody has...

1905
02:05:05,851 --> 02:05:21,024
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, if anybody wants to, you know, volunteer to pick up a piece here, if there's some piece of the process that you were involved with, and maybe the people who created the survey want to talk about the public participation, just to get your face out there.

1906
02:05:21,104 --> 02:05:22,425
[SPEAKER_19]: If not, that's fine, too.

1907
02:05:24,346 --> 02:05:31,352
[SPEAKER_20]: My recommendation would be if one of the two people who selected Misatok as their first choice would present on Misatok.

1908
02:05:32,816 --> 02:05:37,019
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the 12 who picked Belinda Sutton would present on Belinda Sutton.

1909
02:05:39,482 --> 02:05:40,222
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good idea.

1910
02:05:40,242 --> 02:05:42,704
[SPEAKER_15]: So do we have volunteers?

1911
02:05:44,386 --> 02:05:48,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I volunteer to run the slide deck since I think I found my groove.

1912
02:05:50,883 --> 02:05:57,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, we're probably gonna need our own equipment for that, just so you know.

1913
02:05:58,928 --> 02:06:00,269
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to supply a laptop.

1914
02:06:00,789 --> 02:06:04,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would talk to Lisa, probably, because she could best answer that.

1915
02:06:05,712 --> 02:06:07,233
[SPEAKER_19]: Lisa text messaged me.

1916
02:06:07,293 --> 02:06:11,856
[SPEAKER_08]: At the mayor's office, they should have one for you for the presentation.

1917
02:06:11,916 --> 02:06:16,899
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they don't, then I can work with Dr. Cushing to have one for the evening.

1918
02:06:16,959 --> 02:06:19,661
[SPEAKER_08]: But since we're at City Hall,

1919
02:06:20,627 --> 02:06:24,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's probably better if they have equipment for us, they should have one.

1920
02:06:24,851 --> 02:06:28,515
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't, then, um, I'll speak to Dr. Cushing.

1921
02:06:28,555 --> 02:06:32,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So if somebody can just touch base with the mayor's office on that, and then let me know, that would be great.

1922
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:34,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I can bring a laptop.

1923
02:06:34,741 --> 02:06:38,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not have, um, I'm working out of my home.

1924
02:06:38,305 --> 02:06:40,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not have, um, like projector hookups.

1925
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:44,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Peter have his hand up?

1926
02:06:46,914 --> 02:06:51,958
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you can hear me, you don't need to worry about bringing a computer or anything like that.

1927
02:06:52,218 --> 02:06:53,099
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Google Slides.

1928
02:06:53,139 --> 02:06:56,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Just share it with me five minutes before you want to present.

1929
02:06:57,042 --> 02:06:59,023
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can present it through Zoom.

1930
02:06:59,203 --> 02:07:00,264
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the way that

1931
02:07:00,868 --> 02:07:07,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford Community Media has set up the chambers in a really awesome way is it will present to two flat screen televisions.

1932
02:07:07,771 --> 02:07:08,652
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't need projectors.

1933
02:07:08,672 --> 02:07:09,412
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't need anything.

1934
02:07:09,492 --> 02:07:11,133
[SPEAKER_16]: And you don't need to bring a laptop.

1935
02:07:11,213 --> 02:07:12,394
[SPEAKER_16]: You can just bring yourselves.

1936
02:07:13,694 --> 02:07:19,657
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can give me a thumbs up when you're on the next slide, or I'll just follow along.

1937
02:07:19,738 --> 02:07:24,760
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I advance too fast, you can tell me to go back, and I'll be happy to do it however you want.

1938
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:28,202
[SPEAKER_16]: You can also bring a computer, but you don't need to do that.

1939
02:07:29,142 --> 02:07:29,402
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1940
02:07:29,643 --> 02:07:30,263
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1941
02:07:31,195 --> 02:07:31,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds great.

1942
02:07:32,095 --> 02:07:39,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Another question is, do we, Lisa can probably answer this, should we be bringing a hard copy of the presentation too?

1943
02:07:40,977 --> 02:07:47,619
[SPEAKER_08]: The school committee will probably want one, yes, or we can email it to them after the fact, but they might want one of them.

1944
02:07:48,139 --> 02:07:49,560
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know how we do that.

1945
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:52,900
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you can't, you can't, then we can just email it to them.

1946
02:07:53,561 --> 02:07:55,661
[SPEAKER_08]: We do that all the time.

1947
02:07:56,221 --> 02:07:58,982
[SPEAKER_16]: On Monday, I can make sure that there are printed copies available.

1948
02:08:00,506 --> 02:08:00,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1949
02:08:00,886 --> 02:08:01,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria has her hand up.

1950
02:08:03,547 --> 02:08:05,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I was just volunteering to present.

1951
02:08:07,788 --> 02:08:08,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Who do you want?

1952
02:08:09,649 --> 02:08:10,629
[SPEAKER_19]: You want Belinda Sutton?

1953
02:08:11,009 --> 02:08:11,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1954
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:13,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody else want Belinda?

1955
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:17,951
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also an opportunity to share because there's four slides.

1956
02:08:18,611 --> 02:08:22,092
[SPEAKER_19]: So we don't have to just, if anybody else is interested, anybody?

1957
02:08:22,112 --> 02:08:25,833
[SPEAKER_16]: I would love Maria to do it.

1958
02:08:26,774 --> 02:08:28,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, done.

1959
02:08:31,923 --> 02:08:32,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1960
02:08:32,543 --> 02:08:33,664
[SPEAKER_20]: What was that, Ken?

1961
02:08:34,444 --> 02:08:36,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Belinda Sutton will be done by Maria.

1962
02:08:36,865 --> 02:08:37,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1963
02:08:38,305 --> 02:08:39,206
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, very good.

1964
02:08:42,307 --> 02:08:45,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank the volunteers, especially Maria.

1965
02:08:45,468 --> 02:08:49,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great to have a young person up there presenting this important information to our city.

1966
02:08:49,249 --> 02:08:51,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think really fantastic.

1967
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:53,090
[SPEAKER_19]: What about the oldest person, Matt?

1968
02:08:53,611 --> 02:08:56,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he may be one of the oldest persons, but I'm not either.

1969
02:08:57,252 --> 02:08:58,232
[SPEAKER_19]: Good point.

1970
02:08:58,292 --> 02:08:58,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ryan.

1971
02:08:58,913 --> 02:08:59,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point.

1972
02:09:01,186 --> 02:09:02,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point.

1973
02:09:02,727 --> 02:09:04,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we have Belinda.

1974
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:10,714
[SPEAKER_22]: I can take Misitech if nobody else is going to, since I will already be there.

1975
02:09:11,194 --> 02:09:12,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, good point.

1976
02:09:12,395 --> 02:09:16,299
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think- I think Grace is in the process, right?

1977
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:24,886
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think Grace, if you could do, you probably are gonna do, I mean, you're comfortable with doing rubric, obviously.

1978
02:09:25,106 --> 02:09:29,490
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we should trust that to, you're the expert on it, so.

1979
02:09:30,578 --> 02:09:32,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I can do the rubric and I can do MISITUC, that's fine.

1980
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:38,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'm just thinking logistics, if you're up there, do you wanna take the next three tips?

1981
02:09:40,386 --> 02:09:40,886
[SPEAKER_22]: The next?

1982
02:09:42,067 --> 02:09:44,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, from rubric down to MISITUC.

1983
02:09:45,710 --> 02:09:47,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, from rubric down to MISITUC.

1984
02:09:47,131 --> 02:09:48,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you wanna share some of that?

1985
02:09:49,213 --> 02:09:52,976
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm happy to share it or I can do the whole thing, it doesn't really matter.

1986
02:09:52,996 --> 02:09:56,919
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess the question is, does anybody have a burning desire to be part of this?

1987
02:09:56,959 --> 02:09:59,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Because there's plenty of slides to share.

1988
02:10:04,577 --> 02:10:07,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no burning desire to present.

1989
02:10:07,699 --> 02:10:12,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I will do it if we need people, but it wouldn't be my first choice of activity.

1990
02:10:13,284 --> 02:10:15,025
[SPEAKER_02]: How many volunteers do we have so far?

1991
02:10:15,045 --> 02:10:23,751
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to nominate Erin for Missituk because that was her first choice, I believe, if I'm remembering correctly.

1992
02:10:23,771 --> 02:10:29,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, we have Grace who's already volunteered for Missituk, but Erin, do you want to

1993
02:10:31,886 --> 02:10:33,027
[SPEAKER_21]: appreciate your confidence.

1994
02:10:34,008 --> 02:10:38,011
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, I'm not sure that it's not my first choice to want to present.

1995
02:10:38,391 --> 02:10:42,554
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, if I, if there is no one else who wants to do it, then I will.

1996
02:10:43,134 --> 02:10:45,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we do have Grace who's volunteered for this attack.

1997
02:10:45,596 --> 02:10:46,257
[SPEAKER_21]: So okay.

1998
02:10:46,657 --> 02:10:47,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Grace.

1999
02:10:47,397 --> 02:10:47,998
[SPEAKER_19]: That's okay.

2000
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:51,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody else want to slide?

2001
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a great team.

2002
02:10:54,002 --> 02:10:55,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for doing it.

2003
02:10:55,904 --> 02:10:57,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take the one that says thank you.

2004
02:11:00,552 --> 02:11:02,093
[SPEAKER_19]: I kind of wanted that one, Paul.

2005
02:11:02,333 --> 02:11:02,634
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

2006
02:11:03,054 --> 02:11:04,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's going to introduce, Jim?

2007
02:11:04,375 --> 02:11:05,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to share that with you, Paul.

2008
02:11:06,176 --> 02:11:06,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2009
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:15,421
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so I've got, so Dr. Caldera will do the, from rubric right through Ms.

2010
02:11:15,461 --> 02:11:17,162
[SPEAKER_19]: Satak, is that fair to say?

2011
02:11:18,623 --> 02:11:20,364
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, I can do that, that's not a problem.

2012
02:11:20,604 --> 02:11:21,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2013
02:11:21,265 --> 02:11:22,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Seth has his hand up.

2014
02:11:22,745 --> 02:11:23,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Seth?

2015
02:11:24,166 --> 02:11:25,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

2016
02:11:26,573 --> 02:11:31,957
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't commit because I don't know the schedule of my daughter.

2017
02:11:33,037 --> 02:11:45,125
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that might be an influence on my availability is actually whether or not my daughter would like to accompany me to the meeting.

2018
02:11:45,426 --> 02:11:50,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that would be the case, then I would like to be

2019
02:11:54,879 --> 02:11:58,000
[SPEAKER_19]: I can offer you this, I can offer you this, Seth.

2020
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:04,763
[SPEAKER_19]: You can talk about, you know, the first four slides are agenda, which I probably will do.

2021
02:12:05,243 --> 02:12:07,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Then mission would probably be Jim, in my mind.

2022
02:12:08,185 --> 02:12:19,910
[SPEAKER_19]: But background and receiving and reviewing public, I think that we can put you down and if for some reason you don't show up, you know, we can, you know, make a quick substitution if you want to.

2023
02:12:23,717 --> 02:12:28,840
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so I'm going to put myself in as just the intro, if that's okay.

2024
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:33,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Then Jim- May I ask what the date of this is again, Thursday?

2025
02:12:33,422 --> 02:12:33,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Monday.

2026
02:12:34,162 --> 02:12:35,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, next Monday at?

2027
02:12:36,223 --> 02:12:37,404
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't really know yet.

2028
02:12:37,844 --> 02:12:38,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

2029
02:12:38,605 --> 02:12:39,665
[SPEAKER_11]: After the workday?

2030
02:12:39,685 --> 02:12:42,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, six o'clock, six at least.

2031
02:12:42,907 --> 02:12:45,728
[SPEAKER_19]: Earliest is six, seven is more- That would be nice.

2032
02:12:46,889 --> 02:12:50,731
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so I'm going to put Seth in there for background.

2033
02:12:52,172 --> 02:12:54,633
[SPEAKER_19]: and receiving and reviewing public.

2034
02:12:55,614 --> 02:12:56,814
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can prepare that.

2035
02:12:57,875 --> 02:13:03,138
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's all the slides, but anybody can, if anybody had, again, I don't want to dictate this.

2036
02:13:03,198 --> 02:13:04,798
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just trying to do this to get it moving.

2037
02:13:06,059 --> 02:13:11,702
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we just wrap it up at the end with the, you know, if they have questions or comments, I don't know.

2038
02:13:11,722 --> 02:13:15,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully we don't have to wake them up at slide 21, but who knows?

2039
02:13:16,424 --> 02:13:20,266
[SPEAKER_19]: So Kristen, you're going to do the slide deck.

2040
02:13:21,328 --> 02:13:26,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, it seems like the school, they have a mechanism for doing that with the school.

2041
02:13:27,372 --> 02:13:28,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I can be ready to jump in.

2042
02:13:28,913 --> 02:13:32,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so I would suggest that we get there early.

2043
02:13:32,695 --> 02:13:40,900
[SPEAKER_19]: And if anybody has any style issues with how we're going to do this, I assume you'd get up, you give your address, and move on.

2044
02:13:42,161 --> 02:13:43,582
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was easier than I expected.

2045
02:13:43,622 --> 02:13:44,042
[SPEAKER_19]: That's good.

2046
02:13:44,062 --> 02:13:45,443
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2047
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:49,637
[SPEAKER_19]: I just have one final question before we adjourn.

2048
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Directed to Brie.

2049
02:13:53,346 --> 02:13:56,032
[SPEAKER_19]: Brie, would you be open to the school committee naming your baby?

2050
02:14:00,686 --> 02:14:08,014
[SPEAKER_19]: We could meet on Tuesday to start it.

2051
02:14:08,314 --> 02:14:13,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I will take your public input, but I will set up a Google for it.

2052
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,282
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have a list of 18 names.

2053
02:14:16,402 --> 02:14:17,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

2054
02:14:19,165 --> 02:14:19,505
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2055
02:14:19,565 --> 02:14:20,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck.

2056
02:14:20,466 --> 02:14:21,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you want to hear the results from this?

2057
02:14:22,047 --> 02:14:22,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

2058
02:14:22,627 --> 02:14:23,528
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

2059
02:14:23,748 --> 02:14:25,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, please.

2060
02:14:26,050 --> 02:14:26,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2061
02:14:26,610 --> 02:14:28,832
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have 393 students enrolled at the Columbus.

2062
02:14:29,272 --> 02:14:32,354
[SPEAKER_12]: I received votes from 277 of them.

2063
02:14:33,735 --> 02:14:35,976
[SPEAKER_12]: And in alphabetical order.

2064
02:14:37,117 --> 02:14:38,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Tuck received 100 and 107 votes.

2065
02:14:43,666 --> 02:14:51,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Jean Barry Sutherland Elementary School received 84 votes and the Belinda Sutton Elementary School received 86 votes.

2066
02:14:53,581 --> 02:14:58,225
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did share those with the school committee as well as Mr. Lister earlier today.

2067
02:14:58,405 --> 02:14:59,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Jim, were you able to open those later on?

2068
02:15:00,207 --> 02:15:01,047
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, thank you.

2069
02:15:01,067 --> 02:15:08,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and so what we did, and I counted them and then I had Mrs. Sherman-Hudson count them independently in another room for accuracy.

2070
02:15:09,314 --> 02:15:17,361
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we did was we just took some of the comments that the students said about the names and forwarded those with the information for the school committee to deliberate as well.

2071
02:15:19,863 --> 02:15:20,303
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's that.

2072
02:15:20,343 --> 02:15:22,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anybody have any questions they wanna ask me about?

2073
02:15:22,773 --> 02:15:23,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that effort.

2074
02:15:23,714 --> 02:15:24,154
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.

2075
02:15:24,634 --> 02:15:25,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2076
02:15:25,475 --> 02:15:26,095
[SPEAKER_12]: It was our pleasure.

2077
02:15:26,115 --> 02:15:29,757
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you for all the help everybody on this committee for, you know, making this happen.

2078
02:15:29,977 --> 02:15:30,357
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

2079
02:15:30,918 --> 02:15:32,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited to see what the result would be.

2080
02:15:32,999 --> 02:15:34,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope the kids enjoyed it.

2081
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:35,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Now.

2082
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:39,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I speak motion to adjourn?

2083
02:15:39,462 --> 02:15:40,043
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2084
02:15:40,183 --> 02:15:40,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Just very quickly.

2085
02:15:40,863 --> 02:15:42,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to really thank everybody.

2086
02:15:42,304 --> 02:15:45,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank the chair, um, the school committee for having the faith in us.

2087
02:15:46,226 --> 02:15:50,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it hasn't been easy, but I know I've learned a lot and I really appreciate everybody's hard work.

2088
02:15:50,269 --> 02:15:51,009
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you all.

2089
02:15:51,886 --> 02:15:52,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Same.

2090
02:15:52,448 --> 02:15:52,910
