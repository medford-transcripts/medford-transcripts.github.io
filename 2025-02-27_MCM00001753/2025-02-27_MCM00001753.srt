1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:01,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:07,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Frances Moiseau, Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and ADA Coordinator for the City of Medford.

3
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:08,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I will pop on it.

4
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:10,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Over to you, Cameron.

5
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:14,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Frances.

6
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:15,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi all.

7
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:19,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Cam Nab, Medford Disability Commissioner.

8
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:19,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Over to Susan.

9
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:23,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Kim.

10
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Susan Bibbins.

11
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:29,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I Commissioner.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have been on the commission forever, I think.

13
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:45,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget just how long I've been on the commission.

14
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:45,427
[SPEAKER_05]: But

15
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:54,468
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good number of years and I am serving happily and gratefully.

16
00:00:54,488 --> 00:01:07,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And I live in South Medford, happily and gratefully.

17
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Popcorning over to you, John.

18
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:20,363
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean me?

19
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:20,423
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

20
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:23,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm John Shaib.

21
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:27,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a disabled Medford resident.

22
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:36,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been attending the meetings here and doing some things with the city, which is pretty exciting, and trying to become engaged with this committee.

23
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:45,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got about 30 years of political experience around the Boston area and other places.

24
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:47,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all.

25
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,066
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, just ask me, OK?

26
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:56,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

27
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, John.

28
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:11,106
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to hand it over to Nick to introduce himself, because I'm sure you've seen Nick see seeds in much of the correspondence that I've sent.

29
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:14,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think only Susan has met Nick.

30
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:20,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good evening, everyone, and thank you very much, Ms.

31
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:20,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis.

32
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,673
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that don't know me, my name is Nicholas Karikaringa.

33
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a Medford resident.

34
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:35,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been for 28 years, so for the majority of my life.

35
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:52,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, I am the part-time dis-di-di- I'm the part-time disability specialist that goes to work with this lovely lady, Miss Frances.

36
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:57,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, um, so we share one, one office.

37
00:02:57,086 --> 00:03:02,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you come in to see her, most likely you'll come in and see me too.

38
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:03,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

39
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:11,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am also a young man with CP.

40
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:20,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been diagnosed with it from the age of about three months.

41
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is my life and my world.

42
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:27,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I am happy to be able to

43
00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:31,544
[SPEAKER_02]: make a difference and to work with you guys.

44
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:35,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to seeing what it is that all y'all do.

45
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:52,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny, I've lived in, like I said, for pretty much my whole life, and yet I've never been on one of these meetings, so I'm looking forward to working with you guys.

46
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,477
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have any questions, feel free to ask.

47
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:02,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

48
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:05,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Nick.

49
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:15,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's really, really exciting for me because Nick sort of just, you know when these things just happen at the right time?

50
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sort of happened at the right time.

51
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I literally, as you know, it's an office of one up to here.

52
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,683
[SPEAKER_06]: underwater all the time, needing to be in many different areas.

53
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:35,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, in one of my days, I got a call from somebody saying they wanted to talk to me about their son.

54
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, well, what about your son?

55
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,712
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and they were like, oh, a job.

56
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:41,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm thinking, oh, it's a complaint.

57
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:45,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And last year, you know, we had our funds.

58
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:53,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I was able to use our funds to bring in some high school students to do some short term coverage for us.

59
00:04:54,281 --> 00:05:02,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Whilst our lift went down for a full mechanical exchange, I think it was down for about 6 to 8 weeks.

60
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:02,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

61
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:05,387
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was still some funding left over.

62
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And I needed two things.

63
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I needed a disability specialist, meaning somebody who could be the eyes and the ears when I can't get out, right?

64
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:23,282
[SPEAKER_06]: If I've got five meetings already, five different places that I need to be, it's very, very difficult.

65
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:28,367
[SPEAKER_06]: To go to that site visit and do that walkability tour at tough.

66
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:28,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

67
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever I'm required and then meeting Nick.

68
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:41,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Nick was referred by my friends next door to me, the voters registration folks and.

69
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick said that this was something that he would be interested in.

70
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,961
[SPEAKER_06]: He likes that project work approach.

71
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:57,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And I cannot tell you how grateful and how much of a difference it makes.

72
00:05:57,703 --> 00:06:04,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that I email you a lot, but I have one time a month is when I get to see you, right?

73
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:07,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get to have the conversations that

74
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: than can I with anybody, right?

75
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:23,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to wait till the fourth Wednesday of the month to see the commissioners so that I can talk to them about this crazy thing that I saw in the disability scoop that is really driving me nuts, right?

76
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Or to give them an update.

77
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:34,396
[SPEAKER_06]: But I get to do that for a good 15 hours a week with Nick and it's extremely refreshing and seeing, you know,

78
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:39,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing things from the lens that Nick brings to the table.

79
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:45,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Right and having that confidence and knowing that, oh, I don't have to make that decision.

80
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:49,990
[SPEAKER_06]: By myself, it's it's very impactful.

81
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,531
[SPEAKER_06]: It's extremely meaningful.

82
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:54,814
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to that, Nick is also.

83
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:59,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Big instrumental in helping in some of my work.

84
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:23,032
[SPEAKER_06]: helping to put the Black History Month event together, helping to pen some of the memos that go out on our office's behalf, researching grants, and helping me determine which ones might be safe enough for us.

85
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:26,953
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you know, it's like a catch-22 right now.

86
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:35,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But I, for one, am definitely very grateful to have Nick join.

87
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:44,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this will be helpful for us as the Disability Commission and as we continue to plan towards our events.

88
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:49,483
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Anthony, you're up.

89
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:59,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Anthony might just be listening.

90
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,179
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe what I'll do is I'll just go through.

91
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:02,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, can you hear me now?

92
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we can hear you now.

93
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I was muted.

94
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,262
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.

95
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Anthony Andreodla.

96
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:13,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a blind Metro resident.

97
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:15,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lived here for the most of my life.

98
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:22,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Very active in advocating for the disabled community.

99
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:23,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing it for many years.

100
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:28,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dad of a former commissioner.

101
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,904
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter was on the commission for I think five or six years up until recently.

102
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:49,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Gabrielle, you all may know her or not, but I'm just interested in seeing where I might fit in serving the Method community.

103
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:54,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never sat on

104
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:11,645
[SPEAKER_01]: the Disability Commission, and I don't know if it's the right fit for me, but I'm going to sit in for a meeting or two to see if there's any way I might be able to help or contribute in some way.

105
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:16,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can, we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

106
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:17,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

107
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:28,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Anthony, you know, I think it's great that people want to be committed to cause, especially a cause within, you know, for their community.

108
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:38,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I certainly welcome you and I'm sure the other commissioners do as well to sit on and hang out for a couple of meetings.

109
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:48,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I do believe that that is what John has done for the past 3 meetings now, if I'm correct and John will be letting me know.

110
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:57,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Soon, if this is an avenue that John would like to pursue, it's always it's always a fine balance, right?

111
00:09:57,457 --> 00:10:11,562
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we all have our passions and our dreams, but we're governed by ordinance and we try to work within the ordinance with our small, but mighty crew to help support the needs of as many as possible.

112
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:15,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's what folks don't understand is commissioners.

113
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:18,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Receive a tremendous amount of information from me.

114
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:23,768
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also 1 of the commissions that there is no stipend attached.

115
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:29,572
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and if you're like, a, you'll get a random email from me that says, can you call me?

116
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:34,954
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it's because I need to run something by somebody quickly.

117
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:41,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just, you know, throwing that out there in case there are people that think like, oh, it's just a once a month and we get together.

118
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:47,637
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's a lot that's a lot happening behind the scenes that folks don't get to see.

119
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:53,418
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we have Kate on with us, which is doing welcome and introductions, Kate.

120
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:59,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm sorry, I'm wearing a mask because my PCA is here.

121
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Kate.

122
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:04,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I've applied for the commission over a year ago.

123
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:05,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I never heard back.

124
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:06,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I have emailed you.

125
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:07,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I have called you.

126
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:08,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard anything.

127
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:13,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So I showed up to see, like, what's going on.

128
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:15,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And I only assume that my

129
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:28,524
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that I'm more interested in the civil rights than, like, raising awareness, like, might dissuade people, but, like, they opened the new library three years ago.

130
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:33,872
[SPEAKER_04]: The makerspace isn't accessible, and they're jerks about it to the point where I've given up on using it.

131
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:58,966
[SPEAKER_06]: And okay, can I just pause you for a minute only because we were doing welcome and introductions and then we can circle back so that that way I can actually take notes because if you're talking about something that's not in the agenda, it almost seems as if you are filing a complaint or you're asking us to look into something.

132
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:04,547
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm giving an example of things that I noticed around Medford that need to be changed.

133
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:09,109
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, can we do that when we get to the patient?

134
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:12,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I've been an advocate for many years.

135
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:17,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a professional and educational background in it, all the fancy degrees and stuff.

136
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:29,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I live in West Medford and I have many, many multiple disabilities, none of which I actually recommend.

137
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:32,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, yeah.

138
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:33,610
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

139
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,856
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you so much, Kate.

140
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:40,777
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, disability fear update.

141
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:49,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, it was like playing volley trying to find who was responsible for booking this all-inclusive playground.

142
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:57,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally yesterday, the day before the meeting, I got it sorted out.

143
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:00,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I went with the May 10th date.

144
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:03,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember we said May 10th or May 17th.

145
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:05,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I went with the May 10th date.

146
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:13,782
[SPEAKER_06]: The 11 to 2 timeframe, and I made a mistake when I said the Andrews, it's actually the.

147
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:20,006
[SPEAKER_06]: That is right that is right adjacent to the.

148
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:25,483
[SPEAKER_06]: to the playground, you would go through the cafeteria.

149
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:26,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all one level.

150
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:31,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So I booked that as well for two reasons.

151
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:38,265
[SPEAKER_06]: In case we end up having inclement weather and we have to move everything inside, there's plenty of space, it's all on one floor.

152
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:50,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we don't have inclement weather, we can do some, the cafeteria area is big enough to cordon off and have different opportunities to help meet as many needs as possible.

153
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:59,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say the cafeteria area, just keep in mind that all those tables that you see and everything, they fold up and they move out of the way.

154
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:06,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're really talking about a huge surface area, plenty of parking and everything.

155
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:09,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we ready team?

156
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Susan, Nick, Kim, are we ready?

157
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:19,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you ready to remember?

158
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goodness gracious.

159
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

160
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:30,076
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was that update that I wanted to give you and I wanted to also share with you the

161
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:42,470
[SPEAKER_06]: participants, not the people that were invited, right?

162
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:53,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Those that participated, the vendors that were actually on site, and then go through the big list with you of people that were spoken to and everything.

163
00:14:53,277 --> 00:15:03,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I kept a master list all the way from June, just before you went on holiday, to September when you came back from holiday.

164
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:05,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?

165
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:11,677
[SPEAKER_06]: really asking primarily Susan and Cam.

166
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:14,019
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds good.

167
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:20,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we, I just don't know, John, Kate, Anthony, have you heard of the Disability Fair?

168
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:23,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it worth a short recap of what the event is?

169
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what it is, and it's about awareness, right?

170
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I think awareness is a part.

171
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:39,774
[SPEAKER_08]: My understanding, Kate, is the secondary goal is to connect folks with potential supports.

172
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:53,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So like different vendors will be there to, you know, connect with Medford citizens that might be interested in their services.

173
00:15:54,167 --> 00:16:15,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And also making sure people are aware, especially people with disabilities are aware of like most recent, whether it's changes, whether it's MBTA offerings, whether it's Uber things, getting as many disability focused people in the same space as possible to actually talk about the different things that are in place.

174
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:21,206
[SPEAKER_04]: are you going to be talking about the eugenicist policies of the current national administration?

175
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:24,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe that that will be on the agenda.

176
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:37,754
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, I'm just asking the commissioners if I can share the list to show who came before because we are already at February.

177
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:42,857
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good thing is that the groundwork has already been done.

178
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:44,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I have to find it.

179
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.

180
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, John.

181
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,782
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people were at the last one?

182
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:52,043
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of groups attend?

183
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:53,664
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you say it was going to be at the high school?

184
00:16:56,408 --> 00:17:04,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So John, what I can tell you is that if I remember correctly, it was 20 something vendors that were present, right?

185
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:11,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember so much about how many people because I was, the timing was kind of off, right?

186
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It was scheduled for October.

187
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,340
[SPEAKER_06]: The commission goes on holiday.

188
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,682
[SPEAKER_06]: June is the last meeting.

189
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:20,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So July and August, I had to,

190
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:36,214
[SPEAKER_06]: get as much pushed in and done as possible to hand over in September to say, hey, listen, it was the first one that was done in the time frame that I have been here as far as what happened before.

191
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:39,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have information on that.

192
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

193
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,411
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty well, can I say?

194
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:44,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead.

195
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:45,233
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Anthony.

196
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:49,775
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about the one that was at West Medford two years ago, is that correct?

197
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:50,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

198
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:52,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was pretty well attended.

199
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,378
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a number of people there.

200
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there and the crowd was a pretty good size.

201
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:06,325
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of, some people with disabilities, some just neighborhood.

202
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:17,387
[SPEAKER_01]: folks, people interested in learning about disabilities, politicians, you know, civic leaders, state rep was there, the mayor.

203
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:19,468
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty good.

204
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:21,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it went very well.

205
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:29,870
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was one of the better events the city had put on.

206
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Francis did a great job with it, you know.

207
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:38,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And my daughter was there, too, so I'm a little biased.

208
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:43,397
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought it was a great success.

209
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:45,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Anthony.

210
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,379
[SPEAKER_06]: You helped to jog my memory.

211
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:47,939
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

212
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not last year.

213
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:51,840
[SPEAKER_06]: It was definitely two years ago.

214
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just remembered, I reached out to the library because we bought the film.

215
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:00,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my gosh.

216
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:01,863
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the film that we shot?

217
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:11,397
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Melanie McLaughlin that did a presentation in, I believe, a film.

218
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,080
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a school committee member.

219
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:19,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was a film that we showed.

220
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:25,205
[SPEAKER_06]: It will come to me in a minute, and I have it on the flyer, so I can share with you, Kim.

221
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,446
[SPEAKER_06]: It escaped my mind.

222
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sort of assumed everybody knew.

223
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:33,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I realized that you actually don't even know what that flyer looked like at that time.

224
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:45,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did have a video viewing, and the library was very kind enough to purchase the licensed version for us so that we could show it.

225
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:49,122
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here's what I'm going to do.

226
00:19:49,142 --> 00:20:01,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to... You know, you do these things, you run the risk of showing the wrong thing.

227
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:04,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

228
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:05,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit.

229
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:08,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Does everybody see that?

230
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:08,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

231
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we're documenting Saturday, October 7, 2023.

232
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:20,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it says my screen has paused.

233
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:20,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

234
00:20:21,797 --> 00:20:22,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody show me something.

235
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,222
[SPEAKER_07]: You can all see it, but I can't see it anymore.

236
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:30,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Try this again.

237
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:31,524
[SPEAKER_05]: He can't see it.

238
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:32,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see it.

239
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:37,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just took it down because it told me that my screen was paused and then.

240
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,591
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, yeah.

241
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:48,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did it, this year we're saying 11 to two, so that's three hours.

242
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year we did it for four hours.

243
00:20:51,971 --> 00:21:03,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Confirmed attendees were the Arc of Massachusetts, Meg and Phoebe Kane, Armstrong Ambulance was present, Cara of Best Buddies was present.

244
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:12,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I had Chapters Coffee Cart provide refreshments on site that people could purchase.

245
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:16,619
[SPEAKER_06]: They were present.

246
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,502
[SPEAKER_06]: The members of the Disabled Persons Protection Committee, there was a whole group of them that were there.

247
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:33,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them were focused on sexual assault cases and some, the typical reporting that occurs, but they were present as well.

248
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:39,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Easterseals, Jeff from Triangle was there.

249
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:50,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked with the Massachusetts Developmental Disabilities Council, different agency.

250
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:54,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like Department of Developmental Services, two different agencies.

251
00:21:55,468 --> 00:22:06,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you recall during that time, there was still a lot of talk about how the pandemic affected people with respiratory situations and people were still very nervous.

252
00:22:09,515 --> 00:22:16,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So they confirmed that they would host a COVID vaccine clinic during that time.

253
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:27,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the batches of vaccine that was supposed to be released got pushed back two weeks.

254
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So we couldn't have it on that day, but they did make good.

255
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:35,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we had another event.

256
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:43,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we did something quick on an evening and they were able to provide the vaccines.

257
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:49,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I'm not mistaken, it was about 40 something people that got vaccinated that evening.

258
00:22:52,071 --> 00:23:15,182
[SPEAKER_06]: let's say Medford Family Network, the fire department was there, public schools, school department was there, police department was present, rec was not present, but Murrow's Wakefield, Tufts Medical, there, Playful Pelican was there, Triangle Inc.

259
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:18,003
[SPEAKER_06]: was there, Tufts University was there.

260
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Waypoint was present, right?

261
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:25,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Walnut Street Center was there.

262
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:31,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So these were the people that confirmed the attendance and actually came.

263
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:36,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm going to show you.

264
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:41,267
[SPEAKER_06]: the giant Excel spreadsheet because there were so many other people.

265
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:55,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I did was I was just typing in my correspondence with them and things that they said so that if we came to this time, we could look and we could say, hey, remember you said you could help us dance?

266
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,301
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what I mean?

267
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:00,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm not going to remember all this.

268
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this event was last year.

269
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:03,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It was two years ago.

270
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:07,448
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so let me pull that one up.

271
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we are.

272
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:18,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

273
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:27,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So, these are all the people that I reached out to.

274
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:39,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Boston Dance Alliance was referred to me by Jamie Robinson of Deaf Infinitely.

275
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:45,432
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would call one group and then they would refer me to other groups.

276
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least we have like contact information.

277
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it was just a very raw organic list.

278
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we had other partners like mass commission for the blind.

279
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:30,078
[SPEAKER_06]: They sent they sent information and materials and I, I recently put the last set of information out.

280
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:32,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So, some of our state providers.

281
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:39,943
[SPEAKER_06]: that could not be on site actually participated by making sure that they got resource materials to me.

282
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:47,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that MCB did that I loved was, you know, they sent me duplicate materials, right?

283
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:52,551
[SPEAKER_06]: What may be considered your typical size and what is also considered your large print size.

284
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:58,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was nice because I've been able to use those materials here at City Hall.

285
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:09,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, mass office and disability, they sent brochures as well.

286
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a line on the ride at the T. Okay.

287
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:35,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember and I need to lay hands on the contact information.

288
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:35,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

289
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:37,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be lovely.

290
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:48,236
[SPEAKER_05]: But they do travel training, both individually and in groups for kids all the way up to seniors.

291
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:48,556
[SPEAKER_05]: They do,

292
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:09,511
[SPEAKER_05]: RTAG does child training and mapping and a whole bunch of other stuff.

293
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:19,060
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that the ride at the T said that they would be happy to come out if we had a fair.

294
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:23,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So, dude, that is absolutely wonderful.

295
00:27:23,786 --> 00:27:29,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And whenever you have a chance, you can email me the information and I will add it to this list.

296
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:37,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, I think it just it makes it easier for us to know who participated before because we can go right back to them.

297
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:41,713
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want me to, I can send a mass email on your behalf to all of them.

298
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:42,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

299
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:43,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

300
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:44,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

301
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:46,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And then go back to the ones that

302
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:52,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, weren't able to participate or that, you know, we weren't able to connect.

303
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:59,252
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that that is great, especially now with so many changes that are.

304
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:01,334
[SPEAKER_06]: that are happening.

305
00:28:01,394 --> 00:28:14,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, one minute I was really rejoicing that Uber would now, you know, accept service animals, but then on the other hand, as I was reading the thing, it still felt like the drivers could opt out.

306
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

307
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:22,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually speaking with colleague Shanine Pelequin, and it's just like, but it's the law.

308
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:23,980
[SPEAKER_06]: It's transportation.

309
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, everybody... Yeah.

310
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,640
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

311
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:29,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

312
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:31,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So much happening.

313
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't feel like a gain.

314
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:34,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

315
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:35,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

316
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like a chickeny gain, right?

317
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:42,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, okay, we're going to make you think that you've got something, but you really don't have anything.

318
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

319
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:50,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just making the note that May 10th is the fair, 11 a.m.

320
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:52,435
[SPEAKER_06]: to 2 p.m.

321
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:53,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

322
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:56,377
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

323
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:04,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we have, let me stop sharing because it's a bit awkward because I can't see any of you.

324
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:05,514
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

325
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:18,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we have the date, the time, the location, would you remember commissioners?

326
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two of you on today.

327
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,164
[SPEAKER_06]: You have my help.

328
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:26,565
[SPEAKER_06]: You have Nick's help.

329
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick is 15 hours a week.

330
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:34,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So consider between Nick and I at least three and a half forehands, right?

331
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:35,534
[SPEAKER_06]: You know me.

332
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I love what we do.

333
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:40,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm willing to go all in.

334
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:47,178
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think would be better?

335
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:55,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I approach our yes people first, our people that attended before first and say, hey, this is happening.

336
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:57,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you be interested in coming back?

337
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:00,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

338
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:05,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

339
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:13,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And for instance, maybe also just ask them if there's anything they'd like to see different this time around.

340
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:16,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, definitely.

341
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:22,731
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

342
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:26,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can do that.

343
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:27,933
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty easy list.

344
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:36,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And I somewhere can, somewhere over the rainbow, but somewhere in this office, there are a few evaluation forms.

345
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:37,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick, don't laugh.

346
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,697
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what this office looks like.

347
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:42,979
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had back-to-back event season, okay.

348
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:48,484
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Lunar New Year, we have Black History Month community-facing, Black History Month employee luncheon.

349
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:50,646
[SPEAKER_06]: In here, it's like the Amazon warehouse.

350
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:56,052
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not safe for anybody, not even myself, you know.

351
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:05,941
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do have some evaluation forms that some people did complete and return, so I won't dig them up.

352
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:17,259
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of creating the flyer, do you have a vision of what you would like it to look like?

353
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:30,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, for instance, before flyer, I was thinking agenda, like I know, or at least I think, and he's dropped, but I think the last time we had the disability fair, we had a speaker.

354
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:34,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I think something like that would be awesome.

355
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:35,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And then,

356
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:54,440
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I came at the tail end of the disability fair, and I think maybe having something at the beginning and something at the end feels like it could keep the energy up and, you know, be nice bookmarks to the three hours together.

357
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:58,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm listening, Cameron.

358
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:02,813
[SPEAKER_06]: As you were talking, I was trying to find something that would help us out.

359
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:03,854
[SPEAKER_08]: All good.

360
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:12,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the idea of Susan, John, Nick, Kate, like a speaker to open us, you know.

361
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:15,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, perfect.

362
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:15,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I see.

363
00:32:15,606 --> 00:32:16,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

364
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:19,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the flyer, you have the sort of agenda.

365
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:25,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we had a flyer flyer that we used.

366
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:34,973
[SPEAKER_06]: We used Medford blue, and if I'm not mistaken, we used colors from Disability Pride, right?

367
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:45,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we intentionally minimalized the DIS and ensured that the word ability was capitalized.

368
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:55,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up switching around with, I actually had Gabby MC and run the program for me.

369
00:32:55,303 --> 00:33:02,527
[SPEAKER_06]: There was something else that was going on that I had to now attend to, to both the fair and whatever was happening.

370
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:04,848
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's all coming back to me.

371
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:07,909
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was just Intelligent Lives.

372
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,810
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the movie.

373
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,471
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the midpoint movie that we viewed.

374
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:23,335
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was just, again, this was first time out the gate trying to put something together to really get the commission on the map, right?

375
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:36,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really important that we showcase disabled speakers and disabled

376
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:51,564
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, employees and artists and that kind of thing.

377
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:55,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Just it's not less times

378
00:34:06,036 --> 00:34:18,242
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, had no disabled, you know, all the speakers were parents or carers or worked with disabled people.

379
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:25,685
[SPEAKER_05]: And I felt that I felt the lack.

380
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:30,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I was a little disappointed in the lack.

381
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:33,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know,

382
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:50,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it would be important to have a person with disabilities as a speaker this time.

383
00:34:58,085 --> 00:35:02,266
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think it's true, but I'll just point out a couple of reminders.

384
00:35:02,346 --> 00:35:08,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Not every disability is visible and not everybody chooses to disclose their disability.

385
00:35:08,468 --> 00:35:10,248
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very true.

386
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:11,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very true.

387
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:18,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Also the fact that it is all of our responsibilities to pull it all together.

388
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:26,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you recall, the responsibility ended up falling in one and a half people.

389
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,363
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very true and I know you did a beautiful job.

390
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:39,970
[SPEAKER_06]: It is what it is and I got us up and we survived and we learned from it and now we can do better by it.

391
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:47,157
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Susan you were talking about disabled artists and so many different things were coming to my mind and I'm like oh my gosh

392
00:35:48,535 --> 00:36:00,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I wrote the name on the spreadsheet of the music band people that I had reached out to, but I had reached out to them for something else, not the disability fair.

393
00:36:00,938 --> 00:36:07,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to go back and look and make sure that I had entered their name into it.

394
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that that is essential, right?

395
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:15,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is really both a celebration and education

396
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,801
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity.

397
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:21,883
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sort of how I see it.

398
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:25,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So I definitely agree.

399
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:37,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think that between you, between my friends over at Arts Collaborative, I think that we, when we talk about disabled artists of a variety of different mediums,

400
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can get it done, right?

401
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:48,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just thinking artists, we're not even talking, we're not even getting into like the different mediums of art.

402
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:59,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So I definitely agree that that should certainly be our focus, like having as much involvement

403
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:03,954
[SPEAKER_06]: from people who actually have disabilities as possible.

404
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:15,137
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will be clear though, I cannot be paralyzed by, I'll call you back, because we have to put the flyer out, right?

405
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,237
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to get things done.

406
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:19,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but we gotta do what we gotta do.

407
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so at some point we'll do what we need to do.

408
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:24,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Kate has her hand up.

409
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:35,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I was going to finish cameras agenda related questions and then go to questions final questions about the actual fair itself.

410
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, no, no, don't be sorry.

411
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:45,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So, any other ideas of how the day should flow?

412
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:51,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So, something in the beginning to talk, something in the end, tying everything together.

413
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:54,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other suggestions?

414
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:57,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I think two more, Frances.

415
00:37:57,507 --> 00:38:02,188
[SPEAKER_08]: One is like a participation list if people want to

416
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:09,495
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, leave their information, we can include them on future events that the Disability Commission holds.

417
00:38:11,817 --> 00:38:24,728
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it struck me that your information that you send us is so great, like we could package that and send it to interested Medford residents as a

418
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:50,808
[SPEAKER_08]: disability digest you know i so um and then finally um we worked last year on that uh new resident uh guide i think if we could print it out and get folks to comment on you know other resources that we should add other pain points that we should address um i know the

419
00:38:51,908 --> 00:39:00,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Last commission spent a lot of time on that and it'd be great to get feedback from the public on on if it's meeting the need.

420
00:39:02,312 --> 00:39:13,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I've got ensure that ensure that there's more focus on people with disabilities being involved in the actual event.

421
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:14,937
[SPEAKER_06]: A participation list and.

422
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:19,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's cheering going on.

423
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:20,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what is happening.

424
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:29,935
[SPEAKER_08]: For the not for the participation list, it's I think it's the good kind.

425
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:36,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we, we, sometimes we have interruptions as a result of people exercising their rights.

426
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So leave it at that.

427
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:41,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there is a participation list somewhere.

428
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:43,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I will double check.

429
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:50,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, people because people signed in and I believe that there was a section.

430
00:39:50,128 --> 00:39:53,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I always ask, would you like to be involved in the commission?

431
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to hear more information about the commission?

432
00:39:58,152 --> 00:39:58,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

433
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:03,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Double check and then the new residents guide.

434
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I don't have that 1.

435
00:40:11,796 --> 00:40:17,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, both Gabby and our former chairs have all remember the Google Doc.

436
00:40:19,226 --> 00:40:19,667
[SPEAKER_08]: We got it.

437
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:20,288
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an email.

438
00:40:20,368 --> 00:40:20,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll send it to you.

439
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:21,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

440
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:21,970
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

441
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

442
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:22,951
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

443
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:23,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

444
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:27,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, we'll definitely start looking on that.

445
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:35,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you all all right if I update you via email just the same way I typically do?

446
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:41,668
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just respond individually so that it doesn't look like we're voting or if I forgot something.

447
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,790
[SPEAKER_06]: But Nick, what are your thoughts?

448
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this is

449
00:40:49,288 --> 00:40:50,149
[SPEAKER_02]: been so far.

450
00:40:50,169 --> 00:40:54,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what I'm hearing.

451
00:40:56,671 --> 00:41:03,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I wasn't there at the time, so I don't know exactly how last time went.

452
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:08,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Which brings me to my second point, I think.

453
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:16,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we are a small but mighty group.

454
00:41:17,653 --> 00:41:33,758
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think something that needs to be taken into account is that there are people in the Medford city who do not know the resources that are available to them.

455
00:41:35,979 --> 00:41:42,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've lived in Medford my whole life and didn't even know that this group was a thing.

456
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:57,501
[SPEAKER_02]: went out of the city to go to high school at a private school, I kind of lost contact with all things.

457
00:41:57,661 --> 00:42:06,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I think having some type of digest or having some type of city mail that would go out

458
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:18,316
[SPEAKER_02]: can you figure out, hey, if you have a disability, these are resources for you.

459
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:20,337
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things that we do.

460
00:42:20,377 --> 00:42:22,337
[SPEAKER_02]: These are people you can contact.

461
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:23,738
[SPEAKER_02]: These are places you can go.

462
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:27,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be extremely helpful.

463
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

464
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me not be long-winded, but yeah.

465
00:42:35,562 --> 00:42:37,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Nick, you could be long winded.

466
00:42:37,964 --> 00:42:43,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to rescue one of our commissioners who can't find the Zoom link.

467
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to discreetly send it on.

468
00:42:50,055 --> 00:42:50,536
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

469
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:51,637
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

470
00:42:52,577 --> 00:42:53,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

471
00:42:55,044 --> 00:42:57,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think that those are all great points, right?

472
00:42:57,365 --> 00:43:09,108
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about communication and how much communication can you do and what avenues, you know, what are your avenues that you're using to communicate to get the information out?

473
00:43:09,308 --> 00:43:13,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that I've, you know, continued to build a good partnership with the schools.

474
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:16,250
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a result, you have the parent groups.

475
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,070
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they called?

476
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're called parent groups, right?

477
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:20,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what it means?

478
00:43:21,737 --> 00:43:21,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

479
00:43:22,497 --> 00:43:22,877
[SPEAKER_06]: C-PACT.

480
00:43:22,897 --> 00:43:23,478
[SPEAKER_06]: C-PACT.

481
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:24,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

482
00:43:24,278 --> 00:43:27,519
[SPEAKER_06]: That you can, you know, send information through now, right?

483
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:38,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Some principal isn't just getting some random email from, you know, from a Francis Wange who they've never met before that says, please share.

484
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:42,344
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that is wonderful.

485
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:43,785
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

486
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:48,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick, I'm volunteering us.

487
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:58,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, because it's really, it is our job and our role as our office to lift up the commission and help them get started.

488
00:43:58,912 --> 00:44:03,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Some volunteering us in terms of starting some correspondence and.

489
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:19,083
[SPEAKER_06]: looking through the mini warehouse in here to find some of those documents that Cam referenced, see if maybe we can update the style, see if they're still suitable, that type of stuff, and get this going.

490
00:44:19,763 --> 00:44:20,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that okay?

491
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, very excited.

492
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, very, very excited.

493
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:34,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I said, commissioners, I will keep you all updated.

494
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:39,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Kate, do you want to ask your question now?

495
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:43,088
[SPEAKER_06]: We just finished the Disability Fair agenda.

496
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:54,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I remember the last Disability Fair and I remember deciding not to go to it and encouraging disabled people to not go to it because you did not have a disabled speaker.

497
00:44:54,473 --> 00:44:56,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that that was absolutely beyond the pale.

498
00:44:58,335 --> 00:45:03,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wonder why you had somebody who is known to be incredibly ableist as a speaker.

499
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:15,367
[SPEAKER_04]: and who has previously was the reason that I left the Disability Commission because he yelled at me so many times here that I could not be around him.

500
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:22,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think any of us were here anymore.

501
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:23,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Susan was.

502
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:25,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Susan was.

503
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,691
[SPEAKER_04]: She knows exactly who I'm talking about.

504
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:28,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

505
00:45:28,952 --> 00:45:31,293
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know if it's polite to name names, so I'm not.

506
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,391
[SPEAKER_04]: many people know who I'm talking about.

507
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:47,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, maybe we don't have to name names, but I think it's helpful maybe for us to make sure that that person is not a speaker this time.

508
00:45:47,957 --> 00:45:56,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Kate, you had a strong reaction and we want to make sure the event is as inclusive for folks as possible and someone that

509
00:45:58,529 --> 00:46:01,611
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, has made you feel uncomfortable, shouldn't be on the speaker list.

510
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:03,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did not.

511
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:07,176
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just my normal voice because I am autistic.

512
00:46:07,216 --> 00:46:08,457
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my normal voice.

513
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:10,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was not made uncomfortable.

514
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:12,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I was traumatized.

515
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:24,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So, here's what I will say, I think that it's important to remember that the commission approaches everything with as much respect as possible.

516
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:29,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And if people are not here for the history of things.

517
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:31,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Then people won't know.

518
00:46:33,463 --> 00:46:35,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am going to leave it at that.

519
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:54,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we have spoken candidly about some of the shortcomings, but instead of using the energy to continuously repeat the shortcomings, I want to stay excited and energized and look on how we can

520
00:46:55,567 --> 00:47:02,511
[SPEAKER_06]: do better and make sure that we do better on behalf of all people for the city of Medford.

521
00:47:03,332 --> 00:47:11,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, whether it's anybody that is attending this or anybody that ends up watching the recorded version, people don't know what they don't know.

522
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:14,879
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a result, they shouldn't be held accountable.

523
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,462
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody does not share with you ahead of time, hey, are you aware?

524
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:29,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you have no knowledge, so I don't want it to appear as though the commission or the commissioners moved with intention with specific knowledge.

525
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:32,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that would be wrong.

526
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:35,648
[SPEAKER_06]: The commissioners did not know.

527
00:47:37,008 --> 00:47:45,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was not informed of anything either in terms of a speaker being being an ableist.

528
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:46,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

529
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:55,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's important for folks to remember that there is something called integrity.

530
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:06,706
[SPEAKER_06]: And if such had been communicated with me, it would have been done by email and there would have been some back and forth correspondence.

531
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:24,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know Kate, I know that you had not, when I first started, you had mentioned that somebody had made you feel bad, but you referred to the person as the chair at that time, but you never provided to me with the name.

532
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:27,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So that I do recall.

533
00:48:28,926 --> 00:48:37,590
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would like to move on and see how we can continue to do better and grow from the opportunity.

534
00:48:40,371 --> 00:48:44,393
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so Nick and I, we've got a task list.

535
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:48,076
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may just jump in there, Ms.

536
00:48:48,096 --> 00:48:48,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Frances.

537
00:48:48,976 --> 00:48:53,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so everybody knows, I don't make Nick call me Ms.

538
00:48:53,939 --> 00:48:54,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Frances.

539
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I have asked Nick numerous times to call me Frances.

540
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:58,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so everybody knows.

541
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, she has not asked me to, in fact, she should ask me not to, but my mom, but my mom always knew well.

542
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:15,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't even think about it.

543
00:49:16,343 --> 00:49:21,684
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

544
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:25,284
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, just kind of

545
00:49:29,387 --> 00:49:33,248
[SPEAKER_02]: piggyback on that last point by Mitch Francis.

546
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:48,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, I come from Kenya, and in my language, we have a saying that says, basically, if you don't know what you don't know, you don't know.

547
00:49:50,513 --> 00:49:51,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, again, as

548
00:49:57,742 --> 00:50:23,624
[SPEAKER_02]: As a person who is also disabled and is a part of the disabled community, I would have to say that if you see something wrong and you don't tell people and you tell fellow disabled people to not go, then it's just perpetuating the cycle.

549
00:50:25,247 --> 00:50:29,208
[SPEAKER_02]: because then nobody will know what they're doing wrong.

550
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:40,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody will know if they did something right because they won't know that they did something wrong.

551
00:50:43,271 --> 00:50:49,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So in all that, I would say, like, please try to come.

552
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:02,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And if something is done wrong, then tell us so that we can fix that and make that change so that we know.

553
00:51:03,346 --> 00:51:04,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we don't know, we don't know.

554
00:51:05,987 --> 00:51:06,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

555
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:09,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that, Nick.

556
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,090
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

557
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:14,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to City Hall.

558
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:17,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

559
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:18,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I had another idea.

560
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:20,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

561
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:26,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we have a quiet room?

562
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,667
[SPEAKER_05]: like a quiet sensory room last time?

563
00:51:38,587 --> 00:51:53,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we did last time was there was the room when we found out that the vaccines could not happen, the room that was supposed to be used for the vaccines was what we used.

564
00:51:53,874 --> 00:52:02,758
[SPEAKER_06]: But this year we will have a lot more surface area space where we would be able to have like a quiet room.

565
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:08,245
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, Susan, all I can remember is her first name, Tanya.

566
00:52:09,046 --> 00:52:24,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Tanya does massages, but there is specific type of massage for people with sensory issues, people with cerebral palsy, people with CP.

567
00:52:25,214 --> 00:52:27,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Tanya is on that list.

568
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:36,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And last year, by the time I connected with Tanya, it was the event was already planned.

569
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:42,813
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm thinking like something like that, you know, somebody experiencing like a 10 minute massage.

570
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not saying that she's going to do it, but these are the things.

571
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

572
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:58,804
[SPEAKER_05]: A sensory quiet room is good for those who are experiencing sensory overload.

573
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:02,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, whoever would ask and get the consent of

574
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:14,013
[SPEAKER_05]: people who want to have this massage.

575
00:53:14,513 --> 00:53:15,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, definitely.

576
00:53:15,034 --> 00:53:19,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of people in sensory overload don't want to be touched.

577
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:20,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

578
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:21,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, definitely.

579
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:23,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be for her.

580
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,963
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be for the person to sort out.

581
00:53:28,023 --> 00:53:36,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just thinking like different opportunities that we could have making use of all the wonderful space.

582
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:39,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

583
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

584
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:59,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this year, instead of the police coming with, let's say, facts of life materials and stuff, they'll actually come with one of the vehicles that they use during their sensory week to help just a variety of different things.

585
00:54:00,078 --> 00:54:00,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

586
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,581
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it would be good if we had a sensory.

587
00:54:07,513 --> 00:54:10,379
[SPEAKER_05]: separate area, quiet room.

588
00:54:12,408 --> 00:54:15,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let me go to an unsigned again.

589
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:28,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I saw it recently, but I think we have even more space than we actually realize, because we would have the entire, really, the entire first floor all the way out.

590
00:54:28,878 --> 00:54:33,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Some place that we could darken and keep quiet.

591
00:54:34,262 --> 00:54:34,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

592
00:54:38,204 --> 00:54:38,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

593
00:54:39,146 --> 00:54:42,974
[SPEAKER_05]: But a few like cushy chairs and stuff like that.

594
00:54:42,994 --> 00:54:44,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, definitely.

595
00:54:44,436 --> 00:54:46,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to chill out.

596
00:54:47,473 --> 00:55:06,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, I could definitely talk with also, see if I can connect with Charlotte over at the school, Charlotte Prime, who is the occupational therapist for the district and get some ideas on how to utilize some of the space that is already there.

597
00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:16,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I would be looking at indoors and if we needed to sort of like build out our own space, like what are some ideas and suggestions?

598
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick, did you have your hands up or was I?

599
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:22,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

600
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:24,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Two things.

601
00:55:24,574 --> 00:55:29,024
[SPEAKER_02]: One, I am laughing to myself right now because I actually

602
00:55:30,115 --> 00:55:43,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte Heim was my own PT when I went to the murmur, murmur, murmur, so she knows me quite well.

603
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:54,559
[SPEAKER_02]: But regarding the sensory room, I can already picture two rooms that would be

604
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,141
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect for that.

605
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:07,407
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be the lounge that is right across from the cafeteria.

606
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:19,394
[SPEAKER_02]: If you walk into the front door of the cafeteria, it's on your left and then there's the lounge on your right.

607
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:21,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one.

608
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:21,835
[SPEAKER_02]: If

609
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:35,171
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't need something that big, I'm pretty sure there's a teacher's lounge on the far side of the cafeteria.

610
00:56:36,752 --> 00:56:41,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think either one of those two rooms would work well.

611
00:56:45,617 --> 00:56:51,261
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I first thought about the lounge is that there's more

612
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:56,652
[SPEAKER_02]: room to spread out in case we have more people.

613
00:56:58,273 --> 00:57:07,362
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there are some children in the teacher's lounge that are comfortable, if I'm not mistaken, if I know, but yeah.

614
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:10,143
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

615
00:57:10,203 --> 00:57:11,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

616
00:57:11,184 --> 00:57:11,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You are right.

617
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:21,117
[SPEAKER_06]: There is the teacher's lounge in the back, which could serve as our first aid station, let's say, where we keep all our extra things.

618
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:24,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I think because you have to go through the cafeteria.

619
00:57:25,723 --> 00:57:26,863
[SPEAKER_06]: to the teacher's lounge.

620
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:33,025
[SPEAKER_06]: That one might not be ideal if somebody's having sensory overload and if we choose to have activities.

621
00:57:33,546 --> 00:57:39,027
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is great because Susan and myself are community access monitors.

622
00:57:39,988 --> 00:57:42,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Susan, Nick has signed up for his two days.

623
00:57:43,729 --> 00:57:44,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

624
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:45,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

625
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick has signed up for his two-day.

626
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Shanine and I are trying to finish the dance certification.

627
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:55,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I might finish it by the time I'm 95.

628
00:57:56,656 --> 00:58:02,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But either way, maybe as the time gets closer, right?

629
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:05,261
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we all meet there.

630
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:12,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick, since you have a relationship with Charlotte, and I'm sure she'd love to hear from you, perhaps you can be tasked with

631
00:58:14,775 --> 00:58:19,077
[SPEAKER_06]: giving her a, shooting her an email and letting her know.

632
00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:27,802
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we all meet there and we get some guidance and we work, you know, we work together like we typically do and, you know, pull it off.

633
00:58:27,902 --> 00:58:28,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah.

634
00:58:29,803 --> 00:58:31,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, John, go right ahead.

635
00:58:31,964 --> 00:58:40,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've just been... I think I've just been... I think I've just been voluntold.

636
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:45,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there is such a thing.

637
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:47,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, John.

638
00:58:47,773 --> 00:58:52,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

639
00:58:53,497 --> 00:59:11,693
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious about how this is promoted to the various communities, people in disability communities, but also, I'm not a social media guy, but do you go to the college radio station Tufts, or do you go to the Hatch, or the school, I mean, not the school, but the town newspapers,

640
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:13,488
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you promote this?

641
00:59:13,528 --> 00:59:15,750
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get to the different communities out there?

642
00:59:17,311 --> 00:59:25,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So for one, like the primary mode of communication when we're having the disability fair was the newsletter at the senior center.

643
00:59:26,218 --> 00:59:34,765
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also making sure that the flyers got in the hands of the various vendors that had like big distribution lists like deaf

644
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:37,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Deaf Inc, right?

645
00:59:38,046 --> 00:59:44,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Because their distribution list is going to be a lot huger than my tiny little distribution list, right?

646
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:48,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the city does rely heavily on social media.

647
00:59:48,929 --> 00:59:50,929
[SPEAKER_06]: That is completely out of my hands.

648
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:53,250
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I do what I can, right?

649
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,491
[SPEAKER_06]: But also the robocalls, right?

650
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:05,913
[SPEAKER_06]: The flyers, the information was also in the superintendent's weekly bulletin.

651
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:15,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so there's the hard copy one weekly memo, but then there's the video one as well.

652
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:19,869
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was done both ways.

653
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:26,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was sent to the schools for flowering as well, and also on the school's website.

654
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:30,419
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times you tend to have other communities come.

655
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:35,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that is great, especially when we're talking about disabilities.

656
01:00:35,662 --> 01:00:44,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like this really strengthens numbers because in some people's minds, they still think it's, you'd be surprised.

657
01:00:45,428 --> 01:00:48,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'd be surprised about how wonderful, how skilled.

658
01:00:50,322 --> 01:00:55,164
[SPEAKER_06]: and how actually equitable people with disabilities are, right?

659
01:00:55,844 --> 01:01:06,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I'm not a person that is opposed to neighboring communities coming, but I will say that my focus is really the city of Medford, right?

660
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:09,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really what I'm looking at.

661
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:14,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I also forgot, John, the housing authorities as well.

662
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:15,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

663
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,174
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think social media is great.

664
01:01:17,234 --> 01:01:18,734
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't use it.

665
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:23,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I just choose not to, but I was just curious how you promote this.

666
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:28,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously you want to engage people like Nick was talking about.

667
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:33,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know about this committee until I called you and asked a different question than I found out about it.

668
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:36,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I would have had no idea that this was taking place or existed.

669
01:01:37,547 --> 01:01:39,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many other people out there have liked that?

670
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:46,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still a little behind on my goal on where I feel like the committee should be.

671
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it comes to like the equity, I still want an answer.

672
01:01:50,422 --> 01:01:54,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do some commissions get stipends and why don't others, right?

673
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's very real for me.

674
01:01:56,866 --> 01:02:05,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will not stop asking that question until I receive an answer that I believe is worthy of an answer.

675
01:02:06,693 --> 01:02:12,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't tell you why people aren't aware.

676
01:02:12,757 --> 01:02:20,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just tell you the work that the commission has done since when I became a part of the group.

677
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:23,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there are a lot of things too that are different.

678
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:30,490
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a situation where in the city of Medford, we no longer have a newspaper.

679
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:39,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Right and forget that there are people from a specific age group that and that is still the source of.

680
01:02:40,354 --> 01:02:43,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Receiving information that is the primary source.

681
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,396
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they take the information in.

682
01:02:45,876 --> 01:02:52,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Hence the reason that we make sure that we get a lot of stuff to the housing authority.

683
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:56,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say to the housing authority, I don't mean just like the main office to sit on the shelf.

684
01:02:57,122 --> 01:03:01,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, in the buildings, because each building has.

685
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:07,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Variety of many different people, and as far as keeping track of who attends.

686
01:03:08,302 --> 01:03:14,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there an actual sign-in sheet or the people typing in something into it?

687
01:03:14,063 --> 01:03:16,483
[SPEAKER_06]: When people came in, that was what I said earlier.

688
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:18,844
[SPEAKER_06]: When people came in, they did sign in.

689
01:03:19,304 --> 01:03:22,584
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a sign-in sheet, but it was also two different columns.

690
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:34,106
[SPEAKER_06]: They were asked if they would be interested in receiving information from the commission at their contact and if they wanted to join their commission at yes or no.

691
01:03:34,927 --> 01:03:36,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Those things are here somewhere.

692
01:03:37,725 --> 01:03:43,912
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, okay, I just wondering how it takes place because I know, like, my, my handwriting is terrible and at the same time.

693
01:03:44,933 --> 01:03:46,534
[SPEAKER_00]: My left hand is doesn't work.

694
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:50,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as far as typing, but is there someone that can type in information?

695
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:52,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had some.

696
01:03:53,427 --> 01:03:58,672
[SPEAKER_06]: We had four greeters, four hosts, right?

697
01:03:58,692 --> 01:04:06,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you entered, members of the Human Rights Commission at that time volunteered to work with the commissioners that were available.

698
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So they did two different shifts.

699
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:13,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to call it shifts, but I don't know, two different segments.

700
01:04:13,973 --> 01:04:15,134
[SPEAKER_06]: is what I mean, right?

701
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:19,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way, because you will have those, and because we also had swag, right?

702
01:04:19,918 --> 01:04:25,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody can, you know, carry their swag and everything else that they need to do.

703
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:30,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had to, you know, we had to keep all those things in mind.

704
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:36,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do love the idea of artists in the disability community, because they can cover so many things, like you were talking about.

705
01:04:36,712 --> 01:04:41,696
[SPEAKER_00]: But whether someone's a sculptor, or a musician, or a painter, what's out there?

706
01:04:41,716 --> 01:04:42,156
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know?

707
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:45,630
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely huge.

708
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm currently pushing for something right now.

709
01:04:48,312 --> 01:04:50,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Susan knows that's why Susan got that emergency.

710
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:58,963
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to call me right away because it is amazing how people just continue to operate with a blind desire.

711
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:00,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all I'm going to say.

712
01:05:02,105 --> 01:05:04,966
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, commissioners, we are at 639.

713
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, we are having a really long meeting.

714
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just whip through and give you an update.

715
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:22,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Many thanks to ARPA funding, I was finally able to update the hearing accessibility at City Hall inside the chambers.

716
01:05:22,954 --> 01:05:27,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So we actually have new technology, brand spanking new state of the art.

717
01:05:28,577 --> 01:05:39,282
[SPEAKER_06]: When I say listening devices, it's not one contraption, it's the... If Kevin ever watches this, Kevin of Medford Community Media, he's going to laugh at me because he told me the proper name.

718
01:05:39,362 --> 01:05:41,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's called the receiver, right?

719
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:42,904
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the professional one.

720
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:49,647
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's lovely is that the packs are really small, like old-fashioned pages.

721
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,368
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're very discreet.

722
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:55,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Be like a little handbag and nobody would know.

723
01:05:57,135 --> 01:05:59,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you have different styles of headphones.

724
01:05:59,596 --> 01:06:01,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I did electric blue.

725
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:05,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, we need our headphones back, so I need to be able to see people.

726
01:06:06,698 --> 01:06:09,939
[SPEAKER_06]: You forget, but you have the clamshell.

727
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,501
[SPEAKER_06]: ARPA funds were used to purchase that.

728
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:23,624
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to that, ARPA funds were also used to purchase or to add some accessible seating.

729
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:29,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's insane to say that I had been in the chambers so often.

730
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:35,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Never actually occurred to me that we didn't have any seating with arms.

731
01:06:38,267 --> 01:06:39,788
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all scoop chairs.

732
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:51,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the ones that we had with arms had wheels on the bottom so that as you were trying to balance, you can wheel away and end up

733
01:06:52,922 --> 01:06:55,404
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere but where you wanted to end up.

734
01:06:56,865 --> 01:07:15,998
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the very tail end, I think it was like five days before the cutoff, I ordered, Nick did some research for me because I was trying to, you know, that balance between matching them and not making things look, oh, well, that's different, right?

735
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:18,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a seamless match.

736
01:07:19,121 --> 01:07:20,401
[SPEAKER_06]: We purchased, I think it was 12 or 15

737
01:07:24,152 --> 01:07:27,114
[SPEAKER_06]: seats with arms and they have cushions.

738
01:07:27,614 --> 01:07:36,859
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still in the chambers in the format for meetings, but they're just set up in between all the other chairs.

739
01:07:37,759 --> 01:07:40,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's really important.

740
01:07:42,982 --> 01:07:47,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Then after how many years?

741
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:52,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Bathroom renovations at City Hall.

742
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:05,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to cry, but I won't.

743
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:13,584
[SPEAKER_06]: What I will say is that it is one of the joys of working with Nick and working with our director facilities.

744
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:27,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Was actually getting to a point where I was working with people that understood what I was talking about director facilities was extremely instrumental in his support of getting.

745
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:31,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Qualified people to come and assess.

746
01:08:32,746 --> 01:08:34,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And provide a design.

747
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:40,872
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is real, this is not happening overnight.

748
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:44,274
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is happening the right way.

749
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:49,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we'll have to do 1 at a time.

750
01:08:50,322 --> 01:08:53,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care I don't care.

751
01:08:55,384 --> 01:08:57,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but from what I can see of the plans.

752
01:08:59,106 --> 01:09:02,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are not just ADA compliant.

753
01:09:02,867 --> 01:09:05,628
[SPEAKER_06]: They are what you would consider fully accessible.

754
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:09,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know for me this.

755
01:09:10,571 --> 01:09:13,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been it's been a battle, you know, that's it's it's just.

756
01:09:14,892 --> 01:09:25,244
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about we're talking about human dignity, so I just wanted to share that with you guys and I will continue to keep you updated.

757
01:09:27,106 --> 01:09:30,110
[SPEAKER_06]: On on that as we go.

758
01:09:32,286 --> 01:09:43,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Keolis Commuter Services, not able to join us for this meeting, but I will be inviting them to the next meeting and also the April meeting so that they'll have a choice.

759
01:09:46,074 --> 01:09:50,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Rachel was the person that reached out to me, asked, you know, what would be helpful?

760
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:55,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, well, any resources that you have that we can share.

761
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told her, and I don't think that I was misspeaking, if I'm not mistaken,

762
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:06,973
[SPEAKER_06]: request for accessibility at the West Medford train station.

763
01:10:07,393 --> 01:10:07,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

764
01:10:09,615 --> 01:10:10,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Over a decade old.

765
01:10:11,716 --> 01:10:15,138
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody said to me that it's literally 14 years in the making.

766
01:10:16,139 --> 01:10:16,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so.

767
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:17,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when it's opening.

768
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:18,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

769
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:20,402
[SPEAKER_04]: March 10th.

770
01:10:20,802 --> 01:10:21,603
[SPEAKER_04]: When is it opening?

771
01:10:21,903 --> 01:10:22,443
[SPEAKER_04]: March 10th.

772
01:10:22,503 --> 01:10:23,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my birthday present.

773
01:10:25,402 --> 01:10:31,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say this because my friend who is very high up in accessibility at the T and I have been calling it my birthday present for like three months now.

774
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It is your birthday present.

775
01:10:35,651 --> 01:10:38,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a block and a half for me.

776
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:44,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be able to go in my chair and go up and it's all done.

777
01:10:44,298 --> 01:10:45,659
[SPEAKER_04]: They've stopped working on it now.

778
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:49,563
[SPEAKER_04]: They just have to cut the... Do you have any big scissors at City Hall?

779
01:10:50,563 --> 01:10:53,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have the giant ones.

780
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:55,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what they should use to cut it.

781
01:10:56,527 --> 01:10:57,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cut.

782
01:10:57,808 --> 01:10:59,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know when they're going to cut it?

783
01:11:00,209 --> 01:11:00,770
[SPEAKER_06]: March 10th.

784
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:02,130
[SPEAKER_06]: March 10th.

785
01:11:05,653 --> 01:11:08,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be in the RTAG newsletter, right?

786
01:11:10,107 --> 01:11:12,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, this is just me and my friend texting.

787
01:11:12,629 --> 01:11:13,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

788
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:14,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm not even supposed to say that.

789
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

790
01:11:15,531 --> 01:11:16,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I am just so excited.

791
01:11:17,252 --> 01:11:19,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have been calling to the guy.

792
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:22,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive by there like twice a day, and the guys literally know who I am.

793
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:28,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, Kate, literally, I'm not making it up.

794
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:33,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I think somebody told me 14 years in the making.

795
01:11:33,424 --> 01:11:35,125
[SPEAKER_06]: 14 years for accessibility.

796
01:11:36,162 --> 01:11:38,803
[SPEAKER_04]: got to get it slipped in before they dismantle the ADA.

797
01:11:39,403 --> 01:11:40,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

798
01:11:40,984 --> 01:11:49,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And I attended a great meeting today that settled my mind somewhat.

799
01:11:49,707 --> 01:11:52,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a meeting, but a thing.

800
01:11:52,368 --> 01:11:54,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think right now.

801
01:11:55,489 --> 01:11:56,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It has lights.

802
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a roof over it.

803
01:11:58,830 --> 01:11:59,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a roof.

804
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:05,753
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this huge, big, and yeah.

805
01:12:08,269 --> 01:12:12,292
[SPEAKER_06]: John, let me describe to you what I saw when I went.

806
01:12:13,353 --> 01:12:16,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a hole, a giant hole.

807
01:12:18,518 --> 01:12:24,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, how is somebody with a disability supposed to access the train?

808
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:29,507
[SPEAKER_04]: You're supposed to take the right, but the right isn't as good as the train.

809
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,330
[SPEAKER_02]: That part, that part right there.

810
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:34,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

811
01:12:37,629 --> 01:12:42,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I have multiple horror stories about the lie.

812
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:44,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't even get me started.

813
01:12:44,372 --> 01:12:48,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We all do.

814
01:12:49,654 --> 01:12:52,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut my tooth in half because of them.

815
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:56,176
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a whole another discussion.

816
01:13:00,015 --> 01:13:06,198
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the ride is a great resource.

817
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:07,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm grateful for them.

818
01:13:07,438 --> 01:13:12,300
[SPEAKER_02]: They do what they gotta do, but they do not do what they do well.

819
01:13:13,074 --> 01:13:17,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm thankful that the T is doing something about it.

820
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:36,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say one thing that the T needs to think about is people who are disabled that do not have wheelchairs because walking to a whole other section of the street just to get access is ridiculous.

821
01:13:37,272 --> 01:13:39,154
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I digress.

822
01:13:41,932 --> 01:13:49,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like, you can only access the ramps if you go to where it crosses High Street.

823
01:13:50,336 --> 01:13:55,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't access it from, like, across from the little coffee shop.

824
01:13:55,838 --> 01:13:58,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't access the ramps from there, because there are stairs.

825
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,881
[SPEAKER_06]: This cafe, the coffee shop.

826
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:05,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely ridiculous.

827
01:14:05,982 --> 01:14:06,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

828
01:14:07,283 --> 01:14:09,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I'm not mistaken,

829
01:14:10,633 --> 01:14:23,365
[SPEAKER_06]: But Nick, if I'm not mistaken and I have to double check, there is stairs and it's almost like a weird sidewalk that ends up not being a sidewalk.

830
01:14:23,565 --> 01:14:24,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

831
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:32,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to double check with the traffic engineer, but there is some work that is supposed to be done on that.

832
01:14:33,434 --> 01:14:36,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I am not saying that it's happening tomorrow.

833
01:14:37,137 --> 01:14:47,065
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do recall when we were out marking, yes, sometimes I go out and I mark and I have a little measuring tape in the roadway.

834
01:14:47,726 --> 01:14:56,733
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a conversation that I had because I didn't understand why the sidewalk just kept getting narrower and narrower and narrower.

835
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:59,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you were in the rail for the tracks.

836
01:15:01,634 --> 01:15:05,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very weird.

837
01:15:05,357 --> 01:15:08,019
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Medford.

838
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:09,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Our sidewalks don't make sense.

839
01:15:11,982 --> 01:15:15,225
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever notice how they go like slope down?

840
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:29,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the fact that I was trying to ride my power chair to go and just take a walk one day.

841
01:15:30,952 --> 01:15:41,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got to this place where there was a ramp onto the sidewalk, but no ramp off of the sidewalk.

842
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:44,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, oh, wait, I'm stuck.

843
01:15:44,757 --> 01:15:45,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

844
01:15:45,578 --> 01:15:45,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

845
01:15:47,260 --> 01:16:02,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to risk my life by going onto the road and standing there while cars are passing me at a hair's width of a distance.

846
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:05,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I digress.

847
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:10,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not make this meeting go longer than I have to.

848
01:16:15,575 --> 01:16:16,536
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't digress.

849
01:16:16,596 --> 01:16:18,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is the reality.

850
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:20,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these are the things that I am facing, right?

851
01:16:20,762 --> 01:16:24,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, of course, I question it.

852
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:28,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if I can see it, I'm sure other people can too.

853
01:16:28,872 --> 01:16:32,617
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't need to be an ADA coordinator to know that none of it makes sense.

854
01:16:35,701 --> 01:16:46,647
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, why is there an accessible space all the way in a dark corner, further away from, you know, the curb cuts on a hump of a hill that goes like this?

855
01:16:47,448 --> 01:16:48,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what are we saying?

856
01:16:48,769 --> 01:16:54,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, there are... Because people just want to say that, oh, we did it.

857
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:56,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, guess what?

858
01:16:56,276 --> 01:17:02,864
[SPEAKER_06]: What ends up happening is I go and then those things get moved and then they can start trying all they want.

859
01:17:03,104 --> 01:17:07,629
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, there are laws that govern spaces.

860
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:13,175
[SPEAKER_06]: There are guidelines that dictate where things are supposed to be.

861
01:17:15,068 --> 01:17:17,130
[SPEAKER_06]: But you tell me that, oh, we're doing really great.

862
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,631
[SPEAKER_06]: We have six spaces.

863
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:23,195
[SPEAKER_06]: But four of those spaces are not even on level ground.

864
01:17:23,255 --> 01:17:24,977
[SPEAKER_06]: They're on corners that go like this.

865
01:17:26,898 --> 01:17:30,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So some days, I would say, are much better than others.

866
01:17:30,882 --> 01:17:37,648
[SPEAKER_06]: But usually in the summer is when you will find me doing my boots on ground days, hence my

867
01:17:39,235 --> 01:17:39,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful jacket.

868
01:17:40,316 --> 01:17:44,658
[SPEAKER_04]: For what it's worth, I'm a certified access monitor too.

869
01:17:44,718 --> 01:17:46,740
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 15, 20 years ago, but.

870
01:17:48,461 --> 01:17:52,603
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing the refresher if you want for those.

871
01:17:52,903 --> 01:17:56,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care enough because I don't think the law will last that long.

872
01:17:57,466 --> 01:17:58,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say that Kate, don't say that.

873
01:17:59,448 --> 01:18:01,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Kate, I have to hold on to hope.

874
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:04,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to hold on to hope.

875
01:18:05,071 --> 01:18:07,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Executive orders are not statutes.

876
01:18:08,857 --> 01:18:10,798
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the big takeaway today.

877
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:14,521
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I have to keep pushing on behalf of everyone.

878
01:18:14,801 --> 01:18:15,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

879
01:18:19,464 --> 01:18:26,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to stay hopeful, because if we don't, at this point, we'll die.

880
01:18:27,009 --> 01:18:29,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have to stay hopeful.

881
01:18:30,051 --> 01:18:35,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just determined to make sure that I can get... It's weird, like,

882
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't call it rushing but I will say that I'm in haste.

883
01:18:41,326 --> 01:18:45,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost I feel like I'm in a race but I don't know who I'm in a race for or race with.

884
01:18:46,313 --> 01:18:52,562
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like OK I need to get as much of this done now because the unknown is just that.

885
01:18:54,858 --> 01:19:01,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are all the updates that I have in terms of Keolis and in terms of our fair and everything else.

886
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:07,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next meeting is March 26th, same place, same time.

887
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:09,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Nick.

888
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:12,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a question.

889
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:23,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if you live in Medford, you get all kinds of ads and flyers in the mail.

890
01:19:25,931 --> 01:19:30,334
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds, Lord have mercy.

891
01:19:30,874 --> 01:19:49,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a way that we could work with the city and kind of using that type of an avenue to advertise the disability fair or something like that?

892
01:19:49,877 --> 01:19:52,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, we certainly could, right?

893
01:19:52,620 --> 01:20:05,354
[SPEAKER_06]: But here is the thing is that we would have to pay for the postage, not saying that that needs to be a deterrent, but that's what needs to be considered is that everything is done on office budgets, right?

894
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:09,098
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no, like, giant city budget.

895
01:20:09,798 --> 01:20:20,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, could we get in when, like, you know, I would have to talk to the treasurer, like, are there bills that are going out at a specific time, right?

896
01:20:20,244 --> 01:20:33,953
[SPEAKER_06]: If, let's say, if, let's say, April, they are sending out, I'm just going to say water bill, because that's the only thing that comes to mind, they're sending out the annual water bills or the quarterly water bills, then maybe our flyer

897
01:20:34,693 --> 01:20:40,835
[SPEAKER_06]: right, could go in the envelope, or maybe we just do a paper fly that can be, you know, folded out.

898
01:20:41,595 --> 01:20:45,156
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would have to find out if those avenues exist.

899
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:54,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that we could just blanket wise without having a dedicated list, just send because at 69 cents,

900
01:20:57,124 --> 01:20:58,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what it is right now.

901
01:20:58,986 --> 01:21:03,089
[SPEAKER_06]: 69 cents for mail, for one piece of mail.

902
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,010
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 people is $6.90.

903
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:06,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

904
01:21:07,152 --> 01:21:11,536
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, I can tell you right now, ODI, we don't have the budget for that.

905
01:21:12,436 --> 01:21:15,779
[SPEAKER_05]: We would also have to fold and stamp.

906
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:16,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

907
01:21:17,701 --> 01:21:18,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Ourselves.

908
01:21:18,661 --> 01:21:18,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

909
01:21:20,446 --> 01:21:38,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, I know, and granted, this is just my idea, but like, I'm like, when people are trying to run for public office, they send those ones that don't have to be full folded and whatnot.

910
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,985
[SPEAKER_02]: They have funds.

911
01:21:41,345 --> 01:21:41,886
[SPEAKER_06]: They have monies.

912
01:21:42,406 --> 01:21:53,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like, I'm just thinking of stuff that we don't have to fold or stamp or whatever.

913
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:59,232
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be... You have to pay for it, though, somehow.

914
01:21:59,512 --> 01:21:59,932
[SPEAKER_06]: No, right.

915
01:22:00,612 --> 01:22:00,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

916
01:22:01,112 --> 01:22:09,235
[SPEAKER_02]: But just an idea of what could be going out instead of, like,

917
01:22:09,903 --> 01:22:17,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that what would be great is like, I think Cam had made mention of it, John, I think you made mention of it, is that sign-in sheet, right?

918
01:22:17,887 --> 01:22:22,009
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could continue, as a matter of fact, you sure that's not in the Google Doc?

919
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:25,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now that I think about it, I think that I sent all that stuff on.

920
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:38,717
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could continue to build upon that list of people who say that they're interested in things that the commission has, then we have a dedicated list that we are sending stuff out to.

921
01:22:39,237 --> 01:22:40,818
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the survey?

922
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:43,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

923
01:22:43,599 --> 01:22:48,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I do believe that I turned all that stuff in and it was all, you know, I think you guys reviewed it.

924
01:22:50,863 --> 01:22:56,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's on the Google Doc, the cam.

925
01:22:56,886 --> 01:23:01,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on that Google Doc right now.

926
01:23:01,428 --> 01:23:01,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me check.

927
01:23:03,762 --> 01:23:11,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because we did the survey, I did the attendance sheet, because that would be really helpful.

928
01:23:15,766 --> 01:23:19,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Theoretically, we have a list of names and contacts.

929
01:23:21,548 --> 01:23:32,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it on this particular Google Doc, but Kim might have another one that I'm not seeing right now.

930
01:23:32,252 --> 01:23:32,352
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

931
01:23:34,525 --> 01:23:36,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll definitely follow up on that.

932
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:42,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the idea of expanding the different modes of communication of how we get our materials.

933
01:23:42,849 --> 01:23:47,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess really identifying our audience.

934
01:23:52,052 --> 01:23:55,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Just touch something just now and there we go.

935
01:23:55,754 --> 01:23:57,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and identifying our audience.

936
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:02,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have three minutes commissioners.

937
01:24:04,332 --> 01:24:10,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just so excited that any of you noticed that I can't add.

938
01:24:11,778 --> 01:24:15,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Last month, they couldn't figure out.

939
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:18,403
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a nerve to have five Wednesdays.

940
01:24:18,463 --> 01:24:20,604
[SPEAKER_06]: That was enough to get me all confused.

941
01:24:27,549 --> 01:24:31,029
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think I've done it much better now.

942
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:37,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's like on the actual calendar and it actually says the fourth last month.

943
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:39,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I'm coming and going.

944
01:24:39,432 --> 01:24:40,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a meeting?

945
01:24:40,132 --> 01:24:40,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we not have a meeting?

946
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:41,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a second.

947
01:24:41,912 --> 01:24:44,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did I actually think that I would know what is going on?

948
01:24:46,633 --> 01:24:52,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So last month was by error and I definitely apologize for that.

949
01:24:54,582 --> 01:25:01,407
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is there so there is the 2 day community access monitoring training that is being offered by the.

950
01:25:01,427 --> 01:25:07,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just so, you know, March past is a full, but may.

951
01:25:07,171 --> 01:25:09,693
[SPEAKER_06]: May has availability.

952
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:11,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It is insane.

953
01:25:11,514 --> 01:25:15,237
[SPEAKER_06]: It is intense, but it's really useful and it's really powerful.

954
01:25:15,257 --> 01:25:19,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I did was I printed out all my materials so that.

955
01:25:20,721 --> 01:25:25,664
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have to go somewhere, if I have to refer to something quickly, I have them right there.

956
01:25:25,924 --> 01:25:26,224
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

957
01:25:26,725 --> 01:25:34,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Just sharing that it's, it's virtual at this time and then for those of us that have done the 2 day, we get to do our.

958
01:25:34,749 --> 01:25:38,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, refresher, uh, Jeff Dugan sent that out.

959
01:25:39,312 --> 01:25:48,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, sad news, Julia O'Leary general counsel, who was covering for executive director at who retired has moved on.

960
01:25:48,695 --> 01:25:54,917
[SPEAKER_06]: She's she's now working at a supplier diversity, but Robert.

961
01:25:56,517 --> 01:26:10,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's still there and it was nice to see that they updated and we still have our ADA coordinators peer group checking group, which is nice because sometimes you just.

962
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:16,895
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you just have something that you have to have that conversation with another ADA person.

963
01:26:18,782 --> 01:26:20,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is about it.

964
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:22,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody have any questions?

965
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:23,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one question.

966
01:26:24,184 --> 01:26:24,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Joe.

967
01:26:25,164 --> 01:26:36,887
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as, excuse me, as far as the event coming up, the disability event, I assume there will be a translator with sign language.

968
01:26:37,428 --> 01:26:38,488
[SPEAKER_00]: What about other languages?

969
01:26:39,407 --> 01:26:41,108
[SPEAKER_06]: There will not be other languages.

970
01:26:41,188 --> 01:26:43,888
[SPEAKER_06]: The languages that we'll focus on is ASL.

971
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,889
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I focused on before.

972
01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:50,170
[SPEAKER_06]: So there wouldn't be interpreters for other languages.

973
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:52,231
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a disability fair.

974
01:26:52,251 --> 01:26:58,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd be looking at disability related languages and primarily ASL.

975
01:26:58,893 --> 01:27:01,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And my hope is that we can get a full team like we did.

976
01:27:01,874 --> 01:27:03,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on one second.

977
01:27:11,008 --> 01:27:11,110
[SPEAKER_06]: you.

978
01:27:13,036 --> 01:27:13,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

979
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:14,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no worries.

980
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:14,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

981
01:27:15,057 --> 01:27:15,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

982
01:27:16,317 --> 01:27:16,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

983
01:27:16,597 --> 01:27:18,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody brought me in things.

984
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:20,238
[SPEAKER_06]: They put it in the wrong mailbox.

985
01:27:21,578 --> 01:27:27,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, so last year we did have, uh, we did have 3 interpreters and again, you know.

986
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:34,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we get situated, I like to have interpreters for all events, regardless of who identifies or who doesn't identify.

987
01:27:35,582 --> 01:27:40,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but it's great because I've seen an increase actually in requests for interpreters.

988
01:27:42,762 --> 01:27:45,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, which I think it's extremely important.

989
01:27:45,544 --> 01:27:52,069
[SPEAKER_06]: So and they do a great job at letting letting me know right away.

990
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:54,551
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not, we're not going to be able to fill that.

991
01:27:54,851 --> 01:27:57,673
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we're not able to fill it, we're not able to fill it.

992
01:27:58,134 --> 01:27:58,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

993
01:27:58,414 --> 01:28:00,956
[SPEAKER_06]: But the most important thing is that the request goes in.

994
01:28:01,657 --> 01:28:07,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do our due diligence, so and then they, you know, they can also keep tracking right?

995
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:08,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you need to.

996
01:28:08,922 --> 01:28:11,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Be able to say, hey, we need more people.

997
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:12,525
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our need, you know.

998
01:28:13,626 --> 01:28:17,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, so definitely interpreters.

999
01:28:21,992 --> 01:28:24,574
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so anybody else anything else.

1000
01:28:26,136 --> 01:28:28,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've stolen 2 minutes of your time.

1001
01:28:32,592 --> 01:28:34,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And lots more with all the emails that I've sent you.

1002
01:28:34,975 --> 01:28:37,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate all of you.

1003
01:28:37,798 --> 01:28:38,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1004
01:28:38,959 --> 01:28:43,463
[SPEAKER_06]: If the emails ever get to be too much, just let me know.

1005
01:28:43,483 --> 01:28:55,455
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems like lately there's just bam, bam, bam, you know, things are coming out and I just feel like I need to do my due diligence to keep you abreast and keep you updated.

1006
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that note, somebody want to make a motion?

1007
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:06,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I make a motion to adjourn.

1008
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:08,346
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to second?

1009
01:29:09,548 --> 01:29:09,669
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1010
01:29:09,689 --> 01:29:09,849
