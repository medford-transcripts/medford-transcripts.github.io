1
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:22,796
Okay.

2
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:25,338
We are back from executive session.

3
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,999
And next up, we have the consent agenda.

4
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,602
We have bills and payrolls, regular school committee minutes from February 5th, 2024.

5
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:38,623
Is there a motion for approval?

6
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:45,594
Motion for approval.

7
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:47,575
Seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

8
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:48,615
All those in favor?

9
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:49,076
Aye.

10
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:50,356
All those opposed?

11
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:52,918
Getting the hang of it, and it's only meeting three.

12
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:53,898
Good job, good job.

13
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,400
Oh, four, okay, sorry.

14
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:04,004
No reports of subcommittees, and we have three reports from our superintendent.

15
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:06,205
First up is updates and comments.

16
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,146
I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

17
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:11,662
Good evening.

18
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:19,334
Happy Lunar New Year to our Asian American and Pacific Islander community members and all who celebrated it.

19
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:22,900
Saturday marked the beginning of the Year of the Dragon.

20
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:33,940
Lunar New Year celebrations are often focused on festive meals, gathering with family and loved ones and preparing for a healthy and fortunate year ahead.

21
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:43,129
Also, it is that time for the lucky red envelopes, which are given out with money or special treats for children and everyone.

22
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:49,957
The red envelopes are always welcome, and if you're fortunate to receive one, accept it with a big smile.

23
00:39:49,977 --> 00:40:04,874
I'd like to thank the Medford Human Rights Commission and the Medford Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at the city for hosting a fun New Year celebration this past Saturday at our new library.

24
00:40:06,713 --> 00:40:15,818
Also, I'd like to take this moment to introduce a Harvard University education fellow, Miss Kimberly Lewis.

25
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:22,882
I'm very excited to briefly introduce a new member of our Medford Mustangs team.

26
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:28,445
Miss Kimberly Lewis is joining my office two days a week as a Harvard doctoral fellow.

27
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:41,340
Miss Lewis is an experienced secondary educator, who was taught in Texas, California, Maryland, Washington DC, and the United Arab Emirates.

28
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:47,568
She is currently pursuing a doctorate in educational leadership at the Harvard Graduate School of Ed.

29
00:40:49,853 --> 00:40:57,877
Through an extremely competitive process, Medford Public Schools was selected to be one of the highly sought after districts for Harvard residency.

30
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:09,444
This fellowship is fully funded by the generosity of HGSE, and this partnership will provide our district with an additional opportunity to better meet the needs of all of our students.

31
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:11,583
Ms.

32
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:19,689
Lewis will be involved in our district's work and learn about the demands, opportunities, and challenges that face a superintendent on a daily basis.

33
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:26,795
She will utilize this time to learn about the complex role and work of a superintendent of schools.

34
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,018
I am extremely appreciative of the opportunity to work with Ms.

35
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:34,781
Lewis and look forward to our collaboration as colleagues.

36
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:36,142
Ms.

37
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:42,474
Lewis is on the call and we are welcoming you to just greet the school committee.

38
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:47,544
Hello, hi.

39
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,966
Thank you for that lovely introduction, Dr. Vincent.

40
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:57,108
Like Dr. Vincent said, my name is Kimberly, and I'm working on my doctorate in educational leadership.

41
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:05,152
I've worked in education for the past 15 years, and I am super excited to include Medford as part of my learning experience.

42
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:11,894
I've already gained a lot from working with Dr. Vincent in the past weeks, and I look forward to learning from you all as well.

43
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:13,235
Thank you so much.

44
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,259
Thank you, Ms.

45
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:16,660
Lewis.

46
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:27,970
Also this evening, I would like to just provide a brief update on our tiered focus monitoring review.

47
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:37,979
Last week, DESE, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, conducted its triennial review of our English learner education programs.

48
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:51,344
We're very grateful to Mr. Paul Teixeira, our EL director and his team, as well as all the Medford staff and faculty who helped facilitate this important oversight visit.

49
00:42:52,944 --> 00:43:06,730
So at tonight's meeting, I'm looking forward to inviting the committee to approve a generous donation by Tufts University to support Medford's Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility,

50
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:15,199
And next, we'll move on to a mid-year budget update from Mr. Jerry McHugh, our district's finance director.

51
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:36,776
Over recent years, we have talked at length about the significance and positive impact of pandemic-era funding sources, such as the federal government's ESSER program, usually known, it's the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund,

52
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:40,398
which we call the acronym, sir.

53
00:43:41,238 --> 00:43:43,240
So we'll be discussing that a little bit.

54
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:53,425
But we've also talked about how eventually those funding sources would be depleted, and our budgets would face a fiscal cliff.

55
00:43:55,023 --> 00:44:10,800
So this evening, we're going to have a presentation from Mr. McHugh, and he will cover the challenging news that we are facing a shortfall and provide a little more additional detail.

56
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:20,083
But I do want to begin the conversation by stating clearly that our team is all hands on deck to respond to this situation.

57
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:39,227
We will work actively every day with administrators and educators to weather this difficult scenario, communicate its significance to our community, and most of all, to ensure that Medford students continue to receive the high quality public education services they all deserve.

58
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:40,187
Thank you.

59
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:44,362
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent, and nice to meet you, Ms.

60
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:44,743
Lewis.

61
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,385
We have recommendation to approve a donation from Tufts University.

62
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:51,886
Dr. Edward Vincent?

63
00:44:53,127 --> 00:45:02,771
Yes, I am asking the committee to approve a generous donation of $1,000 to the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, CCSR.

64
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:17,072
CCSR is funded by the Cummings Foundation, the Crystal Campbell Community Betterment Fund, and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and relies on thoughtful donations such as this.

65
00:45:17,992 --> 00:45:23,313
So my request is, will the committee approve the $1,000 donation from Tufts University?

66
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:27,754
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

67
00:45:27,914 --> 00:45:28,874
All those in favor?

68
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:29,354
Aye.

69
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:30,595
All those opposed?

70
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:31,935
Motion passes.

71
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:40,007
Next up, we have number three, mid-year fiscal year 24 budget update, Mr. Jerry McHugh, Director of Finance.

72
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:40,488
Welcome.

73
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:58,336
Is that good?

74
00:45:59,636 --> 00:46:06,261
Thank you, Madam Mayor, and it's very nice to meet many of you in person tonight.

75
00:46:09,263 --> 00:46:17,128
As the superintendent said, we began doing projections through the end of this fiscal year in January.

76
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:25,674
In the fall, we had settled the administrator's contract, the building monitor's contract,

77
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:40,912
And these contracts not only affected FY24 salaries, but there were retroactive salaries for FY23 and FY22 that are hitting in FY24.

78
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:50,894
I wanted to get those new salaries kind of programmed in to the payroll system in order to do these projections.

79
00:46:51,955 --> 00:46:52,115
And

80
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:03,585
Recently, I disclosed to the superintendent and the mayor that we are projecting a potential shortfall of $2.5 million.

81
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:09,008
I caution that this is very preliminary at this point.

82
00:47:09,028 --> 00:47:15,031
There's always kind of a tension when you have a problem like this.

83
00:47:16,072 --> 00:47:19,434
Do you do a lot of research so you can have immediate answers or

84
00:47:20,558 --> 00:47:22,779
do you disclose as soon as possible?

85
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:36,949
And I felt like we should be disclosing this to you right now as we kind of look into the various issues that could be, you know, causing the shortfall.

86
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:43,373
So I prepared a document that,

87
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,422
identifies three areas.

88
00:47:47,322 --> 00:48:00,168
There's a lot of, there are a number of accounts that are running over and some are running under and they offset each other, but these particular accounts I'm gonna call out to look at.

89
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:10,252
And the first group is a number of accounts where we spent more in FY23 than we budgeted in FY24.

90
00:48:10,272 --> 00:48:10,312
So,

91
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:16,197
trying to look into why that is.

92
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:21,802
And some of these accounts we're really going to have to address in the FY25 budget.

93
00:48:21,842 --> 00:48:25,045
Our budget should be aligned to what the

94
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,049
projected spending is in that account.

95
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:37,391
For example, in legal expenses, we budgeted $5,000 in FY23.

96
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:38,311
We wound up spending $95,000 in FY23.

97
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:39,392
And then in FY24, we budgeted 5,000 again.

98
00:48:39,412 --> 00:48:42,173
And we're projected to spend by the end of the year $165,000.

99
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:42,493
So there's,

100
00:48:57,571 --> 00:49:01,978
There's about half a dozen cases that the school department is involved in.

101
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:09,329
We get bills every month for legal expenses as they work on these cases.

102
00:49:10,976 --> 00:49:27,748
Earlier in, in the, in the fall, we, we had a settlement and one of the cases of $75,000 that that hit this account so that's just an example of an account that, you know, could not

103
00:49:28,288 --> 00:49:30,489
may not be budgeted correctly.

104
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:36,670
Another one is the homeless transportation.

105
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:42,931
So every school district is required to provide transportation to homeless students.

106
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:44,192
It's for very good reason.

107
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:47,872
And in FY23, we budgeted $130,000 for homeless transportation.

108
00:49:47,912 --> 00:49:48,533
We spent over 700,000.

109
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:07,127
In FY 24, again, we budgeted $130,000, and we're well on our way to spending over $500,000.

110
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:16,974
We do get some money from the state to reimburse that, but it's not anywhere near what the actual expense is.

111
00:50:17,755 --> 00:50:23,419
And it's one of these things it's very hard to budget for because it's very unpredictable.

112
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:40,803
And we could get notice tomorrow from a school district that has a homeless family in Medford and they're being bused back to that district, we participate in half that cost.

113
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:51,430
But as hard as it is to budget for that, we should be cognizant of what we typically spend year in and year out and try to get our budget aligned to that.

114
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:59,162
There's a number of salary accounts that still need to be investigated.

115
00:51:01,985 --> 00:51:08,251
Those budgets are built with particular positions behind them.

116
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:10,653
And so we really have to look at

117
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:17,033
who is expected to be charged to that account and who is actually being charged to that account.

118
00:51:17,714 --> 00:51:24,305
There can be differences in what was predicted versus the actual salary that's being paid.

119
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:31,234
Another problem could be that the payroll system didn't change.

120
00:51:31,294 --> 00:51:41,264
If somebody transferred, say, from the Andrews to the McGlynn, did the payroll change to kind of reflect that salary should be charged to McGlynn now instead of Andrews?

121
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:45,548
So those things should need to be investigated a little bit more.

122
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:46,869
Another,

123
00:51:50,771 --> 00:52:07,897
issue that is really driving the deficit is there's three contracts that were in negotiations at the end of FY23, the administrator's contract, the building monitors, and the custodians.

124
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:16,260
And it appears that there was a reserve established for the settlement of these contracts in FY23.

125
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,961
There's an account called undistributed salaries,

126
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:25,802
there was a budget of $1.1 million for those in that account.

127
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:31,383
Unfortunately, those contracts did not get settled in FY23.

128
00:52:31,423 --> 00:52:43,328
They got settled in FY24, but the budget, the reserves that were there in FY23 were no longer in the budget in FY24.

129
00:52:43,348 --> 00:52:46,709
FY24, the appropriation was set at $250,000.

130
00:52:53,041 --> 00:53:06,252
So those new salaries for FY24 and the retroactive amounts that went along with them are causing some of the shortfall.

131
00:53:07,453 --> 00:53:19,703
And then the third kind of unfunded charge to the budget was that custodians had a wage settlement back in 2022.

132
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:30,857
It was for over $570,000 and it was to be paid out over a three-year period.

133
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:35,680
A small payment in May of 2022, a payment of about $250,000.

134
00:53:44,813 --> 00:53:47,514
$50,000 in August of 22, and another payment of about $250,000 in August of 23.

135
00:53:47,554 --> 00:53:50,475
And these payments ran through the custodian salary account.

136
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:16,155
as was necessary in order to capture the tax withholdings that were necessary for those individuals.

137
00:54:17,495 --> 00:54:21,498
But nevertheless, that's kind of driving some of the shortfall.

138
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:31,724
Now, we will be implementing some initiatives this week to try to

139
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:37,134
close this gap as best we can with existing funds.

140
00:54:39,496 --> 00:54:55,206
We will scrutinize new purchase orders to make sure we're only spending expense budgets on things that are absolutely necessary or where we're required to spend.

141
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:58,168
We're gonna be scrutinizing any

142
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:10,132
vacancies that we have to limit backfilling of vacancies only to those positions that are absolutely necessary.

143
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:23,438
We're gonna review all the planned spending on grants and revolving funds that were part of the FY 24 budget to make sure that those were accurately implemented in the budget.

144
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:38,763
We will also be reviewing existing encumbrances or encumbrances that are already in the system to make sure we're only encumbering what we need to get through the end of the year.

145
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:41,185
As I said, there is,

146
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:51,210
funds available for the homeless transportation, $170,000, so far what I can see in the system.

147
00:55:53,451 --> 00:56:03,915
We had a preliminary conversation with the mayor and her finance director, and we found out that the FY23 budget is not closed yet.

148
00:56:04,175 --> 00:56:10,037
There is a balance that the school department finished with in FY23, so potentially,

149
00:56:12,478 --> 00:56:21,650
There's funds there that can help with some of these retroactive payments for the contracts that had been settled.

150
00:56:22,091 --> 00:56:29,320
We're looking at the ESSA 3 account to see if there's any unspent or unprogrammed

151
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:37,928
spending in that account that can be used to offset this shortfall.

152
00:56:37,948 --> 00:56:47,456
We're looking at other revolving funds that might have capacity and eligibility to

153
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:51,518
to move some spending onto those.

154
00:56:53,438 --> 00:57:10,982
And we did, the city is looking to see if there's any funding in their capital program that could possibly be used for our capital needs as we go forward.

155
00:57:15,404 --> 00:57:15,784
So that's,

156
00:57:17,776 --> 00:57:20,637
First report, there'll be certainly more to come with this.

157
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:30,721
And when we have kind of a plan that we feel is solid, we'll certainly come back and report to the school committee on how we're addressing this.

158
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:39,404
Thank you for the update, Jerry.

159
00:57:40,004 --> 00:57:40,744
Member Rousseau.

160
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:42,405
Thank you very much.

161
00:57:43,185 --> 00:57:44,426
I really appreciate this report.

162
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:45,426
I know that it was a lot of

163
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:46,936
manual labor.

164
00:57:47,016 --> 00:57:54,502
Unfortunately, we don't have the systems in place to make this a button you click, which I think in many districts, it's a button you click.

165
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:58,826
So it's one of the reasons we don't get this stuff monthly.

166
00:57:58,846 --> 00:58:05,992
You know, we don't get a burn report, which many other districts, even the little collaborative short collaborative

167
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:14,535
We get a burn report, and we just can't do that with our systems, which is disappointing in a conversation for another day.

168
00:58:15,955 --> 00:58:16,795
I have a few questions.

169
00:58:17,696 --> 00:58:21,036
I really appreciate the identification of the undistributed salaries line item.

170
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:30,419
You know, this $1.1 million appropriation, that just went back to the city, and then in FY24, the appropriation was 250,000.

171
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:33,159
Neither of those numbers together cover

172
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:38,450
the expense is what I understand, correct?

173
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:50,173
Well, if the contracts had settled in FY23, it might not have covered the full amount, but it was a pretty close estimate.

174
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:54,475
And I will say that there could have been a

175
00:58:57,125 --> 00:59:03,671
not all of those funds were returned to the city because the balance that exists today is about $450,000.

176
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:04,051
So I imagine

177
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:29,985
once they realized that they had available funds in FY23, there was probably some year-end transactions to maybe charge things to general fund that weren't planned for initially in order to reduce charges on grants or revolving funds that could roll into FY24.

178
00:59:30,645 --> 00:59:31,465
Thank you.

179
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:55,603
you won't remember any of this, but on January 6th of 2020, we got our FY 2019 budget close out, and it lists what we budgeted, what we spent, and the differences, and it's sideways, so I can't really go through it too easily.

180
00:59:56,203 --> 01:00:01,568
And I don't believe we have received such a report since then, so I don't know.

181
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:05,869
That means nothing for FY20, FY21, FY22, FY23.

182
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:13,972
We have never seen a closeout that shows us that we budgeted $5,000 and spent $180,000 or whatever it is.

183
01:00:14,752 --> 01:00:24,496
And some of that is that it takes so long to close out because the systems are not, we're not using Munis and we're just using

184
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:27,877
inappropriately outdated systems.

185
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:47,951
But I think that if you have a closeout report for any of those years, I certainly would be grateful because I think when the committee is looking at our budget proposal, and we see a line item for 5,000, and we see that last year the line item was 5,000, the rational person sees that and says, oh, okay, that should be fine, right?

186
01:00:49,032 --> 01:00:53,274
But if we also could have a report at the same time that says, no, we budgeted 5,000,

187
01:00:55,134 --> 01:01:01,097
The superintendent's budget says $5,000, but it was $160,000 in spending.

188
01:01:01,497 --> 01:01:03,158
Well, that's a major conversation.

189
01:01:04,479 --> 01:01:10,542
And I would hope the committee can have that by the time we do the budget.

190
01:01:13,744 --> 01:01:14,504
Point of information.

191
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:14,824
Sure.

192
01:01:15,344 --> 01:01:16,805
Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

193
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:22,988
I believe we made a motion that we would have quarterly budget reports for actuals versus expended.

194
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:27,279
in one of our previous meetings.

195
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:33,342
I don't have it in front of me, but we've had this conversation certainly multiple times, but I believe it was a motion that was put forward.

196
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:45,367
I would have to double check in the motions, but I believe that we said we would have actual versus expended versus projected, which is exactly what we're seeing here, which is nice.

197
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:50,570
And it is remarkable that we haven't had this in the past and we very much need it.

198
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:51,330
And I'm

199
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,478
I just want to double check and see if that motion.

200
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:04,406
My plan for FY 25 is to show you actual spending in FY 23.

201
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:19,877
A good practice for you to review is what's the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, what's the budget for the current fiscal year, and then what was the actual spending for the year behind that.

202
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:29,021
So we'll have an FY25 proposal, we'll have an FY24 budget, and FY23 actual spending.

203
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:30,702
So you can,

204
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:41,569
you know, be able to take a look at, you know, what that, if the budget makes sense versus what we might've spent.

205
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:42,649
Thank you.

206
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:45,971
And I just have one more question and then I'll let my colleagues jump in.

207
01:02:47,212 --> 01:03:00,881
Looking at the FY20 budget, which nobody has in front of them but me, but near the very end of the budget book, and this is something that Medford has been doing for a very long time,

208
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:09,031
there is a long list of positions that are not in any way, shape or form anything other than normal operations.

209
01:03:10,292 --> 01:03:28,982
Let's see, we have a director, we have secretaries, we have teachers, we have tech people, another director, another director, some paras, all of which are actually regular operating normal part of running a school district.

210
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:42,277
And $1.85 million worth of staff is actually listed as being on grants from revolving, the grants of course is different, but much of this is just from revolving accounts.

211
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:49,944
And so I'm aware having talked to other finance directors like the one at the short collaborative, that this is very unusual.

212
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,525
I won't go any further than that.

213
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:55,249
But my question to you is this,

214
01:03:56,926 --> 01:04:13,196
How does, if there's such a thing as a normal district, if we put all of these people on the budget, which we should do, and then we have these revolving accounts that build up funds, how does a normal district dispose of those funds?

215
01:04:13,757 --> 01:04:24,124
Do they just, at the end of the year, like, hey, we have 1.5 extra million dollars from afterschool or whatever the number is, do we, we don't just let that build up forever or become a,

216
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:29,728
private checkbook for the superintendent to do fun things in the district.

217
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:36,255
Do we write a check and transfer it back to the city so that it can become part of the budget.

218
01:04:37,016 --> 01:04:39,598
How does, what does a district normally do with all that.

219
01:04:39,758 --> 01:04:48,427
Yeah, yeah, I, I actually researched that when I first got here because, you know, some of the balances are.

220
01:04:50,894 --> 01:05:03,477
we could use some of those balances to help with our general fund budget, but it's not, you don't have the ability to simply transfer it.

221
01:05:03,557 --> 01:05:19,362
So for instance, the before and after school program is funded entirely from fees that are charged to parents and it's pretty robust and it has a large balance in it,

222
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:26,865
Typically for revolving funds, you're supposed to spend that money.

223
01:05:27,385 --> 01:05:32,390
That has to be a relationship between what you're collecting it for, and what you're spending it on.

224
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:40,997
And you're right, what we can do as a district is that we can start

225
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:49,316
looking at expenses that are being provided on behalf of that program in the general fund.

226
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:52,818
You could do a facilities assessment, for instance.

227
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:57,962
We're providing the classroom space, we're cleaning it, we're providing heat.

228
01:06:00,584 --> 01:06:04,147
There could be an administrative expense charged as well.

229
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:09,351
So there has to be methodologies to make sure it's fair to the program, but

230
01:06:11,112 --> 01:06:20,996
We're spending a lot on processing, payroll processing, encumbrances for those programs, and some of that funding can be recouped.

231
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:33,082
I just last week finished a methodology to charge the food service program for electricity and natural gas that they're using in the cafeteria.

232
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:35,083
So I have to,

233
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:51,306
share this with the director and some of my colleagues, but I think we can recover like $54,000, $55,000 from the lunch fund to kind of help support the buildings grounds department with those expenses.

234
01:06:51,906 --> 01:06:54,086
So that's how you would do it.

235
01:06:56,627 --> 01:07:03,748
I was hoping that maybe you could with, you know,

236
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:13,843
an appropriation from the city council that could move funds in that way that that would, it doesn't appear that that kind of exists.

237
01:07:13,983 --> 01:07:22,965
There's only, there's a lot of language around if you close down a fund, you know, where that money goes to.

238
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:24,245
Thank you.

239
01:07:29,686 --> 01:07:30,206
Member Graham.

240
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:31,487
Thank you.

241
01:07:35,005 --> 01:07:42,422
This might be a question for the superintendent, but who is responsible for approving operations and maintenance over time?

242
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:56,296
It would be the director of building and grounds, but also the overtime is closely linked to community schools.

243
01:07:56,976 --> 01:08:03,961
So with all of the rentals that are happening on weekends, and it's not the normal Monday to Friday weekday.

244
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:12,727
So some of those, some of the time would be automatically, it would need to be overtime because it's happening outside of the school day.

245
01:08:13,667 --> 01:08:27,135
And depending on the number of people that are using the facility, or if it's happening after school, there are large groups of people, they have to go back and clean those areas that normally would not be used.

246
01:08:27,735 --> 01:08:33,559
So the facility is used a lot, especially the high school campus.

247
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:39,622
So yes, and the McGlynn Complex is the other building.

248
01:08:39,702 --> 01:08:42,084
Those two have, I think, the highest

249
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:47,165
rental costs.

250
01:08:47,466 --> 01:08:58,929
And in that vein then, are you checking that the overtime that's attributable to revenue for rentals is being charged off?

251
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:00,570
So I guess my question is,

252
01:09:01,522 --> 01:09:12,568
Is somebody just grossly overspending overtime, or is this just an accounting issue that needs to be resolved, and that there actually is no problem with that account?

253
01:09:13,228 --> 01:09:21,852
On top of that, if I may, just because I understand we have events, but to have a discrepancy of 183 fiscal year 23, and then a $120,000 jump, how many more events in 2024?

254
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:34,128
or this fiscal year, I should say, more than the last fiscal year, is a huge question.

255
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:41,952
So the director of Buildings and Grounds does sign the overtime payroll.

256
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:57,760
The overtime that's attributable to events, church groups, and community schools, pool, that overtime is charged to those revolving funds.

257
01:10:00,508 --> 01:10:08,044
What I'm not sure, there is kind of overtime that's baked into the contract, and I'm

258
01:10:11,468 --> 01:10:19,154
I'm wondering if that like mandatory overtime was ever kind of taken into account in building the overtime budget.

259
01:10:19,274 --> 01:10:25,179
So for instance, during January and February, there's building checks that go on.

260
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:29,983
So a number of custodians are involved in going to the building.

261
01:10:31,104 --> 01:10:37,447
Saturday and Sunday with minimum hours to make sure the heat's functioning.

262
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:46,770
Now, that's, you know, something maybe to be addressed in the next contract with them.

263
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:58,355
But in the meantime, you know, we have to calculate what that amounts to and then make sure that's provided for in the overtime budget.

264
01:10:59,804 --> 01:11:09,150
There's night checks, there's a lot of overtime going to covering people that are out.

265
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:11,792
Some are out on long-term leave.

266
01:11:12,873 --> 01:11:17,116
Some might just be out vacation or sickness or whatever.

267
01:11:17,196 --> 01:11:25,501
So because of minimum manning that's in the contract, those shifts all get covered in the overtime budget.

268
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,084
And can, I think,

269
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:40,465
In a related question, can somebody take an action item to sit with the head of buildings and grounds and come up with a staffing plan that allows us to budget appropriately next time?

270
01:11:41,065 --> 01:11:58,214
Because it seems like there's maybe a budgeting issue, but also if this is in fact accurate and we're way overspending our overtime budget, like we need to have a different plan so that we're not blowing our overtime budget because we don't have the money to do that.

271
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:18,558
So I think somebody needs to sit with the Director of Buildings and Grounds and make a staffing plan that we can both operate to in the future, but also sort of get things under control in the right now, because otherwise we're gonna way overspend instead of somewhat overspend, right?

272
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:22,099
So I think that is pretty critical, because that's one of the big items that jumps out.

273
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:24,780
A couple of- Is that a motion, Member Graham?

274
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:28,365
I think I'm just asking that that happen.

275
01:12:28,906 --> 01:12:30,307
I can happy to make a motion.

276
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:48,626
So I'd like to make a motion that the administration work with the director of buildings and grounds and create a staffing plan so that future budgeting can contemplate planned overtime, and we can curtail overtime spending for the remainder of the school year.

277
01:12:49,432 --> 01:13:04,276
And if somebody wouldn't mind adding, considering that the contract has not changed to see that it's 140,000 more this fiscal year projected versus last, if the committee could get a breakdown of exactly what the reasoning is for that.

278
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:05,656
Yes.

279
01:13:06,056 --> 01:13:17,199
So one issue that might be causing the projection model to overestimate in this area is that

280
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:24,099
we're using overtime in January.

281
01:13:25,103 --> 01:13:26,743
to project through the end of the year.

282
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:48,947
So the building checks will cease at the end of February, and that might reduce, it's not gonna eliminate the deficit, but we'll be continuing to run the model through the remainder of the year, that shortfall is gonna be a moving target.

283
01:13:49,647 --> 01:13:53,108
Hopefully it's getting reduced as we go along and identify

284
01:13:56,415 --> 01:14:01,400
areas that are causing the shortfall and make that cease.

285
01:14:02,081 --> 01:14:02,461
Thank you.

286
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:07,465
I think the other thing that I want to make sure we acknowledge is that

287
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:18,679
we for the four years that I've been on the committee, we've been talking about making sure we have adequate budgets in various line items like technology replacement and building maintenance.

288
01:14:18,739 --> 01:14:22,783
So I think we all sort of know and feel like we're not maintaining our buildings appropriately.

289
01:14:23,684 --> 01:14:30,790
But each time we have that conversation, then we encounter a budget issue where we don't have enough money.

290
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:33,713
And in order to do that on paper, in order to increase

291
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:45,137
a budget, you know, a budget for building maintenance on paper, it would mean like cutting somebody who works with kids.

292
01:14:45,337 --> 01:14:50,521
And so I think the committee has sort of generally said that's, that's not what they want to do.

293
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:54,905
And so therefore, like the creative budgeting happens, which is an exercise on paper.

294
01:14:56,106 --> 01:15:02,951
But it is sort of it is a really terrible practice to have, I think the conundrum that we have always faced is

295
01:15:04,175 --> 01:15:11,519
We each year we set out to do something better and differently and each year the budget numbers just do not reflect an ability to do that.

296
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:27,388
So I know that last year we received a whole series of memos about what our plan could be and then when we got our allocation from the city what our plan had to be, and they're, they were different plan they're completely different plans.

297
01:15:28,568 --> 01:15:37,833
and so it included things like, you know, ESSER's sort of an easy one, but we were going to have $50,000 left in ESSER to roll into this summer and could fund some summer programming.

298
01:15:38,293 --> 01:15:52,000
And then once we got, you know, sort of the allocation, we approved a budget, but then once we got the allocation from the city, it became clear that we could not sit on that money because that would mean cutting a staff member somewhere else in order to like leave that money in reserve.

299
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,361
And we've just not been willing to do that.

300
01:15:56,371 --> 01:16:09,454
having gone through all of that over the last, you know, four years, but certainly last year that there was a huge exercise in like, where can we find this money in order to not have to cut staff?

301
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:19,457
Because what the city was able and willing to provide to the schools was not enough to do the basic things that we were feeling like we needed to do.

302
01:16:19,497 --> 01:16:25,218
And there were some, there were some new things that we had to do or planned to, you know, and plan to do.

303
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:47,275
And so I know that sort of complicates the picture each and every time, but I would like to see an actual budget that reflects what the budget should be so that even if we have to make those decisions and changes, like everyone can realize that our building maintenance budget should be half a million dollars and we budgeted 150.

304
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:47,636
And so therefore,

305
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:54,525
really should be no surprise when we come in at half a million dollars that we're over by $350,000.

306
01:16:55,185 --> 01:17:13,270
So I'm hoping that as you build the budget can really reflect like what does a district of our size need to account for in things like legal expenses and building maintenance and technology replacement and we just we have like never been able to get there for a whole variety of reasons but

307
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:15,980
It is, I think, fairly unsustainable.

308
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:29,865
The other thing I'll say is we, in the series of memos that helped us sort of craft the budget last year, there were lots of positions explicitly being tagged to non-operating fund accounts.

309
01:17:29,905 --> 01:17:38,648
So I think that work to sort of scrub and reconcile that all of that has charged out correctly will be a huge portion of this answer.

310
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:53,398
in terms of, because I went back and when I saw this on the agenda, I went back and read one of those and I was like, yeah, there's a whole bunch of stuff here that we said we would do elsewhere, like there's some vocational line items and all kinds of other things.

311
01:17:53,478 --> 01:18:00,200
So I think that's really important work that has to be done before we really understand how big of a deficit are we really talking about.

312
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,341
And then I think I have one more question and then I'll let some of my colleagues speak, but

313
01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:14,366
There's been comments from teachers in the community that they are being told that the schools will run out of paper.

314
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:22,915
And I'm trying to understand where that's coming from, and whether we have advised teachers that we're going to run out of paper.

315
01:18:23,736 --> 01:18:29,021
And I'd like to make a motion that we do not run out of paper in this school year, because it's just

316
01:18:29,744 --> 01:18:40,755
Like it is, it is critical to operating and so I really want to get to the bottom of like where this information is coming from because it's being broadly distributed on social media.

317
01:18:42,352 --> 01:18:44,893
believe I know the original poster.

318
01:18:44,913 --> 01:18:46,613
It's a wonderful teacher.

319
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:47,934
It was one of my daughter's teachers.

320
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:49,975
I really don't believe he's making it up.

321
01:18:50,055 --> 01:19:03,379
I believe he's hearing it from somewhere from some somebody and that maybe that somebody is very well intentioned but if we're gonna run out of paper, I wanna know about it before we run out of paper because we can't run out of paper.

322
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:04,599
Second.

323
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:11,122
So, we first have the motion for a staffing plan and an explanation on the additional 130

324
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:16,681
and overtime for operation and maintenance by Member Graham, seconded by?

325
01:19:17,441 --> 01:19:17,782
Second.

326
01:19:18,482 --> 01:19:20,444
Member Rheinfeld, all those in favor?

327
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:20,965
Aye.

328
01:19:21,545 --> 01:19:22,226
All those opposed?

329
01:19:22,266 --> 01:19:23,167
Motion passes.

330
01:19:23,687 --> 01:19:28,171
And motion by Member Graham to not run out of paper, seconded by Member Rousseau.

331
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:29,092
All those in favor?

332
01:19:29,372 --> 01:19:29,833
Aye.

333
01:19:30,113 --> 01:19:30,894
All those opposed?

334
01:19:31,414 --> 01:19:31,775
Thank you.

335
01:19:32,075 --> 01:19:32,836
Motion passes.

336
01:19:34,777 --> 01:19:35,358
Member Rousseau.

337
01:19:39,258 --> 01:19:51,904
If I may, we have not issued anything on paper, and I would say throughout this process, we have to prioritize the needs of the classroom first, and then everything else is after that.

338
01:19:52,944 --> 01:19:53,604
I appreciate that.

339
01:19:53,644 --> 01:19:56,326
Thank you.

340
01:19:56,506 --> 01:19:56,866
Thank you.

341
01:19:56,886 --> 01:20:00,647
You know, when I'm looking at this, there's this spreadsheet you gave us.

342
01:20:03,246 --> 01:20:11,541
All these numbers are of course are concerning, but there is a general up in addition to the running out of paper thing there's this.

343
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:16,423
drumbeat that we don't have substitutes.

344
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:25,127
And somehow in FY23, we budgeted a quarter of a million dollars, but spent almost $900,000 on substitutes, which is hard to do if we don't have substitutes.

345
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:32,691
So I don't know where that money is going, or if there's a perception that just because there was a day without a substitute, that there are no substitutes.

346
01:20:32,931 --> 01:20:42,756
I know that generalizing can happen, but this number does not tell the story that the community and some teachers definitely are telling, that there's never any substitutes.

347
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,297
How do you spend a million dollars

348
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:47,911
on substitutes if there aren't any, or 900,000.

349
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:50,733
But we appropriated, again, a totally inappropriate number.

350
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:59,638
FY23 was not a, quote, pandemic year.

351
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:04,602
And so, like the previous year where there was lots of people out for

352
01:21:05,322 --> 01:21:06,663
you know, because everybody was testing.

353
01:21:06,683 --> 01:21:13,168
I mean, I know the pandemic really is, you know, some people would say it's not over and I can't disagree with that.

354
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:25,058
But, you know, to appropriate only even less in FY 24, and then to already be projected to spend twice the appropriation that I just

355
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:39,445
I'm confused about why we're even trying to appropriate, why are we putting numbers down in our budget book at all on a lot of these things they're just made up numbers to squeeze into a number we've been handed on a slip of paper from the city.

356
01:21:43,078 --> 01:21:52,422
But to be fair, some of these numbers were in our budget book, before we got that appropriation, you know, the $5,000 I looked back in some of the older budgets, my very first budget, it said $2,000.

357
01:21:52,522 --> 01:21:55,884
The next one that said $30,000.

358
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:59,766
So it looked like somebody was like, hey, we probably should go up.

359
01:21:59,966 --> 01:22:02,267
Now, of course, I don't have actuals.

360
01:22:02,727 --> 01:22:05,468
So I don't know what the actuals were.

361
01:22:06,068 --> 01:22:06,208
But

362
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:21,208
You know this substitute line though and there's another story in here because we're definitely spending a lot of money on substitutes and it's worth noting we pay less for substitutes than most other districts, so it's even more people and and substitute hours that are happening.

363
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:23,812
Well, first let me say that.

364
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:40,702
It's not unusual for a school district to budget less than they would normally use for substitutes because some of those substitutes are gonna be used for teacher vacancies that occur during the year.

365
01:22:40,862 --> 01:22:48,150
So there's likely gonna be surpluses in those salary accounts to kind of offset some of the substitute spending.

366
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:58,343
But you do have to have a substitute budget that's right size to, you know, what your actual need is.

367
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:00,566
The other thing is that

368
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:09,410
principals will pull teachers in to cover classrooms.

369
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:16,671
So there's classroom teachers, and then there's specialist teachers, music, art, phys ed.

370
01:23:18,472 --> 01:23:24,513
Those teachers can be pulled in during their prep period to cover that class.

371
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:26,034
And so that's,

372
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:33,447
driving a lot of the spending because it is true that we could use more substitutes.

373
01:23:34,589 --> 01:23:44,541
And we do really have to address the salaries that we're paying, we're not competitive with surrounding districts.

374
01:23:46,584 --> 01:23:49,426
in attracting substitutes.

375
01:23:50,287 --> 01:24:02,036
We are looking at a staffing, a substitute staffing firm that would recruit substitutes.

376
01:24:02,156 --> 01:24:11,604
They would essentially pay them the rate that we tell them to pay, and then they get an upcharge for their profit and their overhead.

377
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:13,966
That has to go out to bid.

378
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:19,491
But that's kind of one way we're trying to solve this problem.

379
01:24:21,051 --> 01:24:22,552
But that's what's driving the number.

380
01:24:22,992 --> 01:24:37,575
We're filling the substitute slots internally, and that's more expensive than if we were able to hire a substitute off the street to cover that class.

381
01:24:37,981 --> 01:24:41,202
Thank you, that's actually, I would never have guessed that that line meant that.

382
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:56,868
Is there any, you have plenty of work on your plate, but is there any way you can divide this line item in the future so that charges that when we're paying teachers for lost prep times, that that's a separate line item than substitutes we're hiring in?

383
01:24:56,948 --> 01:25:05,772
Because certainly like, they seem like totally like, can we get enough substitutes, this line item,

384
01:25:07,096 --> 01:25:10,038
tells a very different story than what it turns out to be accurate.

385
01:25:10,058 --> 01:25:25,151
And I would really like to know that, especially when we go into the next teacher contract, like, you know, how much are we actually spending on last prep period, which right now I don't think we could easily tell, at least not from here, maybe in the budget.

386
01:25:25,191 --> 01:25:31,916
Yeah, I mean, we could put that into motion for FY 25 to kind of capture that data, but it is,

387
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:52,067
there is difficult, there's three or four systems at play, the accounting system, there's the frontline system, the Harper's payroll system, and they don't easily talk to each other.

388
01:25:52,087 --> 01:25:53,447
Right, thank you.

389
01:25:53,587 --> 01:25:59,970
And then, I think you touched on the security wages already, but

390
01:26:03,173 --> 01:26:20,510
I'm just, is a lot of this expense related to things like the bathrooms and the, you haven't been here long enough for all of our multi-year debate, discussion, community conversation on the safety of our bathrooms and stuff like that.

391
01:26:20,931 --> 01:26:26,256
But when we're paying administrators or anybody else to monitor bathrooms,

392
01:26:27,153 --> 01:26:28,634
assuming we're paying them, I think we are.

393
01:26:29,955 --> 01:26:36,778
Are those getting put into security wages or is that literally just people who are in the security union?

394
01:26:36,798 --> 01:26:40,380
I would, I'm not sure.

395
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,282
I would guess they might be hitting that substitute line as well.

396
01:26:44,582 --> 01:26:47,544
I don't think they'd be part of security wages, but

397
01:26:48,581 --> 01:26:55,025
What's really driving the security wages in FY24 was the fact that we paid these retros.

398
01:26:56,206 --> 01:27:01,569
So it's 24, 23, and 22 are all hitting that account.

399
01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:07,673
You don't see it on the administrators because they're not paid in one account.

400
01:27:08,133 --> 01:27:13,977
They're kind of distributed throughout the programs, but you can see it with the building monitors.

401
01:27:13,997 --> 01:27:15,798
They're all being charged to that one account.

402
01:27:16,226 --> 01:27:18,647
Thank you, I know you said that earlier, I've already forgotten, sorry.

403
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:19,387
No problem.

404
01:27:19,947 --> 01:27:24,209
And then I did have, what was my question?

405
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:28,730
You already answered that already.

406
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:43,956
In the building repairs, as Member Graham pointed out, we just keep budgeting for a number that doesn't make any sense, especially with an old building like the high school, but then it turns out all the other buildings as well.

407
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:58,105
It does this include expenses when the city donate donates when the city covers capital expenses like you know rekeying doors or.

408
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:00,546
Those are cameras.

409
01:28:00,566 --> 01:28:04,388
It's a separate resource that we're able to access.

410
01:28:04,648 --> 01:28:09,751
So anything that's considered capital that the city is paying for directly, that's not even included in this number.

411
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:10,231
Correct.

412
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:15,234
And do you have a sense for what is the big ticket thing?

413
01:28:15,294 --> 01:28:22,257
I mean, I assume that, I don't know when this data came in, but like, is this covering the flooding we just had?

414
01:28:24,631 --> 01:28:29,574
made an educated guess that we would, we're already in deficit in that account.

415
01:28:29,795 --> 01:28:34,838
We spent a little over $300,000 in the first six months.

416
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:42,863
I estimated that we would spend another $250,000 to get through the end of the year.

417
01:28:44,384 --> 01:28:53,150
And we may get some support for the city for that if they have the ability, but it's just that,

418
01:28:54,997 --> 01:29:03,442
that there has to be much better analysis of what needs to be budgeted for.

419
01:29:04,123 --> 01:29:07,545
There are things that are always gonna come up.

420
01:29:07,605 --> 01:29:10,627
There's always bathrooms that have to be repaired.

421
01:29:10,647 --> 01:29:15,450
There's always security cameras that have to be repaired.

422
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:16,931
I would,

423
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:37,919
I would hope that we could, we're kind of in a cycle where we wait until we get enough of a problem that we can go to the city and get a capital outlay, but we don't have an ability to kind of address these things in real time because we don't have enough money in our budget.

424
01:29:38,019 --> 01:29:44,625
And we had a fire alarm issue at the high school,

425
01:29:45,928 --> 01:29:48,909
is five different fire alarm systems in that building.

426
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:56,250
So kind of tracking the nature of the problem was very difficult.

427
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:06,612
We had a fire detail up at the high school to make sure that students and staff were safe.

428
01:30:09,072 --> 01:30:13,553
We had the flood, you know, things happen, life happens.

429
01:30:15,717 --> 01:30:20,219
and you just can't say, well, we're not gonna do that because we don't have enough money.

430
01:30:20,339 --> 01:30:27,042
We have to do it, but we have to make sure those budgets are right size so we can address problems as they come up.

431
01:30:28,042 --> 01:30:28,383
Thank you.

432
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:39,307
And I just wanna say one other thing about when we get to the budget, if the committee decides that we want to use reality as a basis for our budget,

433
01:30:42,162 --> 01:30:57,311
barring some gigantic unexpected increase in revenue, we'll be faced with the decision of, okay, we're going to put in $150,000 for legal, and we're going to lay off this number of people to do it.

434
01:30:58,011 --> 01:31:00,092
It's not a situation any of us wants.

435
01:31:00,713 --> 01:31:06,836
I should also point out that just pretending reality isn't there, I don't know who it serves.

436
01:31:09,128 --> 01:31:12,171
And this is the position we have been in year after year.

437
01:31:13,713 --> 01:31:29,889
And I'm not looking forward to the budget for this reason, but I think having those actuals right up against it, having reality on screen and in our books will at least allow us to say it out loud.

438
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:31,671
Okay, we're gonna probably spend

439
01:31:32,632 --> 01:31:37,516
$500,000, we're going to budget 100,000 and just see what happens.

440
01:31:38,277 --> 01:31:38,978
Very exciting.

441
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:42,461
It's really depressing, frankly.

442
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:50,407
And this is going to be my sixth budget, I don't count the first one, new members, like the budget just happens to them.

443
01:31:50,888 --> 01:31:58,014
But it's going to be really my sixth budget, where I participated, where every year the buildings and grounds budget is

444
01:31:58,949 --> 01:32:01,352
150,000, building repairs is $150,000.

445
01:32:02,313 --> 01:32:10,320
Each year that I looked at, and I can say quite confidently, there has never been a year where it was anywhere close to that.

446
01:32:12,202 --> 01:32:22,612
But short of an awful lot more money from the city, we're gonna have to choose to either be honest with the budget and lay off a whole lot of people.

447
01:32:23,951 --> 01:32:27,014
or just zero things out and see what happens.

448
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:29,055
I just think it's a crappy choice that we have.

449
01:32:29,756 --> 01:32:34,300
And I appreciate that you're gonna at least allow us to see it in real time.

450
01:32:35,911 --> 01:32:45,940
and we can all make our decision to put $5,000 in the legal fund so that we can save the staff that is directly with the students.

451
01:32:47,241 --> 01:32:49,803
But then we're just gonna be here next year having the same conversation.

452
01:32:50,864 --> 01:32:54,828
We should all look at each other and be like, we're gonna have this exact same conversation next year.

453
01:32:55,328 --> 01:32:59,572
And it's going to be the worst deja vu, but thank you very much.

454
01:33:02,314 --> 01:33:02,775
Member Graham.

455
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:12,827
I'd like to make a motion that we get an update sometime in March to let us know sort of all the work that you're doing.

456
01:33:13,547 --> 01:33:15,188
How is it changing the projections?

457
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,213
Point of information.

458
01:33:21,233 --> 01:33:22,234
The 18th, on or about the 18th meeting.

459
01:33:24,775 --> 01:33:26,156
point of information member McLaughlin.

460
01:33:26,276 --> 01:33:31,579
I just want to double check too on the quarterly for the actual versus projected versus budgeted.

461
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:32,899
So on that motion.

462
01:33:32,999 --> 01:33:42,124
So I think we, you know, should be getting a quarterly report, which would be around March, April, based on that motion that already exists.

463
01:33:42,865 --> 01:33:44,305
But I don't have the motion number.

464
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:52,850
I have to go back to the minutes or something, but so is that I will second in lieu of us checking that.

465
01:33:53,234 --> 01:34:05,779
but I think we also need to check because we should have a motion in place that's quarterly, budgeted, actual, projected, deficit, as has been discussed previously.

466
01:34:05,999 --> 01:34:06,399
Thank you.

467
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:10,741
Okay, so motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

468
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:11,721
All those in favor?

469
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:12,261
Aye.

470
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:17,923
All those opposed for a budget update, March 18th, no hearing and seeing none, motion passes.

471
01:34:20,865 --> 01:34:21,945
And I'm assuming

472
01:34:23,237 --> 01:34:27,778
Mr. McHugh, you're gonna keep digging, have more information for us on the 18th.

473
01:34:28,758 --> 01:34:29,058
Okay.

474
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:35,880
Thank you.

475
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:36,860
Okay.

476
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,761
Thank you.

477
01:34:44,082 --> 01:34:46,383
Presentations of the public, there are

478
01:34:47,253 --> 01:35:01,105
There aren't any nor continued or new business, we do have a resolution offered by member Russo member all a party, 2024 dash nine the result the name of the school building committee be named the Medford comprehensive high school building committee.

479
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:08,211
Further, the superintendent will secure the domain, mhs project.org and set up a website dedicated

480
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:15,763
to this project, and further, the chairperson of said committee will be vice chair of the Medford School Committee, member Jenny Graham.

481
01:35:16,364 --> 01:35:17,925
Member Rousseau or member Olopade?

482
01:35:18,105 --> 01:35:19,746
Do you want to speak?

483
01:35:20,186 --> 01:35:20,707
I'll start.

484
01:35:21,147 --> 01:35:23,548
One second, let me just get the language back up.

485
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:28,792
So in our last meeting, we were

486
01:35:29,804 --> 01:35:32,825
I think we had motions and we all seem to really want to have an FAQ.

487
01:35:32,885 --> 01:35:35,307
And I think an FAQ is certainly critical.

488
01:35:35,367 --> 01:35:36,807
It needs to hang off of something.

489
01:35:36,827 --> 01:35:43,350
I looked around at project websites that existed for surrounding communities.

490
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:51,634
They were frankly, nobody was very creative in their school building project website URL.

491
01:35:52,315 --> 01:35:59,098
And I just copied, I think, I don't know if it was Arlington or Somerville,

492
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:05,166
just use MHSproject.org, it could be anything, as long as it's not too long.

493
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:11,815
And I did look to make sure it was available, at least until this got published, and hopefully nobody went and snagged it.

494
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:14,339
So I think, you know, having that

495
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:28,287
having us have the actual URL gives us a starting point for folks to actually put up an FAQ system, which I highly recommend we just look at the FAQs for other districts because mostly they're just going to be the same questions.

496
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:31,228
And then the other thing was to actually name the committee.

497
01:36:32,189 --> 01:36:36,351
And I know we have a policy on advisory committees, but this is not an advisory committee, which

498
01:36:37,811 --> 01:36:39,552
is like, well, what is it?

499
01:36:39,812 --> 01:36:49,134
It's a special kind of committee that's part of the law that authorizes the MSBA building stuff.

500
01:36:50,234 --> 01:36:54,936
So that's why I'm not following the advisory committee policy we have, because it's not an advisory committee.

501
01:36:56,636 --> 01:36:59,397
An advisory committee doesn't actually make decisions.

502
01:36:59,457 --> 01:37:03,658
They make decisions, well, they make decisions, but then they come to us and then we make the decision.

503
01:37:04,178 --> 01:37:08,800
I think a building committee makes actual decisions that are the decision.

504
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,961
So I think that's probably the biggest difference.

505
01:37:13,021 --> 01:37:22,624
And then, so I did choose, I just, again, I'm open to changes to these things, but the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee, it's a little long.

506
01:37:23,065 --> 01:37:24,005
It was always gonna be long.

507
01:37:25,826 --> 01:37:32,232
And then the final part was to name Vice Chair Graham as the chair of the committee.

508
01:37:32,272 --> 01:37:36,676
I looked around, the school committee member is usually the chair of the building committee.

509
01:37:37,456 --> 01:37:46,044
I think it's, you know, in our renaming committee, we didn't have a school committee member as, was there a member at all on there?

510
01:37:46,364 --> 01:37:46,444
No.

511
01:37:46,844 --> 01:37:47,585
But you know, and

512
01:37:48,430 --> 01:38:02,038
you know, nothing to, not to speak badly of anybody on that committee, but having somebody who is like regularly using Roberts rules, understands open meeting law is like not optional.

513
01:38:02,478 --> 01:38:09,082
And we did build that into the advisory committee policy, which we bid, we drafted a couple of years ago.

514
01:38:09,943 --> 01:38:16,567
So I think it's very important to have a current school committee member who can, from day one, know how to run the meetings, know about open meeting law,

515
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:22,641
So that's why, and obviously somebody who's willing to serve as the chair is kind of an important piece.

516
01:38:23,602 --> 01:38:26,885
So I do not wish to be the chair.

517
01:38:28,406 --> 01:38:33,471
And so I asked Member Graham if she would like to be chair and she is able and willing.

518
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:35,633
So that's why I've made this motion.

519
01:38:36,594 --> 01:38:37,455
Thank you, Member Russo.

520
01:38:40,137 --> 01:38:41,699
Thank you both for your resolution.

521
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:43,060
Is there a motion on the floor then?

522
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:48,091
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Olopade.

523
01:38:48,691 --> 01:38:49,572
All those in favor?

524
01:38:50,733 --> 01:38:51,573
All those opposed?

525
01:38:51,694 --> 01:38:52,494
Motion passes.

526
01:38:54,216 --> 01:38:56,578
We do not have any reports requested.

527
01:38:56,698 --> 01:39:05,085
Our next regular scheduled meeting is March 4th, 2024, here at the Alden Memorial Chambers, Metro City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

528
01:39:09,148 --> 01:39:09,769
Motion to adjourn?

529
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:12,356
by Member Brandley, seconded by Member Graham.

530
01:39:12,396 --> 01:39:13,178
All those in favor?

531
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:13,639
Aye.

532
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:14,621
Opposed?

533
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:16,725
Motion to adjourn is approved.

534
01:39:16,765 --> 01:39:17,527
No school tomorrow.

535
01:39:18,188 --> 01:39:19,090
No school tomorrow.

536
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:19,571
Yes.

537
01:39:20,153 --> 01:39:20,794
Shovel your neighbor.
