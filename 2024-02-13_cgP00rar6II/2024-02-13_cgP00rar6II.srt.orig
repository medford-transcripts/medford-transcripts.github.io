1
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:22,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:25,338
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back from executive session.

3
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And next up, we have the consent agenda.

4
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,602
[SPEAKER_05]: We have bills and payrolls, regular school committee minutes from February 5th, 2024.

5
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:38,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion for approval?

6
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:45,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval.

7
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:47,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

8
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:48,615
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

9
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:49,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

10
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:50,356
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

11
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:52,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting the hang of it, and it's only meeting three.

12
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:53,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, good job.

13
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, four, okay, sorry.

14
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:04,004
[SPEAKER_05]: No reports of subcommittees, and we have three reports from our superintendent.

15
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:06,205
[SPEAKER_05]: First up is updates and comments.

16
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

17
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:11,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

18
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:19,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Lunar New Year to our Asian American and Pacific Islander community members and all who celebrated it.

19
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:22,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Saturday marked the beginning of the Year of the Dragon.

20
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:33,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Lunar New Year celebrations are often focused on festive meals, gathering with family and loved ones and preparing for a healthy and fortunate year ahead.

21
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:43,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, it is that time for the lucky red envelopes, which are given out with money or special treats for children and everyone.

22
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:49,957
[SPEAKER_06]: The red envelopes are always welcome, and if you're fortunate to receive one, accept it with a big smile.

23
00:39:49,977 --> 00:40:04,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to thank the Medford Human Rights Commission and the Medford Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at the city for hosting a fun New Year celebration this past Saturday at our new library.

24
00:40:06,713 --> 00:40:15,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'd like to take this moment to introduce a Harvard University education fellow, Miss Kimberly Lewis.

25
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:22,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited to briefly introduce a new member of our Medford Mustangs team.

26
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:28,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Miss Kimberly Lewis is joining my office two days a week as a Harvard doctoral fellow.

27
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:41,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Miss Lewis is an experienced secondary educator, who was taught in Texas, California, Maryland, Washington DC, and the United Arab Emirates.

28
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:47,568
[SPEAKER_06]: She is currently pursuing a doctorate in educational leadership at the Harvard Graduate School of Ed.

29
00:40:49,853 --> 00:40:57,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Through an extremely competitive process, Medford Public Schools was selected to be one of the highly sought after districts for Harvard residency.

30
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:09,444
[SPEAKER_06]: This fellowship is fully funded by the generosity of HGSE, and this partnership will provide our district with an additional opportunity to better meet the needs of all of our students.

31
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:11,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

32
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:19,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis will be involved in our district's work and learn about the demands, opportunities, and challenges that face a superintendent on a daily basis.

33
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:26,795
[SPEAKER_06]: She will utilize this time to learn about the complex role and work of a superintendent of schools.

34
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I am extremely appreciative of the opportunity to work with Ms.

35
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:34,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis and look forward to our collaboration as colleagues.

36
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:36,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

37
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:42,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis is on the call and we are welcoming you to just greet the school committee.

38
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:47,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, hi.

39
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that lovely introduction, Dr. Vincent.

40
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:57,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Dr. Vincent said, my name is Kimberly, and I'm working on my doctorate in educational leadership.

41
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:05,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked in education for the past 15 years, and I am super excited to include Medford as part of my learning experience.

42
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:11,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already gained a lot from working with Dr. Vincent in the past weeks, and I look forward to learning from you all as well.

43
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:13,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

44
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

45
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:16,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Lewis.

46
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:27,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Also this evening, I would like to just provide a brief update on our tiered focus monitoring review.

47
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:37,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week, DESE, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, conducted its triennial review of our English learner education programs.

48
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:51,344
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very grateful to Mr. Paul Teixeira, our EL director and his team, as well as all the Medford staff and faculty who helped facilitate this important oversight visit.

49
00:42:52,944 --> 00:43:06,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So at tonight's meeting, I'm looking forward to inviting the committee to approve a generous donation by Tufts University to support Medford's Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility,

50
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:15,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And next, we'll move on to a mid-year budget update from Mr. Jerry McHugh, our district's finance director.

51
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:36,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Over recent years, we have talked at length about the significance and positive impact of pandemic-era funding sources, such as the federal government's ESSER program, usually known, it's the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund,

52
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:40,398
[SPEAKER_06]: which we call the acronym, sir.

53
00:43:41,238 --> 00:43:43,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be discussing that a little bit.

54
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:53,425
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've also talked about how eventually those funding sources would be depleted, and our budgets would face a fiscal cliff.

55
00:43:55,023 --> 00:44:10,800
[SPEAKER_06]: So this evening, we're going to have a presentation from Mr. McHugh, and he will cover the challenging news that we are facing a shortfall and provide a little more additional detail.

56
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:20,083
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do want to begin the conversation by stating clearly that our team is all hands on deck to respond to this situation.

57
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:39,227
[SPEAKER_06]: We will work actively every day with administrators and educators to weather this difficult scenario, communicate its significance to our community, and most of all, to ensure that Medford students continue to receive the high quality public education services they all deserve.

58
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:40,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

59
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:44,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent, and nice to meet you, Ms.

60
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:44,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Lewis.

61
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,385
[SPEAKER_05]: We have recommendation to approve a donation from Tufts University.

62
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:51,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward Vincent?

63
00:44:53,127 --> 00:45:02,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am asking the committee to approve a generous donation of $1,000 to the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, CCSR.

64
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:17,072
[SPEAKER_06]: CCSR is funded by the Cummings Foundation, the Crystal Campbell Community Betterment Fund, and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and relies on thoughtful donations such as this.

65
00:45:17,992 --> 00:45:23,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So my request is, will the committee approve the $1,000 donation from Tufts University?

66
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:27,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

67
00:45:27,914 --> 00:45:28,874
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

68
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:29,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

69
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:30,595
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

70
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:31,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

71
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:40,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, we have number three, mid-year fiscal year 24 budget update, Mr. Jerry McHugh, Director of Finance.

72
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:40,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

73
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:58,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that good?

74
00:45:59,636 --> 00:46:06,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam Mayor, and it's very nice to meet many of you in person tonight.

75
00:46:09,263 --> 00:46:17,128
[SPEAKER_00]: As the superintendent said, we began doing projections through the end of this fiscal year in January.

76
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:25,674
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fall, we had settled the administrator's contract, the building monitor's contract,

77
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:40,912
[SPEAKER_00]: And these contracts not only affected FY24 salaries, but there were retroactive salaries for FY23 and FY22 that are hitting in FY24.

78
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:50,894
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get those new salaries kind of programmed in to the payroll system in order to do these projections.

79
00:46:51,955 --> 00:46:52,115
[SPEAKER_00]: And

80
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:03,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I disclosed to the superintendent and the mayor that we are projecting a potential shortfall of $2.5 million.

81
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:09,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I caution that this is very preliminary at this point.

82
00:47:09,028 --> 00:47:15,031
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always kind of a tension when you have a problem like this.

83
00:47:16,072 --> 00:47:19,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do a lot of research so you can have immediate answers or

84
00:47:20,558 --> 00:47:22,779
[SPEAKER_00]: do you disclose as soon as possible?

85
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:36,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like we should be disclosing this to you right now as we kind of look into the various issues that could be, you know, causing the shortfall.

86
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:43,373
[SPEAKER_00]: So I prepared a document that,

87
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,422
[SPEAKER_00]: identifies three areas.

88
00:47:47,322 --> 00:48:00,168
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, there are a number of accounts that are running over and some are running under and they offset each other, but these particular accounts I'm gonna call out to look at.

89
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:10,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first group is a number of accounts where we spent more in FY23 than we budgeted in FY24.

90
00:48:10,272 --> 00:48:10,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

91
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:16,197
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to look into why that is.

92
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:21,802
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these accounts we're really going to have to address in the FY25 budget.

93
00:48:21,842 --> 00:48:25,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Our budget should be aligned to what the

94
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,049
[SPEAKER_00]: projected spending is in that account.

95
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:37,391
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in legal expenses, we budgeted $5,000 in FY23.

96
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:38,311
[SPEAKER_00]: We wound up spending $95,000 in FY23.

97
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:39,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in FY24, we budgeted 5,000 again.

98
00:48:39,412 --> 00:48:42,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're projected to spend by the end of the year $165,000.

99
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:42,493
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's,

100
00:48:57,571 --> 00:49:01,978
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about half a dozen cases that the school department is involved in.

101
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:09,329
[SPEAKER_00]: We get bills every month for legal expenses as they work on these cases.

102
00:49:10,976 --> 00:49:27,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier in, in the, in the fall, we, we had a settlement and one of the cases of $75,000 that that hit this account so that's just an example of an account that, you know, could not

103
00:49:28,288 --> 00:49:30,489
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be budgeted correctly.

104
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:36,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is the homeless transportation.

105
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:42,931
[SPEAKER_00]: So every school district is required to provide transportation to homeless students.

106
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:44,192
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for very good reason.

107
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:47,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And in FY23, we budgeted $130,000 for homeless transportation.

108
00:49:47,912 --> 00:49:48,533
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent over 700,000.

109
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:07,127
[SPEAKER_00]: In FY 24, again, we budgeted $130,000, and we're well on our way to spending over $500,000.

110
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:16,974
[SPEAKER_00]: We do get some money from the state to reimburse that, but it's not anywhere near what the actual expense is.

111
00:50:17,755 --> 00:50:23,419
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of these things it's very hard to budget for because it's very unpredictable.

112
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:40,803
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could get notice tomorrow from a school district that has a homeless family in Medford and they're being bused back to that district, we participate in half that cost.

113
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:51,430
[SPEAKER_00]: But as hard as it is to budget for that, we should be cognizant of what we typically spend year in and year out and try to get our budget aligned to that.

114
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:59,162
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of salary accounts that still need to be investigated.

115
00:51:01,985 --> 00:51:08,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Those budgets are built with particular positions behind them.

116
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:10,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really have to look at

117
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:17,033
[SPEAKER_00]: who is expected to be charged to that account and who is actually being charged to that account.

118
00:51:17,714 --> 00:51:24,305
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be differences in what was predicted versus the actual salary that's being paid.

119
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:31,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem could be that the payroll system didn't change.

120
00:51:31,294 --> 00:51:41,264
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody transferred, say, from the Andrews to the McGlynn, did the payroll change to kind of reflect that salary should be charged to McGlynn now instead of Andrews?

121
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:45,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So those things should need to be investigated a little bit more.

122
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:46,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Another,

123
00:51:50,771 --> 00:52:07,897
[SPEAKER_00]: issue that is really driving the deficit is there's three contracts that were in negotiations at the end of FY23, the administrator's contract, the building monitors, and the custodians.

124
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:16,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears that there was a reserve established for the settlement of these contracts in FY23.

125
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,961
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an account called undistributed salaries,

126
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:25,802
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a budget of $1.1 million for those in that account.

127
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:31,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, those contracts did not get settled in FY23.

128
00:52:31,423 --> 00:52:43,328
[SPEAKER_00]: They got settled in FY24, but the budget, the reserves that were there in FY23 were no longer in the budget in FY24.

129
00:52:43,348 --> 00:52:46,709
[SPEAKER_00]: FY24, the appropriation was set at $250,000.

130
00:52:53,041 --> 00:53:06,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So those new salaries for FY24 and the retroactive amounts that went along with them are causing some of the shortfall.

131
00:53:07,453 --> 00:53:19,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third kind of unfunded charge to the budget was that custodians had a wage settlement back in 2022.

132
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:30,857
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for over $570,000 and it was to be paid out over a three-year period.

133
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:35,680
[SPEAKER_00]: A small payment in May of 2022, a payment of about $250,000.

134
00:53:44,813 --> 00:53:47,514
[SPEAKER_00]: $50,000 in August of 22, and another payment of about $250,000 in August of 23.

135
00:53:47,554 --> 00:53:50,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And these payments ran through the custodian salary account.

136
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:16,155
[SPEAKER_00]: as was necessary in order to capture the tax withholdings that were necessary for those individuals.

137
00:54:17,495 --> 00:54:21,498
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, that's kind of driving some of the shortfall.

138
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:31,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we will be implementing some initiatives this week to try to

139
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:37,134
[SPEAKER_00]: close this gap as best we can with existing funds.

140
00:54:39,496 --> 00:54:55,206
[SPEAKER_00]: We will scrutinize new purchase orders to make sure we're only spending expense budgets on things that are absolutely necessary or where we're required to spend.

141
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:58,168
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be scrutinizing any

142
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:10,132
[SPEAKER_00]: vacancies that we have to limit backfilling of vacancies only to those positions that are absolutely necessary.

143
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:23,438
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna review all the planned spending on grants and revolving funds that were part of the FY 24 budget to make sure that those were accurately implemented in the budget.

144
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:38,763
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also be reviewing existing encumbrances or encumbrances that are already in the system to make sure we're only encumbering what we need to get through the end of the year.

145
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:41,185
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, there is,

146
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:51,210
[SPEAKER_00]: funds available for the homeless transportation, $170,000, so far what I can see in the system.

147
00:55:53,451 --> 00:56:03,915
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a preliminary conversation with the mayor and her finance director, and we found out that the FY23 budget is not closed yet.

148
00:56:04,175 --> 00:56:10,037
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a balance that the school department finished with in FY23, so potentially,

149
00:56:12,478 --> 00:56:21,650
[SPEAKER_00]: There's funds there that can help with some of these retroactive payments for the contracts that had been settled.

150
00:56:22,091 --> 00:56:29,320
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the ESSA 3 account to see if there's any unspent or unprogrammed

151
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:37,928
[SPEAKER_00]: spending in that account that can be used to offset this shortfall.

152
00:56:37,948 --> 00:56:47,456
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at other revolving funds that might have capacity and eligibility to

153
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:51,518
[SPEAKER_00]: to move some spending onto those.

154
00:56:53,438 --> 00:57:10,982
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did, the city is looking to see if there's any funding in their capital program that could possibly be used for our capital needs as we go forward.

155
00:57:15,404 --> 00:57:15,784
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's,

156
00:57:17,776 --> 00:57:20,637
[SPEAKER_00]: First report, there'll be certainly more to come with this.

157
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:30,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have kind of a plan that we feel is solid, we'll certainly come back and report to the school committee on how we're addressing this.

158
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:39,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the update, Jerry.

159
00:57:40,004 --> 00:57:40,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

160
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:42,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

161
00:57:43,185 --> 00:57:44,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate this report.

162
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:45,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it was a lot of

163
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:46,936
[SPEAKER_01]: manual labor.

164
00:57:47,016 --> 00:57:54,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we don't have the systems in place to make this a button you click, which I think in many districts, it's a button you click.

165
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:58,826
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of the reasons we don't get this stuff monthly.

166
00:57:58,846 --> 00:58:05,992
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't get a burn report, which many other districts, even the little collaborative short collaborative

167
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:14,535
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a burn report, and we just can't do that with our systems, which is disappointing in a conversation for another day.

168
00:58:15,955 --> 00:58:16,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few questions.

169
00:58:17,696 --> 00:58:21,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the identification of the undistributed salaries line item.

170
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:30,419
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this $1.1 million appropriation, that just went back to the city, and then in FY24, the appropriation was 250,000.

171
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:33,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither of those numbers together cover

172
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:38,450
[SPEAKER_01]: the expense is what I understand, correct?

173
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:50,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the contracts had settled in FY23, it might not have covered the full amount, but it was a pretty close estimate.

174
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:54,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that there could have been a

175
00:58:57,125 --> 00:59:03,671
[SPEAKER_00]: not all of those funds were returned to the city because the balance that exists today is about $450,000.

176
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:04,051
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine

177
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:29,985
[SPEAKER_00]: once they realized that they had available funds in FY23, there was probably some year-end transactions to maybe charge things to general fund that weren't planned for initially in order to reduce charges on grants or revolving funds that could roll into FY24.

178
00:59:30,645 --> 00:59:31,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

179
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:55,603
[SPEAKER_01]: you won't remember any of this, but on January 6th of 2020, we got our FY 2019 budget close out, and it lists what we budgeted, what we spent, and the differences, and it's sideways, so I can't really go through it too easily.

180
00:59:56,203 --> 01:00:01,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't believe we have received such a report since then, so I don't know.

181
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:05,869
[SPEAKER_01]: That means nothing for FY20, FY21, FY22, FY23.

182
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:13,972
[SPEAKER_01]: We have never seen a closeout that shows us that we budgeted $5,000 and spent $180,000 or whatever it is.

183
01:00:14,752 --> 01:00:24,496
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that is that it takes so long to close out because the systems are not, we're not using Munis and we're just using

184
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:27,877
[SPEAKER_01]: inappropriately outdated systems.

185
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:47,951
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that if you have a closeout report for any of those years, I certainly would be grateful because I think when the committee is looking at our budget proposal, and we see a line item for 5,000, and we see that last year the line item was 5,000, the rational person sees that and says, oh, okay, that should be fine, right?

186
01:00:49,032 --> 01:00:53,274
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we also could have a report at the same time that says, no, we budgeted 5,000,

187
01:00:55,134 --> 01:01:01,097
[SPEAKER_01]: The superintendent's budget says $5,000, but it was $160,000 in spending.

188
01:01:01,497 --> 01:01:03,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a major conversation.

189
01:01:04,479 --> 01:01:10,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hope the committee can have that by the time we do the budget.

190
01:01:13,744 --> 01:01:14,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information.

191
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:14,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

192
01:01:15,344 --> 01:01:16,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

193
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:22,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we made a motion that we would have quarterly budget reports for actuals versus expended.

194
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:27,279
[SPEAKER_04]: in one of our previous meetings.

195
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:33,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have it in front of me, but we've had this conversation certainly multiple times, but I believe it was a motion that was put forward.

196
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:45,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to double check in the motions, but I believe that we said we would have actual versus expended versus projected, which is exactly what we're seeing here, which is nice.

197
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:50,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is remarkable that we haven't had this in the past and we very much need it.

198
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:51,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm

199
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to double check and see if that motion.

200
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:04,406
[SPEAKER_00]: My plan for FY 25 is to show you actual spending in FY 23.

201
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:19,877
[SPEAKER_00]: A good practice for you to review is what's the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, what's the budget for the current fiscal year, and then what was the actual spending for the year behind that.

202
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:29,021
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have an FY25 proposal, we'll have an FY24 budget, and FY23 actual spending.

203
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:30,702
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can,

204
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:41,569
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, be able to take a look at, you know, what that, if the budget makes sense versus what we might've spent.

205
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:42,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

206
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:45,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just have one more question and then I'll let my colleagues jump in.

207
01:02:47,212 --> 01:03:00,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the FY20 budget, which nobody has in front of them but me, but near the very end of the budget book, and this is something that Medford has been doing for a very long time,

208
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:09,031
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a long list of positions that are not in any way, shape or form anything other than normal operations.

209
01:03:10,292 --> 01:03:28,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, we have a director, we have secretaries, we have teachers, we have tech people, another director, another director, some paras, all of which are actually regular operating normal part of running a school district.

210
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:42,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And $1.85 million worth of staff is actually listed as being on grants from revolving, the grants of course is different, but much of this is just from revolving accounts.

211
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:49,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm aware having talked to other finance directors like the one at the short collaborative, that this is very unusual.

212
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go any further than that.

213
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:55,249
[SPEAKER_01]: But my question to you is this,

214
01:03:56,926 --> 01:04:13,196
[SPEAKER_01]: How does, if there's such a thing as a normal district, if we put all of these people on the budget, which we should do, and then we have these revolving accounts that build up funds, how does a normal district dispose of those funds?

215
01:04:13,757 --> 01:04:24,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they just, at the end of the year, like, hey, we have 1.5 extra million dollars from afterschool or whatever the number is, do we, we don't just let that build up forever or become a,

216
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:29,728
[SPEAKER_01]: private checkbook for the superintendent to do fun things in the district.

217
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:36,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we write a check and transfer it back to the city so that it can become part of the budget.

218
01:04:37,016 --> 01:04:39,598
[SPEAKER_01]: How does, what does a district normally do with all that.

219
01:04:39,758 --> 01:04:48,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I, I actually researched that when I first got here because, you know, some of the balances are.

220
01:04:50,894 --> 01:05:03,477
[SPEAKER_00]: we could use some of those balances to help with our general fund budget, but it's not, you don't have the ability to simply transfer it.

221
01:05:03,557 --> 01:05:19,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, the before and after school program is funded entirely from fees that are charged to parents and it's pretty robust and it has a large balance in it,

222
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:26,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically for revolving funds, you're supposed to spend that money.

223
01:05:27,385 --> 01:05:32,390
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to be a relationship between what you're collecting it for, and what you're spending it on.

224
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:40,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right, what we can do as a district is that we can start

225
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:49,316
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at expenses that are being provided on behalf of that program in the general fund.

226
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:52,818
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do a facilities assessment, for instance.

227
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:57,962
[SPEAKER_00]: We're providing the classroom space, we're cleaning it, we're providing heat.

228
01:06:00,584 --> 01:06:04,147
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be an administrative expense charged as well.

229
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:09,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has to be methodologies to make sure it's fair to the program, but

230
01:06:11,112 --> 01:06:20,996
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spending a lot on processing, payroll processing, encumbrances for those programs, and some of that funding can be recouped.

231
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:33,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I just last week finished a methodology to charge the food service program for electricity and natural gas that they're using in the cafeteria.

232
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:35,083
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to,

233
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:51,306
[SPEAKER_00]: share this with the director and some of my colleagues, but I think we can recover like $54,000, $55,000 from the lunch fund to kind of help support the buildings grounds department with those expenses.

234
01:06:51,906 --> 01:06:54,086
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you would do it.

235
01:06:56,627 --> 01:07:03,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping that maybe you could with, you know,

236
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:13,843
[SPEAKER_00]: an appropriation from the city council that could move funds in that way that that would, it doesn't appear that that kind of exists.

237
01:07:13,983 --> 01:07:22,965
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only, there's a lot of language around if you close down a fund, you know, where that money goes to.

238
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:24,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

239
01:07:29,686 --> 01:07:30,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

240
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:31,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

241
01:07:35,005 --> 01:07:42,422
[SPEAKER_03]: This might be a question for the superintendent, but who is responsible for approving operations and maintenance over time?

242
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:56,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be the director of building and grounds, but also the overtime is closely linked to community schools.

243
01:07:56,976 --> 01:08:03,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So with all of the rentals that are happening on weekends, and it's not the normal Monday to Friday weekday.

244
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:12,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of those, some of the time would be automatically, it would need to be overtime because it's happening outside of the school day.

245
01:08:13,667 --> 01:08:27,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And depending on the number of people that are using the facility, or if it's happening after school, there are large groups of people, they have to go back and clean those areas that normally would not be used.

246
01:08:27,735 --> 01:08:33,559
[SPEAKER_06]: So the facility is used a lot, especially the high school campus.

247
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:39,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, and the McGlynn Complex is the other building.

248
01:08:39,702 --> 01:08:42,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Those two have, I think, the highest

249
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:47,165
[SPEAKER_06]: rental costs.

250
01:08:47,466 --> 01:08:58,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that vein then, are you checking that the overtime that's attributable to revenue for rentals is being charged off?

251
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:00,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess my question is,

252
01:09:01,522 --> 01:09:12,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Is somebody just grossly overspending overtime, or is this just an accounting issue that needs to be resolved, and that there actually is no problem with that account?

253
01:09:13,228 --> 01:09:21,852
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of that, if I may, just because I understand we have events, but to have a discrepancy of 183 fiscal year 23, and then a $120,000 jump, how many more events in 2024?

254
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:34,128
[SPEAKER_05]: or this fiscal year, I should say, more than the last fiscal year, is a huge question.

255
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:41,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So the director of Buildings and Grounds does sign the overtime payroll.

256
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:57,760
[SPEAKER_00]: The overtime that's attributable to events, church groups, and community schools, pool, that overtime is charged to those revolving funds.

257
01:10:00,508 --> 01:10:08,044
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm not sure, there is kind of overtime that's baked into the contract, and I'm

258
01:10:11,468 --> 01:10:19,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if that like mandatory overtime was ever kind of taken into account in building the overtime budget.

259
01:10:19,274 --> 01:10:25,179
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, during January and February, there's building checks that go on.

260
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:29,983
[SPEAKER_00]: So a number of custodians are involved in going to the building.

261
01:10:31,104 --> 01:10:37,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday and Sunday with minimum hours to make sure the heat's functioning.

262
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:46,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's, you know, something maybe to be addressed in the next contract with them.

263
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:58,355
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, you know, we have to calculate what that amounts to and then make sure that's provided for in the overtime budget.

264
01:10:59,804 --> 01:11:09,150
[SPEAKER_00]: There's night checks, there's a lot of overtime going to covering people that are out.

265
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:11,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are out on long-term leave.

266
01:11:12,873 --> 01:11:17,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might just be out vacation or sickness or whatever.

267
01:11:17,196 --> 01:11:25,501
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of minimum manning that's in the contract, those shifts all get covered in the overtime budget.

268
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And can, I think,

269
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:40,465
[SPEAKER_03]: In a related question, can somebody take an action item to sit with the head of buildings and grounds and come up with a staffing plan that allows us to budget appropriately next time?

270
01:11:41,065 --> 01:11:58,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it seems like there's maybe a budgeting issue, but also if this is in fact accurate and we're way overspending our overtime budget, like we need to have a different plan so that we're not blowing our overtime budget because we don't have the money to do that.

271
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:18,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think somebody needs to sit with the Director of Buildings and Grounds and make a staffing plan that we can both operate to in the future, but also sort of get things under control in the right now, because otherwise we're gonna way overspend instead of somewhat overspend, right?

272
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:22,099
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that is pretty critical, because that's one of the big items that jumps out.

273
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:24,780
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of- Is that a motion, Member Graham?

274
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:28,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm just asking that that happen.

275
01:12:28,906 --> 01:12:30,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I can happy to make a motion.

276
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:48,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to make a motion that the administration work with the director of buildings and grounds and create a staffing plan so that future budgeting can contemplate planned overtime, and we can curtail overtime spending for the remainder of the school year.

277
01:12:49,432 --> 01:13:04,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And if somebody wouldn't mind adding, considering that the contract has not changed to see that it's 140,000 more this fiscal year projected versus last, if the committee could get a breakdown of exactly what the reasoning is for that.

278
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:05,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

279
01:13:06,056 --> 01:13:17,199
[SPEAKER_00]: So one issue that might be causing the projection model to overestimate in this area is that

280
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:24,099
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using overtime in January.

281
01:13:25,103 --> 01:13:26,743
[SPEAKER_00]: to project through the end of the year.

282
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:48,947
[SPEAKER_00]: So the building checks will cease at the end of February, and that might reduce, it's not gonna eliminate the deficit, but we'll be continuing to run the model through the remainder of the year, that shortfall is gonna be a moving target.

283
01:13:49,647 --> 01:13:53,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's getting reduced as we go along and identify

284
01:13:56,415 --> 01:14:01,400
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that are causing the shortfall and make that cease.

285
01:14:02,081 --> 01:14:02,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

286
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:07,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other thing that I want to make sure we acknowledge is that

287
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:18,679
[SPEAKER_03]: we for the four years that I've been on the committee, we've been talking about making sure we have adequate budgets in various line items like technology replacement and building maintenance.

288
01:14:18,739 --> 01:14:22,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we all sort of know and feel like we're not maintaining our buildings appropriately.

289
01:14:23,684 --> 01:14:30,790
[SPEAKER_03]: But each time we have that conversation, then we encounter a budget issue where we don't have enough money.

290
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:33,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to do that on paper, in order to increase

291
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:45,137
[SPEAKER_03]: a budget, you know, a budget for building maintenance on paper, it would mean like cutting somebody who works with kids.

292
01:14:45,337 --> 01:14:50,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think the committee has sort of generally said that's, that's not what they want to do.

293
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:54,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And so therefore, like the creative budgeting happens, which is an exercise on paper.

294
01:14:56,106 --> 01:15:02,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is sort of it is a really terrible practice to have, I think the conundrum that we have always faced is

295
01:15:04,175 --> 01:15:11,519
[SPEAKER_03]: We each year we set out to do something better and differently and each year the budget numbers just do not reflect an ability to do that.

296
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:27,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that last year we received a whole series of memos about what our plan could be and then when we got our allocation from the city what our plan had to be, and they're, they were different plan they're completely different plans.

297
01:15:28,568 --> 01:15:37,833
[SPEAKER_03]: and so it included things like, you know, ESSER's sort of an easy one, but we were going to have $50,000 left in ESSER to roll into this summer and could fund some summer programming.

298
01:15:38,293 --> 01:15:52,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once we got, you know, sort of the allocation, we approved a budget, but then once we got the allocation from the city, it became clear that we could not sit on that money because that would mean cutting a staff member somewhere else in order to like leave that money in reserve.

299
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've just not been willing to do that.

300
01:15:56,371 --> 01:16:09,454
[SPEAKER_03]: having gone through all of that over the last, you know, four years, but certainly last year that there was a huge exercise in like, where can we find this money in order to not have to cut staff?

301
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:19,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what the city was able and willing to provide to the schools was not enough to do the basic things that we were feeling like we needed to do.

302
01:16:19,497 --> 01:16:25,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were some, there were some new things that we had to do or planned to, you know, and plan to do.

303
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:47,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I know that sort of complicates the picture each and every time, but I would like to see an actual budget that reflects what the budget should be so that even if we have to make those decisions and changes, like everyone can realize that our building maintenance budget should be half a million dollars and we budgeted 150.

304
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:47,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And so therefore,

305
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:54,525
[SPEAKER_03]: really should be no surprise when we come in at half a million dollars that we're over by $350,000.

306
01:16:55,185 --> 01:17:13,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that as you build the budget can really reflect like what does a district of our size need to account for in things like legal expenses and building maintenance and technology replacement and we just we have like never been able to get there for a whole variety of reasons but

307
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:15,980
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, I think, fairly unsustainable.

308
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I'll say is we, in the series of memos that helped us sort of craft the budget last year, there were lots of positions explicitly being tagged to non-operating fund accounts.

309
01:17:29,905 --> 01:17:38,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that work to sort of scrub and reconcile that all of that has charged out correctly will be a huge portion of this answer.

310
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:53,398
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of, because I went back and when I saw this on the agenda, I went back and read one of those and I was like, yeah, there's a whole bunch of stuff here that we said we would do elsewhere, like there's some vocational line items and all kinds of other things.

311
01:17:53,478 --> 01:18:00,200
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's really important work that has to be done before we really understand how big of a deficit are we really talking about.

312
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think I have one more question and then I'll let some of my colleagues speak, but

313
01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:14,366
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been comments from teachers in the community that they are being told that the schools will run out of paper.

314
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:22,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying to understand where that's coming from, and whether we have advised teachers that we're going to run out of paper.

315
01:18:23,736 --> 01:18:29,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to make a motion that we do not run out of paper in this school year, because it's just

316
01:18:29,744 --> 01:18:40,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it is, it is critical to operating and so I really want to get to the bottom of like where this information is coming from because it's being broadly distributed on social media.

317
01:18:42,352 --> 01:18:44,893
[SPEAKER_03]: believe I know the original poster.

318
01:18:44,913 --> 01:18:46,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a wonderful teacher.

319
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:47,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of my daughter's teachers.

320
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:49,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't believe he's making it up.

321
01:18:50,055 --> 01:19:03,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe he's hearing it from somewhere from some somebody and that maybe that somebody is very well intentioned but if we're gonna run out of paper, I wanna know about it before we run out of paper because we can't run out of paper.

322
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:04,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

323
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:11,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we first have the motion for a staffing plan and an explanation on the additional 130

324
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:16,681
[SPEAKER_05]: and overtime for operation and maintenance by Member Graham, seconded by?

325
01:19:17,441 --> 01:19:17,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

326
01:19:18,482 --> 01:19:20,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rheinfeld, all those in favor?

327
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:20,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

328
01:19:21,545 --> 01:19:22,226
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

329
01:19:22,266 --> 01:19:23,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

330
01:19:23,687 --> 01:19:28,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And motion by Member Graham to not run out of paper, seconded by Member Rousseau.

331
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:29,092
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

332
01:19:29,372 --> 01:19:29,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

333
01:19:30,113 --> 01:19:30,894
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

334
01:19:31,414 --> 01:19:31,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

335
01:19:32,075 --> 01:19:32,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

336
01:19:34,777 --> 01:19:35,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

337
01:19:39,258 --> 01:19:51,904
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may, we have not issued anything on paper, and I would say throughout this process, we have to prioritize the needs of the classroom first, and then everything else is after that.

338
01:19:52,944 --> 01:19:53,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

339
01:19:53,644 --> 01:19:56,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

340
01:19:56,506 --> 01:19:56,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

341
01:19:56,886 --> 01:20:00,647
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I'm looking at this, there's this spreadsheet you gave us.

342
01:20:03,246 --> 01:20:11,541
[SPEAKER_01]: All these numbers are of course are concerning, but there is a general up in addition to the running out of paper thing there's this.

343
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:16,423
[SPEAKER_01]: drumbeat that we don't have substitutes.

344
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:25,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow in FY23, we budgeted a quarter of a million dollars, but spent almost $900,000 on substitutes, which is hard to do if we don't have substitutes.

345
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:32,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know where that money is going, or if there's a perception that just because there was a day without a substitute, that there are no substitutes.

346
01:20:32,931 --> 01:20:42,756
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that generalizing can happen, but this number does not tell the story that the community and some teachers definitely are telling, that there's never any substitutes.

347
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,297
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you spend a million dollars

348
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:47,911
[SPEAKER_01]: on substitutes if there aren't any, or 900,000.

349
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:50,733
[SPEAKER_01]: But we appropriated, again, a totally inappropriate number.

350
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:59,638
[SPEAKER_01]: FY23 was not a, quote, pandemic year.

351
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:04,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, like the previous year where there was lots of people out for

352
01:21:05,322 --> 01:21:06,663
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because everybody was testing.

353
01:21:06,683 --> 01:21:13,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know the pandemic really is, you know, some people would say it's not over and I can't disagree with that.

354
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:25,058
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, to appropriate only even less in FY 24, and then to already be projected to spend twice the appropriation that I just

355
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:39,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confused about why we're even trying to appropriate, why are we putting numbers down in our budget book at all on a lot of these things they're just made up numbers to squeeze into a number we've been handed on a slip of paper from the city.

356
01:21:43,078 --> 01:21:52,422
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be fair, some of these numbers were in our budget book, before we got that appropriation, you know, the $5,000 I looked back in some of the older budgets, my very first budget, it said $2,000.

357
01:21:52,522 --> 01:21:55,884
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one that said $30,000.

358
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:59,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looked like somebody was like, hey, we probably should go up.

359
01:21:59,966 --> 01:22:02,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, I don't have actuals.

360
01:22:02,727 --> 01:22:05,468
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the actuals were.

361
01:22:06,068 --> 01:22:06,208
[SPEAKER_01]: But

362
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:21,208
[SPEAKER_01]: You know this substitute line though and there's another story in here because we're definitely spending a lot of money on substitutes and it's worth noting we pay less for substitutes than most other districts, so it's even more people and and substitute hours that are happening.

363
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:23,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first let me say that.

364
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:40,702
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not unusual for a school district to budget less than they would normally use for substitutes because some of those substitutes are gonna be used for teacher vacancies that occur during the year.

365
01:22:40,862 --> 01:22:48,150
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's likely gonna be surpluses in those salary accounts to kind of offset some of the substitute spending.

366
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:58,343
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have to have a substitute budget that's right size to, you know, what your actual need is.

367
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:00,566
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that

368
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:09,410
[SPEAKER_00]: principals will pull teachers in to cover classrooms.

369
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:16,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's classroom teachers, and then there's specialist teachers, music, art, phys ed.

370
01:23:18,472 --> 01:23:24,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Those teachers can be pulled in during their prep period to cover that class.

371
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:26,034
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's,

372
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:33,447
[SPEAKER_00]: driving a lot of the spending because it is true that we could use more substitutes.

373
01:23:34,589 --> 01:23:44,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do really have to address the salaries that we're paying, we're not competitive with surrounding districts.

374
01:23:46,584 --> 01:23:49,426
[SPEAKER_00]: in attracting substitutes.

375
01:23:50,287 --> 01:24:02,036
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking at a staffing, a substitute staffing firm that would recruit substitutes.

376
01:24:02,156 --> 01:24:11,604
[SPEAKER_00]: They would essentially pay them the rate that we tell them to pay, and then they get an upcharge for their profit and their overhead.

377
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:13,966
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to go out to bid.

378
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:19,491
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of one way we're trying to solve this problem.

379
01:24:21,051 --> 01:24:22,552
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what's driving the number.

380
01:24:22,992 --> 01:24:37,575
[SPEAKER_00]: We're filling the substitute slots internally, and that's more expensive than if we were able to hire a substitute off the street to cover that class.

381
01:24:37,981 --> 01:24:41,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, that's actually, I would never have guessed that that line meant that.

382
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:56,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any, you have plenty of work on your plate, but is there any way you can divide this line item in the future so that charges that when we're paying teachers for lost prep times, that that's a separate line item than substitutes we're hiring in?

383
01:24:56,948 --> 01:25:05,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Because certainly like, they seem like totally like, can we get enough substitutes, this line item,

384
01:25:07,096 --> 01:25:10,038
[SPEAKER_01]: tells a very different story than what it turns out to be accurate.

385
01:25:10,058 --> 01:25:25,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would really like to know that, especially when we go into the next teacher contract, like, you know, how much are we actually spending on last prep period, which right now I don't think we could easily tell, at least not from here, maybe in the budget.

386
01:25:25,191 --> 01:25:31,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we could put that into motion for FY 25 to kind of capture that data, but it is,

387
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:52,067
[SPEAKER_00]: there is difficult, there's three or four systems at play, the accounting system, there's the frontline system, the Harper's payroll system, and they don't easily talk to each other.

388
01:25:52,087 --> 01:25:53,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, thank you.

389
01:25:53,587 --> 01:25:59,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I think you touched on the security wages already, but

390
01:26:03,173 --> 01:26:20,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, is a lot of this expense related to things like the bathrooms and the, you haven't been here long enough for all of our multi-year debate, discussion, community conversation on the safety of our bathrooms and stuff like that.

391
01:26:20,931 --> 01:26:26,256
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're paying administrators or anybody else to monitor bathrooms,

392
01:26:27,153 --> 01:26:28,634
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming we're paying them, I think we are.

393
01:26:29,955 --> 01:26:36,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those getting put into security wages or is that literally just people who are in the security union?

394
01:26:36,798 --> 01:26:40,380
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I'm not sure.

395
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess they might be hitting that substitute line as well.

396
01:26:44,582 --> 01:26:47,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they'd be part of security wages, but

397
01:26:48,581 --> 01:26:55,025
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really driving the security wages in FY24 was the fact that we paid these retros.

398
01:26:56,206 --> 01:27:01,569
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 24, 23, and 22 are all hitting that account.

399
01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:07,673
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it on the administrators because they're not paid in one account.

400
01:27:08,133 --> 01:27:13,977
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of distributed throughout the programs, but you can see it with the building monitors.

401
01:27:13,997 --> 01:27:15,798
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all being charged to that one account.

402
01:27:16,226 --> 01:27:18,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, I know you said that earlier, I've already forgotten, sorry.

403
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:19,387
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

404
01:27:19,947 --> 01:27:24,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did have, what was my question?

405
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:28,730
[SPEAKER_01]: You already answered that already.

406
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:43,956
[SPEAKER_01]: In the building repairs, as Member Graham pointed out, we just keep budgeting for a number that doesn't make any sense, especially with an old building like the high school, but then it turns out all the other buildings as well.

407
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:58,105
[SPEAKER_01]: It does this include expenses when the city donate donates when the city covers capital expenses like you know rekeying doors or.

408
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:00,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are cameras.

409
01:28:00,566 --> 01:28:04,388
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a separate resource that we're able to access.

410
01:28:04,648 --> 01:28:09,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that's considered capital that the city is paying for directly, that's not even included in this number.

411
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:10,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

412
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:15,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have a sense for what is the big ticket thing?

413
01:28:15,294 --> 01:28:22,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I assume that, I don't know when this data came in, but like, is this covering the flooding we just had?

414
01:28:24,631 --> 01:28:29,574
[SPEAKER_00]: made an educated guess that we would, we're already in deficit in that account.

415
01:28:29,795 --> 01:28:34,838
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent a little over $300,000 in the first six months.

416
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:42,863
[SPEAKER_00]: I estimated that we would spend another $250,000 to get through the end of the year.

417
01:28:44,384 --> 01:28:53,150
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may get some support for the city for that if they have the ability, but it's just that,

418
01:28:54,997 --> 01:29:03,442
[SPEAKER_00]: that there has to be much better analysis of what needs to be budgeted for.

419
01:29:04,123 --> 01:29:07,545
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that are always gonna come up.

420
01:29:07,605 --> 01:29:10,627
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always bathrooms that have to be repaired.

421
01:29:10,647 --> 01:29:15,450
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always security cameras that have to be repaired.

422
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:16,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I would,

423
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:37,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that we could, we're kind of in a cycle where we wait until we get enough of a problem that we can go to the city and get a capital outlay, but we don't have an ability to kind of address these things in real time because we don't have enough money in our budget.

424
01:29:38,019 --> 01:29:44,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a fire alarm issue at the high school,

425
01:29:45,928 --> 01:29:48,909
[SPEAKER_00]: is five different fire alarm systems in that building.

426
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:56,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of tracking the nature of the problem was very difficult.

427
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:06,612
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a fire detail up at the high school to make sure that students and staff were safe.

428
01:30:09,072 --> 01:30:13,553
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the flood, you know, things happen, life happens.

429
01:30:15,717 --> 01:30:20,219
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just can't say, well, we're not gonna do that because we don't have enough money.

430
01:30:20,339 --> 01:30:27,042
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do it, but we have to make sure those budgets are right size so we can address problems as they come up.

431
01:30:28,042 --> 01:30:28,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

432
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:39,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanna say one other thing about when we get to the budget, if the committee decides that we want to use reality as a basis for our budget,

433
01:30:42,162 --> 01:30:57,311
[SPEAKER_01]: barring some gigantic unexpected increase in revenue, we'll be faced with the decision of, okay, we're going to put in $150,000 for legal, and we're going to lay off this number of people to do it.

434
01:30:58,011 --> 01:31:00,092
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a situation any of us wants.

435
01:31:00,713 --> 01:31:06,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I should also point out that just pretending reality isn't there, I don't know who it serves.

436
01:31:09,128 --> 01:31:12,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the position we have been in year after year.

437
01:31:13,713 --> 01:31:29,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not looking forward to the budget for this reason, but I think having those actuals right up against it, having reality on screen and in our books will at least allow us to say it out loud.

438
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:31,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're gonna probably spend

439
01:31:32,632 --> 01:31:37,516
[SPEAKER_01]: $500,000, we're going to budget 100,000 and just see what happens.

440
01:31:38,277 --> 01:31:38,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Very exciting.

441
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:42,461
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really depressing, frankly.

442
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:50,407
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to be my sixth budget, I don't count the first one, new members, like the budget just happens to them.

443
01:31:50,888 --> 01:31:58,014
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be really my sixth budget, where I participated, where every year the buildings and grounds budget is

444
01:31:58,949 --> 01:32:01,352
[SPEAKER_01]: 150,000, building repairs is $150,000.

445
01:32:02,313 --> 01:32:10,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Each year that I looked at, and I can say quite confidently, there has never been a year where it was anywhere close to that.

446
01:32:12,202 --> 01:32:22,612
[SPEAKER_01]: But short of an awful lot more money from the city, we're gonna have to choose to either be honest with the budget and lay off a whole lot of people.

447
01:32:23,951 --> 01:32:27,014
[SPEAKER_01]: or just zero things out and see what happens.

448
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:29,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's a crappy choice that we have.

449
01:32:29,756 --> 01:32:34,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that you're gonna at least allow us to see it in real time.

450
01:32:35,911 --> 01:32:45,940
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can all make our decision to put $5,000 in the legal fund so that we can save the staff that is directly with the students.

451
01:32:47,241 --> 01:32:49,803
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we're just gonna be here next year having the same conversation.

452
01:32:50,864 --> 01:32:54,828
[SPEAKER_01]: We should all look at each other and be like, we're gonna have this exact same conversation next year.

453
01:32:55,328 --> 01:32:59,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be the worst deja vu, but thank you very much.

454
01:33:02,314 --> 01:33:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

455
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:12,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to make a motion that we get an update sometime in March to let us know sort of all the work that you're doing.

456
01:33:13,547 --> 01:33:15,188
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it changing the projections?

457
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

458
01:33:21,233 --> 01:33:22,234
[SPEAKER_05]: The 18th, on or about the 18th meeting.

459
01:33:24,775 --> 01:33:26,156
[SPEAKER_05]: point of information member McLaughlin.

460
01:33:26,276 --> 01:33:31,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to double check too on the quarterly for the actual versus projected versus budgeted.

461
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:32,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion.

462
01:33:32,999 --> 01:33:42,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we, you know, should be getting a quarterly report, which would be around March, April, based on that motion that already exists.

463
01:33:42,865 --> 01:33:44,305
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't have the motion number.

464
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:52,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go back to the minutes or something, but so is that I will second in lieu of us checking that.

465
01:33:53,234 --> 01:34:05,779
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think we also need to check because we should have a motion in place that's quarterly, budgeted, actual, projected, deficit, as has been discussed previously.

466
01:34:05,999 --> 01:34:06,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

467
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:10,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

468
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:11,721
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

469
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:12,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

470
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:17,923
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed for a budget update, March 18th, no hearing and seeing none, motion passes.

471
01:34:20,865 --> 01:34:21,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm assuming

472
01:34:23,237 --> 01:34:27,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. McHugh, you're gonna keep digging, have more information for us on the 18th.

473
01:34:28,758 --> 01:34:29,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

474
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:35,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

475
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:36,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

476
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

477
01:34:44,082 --> 01:34:46,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Presentations of the public, there are

478
01:34:47,253 --> 01:35:01,105
[SPEAKER_05]: There aren't any nor continued or new business, we do have a resolution offered by member Russo member all a party, 2024 dash nine the result the name of the school building committee be named the Medford comprehensive high school building committee.

479
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:08,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Further, the superintendent will secure the domain, mhs project.org and set up a website dedicated

480
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:15,763
[SPEAKER_05]: to this project, and further, the chairperson of said committee will be vice chair of the Medford School Committee, member Jenny Graham.

481
01:35:16,364 --> 01:35:17,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau or member Olopade?

482
01:35:18,105 --> 01:35:19,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to speak?

483
01:35:20,186 --> 01:35:20,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start.

484
01:35:21,147 --> 01:35:23,548
[SPEAKER_01]: One second, let me just get the language back up.

485
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:28,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our last meeting, we were

486
01:35:29,804 --> 01:35:32,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had motions and we all seem to really want to have an FAQ.

487
01:35:32,885 --> 01:35:35,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think an FAQ is certainly critical.

488
01:35:35,367 --> 01:35:36,807
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to hang off of something.

489
01:35:36,827 --> 01:35:43,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked around at project websites that existed for surrounding communities.

490
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:51,634
[SPEAKER_01]: They were frankly, nobody was very creative in their school building project website URL.

491
01:35:52,315 --> 01:35:59,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just copied, I think, I don't know if it was Arlington or Somerville,

492
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:05,166
[SPEAKER_01]: just use MHSproject.org, it could be anything, as long as it's not too long.

493
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:11,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did look to make sure it was available, at least until this got published, and hopefully nobody went and snagged it.

494
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:14,339
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, having that

495
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:28,287
[SPEAKER_01]: having us have the actual URL gives us a starting point for folks to actually put up an FAQ system, which I highly recommend we just look at the FAQs for other districts because mostly they're just going to be the same questions.

496
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:31,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing was to actually name the committee.

497
01:36:32,189 --> 01:36:36,351
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we have a policy on advisory committees, but this is not an advisory committee, which

498
01:36:37,811 --> 01:36:39,552
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, well, what is it?

499
01:36:39,812 --> 01:36:49,134
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a special kind of committee that's part of the law that authorizes the MSBA building stuff.

500
01:36:50,234 --> 01:36:54,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'm not following the advisory committee policy we have, because it's not an advisory committee.

501
01:36:56,636 --> 01:36:59,397
[SPEAKER_01]: An advisory committee doesn't actually make decisions.

502
01:36:59,457 --> 01:37:03,658
[SPEAKER_01]: They make decisions, well, they make decisions, but then they come to us and then we make the decision.

503
01:37:04,178 --> 01:37:08,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a building committee makes actual decisions that are the decision.

504
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's probably the biggest difference.

505
01:37:13,021 --> 01:37:22,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I did choose, I just, again, I'm open to changes to these things, but the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee, it's a little long.

506
01:37:23,065 --> 01:37:24,005
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always gonna be long.

507
01:37:25,826 --> 01:37:32,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final part was to name Vice Chair Graham as the chair of the committee.

508
01:37:32,272 --> 01:37:36,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked around, the school committee member is usually the chair of the building committee.

509
01:37:37,456 --> 01:37:46,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, you know, in our renaming committee, we didn't have a school committee member as, was there a member at all on there?

510
01:37:46,364 --> 01:37:46,444
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

511
01:37:46,844 --> 01:37:47,585
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, and

512
01:37:48,430 --> 01:38:02,038
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, nothing to, not to speak badly of anybody on that committee, but having somebody who is like regularly using Roberts rules, understands open meeting law is like not optional.

513
01:38:02,478 --> 01:38:09,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did build that into the advisory committee policy, which we bid, we drafted a couple of years ago.

514
01:38:09,943 --> 01:38:16,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's very important to have a current school committee member who can, from day one, know how to run the meetings, know about open meeting law,

515
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:22,641
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why, and obviously somebody who's willing to serve as the chair is kind of an important piece.

516
01:38:23,602 --> 01:38:26,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do not wish to be the chair.

517
01:38:28,406 --> 01:38:33,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I asked Member Graham if she would like to be chair and she is able and willing.

518
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:35,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I've made this motion.

519
01:38:36,594 --> 01:38:37,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Russo.

520
01:38:40,137 --> 01:38:41,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you both for your resolution.

521
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:43,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion on the floor then?

522
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:48,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Olopade.

523
01:38:48,691 --> 01:38:49,572
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

524
01:38:50,733 --> 01:38:51,573
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?
