begun. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6216.3s">Medford</a>  kicked off its celebrations with a wonderful Pride flag raising festival at City Hall on this past Friday, which I was pleased to

 also want to just let the audience know that this Saturday, students from Medford High School, GSA, will join the wider Greater Boston LGBTQIA plus community in the Boston Pride Parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6258.145s">So</a>  we wish them clear skies, lots of fun, and don't forget to wear sunblock. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6264.067s">Medford</a>  Public Schools embraces our LGBTQ <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6268.715s">IA</a>  plus community members this month, students, staff, family members, and all those who call Medford home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6277.113s">The</a>  diversity of our community is an incredible strength, with each individual contributing their unique talents and perspectives to the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6286.28s">We</a>  also firmly believe in and defend the civil and human rights of LGBTQIA plus Mustangs and all people, particularly at a time when those rights are often under attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6299.551s">We</a>  all deserve the same chance to thrive and live freely and authentically. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6304.475s">Happy</a>  Pride Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6306.869s">I</a>  also want to share that last week, we had a wonderful Special Olympics that took place in Malden for our students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6318.12s">It</a>  was a wonderful event students from other communities participated in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6323.084s">And</a>  I just want to thank our special educators, Miss Bowen and all the members of her team, Miss Lauren Perillo, Denise DeJardins, and many other staff, Miss Principal Michelle Kroll, who was able to attend that event last week in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6339.132s">It</a>  was excellent, and it was wonderful weather as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6343.434s">I</a>  also would like to say that last week we had a wonderful event, the Junior Olympics for our fifth grade students that are moving on to middle school next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6355.401s">And</a>  we had some pretty bad weather last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6359.704s">So</a>  at the last minute, Tufts University was willing to let us use their Gancher Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6366.528s">And</a>  we're very grateful to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6368.149s">We</a>  want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6369.89s">Rachel</a>  Perry and all the athletic, the phys ed teachers that participated and the fifth grade staff, all the principals were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6379.295s">We</a>  also want to thank the PTOs, Dr. Cushing for helping to coordinate that event as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6387.44s">So</a>  those were two wonderful year end events for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6392.502s">At</a>  tonight's meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6395.183s">I'm</a>  looking forward to recognizing some of our district fine art students for their notable photography accomplishments and recognizing Medford

    <p>[Nkera]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7350.812s">Hi,</a>  thank you for having me here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7352.313s">I</a>  think we have a slideshow queued up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7355.435s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7356.435s">So</a>  I had the privilege of doing this program during the summer at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7361.838s">And</a>  one of our projects was to do something that we're passionate about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7364.72s">So</a>  I did a research project about how we can increase representation and access to AP courses at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7373.854s">Yeah,</a>  so just for some statistics and school segregation accounts for about 40% of segregation at schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7381.886s">And</a>  sadly, this is when you can kind of tell the level of course at the school itself by the makeup of the students in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7389.321s">And</a>  one way that we can combat that is looking at policy changes that we can make to increase access to these courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7396.085s">And</a>  this also applies to not only minority students, but also low income students or students from single parent households who don't have access to tutoring or guidance that could help them succeed in these courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7412.085s">So</a>  some possible causes for this are a lack of diversity in the teacher workforce itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7419.132s">And</a>  this is really detrimental to the students themselves because studies actually show that students do better when they're represented within the teachers that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7429.301s">And</a>  then also teacher expectations could be a root cause just because of implicit biases as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7438.01s">So</a>  just for some examples of policy that could lead to this, well, the first one I have is tracking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7443.631s">So</a>  I think Medford High School actually got rid of this this year, but before we had this policy where you had to take a math test in sixth grade and that kind of depended where you went or what math classes you took in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7457.794s">So</a>  this limited access to calculus, for example, for a lot of students who maybe didn't have access to tutoring to do well on these tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7465.736s">And</a>  this is not only, this is not necessarily to say that we shouldn't use tracking in schools, but just that we should also supplement tracking with, for example, more guidance for students who need them, who are either minority students or low-income students, and looking at how we can make these programs accessible for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7489.867s">And</a>  then just some community organizations that are working on this issue are, for example, the NAACP. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7496.07s">So</a>  they have science fairs that encourage achievement in STEM and other academic subjects. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7503.973s">And</a>  these are some things that we can incorporate at Medford High School and other communities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7511.696s">And</a>  thank you for listening to my presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7513.857s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7599.499s">We</a>  have number five, our McGlynn playground update presented by Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7622.585s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7624.526s">Thank</a>  you very much for this opportunity to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7627.507s">I'll</a>  just preface this as we head into this slideshow and presentation by saying they say a picture is worth a thousand words. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7634.591s">I'll</a>  say in this instance, the pictures don't do the project justice by any stretch of the imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7642.075s">And</a>  I know that several of you have been out to the site <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7644.996s">We</a>  also have a tour for members of the city council, members of the school committee this Thursday at one o'clock as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7653.938s">And</a>  so we look forward to sharing with you the live in-person progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7659.899s">I</a>  also have online my co-chair of the design committee, Shanine Peliquin, who has been really invaluable as a part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7670.68s">So</a>  I will start to move through the slideshow right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7674.923s">All</a>  right, so here is the overall conceptual design of the construction as was proposed to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7682.649s">I</a>  want you to hold this in your mind as we go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7687.313s">You</a>  can see here one of the areas that was really prone to flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7692.057s">This</a>  is now where we have built an elevated deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7695.92s">Playground</a>  structures last for about 20 to 25 years in the most ideal conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7700.343s">This</a>  was installed in 2001, so we got about 22 years out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7704.028s">It</a>  used to be part of the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7707.131s">It's</a>  a really wet ground that is overly saturated, and the playground was flooded for much of the year in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7714.54s">I</a>  would wager you could have ice skated on a significant portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7720.719s">So</a>  why the flooding? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7721.74s">Well,</a>  because it was a river and the drainage was not well maintained, well cared for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7726.624s">I</a>  want to thank the DPW for in the last year and a half, they went in, they really excavated, put in some temporary drains, and they did a really great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7734.771s">And</a>  the land itself is just wet a lot of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7738.694s">So</a>  what's going on behind the fence? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7740.555s">Thank</a>  you all for being at the groundbreaking back in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7742.897s">I</a>  should say the snow breaking at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7746.58s">But</a>  we, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7749.366s">We've</a>  been working really hard over the winter to really demolish the old playground, build in drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7755.767s">The</a>  drainage is really amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7758.088s">It's</a>  oversized, or I'd say properly sized, which means it's rather large to handle the amount of water that we're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7765.71s">We've</a>  put in rain gardens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7767.65s">We've</a>  done electricity out to the playground, so we're not running extension cords. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7772.691s">We've</a>  done data ports out to the playground, so that we'll have that available <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7776.584s">The</a>  rocks and the boulders that you'll see throughout the site have actually been brought in from Carr Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7782.367s">and</a>  that work that's been done there, it's a really cool, it adds a really cool feel to the playground, just the boulders themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7789.952s">We've</a>  been finalizing play structure, design, colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7793.395s">We've</a>  been having weekly meetings with our design team and construction team. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7798.819s">We've</a>  been ironing out some of our differences and some of our, you know, questions that arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7807.344s">And</a>  so I put this image up there again, just so that you can get a sense of the massive scale that this project was. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7815.746s">It</a>  started with resurfacing the playground and the CPC and others were like, how about we time out on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7823.948s">Because</a>  that was going to be in of itself well over half a million dollars to just rip up and replace the soft surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7832.429s">And</a>  so what they did was they funded a design study that was put on hold, I'm going to be honest, for probably about 18 months while COVID took precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7842.092s">And</a>  why I want you to really get a vision for this picture, this aerial, is for how we took a lot of underutilized space, and with Shanine and others' input, really moved forward with maximizing our space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7856.517s">So</a>  here you can see the pavilion in phase one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7861.19s">All</a>  that gray, dark tar will be covered with poured in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7866.133s">The</a>  turf field was recently installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7868.415s">The</a>  pavilion now has its roof on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7871.377s">We</a>  hope to have outdoor movies, concerts, things along those lines where families and school personnel can enjoy the turf field. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7882.455s">We've</a>  done 66 new native trees, countless bushes, shrubs, and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7887.857s">The</a>  landscaping looks absolutely beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7891.159s">And</a>  the tree area, students repeatedly said that if anything happens to this tree, we'll just die, or we won't be able to really enjoy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7900.143s">I</a>  forget, Shanine can add. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7902.078s">She's</a>  a co-host, so she can chime in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7903.719s">I</a>  forget their exact statement, but basically they would have been despondent if we had done anything to that tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7910.282s">So</a>  we've been extraordinarily careful with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7913.804s">There's</a>  a gradual pathway around the tree that will be covered in a semi-permeable pavement called Flexi-Pave. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7921.188s">And</a>  in the lower corner, you can see the deck that will serve as another outdoor classroom type space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7928.251s">We've</a>  put in multiple picnic tables that are accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7933.355s">And</a>  so moving through the pictures, here's our outdoor classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7937.598s">The</a>  logs are set so that there's multiple spaces for accessible seating, wheelchair seating, and all of the gravel in this area will be covered with the flexi-pave permeable paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7952.859s">And</a>  accessible garden beds allow for a wheelchair to go underneath and multiple heights for students of various heights and sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7962.886s">Coming</a>  up next, fencing will be installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7964.968s">We're</a>  expecting pavement to go in this week, the asphalt pavement that needs 28 days to cure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7970.96s">We'll</a>  start digging and playground equipment areas and creating landforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7975.081s">We</a>  have some hills to create throughout the remaining area and lots more to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7982.283s">So</a>  if you have any questions, feel free to email Shanine or Amanda Santrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7987.364s">They're</a>  really taking point and answering questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7989.724s">I'm</a>  always happy to answer any questions, but look forward to seeing anyone who hasn't been able to make it to the site this coming <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7997.585s">Thursday</a>  at one o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7999.265s">We're</a>  hoping that it is not a monsoon as it has been the last two Thursdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8005.407s">So</a>  if you have any questions, feel free, or Shanine, do you want to chime in?</p>

    <p>[Peloquin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8012.648s">I</a>  think you covered it pretty well.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8021.01s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8022.875s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8024.175s">I</a>  actually have had a chance to tour the playground, and it's super exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8029.176s">I</a>  was involved in the CPC applications that started this, actually, that happened before I was on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8037.818s">And</a>  it started out as a collaboration between the PTOs at the three schools that got resurfacing at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8046.02s">So</a>  it was the Missittuc, the Brooks, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8048.824s">and</a>  the McLean and the folks at the McLean. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8054.082s">were</a>  very committed to making sure that what they did for that school served the school for the long haul and not in the just the immediate, like, I want the same as everybody else kind of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8067.191s">So</a>  I want to just say thank you to them for their patience, because this has been a long process, much to all of our, you know, chagrin, like we all could have done without COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8078.339s">But</a>  here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8080.802s">And</a>  the project is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8082.483s">And</a>  we're still accepting donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8084.684s">And</a>  maybe we can put another reminder in the weekly in the weekly update from the superintendent that that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8093.789s">So</a>  we are still looking for community donations to support, you know, making sure that we can really sort of dress this proper place out the way that it deserves to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8105.682s">There's</a>  so many trees going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8108.063s">It's</a>  going to be the envy of every elementary school and the question is going to be which one is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8113.344s">So</a>  I'm hopeful that we'll be able to find some money for those conversations quickly because this playground is far above anything that Medford Public Schools has ever been able to see or deliver to students before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8129.287s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8131.325s">The</a>  thing that I do want to say publicly, I've said it to everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8134.647s">I</a>  really feel that it's a smaller project, but this should serve as inspiration for everybody for the Medford High School project as to what good design, good construction oversight, and good process of getting community involvement really can do.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8153.281s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8153.621s">And</a>  just from the chair, I want to thank you, Dr. Cushing, as well as the committee that worked on this for <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8159.332s">quite</a>  some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8160.133s">I</a>  know member Graham's one of those people, former member McLaughlin and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8165.696s">Pellequin</a>  and a number of other people that just put their time and soul into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8172.801s">So</a>  happy to see it come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8174.982s">It</a>  was pretty exciting to tour it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8177.764s">Like</a>  member Graham said, to see a park that's this inclusive and it's gonna be utilized by the entire community, not just those three schools is something to be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8189.889s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8194.271s">Member</a>  Rousseau, then we have Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8196.592s">Pelquin.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8197.752s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8199.873s">I</a>  brought my kids to the old playground when they were little and even did skate, not on skates, but it was definitely skating material. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8207.756s">And</a>  it's really, I did get to tour it and it is, while it is, when I toured it, it's far from done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8215.539s">It</a>  is shocking that it's the same, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8219.48s">footprint</a>  really that's sort of the thing that's hard to really wrap your head around is that the old one felt frankly small and this just feels so big it's like a like a TARDIS or something from Doctor Who it's like how on earth did you get all this in here doesn't feel crowded it's really amazing and I cannot say <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8243.277s">enough</a>  good things about it, and I'm super excited for the stuff that's yet to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8247.526s">I</a>  know that there's a lot of stuff that looks <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8254.198s">tar</a>  color, but that's going to be colorful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8256.7s">And</a>  I can't remember, I think it was Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8261.023s">Pelequin</a>  who explained the way the color differentials will help those with low vision and just the thoughtfulness around things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8271.231s">Because</a>  when you first glance at it, you're like, there's all these opportunities for kids to fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8274.673s">But</a>  of course, we want kids to have the opportunity to fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8278.916s">The</a>  old playgrounds make them so safe that they are, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8283.547s">can't</a>  possibly skin a knee, but also they're boring is thankfully becoming a thing of the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8290.693s">Cause</a>  like I drive through Belmont every day and they have a beautiful playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8297.218s">It</a>  looks like architecturally like gorgeous, but it's all brown and it is all that style of nobody can get hurt in our playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8308.086s">And</a>  I'm sure it costs probably more than our playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8311.228s">But</a>  I'm glad we're not going there and that it's going to be a place the kids can't get enough of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8316.529s">And</a>  my kids are way too old to enjoy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8318.95s">So</a>  I'll just go by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8320.151s">But</a>  thank you so much for all the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8321.971s">And</a>  it's really an enormous number of people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8326.513s">And</a>  I want to thank the mayor and and the residents for funding it through the CPC because <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8333.706s">It</a>  wasn't the cheapest thing we could have done is an understatement, but I think our kids are really going to benefit from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8341.211s">And</a>  not just the kids at the McGlynn, like my kids didn't go to the McGlynn, but we went there anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8347.355s">So</a>  I think that the kids of the entire city are gonna drive there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8350.857s">There's</a>  parking, especially on a weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8352.738s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8355.42s">Thank</a>  you member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8356.381s">I</a>  think we used a number of funding sources, ARPA, CDBG, CPA, and one or two other as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8363.268s">It</a>  takes a village, including when you have to finance something. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8366.63s">I'm</a>  miss Pelican.</p>

    <p>[Peloquin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8368.571s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8368.831s">Yeah,</a>  the other funding source was a federal earmark from representative Barbara through the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8375.336s">I</a>  just wanted to say for those of you who are able to visit or who are already visited, you'll hear me say this as well, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8381.471s">I</a>  think one of the things to know is that this is the precedent setter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8385.354s">It's</a>  not that the other schools aren't going to get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8387.556s">It's</a>  that this is the way we're doing things from now on, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8390.178s">We</a>  want to make sure we have robust community input processes and really hear from the kids first. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8395.082s">I'm</a>  really proud of the way that this community has listened to the kids and then the staff on how to make it really workable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8405.531s">And</a>  then the other thing to know, for those of you who haven't heard us present before, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8410.051s">that</a>  we did also use CPC funding to do assessments of the other MPS playgrounds because there are six total that are owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8419.334s">And</a>  we were able to get new equipment for the Roberts and Brooks that had broken equipment and a new, just a new panel for the Missitook as well to make things safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8431.877s">So</a>  those playgrounds have been inspected and are now safe and they will last longer while we figure out the funding pieces for how to, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8440.171s">improve</a>  those schoolyards when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8442.232s">But</a>  those playgrounds are, they're up to the standard of care with the new surfacing and replacement equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8450.578s">So</a>  those schools did get pieces of equipment and we anticipate these kinds of processes of really deciding what works for each school in the future.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8462.346s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8465.368s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8465.808s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8467.859s">We</a>  have an update also by Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent, Student Opportunity Act.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8473.342s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8476.103s">This</a>  was a report that we originally hoped to get a vote for you on April. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8481.673s">sorry,</a>  on April 29th, but due to budgets and other presentations and stuff, the proverbial can was kicked. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8492.101s">So</a>  I'm presenting here tonight on our Student Opportunity Act submission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8499.875s">We</a>  receive student opportunity act was first conceived to really rectify funding disparities for districts across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8510.487s">Who</a>  you know typically urban. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8514.011s">Typically</a>  underserved receive significant funding this Medford as part of our. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8520.458s">our</a>  chapter 70 money, so this is all now rolled into our chapter 70 money, receives approximately an additional $135,000 based on the governor's allotment this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8531.645s">We</a>  may be receiving more based on the House and the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8536.768s">That's</a>  a may. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8538.268s">We</a>  anticipate that we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8539.849s">However,</a>  these are numbers that we've already really accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8543.492s">This</a>  is not <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8544.887s">in</a>  addition to we're not getting an additional check or anything along those lines, but then there are certain requirements that we have to do as part of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8554.553s">So</a>  this is our report. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8557.535s">So</a>  three key priorities, continued development of a robust early literacy program for grades K to five in all four of our elementary schools, a commitment to early literacy screening, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8571.224s">in</a>  grades K through 3 with continued monitoring throughout middle school and refined the Medford High School Saturday Acceleration Academy program that began in January 2024 to provide targeted support to identified high school students and rising ninth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8588.94s">So</a>  identified eighth graders that are rising to ninth grade as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8594.445s">So</a>  the investments that we're planning and again <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8598.021s">only</a>  $135,000 a year approximately. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8598.762s">But</a>  these investments will come out to about $720,000 over the next three years, $165,000 for early literacy screening and support, $435,000 for comprehensive support for early literacy programming, and really intense <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8620.436s">in-kind</a>  professional development, $120,000 for Saturday Acceleration Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8627.243s">And</a>  so this is directly taken from our application that I provided to you, that the district is committed to these initiatives despite significant financial challenges on the horizon that nominal support from the Student Opportunity Act will ameliorate to a certain degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8643.82s">Basically,</a>  we are picking up the lion's share with local money to really support this because the Student Opportunity Act doesn't really deliver a whole lot to the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8656.463s">So</a>  one thing though that under the new Student Opportunity Act pieces that they've put in the last year, year and a half, is to really try to figure out how we're gonna measure family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8667.711s">This</a>  is something that we and most districts are struggling with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8671.014s">We</a>  are trying to really engage families. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8674.396s">Recently,</a>  we had about 60 families, 60 individuals sign up for an event that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8679.06s">Shulman</a>  put on, we had 16 actually show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8683.143s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8684.324s">just</a>  some of the challenges that we face, but we're going to review metrics from our mass communication system. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8689.648s">We're</a>  going to deploy surveys as needed to families. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8692.69s">Uh,</a>  we're going to monitor school site count, and that'll be a panorama survey that we're working on with the high school and hopefully get down to the other schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8700.156s">We'll</a>  monitor school site council compositions to include family representatives of our targeted groups, um, review data from talking points, uh, explore and deploy further rounds, future round tables, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8712.985s">for</a>  families and caregiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8714.186s">We've</a>  had some success with those at the height of the pandemic, less success with those as we came out of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8721.129s">So</a>  the school leadership respectfully requests a vote of the Medford School Committee to approve the plan that you have in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8728.873s">I</a>  gave you the brief right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8730.934s">And</a>  for me to also amend the date to June 3rd, 2024, as opposed to the April 29th in your packet.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8739.637s">Motion</a>  to approve the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8741.538s">Motion</a>  to approve the plan by Member Graham, seconded by?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8744.599s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8746.3s">Member</a>  Olopade, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8747.841s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8749.241s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8749.961s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8751.482s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8752.442s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8754.083s">We</a>  have no presentations of the <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8756.988s">public,</a>  but we do have continued business. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8759.109s">We</a>  have MSBA slash MCH SBA update table from May 20th, 2024 presented by Member Graham, School Building Committee meeting, May 13th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8769.297s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8769.697s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8772.919s">Just</a>  a few brief updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8775.88s">There</a>  are five deliverables in the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8778.48s">Two</a>  of the five have been submitted to MSBA already. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8782.861s">The</a>  remaining three are on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8786.402s">I</a>  am anticipating that in our meeting tomorrow night the chapter 74 eligibility form will be finalized and approved by the committee and they will do a first draft review of our <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8798.445s">our</a>  educational profile where we will look at that before June is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8802.889s">So</a>  we are sort of pushing hard to make sure that we are getting all of our deliverables in just as quickly as we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8811.235s">I'm</a>  working with the mayor and the president of the council to make sure that the right votes get taken to fund the feasibility study, which will rely on free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8821.103s">So</a>  all of that also just to happen here in the month of June in some capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8827.628s">In</a>  terms of some of the work the committee has been doing, we have established two subcommittees so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8834.894s">One</a>  is about communications and community engagement, actually three subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8839.277s">Communications</a>  and community engagement has built a plan that includes some surveying that we'll do in the short term to ask the community sort of what their questions are so that the website can attempt to answer some of those questions proactively. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8854.982s">We</a>  also have talked about a strategy of how to start to include the community in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8861.106s">It's</a>  a little bit of a boring conversation right now because it's a lot of paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8865.648s">But</a>  once we sort of move into the next phases, we're actually talking about things like feasibility study and envisioning what a new building could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8873.552s">That'll</a>  be a sort of a completely different scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8877.294s">So</a>  we have a plan that includes things like being at tables at community events and having a pitch deck for lack of a better term that we can use to go talk to all the boards and commissions who might be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8890.041s">So</a>  we have some like upfront planning and survey work happening really over the course of the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8895.504s">And</a>  then, you know, sort of really just using this time to set the stage for good proactive communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8903.735s">We</a>  also had a rules and onboarding subcommittee meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8906.697s">We</a>  have established and passed our operating rules, which are very similar to what they are here in terms of using Robert's Rules of Order and trying to take a more, actually a less formal tone than we do even here, but outlining the same rules of public participation that we use here so that we can make sure that our meetings can remain productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8930.591s">And,</a>  you know, overall, have established a path for what happens when we need to onboard new people so we have sort of plans in place for all of that so that somebody coming on board can get up to speed quickly if that becomes necessary which over the life of us five to seven year project it's inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8951.618s">The</a>  website, the dedicated website is just about complete in its draft form and it will include bios of all the folks that are on the committee, it will include all of our minutes and all of our agendas and all the documents that we have talked about so far, submitted documents, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8972.733s">And</a>  then just other helpful links, FAQs, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8975.195s">So</a>  all of that is about done and ready to be launched. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8978.9s">But</a>  our anticipation is that there won't be a lot of traction for that until we get into the feasibility study phase, which is just a little ways down the road for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8991.63s">Again,</a>  we have to be done by January 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8993.652s">We're</a>  on track to be done far sooner than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8999.577s">And</a>  the sooner that we're done, the sooner we can get in the queue to go to the board meeting, which happens every other month. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9006.402s">And</a>  then the sooner that we can move on to those next phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9011.104s">We</a>  also had a finance subcommittee meeting, where we talked with Alicia hunt who's our director of planning and sustain a development and sustainability is that right okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9024.738s">And</a>  she was immensely helpful there's been a lot of questions around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9029.705s">the</a>  site of the new high school and whether there are other possibilities besides where Medford High is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9036.669s">And</a>  she went through, she pulled up a map and went through what those options might be in terms of sort of things that she would be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9047.315s">We</a>  don't need that information just yet, but at some point we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9050.437s">So,</a>  you know, for example, like people have asked about Playstead Park as a potential site. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9057.061s">I</a>  think that has been noted before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9059.341s">She</a>  actually said that's sort of not on her hit parade of places to look, namely because we would be burying the high school further into a corner of the city that is the wealthiest corner of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9074.832s">So</a>  we'd be sort of advantaging students already who generally have lots of advantage in terms of getting to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9081.737s">And</a>  then, you know, there's sort of a whole bunch of transportation concerns with that location as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9087.739s">HAB-Charlotte</a>  Pitts, Moderator): She did cite Tufts Park is maybe someplace to think about because even though it is also sort of in a corner of the city, which is its own HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): Challenge from a transportation perspective, her thought was like it is in a corner of the city that <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9102.349s">would</a>  actually advantage students who are historically disadvantaged in terms of their ability to get back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9109.534s">She</a>  also said that, you know, her planner heart says she would love to see Medford High back in the middle of the city, just like it used to be one day long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9117.999s">And</a>  so that's sort of also a conversation we talked about, like the complex over at Hormel, and sort of ruled that out for the most part, because it would be too congested with <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9130.208s">elementary,</a>  middle, and high school all sort of having to convene in the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9134.491s">So</a>  we had a really, really good discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9136.713s">We</a>  also talked with Fiona Maxwell, who's our purchasing official for the city, and she's certified and meets requirements by MSBA, and she is starting to work on collecting <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9149.543s">model</a>  documents for bringing on our owners project manager, which will be our next our next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9156.047s">And</a>  we talked about, again, an aggressive goal that on the day where they approve us to go into the owners project manager selection phase that our fee goes out the door that same day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9164.993s">And</a>  so that's going to take some advanced work and planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9168.335s">And</a>  so she is starting to talk to the local communities around us who have done this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9173.138s">to</a>  start to pull some of those things together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9174.839s">So</a>  everybody's like really eager to get past this phase, which is exciting and has been helpful and collaborative all throughout the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9188.403s">So</a>  it is a big committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9189.683s">Everything</a>  is going great so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9191.464s">We've</a>  had great attendance and great participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9193.624s">And</a>  there's just like a lot of sort of legwork to do between now and say the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9199.666s">So</a>  we'll continue to sort of work through that <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9201.887s">We</a>  have a meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9203.929s">Our</a>  meetings are in the bistro so people are welcome to join us in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9207.592s">They</a>  are on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9208.793s">We've</a>  not seen a lot of traction yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9211.635s">It</a>  is June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9214.497s">There</a>  are a few million things happening at the same time so I'm not surprised but <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9218.974s">I</a>  also think the time for that participation is going to be once we get into the feasibility study where we're hiring a designer who's actually engaging with us to say, tell us, tell us what you want this place to look like and what you want it to be and what you want to be able to do in the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9234.212s">much</a>  like what we talked about with McGlynn, like how do you really thoughtfully design like every last nook and cranny of a building so it both serves a need and provides some flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9243.398s">So</a>  all of that's like sort of down the line and that's where really we'll be talking to, you know, to teachers, to staff, to students, to the community and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9254.144s">So</a>  all that's very much to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9256.526s">So</a>  that's just a quick update of what we're doing, but we do have a pretty robust communication plan <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9263.806s">getting</a>  underway, and everyone's excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9268.809s">I'm</a>  happy to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9771.252s">Motion</a>  to waive the definitions reading.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9778.115s">Motion</a>  to waive the definitions by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9783.697s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9784.877s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9785.438s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9785.838s">Definition</a>  section is waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9787.578s">Budget</a>  requests, capital improvement plan, capital improvement projects, capital budget, final budget, municipal allocation, med school spending, projected municipal allocation, and proposed reconciled budget were the definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9801.683s">Thank</a>  you, Member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9803.797s">HAB-Masyn</a>  Moyer): From the chair, if I may, I just want to see if the superintendent can comment on whether or not the central administration yourself and CFO especially have reviewed this and have been able to HAB-Masyn Moyer): Implement comment on it, as I know it's pretty lengthy and I want to make sure that this is feasible.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9825.097s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9828.39s">Member</a>  Rizzo.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9828.75s">Can</a>  I just speak on it real quick first? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9830.993s">So,</a>  most of this is actually stuff we already do, especially the budget preparation stuff and the planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9839.642s">And,</a>  you know, those are sections that are for the administration, so obviously any changes, additions, subtractions that they would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9849.355s">I</a>  obviously I think we would be happy to consider those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9854.258s">The</a>  dates are were difficult, because the city council passed the budget ordinance that says on March 1, that the mayor's office will tell the school district, or I don't know if it tells city council or the school district, what the. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9871.547s">potential</a>  allocation will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9874.55s">So</a>  we had to really, the dates on this really had to be planned around that date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9881.176s">I</a>  mean, to pretend we don't get a number when we get a number doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9886.5s">So</a>  that's why a lot of this stuff is sort of backed up and that March 1 date is so important in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9893.687s">And</a>  then, you know, one of the things in this current budget cycle that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9899.537s">I</a>  don't know if everybody agrees, but I certainly think many people in the community would want to know is like when we had our presentation of the budget last <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9910.427s">time</a>  or the time before, and we we cut 2.2 million and still had 2.7 million left to figure out how to cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9918.671s">And</a>  I understand why we did that, because, like, it was probably very hard to even wrap our heads around where we would make those cuts, but it's June, and if we still had to make those cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9932.717s">that's</a>  not a lot of time for the community to respond, for us to respond, for staff to be like, all right, we've just decided we're laying off another 50 people, they got families and mortgages. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9944.139s">And</a>  so I felt it was really important that when we get an allocation, a projected allocation, that we take it completely seriously, and that we have a document that says, if that's our number, here is how we'll get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9959.79s">We</a>  still don't have that now and I understand why and I, I actually support that, because this gap was so phenomenally large, but in a normal year even if there's a gap, we need to be able to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9973.598s">This</a>  is how we're going to do it now we aren't going to put names and say these people are getting laid off all the way back in February that would or March that would make no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9982.265s">But,</a>  you know, how are we going to get from what we need to what we think we may get the public should know that we should know that, and not a few weeks before schools out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9995.296s">So</a>  that was sort of my. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9997.819s">my</a>  point in all that and then also telling the city council I mean the city council has traditionally received our budget book that we get. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10006.065s">And</a>  that's, that's the, that's the recommended budget from the school committee that's not what will actually happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10015.612s">And</a>  I think that if we have the budget request, which is that this is what we would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10022.463s">If</a>  we only get that projected allocation, this is what it will look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10027.047s">And</a>  a letter that says, here's how we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10030.55s">And</a>  no we don't like it, but I think that they need that for their deliberations because I know the superintendent was in the hot seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10038.017s">And,</a>  you know, it's too big of a. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10042.779s">The</a>  budget is too big to just drill you for an hour or two even, and think that that's enough, that's that's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10052.131s">It's</a>  just too much for the city council to actually take all that in, and to get to all their questions really. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10062.418s">There</a>  is this other thing in here of having the budget hearing, possibly up to three times, and that is to say, if we are really going to have to make cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10075.831s">that</a>  are bigger than I just picked 1% because I looked at the math and thought that's, that's still a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10082.119s">If</a>  we have to cut 1% or more than the public should be able to have a say, just like with the regular budget hearing, which is why we have to have the budget hearing so that the public can say what they think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10095.254s">And</a>  so that's the overview of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10099.358s">And</a>  I apologize for it being so long and wordy, but I just felt like I couldn't, this is shorter than it was, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10107.384s">Thank</a>  you members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10109.546s">So</a>  Dr. Edward-Vincenino, if you don't have comment, just do you think there is time needed to discuss it with Central and our CFO?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10121.596s">I</a>  mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10125.348s">I</a>  appreciate that it's mapped out the way that it is mapped out I just was looking at between phase one and phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10137.648s">Phase</a>  one, October one is when we have our first enrollment projections that are submitted to DC. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10145.837s">So</a>  it, it definitely is a very early start, knowing that like September to October. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10154.426s">I</a>  would love to be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10160.151s">for</a>  phase one and phase two where this, the work is mapped out, I would love to be able to just kind of unpack the timing of some of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10169.875s">I</a>  understand the March one target date, like how you were backwards mapping. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10176.097s">I'm</a>  just wondering if from October one to December 15th, with the start of school, will that give us <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10186.616s">you</a>  know, just for my own learning curve, honestly, that I would be starting the budget process in October and thinking about just the start of the school year and pushing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10196.62s">If</a>  I could at least try to unpack the timetables for phase one and phase two, not what's listed within it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10205.483s">I</a>  am completely, you know, in support of the pieces that are listed within it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10212.085s">I'm</a>  just trying to think of, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10214.346s">realistically</a>  with like the team, would they be able to get every every single piece done during that October, October one where we're still, you know, monitoring some pieces?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10228.536s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10229.737s">Member</a>  Rousseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10230.798s">Um,</a>  you know, it is <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10233.937s">Phase</a>  one and phase two, frankly, are the superintendent's office, and they could have just been called phase one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10241.403s">So,</a>  those dates, you know, between October one and February one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10246.648s">Honestly,</a>  I don't, I don't think anybody cares where and how you have to switch that around so you know the December thing really bothered me when I was doing it because I'm like, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10258.32s">It's</a>  like December 31st, well, like it's the holidays or winter break or whatever you call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10264.282s">And</a>  I know that that wasn't a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10267.923s">So</a>  certainly if you wanna move the dates around or move things in phase one and two around, I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10277.986s">Some</a>  of this language I did get from Cambridge Public Schools, which frankly, they were the only school system I could find that had anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10287.944s">Everybody</a>  had the same block paragraph that we all inherit from MASC, which essentially says, we'll do a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10295.79s">Gee,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10297.752s">So</a>  yeah, so definitely that stuff feels very much squishy and whatever you recommend for changes, I'm sure we would be fine with, or I would be fine with, I can't speak for the committee, but that's how those came about.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10314.285s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10315.606s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10318.267s">You</a>  know, one of the things that I feel like we have seen, and we see it happen in different ways every year, but certainly we're seeing it this year, is like, you know, we get to the point where we're like talking about the budget with the community, and all of a sudden, what we're asking for and what we think we're going to get all gets like mushed together and people get really confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10342.04s">What</a>  when I think about being led by a strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10345.682s">I</a>  think that means like somebody sitting down at some point in time and saying, in order to make progress strategically on whatever our objectives are like here's what we need to do next year and then you have to sort of let reality like play play its course and and you adjust from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10363.072s">But</a>  we've not yet ever really gotten to a point where like that, what do we need to do the things that we're setting out to do is not muddied by some financial reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10375.848s">And</a>  I think it's a disservice to the community because I think people <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10380.593s">have</a>  questions about, are we doing strategic thinking? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10384.195s">Are</a>  we doing things that, you know, improve the arts programming across the district from, you know, K to 12? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10391.859s">Like</a>  nobody sees that work because it gets sort of buried under everything that happens when you start talking about the reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10401.204s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10402.304s">Um,</a>  I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10403.745s">We've,</a>  we've sort of bifurcated these two things, but it's still very, it's so tight and close together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10409.269s">It's</a>  still quite muddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10410.13s">Um,</a>  and I would also say that we are unusual in that we are in June and still talking about a budget that does not happen across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10420.857s">People</a>  are passing school committee budgets in January, and they're feeling like they're behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10425.68s">Like</a>  there are communities that pass budgets before January. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10428.802s">Like</a>  none of this is unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10432.102s">in</a>  terms of sort of endeavoring to have a better process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10435.664s">And</a>  I feel like maybe those communities have figured out that like the gauntlet of May and June is just not the time to be also hashing out like the, whether you're gonna have enough paper next year, like all of the things that sort of converge in May and June, like we need to start to offload some of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10454.231s">It's</a>  just like an unsustainable amount of <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10458.971s">activity</a>  that has to happen during that time, both for the superintendent, for all of Medford Public Schools, for this body, for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10466.532s">So</a>  I think there's a way for us to sort of be thoughtful and strategic and do our part and do so in a little bit more of a pathway when we can take advantage of what are historically like generally sort of light meetings in January and February and March to really hash out <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10485.81s">the</a>  strategic details and then we're sort of on our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10488.733s">So</a>  I like the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10490.615s">I</a>  have been pushing to do things sooner earlier since I started on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10497.482s">And</a>  we're not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10498.683s">Like</a>  and even here, here we are, it's June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10501.145s">And</a>  I was like, it's earlier than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10503.428s">And</a>  it's here, it's still June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10505.249s">We're</a>  still talking about this in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10507.592s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10508.834s">people</a>  don't have clarity about like what exactly is happening and what that means and to some degree that will always be the case because we are dependent on the mayor putting out her budget, she has work to do to do that that has nothing to do with us, and the council has to agree to all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10524.892s">There,</a>  there are still those things that are going to push us to having budget discussions in June, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10530.894s">I</a>  just think we should have less of budget discussions in June and more budget discussions earlier in the cycle so that we are not part of like what the ultimate <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10543.478s">sort</a>  of June rush looks like, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10545.84s">So</a>  I think we have an opportunity to try this and if it doesn't work, we can revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10551.925s">So</a>  I'm in full support and would make a motion to approve it with that one amendment of talking about the municipal allocation instead of the proposed reconciled budget in phase five, item 1B.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10570.279s">Motion</a>  by member Graham as amended.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10573.524s">have</a>  another minor text. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10576.265s">I</a>  think it was in section eight, part D. I can just send this to you, but to move that phrase to approve the proposed reconciled budget to after meeting, so special school committee meeting to approve the proposed reconciled budget will be scheduled no less than five business days. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10597.751s">You</a>  stumbled over it when reading it the same way that I stumbled over it at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10605.303s">And</a>  I did have a question on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10609.106s">So</a>  you talk in phase two about discussing the budget needs with the principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10613.949s">I</a>  was wondering about the department heads and potentially that's part of the presentations we get regularly from the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10623.539s">I</a>  don't know if that's part of the budget process, or if it's part of the updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10627.222s">This</a>  is what we've been doing, this is where we are, and this is what we anticipate needing for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10631.486s">So</a>  build some of that strategic planning into those updates that we're already getting, or if not, make sure it's in the process of crafting the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10641.836s">I</a>  think one of the big questions that people have had, that I've seen from people is, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10648.737s">who</a>  exactly, how are we getting these numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10651.279s">Why</a>  are we, what is the plan for this department and that department and what are their needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10656.262s">And</a>  I know it's allocated by school and the principals are really important, but thinking about the departments and giving us a better sense of where those numbers and allocations are coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10666.849s">Because</a>  I think that also informs how we spend our money and what our priorities are.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10672.754s">Member</a>  Russo and then Dr. Edward-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10675.216s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10676.496s">You</a>  know, in my seven and a half years now, we've done budgets, this will be the third way that we've done them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10684.678s">And</a>  when I started, the way we did them, I mean, it was just the way I've been done, I was new, was that every department head, every principal came before the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10697.366s">They</a>  told us what they wanted, but of course, we're not their boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10702.129s">The</a>  superintendent's their boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10703.649s">So</a>  everything that they were presenting, the superintendent already had, of course, like vetted, or I assumed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10711.453s">I</a>  mean, it made no sense that we were being presented with something that the superintendent had already said, yeah, that's fine, as if we were going to somehow, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10722.099s">be</a>  a decision maker at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10723.72s">It</a>  was informational, but the biggest flaw in that was that, you know, if a department head had like a big spend, they wanted to really do something big with the department and the superintendent after talking down about how much money there was, was like, we can't do it this year, or we never hear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10742.756s">So,</a>  you know, if we were hearing about those things that we weren't gonna get to do, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10749.042s">because</a>  we didn't have the resources in those meetings, then that could have been useful and helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10754.527s">So</a>  that was the first couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10758.63s">And</a>  then remember Graham got on and that got turned upside down where it was, here's the list of things we would do if we had the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10769.459s">And</a>  we did that, I think, two years and then we have this pandemic thing that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10775.768s">Oh,</a>  actually, no, I got my time right a little off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10778.332s">But</a>  anyways, we had a laundry list of things we would do if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10782.277s">And</a>  many of those things were not like <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10785.157s">know</a>  nice to have they were things you're like wait the public schools doesn't do that stuff like how are you operating a public school and not doing that which was sort of the whole point was to have that in black and white um and this year we haven't we sort of done it a different way because we just because we knew how big the the budget gap was so a lot of that stuff kind of fell to the ways to the side as <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10810.562s">We</a>  could have done it, but honestly, what was the point? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10814.804s">It</a>  sort of felt like this year, like what was the point? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10819.146s">So</a>  I forgot what my point was in response to your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10823.869s">What</a>  was your question?</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10826.19s">My</a>  question was how do we make transparent those priorities, not just in the individual schools, but across the areas, the department areas,</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10838.801s">That,</a>  sorry, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10839.922s">So</a>  I guess part of the problem with that type of transparency is that the, I mean, it isn't really appropriate to think department heads and principals are gonna come and essentially just ignore what their boss said and say, here's what we think that the priorities for science should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10861.966s">And</a>  if the superintendent doesn't agree, I don't think we should hear about it because that's not transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10867.831s">We</a>  hire and supervise the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10870.613s">And</a>  if she believes that's not the way to do it right now, or we can't afford it, I think that's not transparent for us, but it's on the other side of a veil that is like etched in stone in the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10887.047s">And,</a>  you know, we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10892.213s">dig</a>  and we can, you know, throw the fishing hook in and try and pull that stuff out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10897.455s">And</a>  we will hear from the community and other folks like, you know, science, which is doing great, by the way, but I'm using it as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10905.079s">Science</a>  has a problem like we did before we bought FOSS. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10909.821s">And</a>  maybe we can push, but I just think having, it really felt like a dog and pony show where <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10918.649s">department</a>  heads and the principals told us stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10922.652s">And</a>  every year they seem to sort of have everything they needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10925.935s">And</a>  it was like two months of committee of the halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10930.838s">It</a>  was like on top of school committee, two months of committee of the halls, where at the end you were just like, okay, I know what's going on, but there's no strategic anything involved because it's already been decided by the superintendent, which is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10946.551s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10947.561s">I</a>  understand that desire, but I also feel like getting that desire satisfied is in some ways outside of our jurisdiction, if you will, so.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10961.706s">Then</a>  maybe what I'm asking is if that budget presentation can be tied more closely to the strategic plan and the direction that we're headed.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10972.49s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10974.071s">Dr.</a>  Edward-Vinson, <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10976.038s">was</a>  next and then I'll go to member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10978.721s">So</a>  in response to your question, what I started writing down and I think you were reading my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10986.94s">but</a>  I wrote down alignment, aligned strategic plan, curriculum review, and I also wrote down MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10995.964s">And</a>  so we did have a different way of doing the budget in previous years in agreement with what member Rousseau was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11007.208s">And</a>  what we found at least this particular year, how the numbers were explained and how you have to work with what you're given. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11017.793s">Our</a>  priority is to truly align our resources and work smarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11022.68s">On</a>  behalf of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11024.823s">We</a>  do have a strategic plan that we are in the process of getting ready, ready to do the next cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11032.314s">However,</a>  we <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11034.296s">temporarily</a>  push pause in working with Member Graham and other members of the committee because of all of the work and the requirements that MSBA is asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11046.987s">So</a>  instead of having us, you know, in isolation, work on a strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11052.132s">And</a>  then MSBA says, we need X, Y, and Z. And it's like, oh, well, we did A, B, and C. And it's like, well, forget about that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11060.697s">let's</a>  go do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11061.737s">So</a>  instead of trying to do things two and three times, we're kind of trying to align the work, making sure that the work is coherent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11072.46s">And</a>  again, always keeping in mind that it's about what's going to be best for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11076.982s">And</a>  so I do feel that <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11081.363s">having</a>  everyone come up to present what their wish list is, isn't necessarily the best use of time because it may not be connected, clearly connected to our strategic plan so that if everything we do is aligned to our strategy, our strategic plan, the entire district will move forward in one direction and we will see greater results for our students and we will have a more effective <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11108.442s">running</a>  district and do things more efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11112.863s">So</a>  I just want to say that that's the reason why there has been a pause in some areas, but it's really about gathering enough information in order to make a good decision once.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11127.947s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11128.307s">Yeah,</a>  I don't support doing the same work over and over, to be clear.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11134.966s">Okay,</a>  Member Graham, and then we'll take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11138.047s">Sure,</a>  I just wanted to revise my motion a little bit, and I think this might help. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11142.529s">So</a>  a motion to approve this on first reading with two amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11148.831s">One</a>  is section five, item 1B, in that second line, it shouldn't say proposed reconciled budget, it should say proposed municipal allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11163.909s">And</a>  then with a second amendment in phase two, item number two, it says principals and we're going to add and department heads discuss budget needs with school councils and provide feedback to the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11179.057s">Motion</a>  for approval as amended twice by member Graham, seconded by member Reinfeldt. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11191.294s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11191.734s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11192.255s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11192.695s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11193.036s">Our</a>  next meeting is June 10th, 2024, here at the Alden Memorial Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11196.659s">That's</a>  next Monday, in addition to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11198.461s">This</a>  will be the last regular meeting of the Medford School Committee for school year 23-24. <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11202.124s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11202.785s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11203.566s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11204.226s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11204.927s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11205.648s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11206.649s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11207.469s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11208.41s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11209.051s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11209.812s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11210.812s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11211.653s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11212.995s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11215.137s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11215.757s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11217.098s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11217.759s">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn?</p>
