Now, let me see if I can.

43
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:01,647

01:42:08,574 --> 01:42:09,375
Motion to approve.

47
01:42:09,695 --> 01:42:11,036
Member Reinfeldt, seconded by?

01:42:11,076 --> 01:42:11,436

01:42:14,919 --> 01:42:17,001
Consent agenda is approved.

53
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:22,130
We have reports of subcommittees, strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting held on May 21st, 2024.

54
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:22,491
Thank you, Mayor.

55
01:42:28,224 --> 01:42:28,825
Thank you, Mayor.

56
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:39,713
I'm actually going to hold most of my comments because Member Rousseau helpfully crafted a policy that covers much of what we talked about.

57
01:42:41,454 --> 01:42:47,359
The only other thing that I would add is that we will be making updates to the existing

58
01:42:49,597 --> 01:42:55,283
capital plan for the schools in time for that next cycle next year, assuming that that passes tonight.

59
01:42:55,363 --> 01:43:02,110
So we can get to that later, the process, which I think was the more substantive part of our conversation later on.

60
01:43:03,932 --> 01:43:04,272
Thank you.

61
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:06,194
Thank you.

62
01:43:06,314 --> 01:43:10,138
Curriculum instruction assessment and accountability subcommittee meeting held on May 28, 2024.

63
01:43:11,823 --> 01:43:12,964
Yep, I don't have a lot to share.

64
01:43:13,004 --> 01:43:14,386
This was really a foundational meeting.

65
01:43:14,406 --> 01:43:19,952
We had a great crowd of people who gave us an overview of what was happening and we're moving forward towards phase two.

66
01:43:21,053 --> 01:43:22,014
Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

67
01:43:22,855 --> 01:43:26,359
We have our report of superintendent updates and comments.

68
01:43:26,379 --> 01:43:27,460
Dr. Maurice Edouard Vincent.

69
01:43:28,841 --> 01:43:29,322
Good evening.

70
01:43:33,058 --> 01:43:35,700
It's June 3, which means Pride Month has begun.

71
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:46,648
Medford kicked off its celebrations with a wonderful Pride flag raising festival at City Hall on this past Friday, which I was pleased to attend.

72
01:43:47,448 --> 01:43:49,730
I want to thank our mayor, thank Ms.

73
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:56,895
Frances Nwaje, the city's DEI director, the members of your team that helped to set it up.

74
01:43:57,115 --> 01:44:00,017
It was truly an enjoyable event for all.

75
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:17,604
I also want to just let the audience know that this Saturday, students from Medford High School, GSA, will join the wider Greater Boston LGBTQIA plus community in the Boston Pride Parade.

76
01:44:18,145 --> 01:44:22,526
So we wish them clear skies, lots of fun, and don't forget to wear sunblock.

77
01:44:24,067 --> 01:44:27,088
Medford Public Schools embraces our LGBTQ

78
01:44:28,715 --> 01:44:36,002
IA plus community members this month, students, staff, family members, and all those who call Medford home.

79
01:44:37,113 --> 01:44:45,280
The diversity of our community is an incredible strength, with each individual contributing their unique talents and perspectives to the whole.

80
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:58,591
We also firmly believe in and defend the civil and human rights of LGBTQIA plus Mustangs and all people, particularly at a time when those rights are often under attack.

81
01:44:59,551 --> 01:45:03,975
We all deserve the same chance to thrive and live freely and authentically.

82
01:45:04,475 --> 01:45:05,316
Happy Pride Month.

83
01:45:06,869 --> 01:45:17,699
I also want to share that last week, we had a wonderful Special Olympics that took place in Malden for our students with disabilities.

84
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:22,564
It was a wonderful event students from other communities participated in that.

85
01:45:23,084 --> 01:45:39,092
And I just want to thank our special educators, Miss Bowen and all the members of her team, Miss Lauren Perillo, Denise DeJardins, and many other staff, Miss Principal Michelle Kroll, who was able to attend that event last week in Malden.

86
01:45:39,132 --> 01:45:42,314
It was excellent, and it was wonderful weather as well.

87
01:45:43,434 --> 01:45:54,621
I also would like to say that last week we had a wonderful event, the Junior Olympics for our fifth grade students that are moving on to middle school next year.

88
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:59,164
And we had some pretty bad weather last week.

89
01:45:59,704 --> 01:46:05,668
So at the last minute, Tufts University was willing to let us use their Gancher Center.

90
01:46:06,528 --> 01:46:08,129
And we're very grateful to that.

91
01:46:08,149 --> 01:46:08,809
We want to thank

92
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:18,795
Rachel Perry and all the athletic, the phys ed teachers that participated and the fifth grade staff, all the principals were there.

93
01:46:19,295 --> 01:46:26,739
We also want to thank the PTOs, Dr. Cushing for helping to coordinate that event as well.

94
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,522
So those were two wonderful year end events for our students.

95
01:46:32,502 --> 01:46:33,483
At tonight's meeting,

96
01:46:35,183 --> 01:46:51,497
I'm looking forward to recognizing some of our district fine art students for their notable photography accomplishments and recognizing Medford students in the annual scholastic competition that recognizes teens in grades seven through 12.

97
01:46:53,178 --> 01:46:59,701
with regional and national honors for their creativity in art and writing in 28 categories.

98
01:47:00,141 --> 01:47:02,463
That will be presented this evening by Ms.

99
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:03,403
Suzanne Fee.

100
01:47:04,283 --> 01:47:21,572
After that, we will have the opportunity to welcome and celebrate two newly appointed leaders in our school district, Mrs. Nancy Sherman-Hudson, who will begin next school year as principal of the Missittuck Elementary School, and Mrs. Christina Lungo-Dudley, the new director of Kids' Corner.

101
01:47:22,952 --> 01:47:24,593
Next, we'll also invite Ms.

102
01:47:24,613 --> 01:47:32,979
Stacey Shulman, Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health, to tell us about the always inspiring Bloomsack Leadership Awards.

103
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:43,968
This unique academic and professional opportunity is made available to Medford Public School students through the extremely generous support of the Bloomsack family.

104
01:47:44,648 --> 01:47:46,849
And we look forward to hearing more from Ms.

105
01:47:46,889 --> 01:47:49,470
Shulman and Ms.

106
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:54,271
Nakera, one of our students who was the recipient of that award.

107
01:47:55,552 --> 01:48:10,177
Dr. Peter Cushing will provide updates on the exciting progress being made on the McGlynn Playground Project, the city's first universally accessible playground, and the District Student Opportunity Act.

108
01:48:10,957 --> 01:48:13,658
Thank you, and I look forward to this evening's.

109
01:48:14,478 --> 01:48:15,198
presentations.

110
01:48:15,399 --> 01:48:16,579
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

111
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,720
Next, we'll invite Ms.

112
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,563
Suzanne Fee, Coordinator of Fine Arts, to give us Fine Arts student recognition update.

113
01:48:25,724 --> 01:48:25,984
Welcome.

114
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:39,551
Thank you very much for having us.

115
01:48:41,072 --> 01:48:44,454
If you could just indulge me for one minute before we get to the awards.

116
01:48:44,835 --> 01:48:48,977
We had a busy and exciting month in the art and music departments.

117
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:53,540
May was arts month and we had six student art exhibitions.

118
01:48:54,281 --> 01:49:01,665
We had five all school art shows that featured artwork from all students in the school, as well as musical performances.

119
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:11,350
including the band, the jazz band, ukulele performances, recorder performances, singing performances, orchestra, and more.

120
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:17,352
In addition to all the music that enhanced the art show, there were four concert events and two musicals.

121
01:49:17,993 --> 01:49:30,478
It was just a tremendous effort that by all of our art and music staff and with the support of building principals and our PTOs and our grant partners that supplemented some of those activities, we're just really proud of

122
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:31,692
the month we had.

123
01:49:31,792 --> 01:49:38,991
So I want to thank everybody who showed up and reached out about what a great series of events we had.

124
01:49:40,336 --> 01:49:44,718
But now on to the photo contest and the Scholastic Art Award winners.

125
01:49:45,518 --> 01:49:47,059
I'm joined by Ms.

126
01:49:47,099 --> 01:49:57,263
Van Aken, who has been a teacher at Medford High for many, many years and plays a vital role in both the photo contest and organizing the Scholastic Art Awards.

127
01:49:57,563 --> 01:50:06,086
And she is retiring at the end of this year, and neither one of these events would be possible without her extra help and time and dedication.

128
01:50:06,106 --> 01:50:07,247
So I just want to acknowledge Ms.

129
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:08,187
Van Aken as well.

130
01:50:14,246 --> 01:50:15,127
Dr. Cushing?

131
01:50:17,849 --> 01:50:21,992
I think I have a presentation to share so you can see the winning entries.

132
01:50:25,154 --> 01:50:36,803
So we'll start with the photo contest winners and the photo contest is a wonderful contest that we have at MHS because it brings out a lot of kids who aren't necessarily taking art classes and stuff so it's a great way to

133
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:39,031
get more kids involved in the arts.

134
01:50:40,171 --> 01:50:49,296
So when I call you up, if you're here, we'll give you your award and your prize and your matted photo and you could shake everyone's hand and come around this way.

135
01:50:49,596 --> 01:50:56,459
A lot of our seniors are at the barbecue, so I'll be chasing them at graduation to give them their awards and prizes, but we do have a lot of students here.

136
01:51:01,767 --> 01:51:03,107
Oh, okay.

137
01:51:03,468 --> 01:51:05,288
Well, I'll just read through it and we have the photos.

138
01:51:06,488 --> 01:51:10,990
Connor O'Leary in grade 12 got an honorable mention for his photo paddling down.

139
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:14,591
I don't think, I think Connor left for that over here.

140
01:51:16,691 --> 01:51:21,653
Kaitlyn Chuang, an honorable mention for her photo shove it.

141
01:51:22,433 --> 01:51:24,654
Yep, make sure we show the photo to both sides.

142
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:34,076

144
01:51:51,997 --> 01:51:59,279
And now our category winners, Jonathan Malerba in grade 11, who you may recognize because he's at all of our events taking fabulous photos.

145
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:02,019
He won best action photo for Kaboom.

146
01:52:09,381 --> 01:52:13,622
Connor O'Leary again won for best landscape or cityscape, but he is not here.

147
01:52:16,142 --> 01:52:19,523
Emma Beardsley in grade 10 won best portrait for Thanksgiving Day.

148
01:52:24,056 --> 01:52:29,961
Linnea Strassfield in grade 11, won third place and best nature photo for evergreen.

149
01:52:36,366 --> 01:52:41,390
Julia Hollenbaker in grade 12, won second place for Willie from Boston.

150
01:52:45,914 --> 01:52:51,038
And Ari Atwell in grade 11, won first place for swim among the stars.

151
01:53:00,882 --> 01:53:07,228
And our Scholastic Art Award winners this year, Dakota Mahoney got an Honorable Mention for Fragile Tension.

152
01:53:08,109 --> 01:53:09,510
She's not here, she's at the barbecue.

153
01:53:11,933 --> 01:53:15,136
Lily Burhagen won a Silver Key for Glass Ceiling.

154
01:53:21,782 --> 01:53:24,065
And she also won an Honorable Mention for another piece.

155
01:53:26,849 --> 01:53:36,079
And Stella Heining, again, won a gold key for one of her ceramic pieces, Shadow Woman Jar, and an honorable mention for Many Faces Jar.

156
01:53:41,484 --> 01:53:43,767
And a silver key for her portfolio work.

157
01:53:46,189 --> 01:53:47,291
So thank you very much.

158
01:53:47,371 --> 01:53:49,293
If we could just do a quick photo, that would be great.

159
01:54:32,328 --> 01:54:32,611
Thanks.

160
01:55:05,677 --> 01:55:06,857
Member Ntapa.

161
01:55:09,878 --> 01:55:10,119
Awesome.

162
01:55:10,219 --> 01:55:14,600
I just want to say thank you very much, Director Fee for presenting all this.

163
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:22,143
I just want to also say that I have the distinct pleasure of working at an art institution and being a graduate of an art institution.

164
01:55:22,363 --> 01:55:29,065
And by doing that, I get to see what everyone from around the state and around the country is producing.

165
01:55:29,425 --> 01:55:31,746
Watching our Studio Foundation students go through the

166
01:55:32,166 --> 01:55:34,487
the system, working with students all the time.

167
01:55:35,147 --> 01:55:44,330
And I can comfortably say I think for the first time that Medford is excelling in the arts and I'm really, really pleased to see all the work that's presented, I mean these are just the award winners.

168
01:55:45,131 --> 01:55:53,174
We don't know what people are crafting personally what's in their full portfolios, and just, it's really refreshing to see this much attention to the arts.

169
01:55:54,774 --> 01:56:00,097
and seeing how many people were involved in the level that they're at, at grade 10, grade 11, seniors.

170
01:56:00,618 --> 01:56:14,026
So whether or not they pursue to do an art education, which I know some of the winners are, but I just want to say like, this is phenomenal work and thank you and congratulations to everyone who won an award and hopefully we'll see what you do next.

171
01:56:14,246 --> 01:56:14,766
So thank you.

172
01:56:22,011 --> 01:56:23,832
Yes, thank you very much, Ms.

173
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:23,872
B.

174
01:56:25,746 --> 01:56:35,116
We have number three announcement of new positions new principal of the Mississauga elementary school Miss Nancy Sherman Hudson, and the direct new director of kids corner Miss Christina lungo deadly.

175
01:56:35,717 --> 01:56:38,099
Dr. Thank you.

176
01:56:38,619 --> 01:56:45,847
So I would love for Mrs Sherman Hudson, and Mrs Christina Luongo deadly to come forward

177
01:56:51,209 --> 01:56:52,430
Thank you to the both of you.

178
01:56:53,991 --> 01:57:14,605
When we learned this year that Dr. Kathy Kay, we see you, long time principal of the Missituck Elementary School planned to retire at the end of the school year, we knew that it was important to engage the whole school community, including parents and staff in the selection of the next leader of our school, of the Missituck School.

179
01:57:15,806 --> 01:57:35,451
Our selection, Mrs. Nancy Sherman Hudson, has a long and impressive resume from her time in the Medford Public Schools, working as an inclusion kindergarten teacher for many years at different schools before joining Dr. K to lead the Missittuc as assistant principal in 2013.

180
01:57:38,268 --> 01:57:51,986
Earlier this year, miss Sherman Hudson acted as interim principal of the Mississippi elementary school, ensuring continuity and stability for the school community during the temporary absence of the principal.

181
01:57:53,408 --> 01:58:04,618
As assistant principal and interim principal, Mrs. Sherman has played an active role in the daily operations, systems, management, and routines of the school.

182
01:58:05,699 --> 01:58:14,607
She has also worked closely with teachers as an educational leader, supporting and coaching classroom teachers throughout the school.

183
01:58:15,688 --> 01:58:18,110
I am very pleased to first welcome

184
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:23,894
The next principal of the elementary school, Mrs. Nancy Sherman Hudson.

185
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:39,441
Okay, my first job was done.

186
01:58:41,362 --> 01:58:43,864
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent and school committee members.

187
01:58:44,044 --> 01:58:50,348
I look forward to continuing to work alongside our very dedicated staff and families at the Mississauga.

188
01:58:50,968 --> 01:58:56,632
A special thank you to Dr. Kaye for her mentoring and leadership she modeled over the past 11 years.

189
01:58:57,372 --> 01:58:58,933
Thank you, I'm so excited.

190
01:59:05,177 --> 01:59:05,597
Thank you.

191
01:59:07,628 --> 01:59:08,090
Thank you.

192
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:13,770
And next, I would like to welcome another leader with an impressive history in our school community.

193
01:59:15,777 --> 01:59:20,880
Upon the retirement of Mrs. Linda Selinger, I am very pleased to appoint Ms.

194
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:26,903
Christina Luongo-Dudley as the next director of Medford's Kids Corner Child Care Center.

195
01:59:27,724 --> 01:59:27,904
Ms.

196
01:59:27,944 --> 01:59:35,648
Luongo-Dudley is an accomplished early educator with experience ranging from infant care to pre-kindergarten.

197
01:59:36,308 --> 01:59:40,751
Since 2013, she has worked as a lead teacher at Kids Corner,

198
01:59:41,651 --> 01:59:51,416
augmenting her responsibilities in 2018 by becoming the Kids' Corner Assistant Director Program Coordinator in addition to her classroom role.

199
01:59:52,336 --> 02:00:02,861
Throughout her years working in Kids' Corner, Christina Luongo-Dudley developed a reputation for peer leadership, effective communication, and student enrichment.

200
02:00:03,581 --> 02:00:09,684
Please join me in welcoming the next Kids' Corner Director, Mrs. Christina Luongo-Dudley.

201
02:00:16,872 --> 02:00:17,352
Thank you.

202
02:00:18,133 --> 02:00:19,193
Good evening, everyone.

203
02:00:19,493 --> 02:00:22,715
I stand here today to say thank you for this wonderful opportunity.

204
02:00:23,215 --> 02:00:31,439
It is with the utmost excitement and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of our families for entrusting me with the privilege of educating and nurturing your children.

205
02:00:32,439 --> 02:00:40,983
As your new director of Kids' Corner Daycare, I am committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and engaging learning environment for every child, family, and staff member.

206
02:00:42,881 --> 02:00:46,923
This would not have been possible without the support and guidance of many amazing people.

207
02:00:47,863 --> 02:00:53,746
I would like to thank Assistant Superintendent Suzanne B. Galluzzi for her mentorship and guidance throughout this process.

208
02:00:54,186 --> 02:00:59,848
Her continued partnership will only help me become a better individual and leader for our staff, families, and children.

209
02:01:00,668 --> 02:01:07,371
Finally, I would like to thank Superintendent Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent for entrusting me to serve as the new director of Kids' Corner.

210
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:09,092
I am eternally grateful.

211
02:01:10,478 --> 02:01:15,999
I am excited for the future of Kids Corner Daycare, as I have many dreams and aspirations for its growth and development.

212
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:22,741
With the upcoming 2024-2025 school year, I am thrilled to begin implementing fresh and innovative changes.

213
02:01:23,461 --> 02:01:31,844
I am truly excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and I'm confident that with the support of our community, we can create a bright and prosperous future for the center.

214
02:01:32,284 --> 02:01:32,624
Thank you.

215
02:01:42,312 --> 02:01:43,634
Thank you both, congratulations.

216
02:01:46,019 --> 02:01:48,864
We have number four, Bloomsack Leadership Awards.

217
02:01:49,145 --> 02:01:49,345
Ms.

218
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:53,413
Stacey Shulman, Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health, and I see Ms.

219
02:01:53,433 --> 02:01:54,535
Bloomsack in the audience.

220
02:01:58,561 --> 02:01:58,881
Welcome.

221
02:01:59,361 --> 02:02:00,221
Hi, good evening.

222
02:02:00,281 --> 02:02:02,462
I'm Stacey Shulman, Director of School Counseling.

223
02:02:02,682 --> 02:02:05,862
And I am always thrilled to come here to talk about our students' work.

224
02:02:06,382 --> 02:02:07,903
The Bloomsack family, Ms.

225
02:02:07,923 --> 02:02:15,424
Bloomsack is here with us this evening, has sponsored a student every summer to attend the pre-college program at Tufts for Leadership for Social Change.

226
02:02:15,864 --> 02:02:20,265
And we are thrilled that each of our students has done a project, which we'll give back to Medford.

227
02:02:20,925 --> 02:02:21,085
Ms.

228
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:21,925
Nakira, Ms.

229
02:02:21,965 --> 02:02:24,626
Oprah Nakira, is here this evening to share her project with us.

230
02:02:24,686 --> 02:02:26,786
So without further ado, I'll allow her to speak.

231
02:02:30,812 --> 02:02:32,293
Hi, thank you for having me here today.

232
02:02:32,313 --> 02:02:34,854
I think we have a slideshow queued up.

233
02:02:35,435 --> 02:02:35,855
Thank you.

234
02:02:36,435 --> 02:02:41,158
So I had the privilege of doing this program during the summer at Tufts.

235
02:02:41,838 --> 02:02:44,660
And one of our projects was to do something that we're passionate about.

236
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:51,384
So I did a research project about how we can increase representation and access to AP courses at Medford High School.

237
02:02:53,854 --> 02:03:01,466
Yeah, so just for some statistics and school segregation accounts for about 40% of segregation at schools.

238
02:03:01,886 --> 02:03:08,557
And sadly, this is when you can kind of tell the level of course at the school itself by the makeup of the students in the school.

239
02:03:09,321 --> 02:03:15,265
And one way that we can combat that is looking at policy changes that we can make to increase access to these courses.

240
02:03:16,085 --> 02:03:29,894
And this also applies to not only minority students, but also low income students or students from single parent households who don't have access to tutoring or guidance that could help them succeed in these courses.

241
02:03:32,085 --> 02:03:38,331
So some possible causes for this are a lack of diversity in the teacher workforce itself.

242
02:03:39,132 --> 02:03:48,660
And this is really detrimental to the students themselves because studies actually show that students do better when they're represented within the teachers that they have.

243
02:03:49,301 --> 02:03:54,886
And then also teacher expectations could be a root cause just because of implicit biases as well.

244
02:03:58,010 --> 02:04:03,491
So just for some examples of policy that could lead to this, well, the first one I have is tracking.

245
02:04:03,631 --> 02:04:17,314
So I think Medford High School actually got rid of this this year, but before we had this policy where you had to take a math test in sixth grade and that kind of depended where you went or what math classes you took in high school.

246
02:04:17,794 --> 02:04:24,896
So this limited access to calculus, for example, for a lot of students who maybe didn't have access to tutoring to do well on these tests.

247
02:04:25,736 --> 02:04:46,677
And this is not only, this is not necessarily to say that we shouldn't use tracking in schools, but just that we should also supplement tracking with, for example, more guidance for students who need them, who are either minority students or low-income students, and looking at how we can make these programs accessible for all students.

248
02:04:49,867 --> 02:04:55,649
And then just some community organizations that are working on this issue are, for example, the NAACP.

249
02:04:56,070 --> 02:05:03,152
So they have science fairs that encourage achievement in STEM and other academic subjects.

250
02:05:03,973 --> 02:05:10,035
And these are some things that we can incorporate at Medford High School and other communities as well.

251
02:05:11,696 --> 02:05:13,497
And thank you for listening to my presentation.

252
02:05:13,857 --> 02:05:14,097
Thanks.

253
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:22,721
Great job, thank you so much for presenting.

254
02:05:23,482 --> 02:05:24,142
Member Russo?

255
02:05:24,783 --> 02:05:26,444
I'm sorry, I just started eating a cookie.

256
02:05:27,805 --> 02:05:29,766
Could we get that presentation sent to us, please?

257
02:05:30,727 --> 02:05:32,328
Thank you so much, wonderful.

258
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:35,290
Thank you.

259
02:05:41,214 --> 02:05:42,655
Thank you for joining us, Ms.

260
02:05:42,695 --> 02:05:43,215
Bloomsack.

261
02:05:46,978 --> 02:05:48,179
And thank you for the donation, yeah.

262
02:05:51,598 --> 02:05:52,078
Thank you.

263
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:54,439
Thank you.

264
02:05:55,159 --> 02:05:56,479
Ms.

265
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:57,940
Shulman.

266
02:05:58,220 --> 02:05:58,340
Ms.

267
02:05:58,360 --> 02:05:58,840
Shulman.

268
02:05:59,460 --> 02:05:59,600
Ms.

269
02:05:59,620 --> 02:06:00,081
Shulman.

270
02:06:00,181 --> 02:06:00,561
Ms.

271
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:01,041
Shulman.

272
02:06:01,481 --> 02:06:03,642
I'm going to use my phone.

273
02:06:24,625 --> 02:06:25,206
Yes.

274
02:06:25,226 --> 02:06:25,306
Okay.

275
02:06:39,499 --> 02:06:45,364
We have number five, our McGlynn playground update presented by Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.

276
02:07:02,585 --> 02:07:04,506
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

277
02:07:04,526 --> 02:07:06,447
Thank you very much for this opportunity to present.

278
02:07:07,507 --> 02:07:14,331
I'll just preface this as we head into this slideshow and presentation by saying they say a picture is worth a thousand words.

279
02:07:14,591 --> 02:07:21,374
I'll say in this instance, the pictures don't do the project justice by any stretch of the imagination.

280
02:07:22,075 --> 02:07:24,476
And I know that several of you have been out to the site

281
02:07:24,996 --> 02:07:33,157
We also have a tour for members of the city council, members of the school committee this Thursday at one o'clock as well.

282
02:07:33,938 --> 02:07:39,719
And so we look forward to sharing with you the live in-person progress.

283
02:07:39,899 --> 02:07:49,700
I also have online my co-chair of the design committee, Shanine Peliquin, who has been really invaluable as a part of this.

284
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:53,901
So I will start to move through the slideshow right now.

285
02:07:54,923 --> 02:08:02,629
All right, so here is the overall conceptual design of the construction as was proposed to you.

286
02:08:02,649 --> 02:08:05,932
I want you to hold this in your mind as we go through.

287
02:08:07,313 --> 02:08:11,977
You can see here one of the areas that was really prone to flooding.

288
02:08:12,057 --> 02:08:14,759
This is now where we have built an elevated deck.

289
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,743
Playground structures last for about 20 to 25 years in the most ideal conditions.

290
02:08:20,343 --> 02:08:24,008
This was installed in 2001, so we got about 22 years out of it.

291
02:08:24,028 --> 02:08:26,851
It used to be part of the Mystic River.

292
02:08:27,131 --> 02:08:34,519
It's a really wet ground that is overly saturated, and the playground was flooded for much of the year in the winter.

293
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:38,424
I would wager you could have ice skated on a significant portion of it.

294
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:41,680
So why the flooding?

295
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:46,144
Well, because it was a river and the drainage was not well maintained, well cared for.

296
02:08:46,624 --> 02:08:54,610
I want to thank the DPW for in the last year and a half, they went in, they really excavated, put in some temporary drains, and they did a really great job.

297
02:08:54,771 --> 02:08:57,092
And the land itself is just wet a lot of the time.

298
02:08:58,694 --> 02:09:00,195
So what's going on behind the fence?

299
02:09:00,555 --> 02:09:02,797
Thank you all for being at the groundbreaking back in December.

300
02:09:02,897 --> 02:09:05,059
I should say the snow breaking at that time.

301
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:07,160
But we,

302
02:09:09,366 --> 02:09:15,727
We've been working really hard over the winter to really demolish the old playground, build in drainage.

303
02:09:15,767 --> 02:09:17,288
The drainage is really amazing.

304
02:09:18,088 --> 02:09:25,250
It's oversized, or I'd say properly sized, which means it's rather large to handle the amount of water that we're going through.

305
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:27,130
We've put in rain gardens.

306
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:32,651
We've done electricity out to the playground, so we're not running extension cords.

307
02:09:32,691 --> 02:09:36,112
We've done data ports out to the playground, so that we'll have that available

308
02:09:36,584 --> 02:09:41,722
The rocks and the boulders that you'll see throughout the site have actually been brought in from Carr Park.

309
02:09:42,367 --> 02:09:48,491
and that work that's been done there, it's a really cool, it adds a really cool feel to the playground, just the boulders themselves.

310
02:09:49,952 --> 02:09:52,714
We've been finalizing play structure, design, colors.

311
02:09:53,395 --> 02:09:58,358
We've been having weekly meetings with our design team and construction team.

312
02:09:58,819 --> 02:10:05,903
We've been ironing out some of our differences and some of our, you know, questions that arise.

313
02:10:07,344 --> 02:10:15,686
And so I put this image up there again, just so that you can get a sense of the massive scale that this project was.

314
02:10:15,746 --> 02:10:23,328
It started with resurfacing the playground and the CPC and others were like, how about we time out on that?

315
02:10:23,948 --> 02:10:31,770
Because that was going to be in of itself well over half a million dollars to just rip up and replace the soft surfacing.

316
02:10:32,429 --> 02:10:41,432
And so what they did was they funded a design study that was put on hold, I'm going to be honest, for probably about 18 months while COVID took precedent.

317
02:10:42,092 --> 02:10:56,397
And why I want you to really get a vision for this picture, this aerial, is for how we took a lot of underutilized space, and with Shanine and others' input, really moved forward with maximizing our space.

318
02:10:56,517 --> 02:10:59,158
So here you can see the pavilion in phase one.

319
02:11:01,190 --> 02:11:05,233
All that gray, dark tar will be covered with poured in place.

320
02:11:06,133 --> 02:11:08,355
The turf field was recently installed.

321
02:11:08,415 --> 02:11:10,336
The pavilion now has its roof on.

322
02:11:11,377 --> 02:11:19,823
We hope to have outdoor movies, concerts, things along those lines where families and school personnel can enjoy the turf field.

323
02:11:22,455 --> 02:11:27,457
We've done 66 new native trees, countless bushes, shrubs, and other things.

324
02:11:27,857 --> 02:11:30,138
The landscaping looks absolutely beautiful.

325
02:11:31,159 --> 02:11:40,122
And the tree area, students repeatedly said that if anything happens to this tree, we'll just die, or we won't be able to really enjoy it.

326
02:11:40,143 --> 02:11:41,183
I forget, Shanine can add.

327
02:11:42,078 --> 02:11:43,659
She's a co-host, so she can chime in.

328
02:11:43,719 --> 02:11:49,682
I forget their exact statement, but basically they would have been despondent if we had done anything to that tree.

329
02:11:50,282 --> 02:11:53,784
So we've been extraordinarily careful with it.

330
02:11:53,804 --> 02:12:00,487
There's a gradual pathway around the tree that will be covered in a semi-permeable pavement called Flexi-Pave.

331
02:12:01,188 --> 02:12:06,971
And in the lower corner, you can see the deck that will serve as another outdoor classroom type space.

332
02:12:08,251 --> 02:12:11,694
We've put in multiple picnic tables that are accessible.

333
02:12:13,355 --> 02:12:17,078
And so moving through the pictures, here's our outdoor classroom.

334
02:12:17,598 --> 02:12:32,229
The logs are set so that there's multiple spaces for accessible seating, wheelchair seating, and all of the gravel in this area will be covered with the flexi-pave permeable paving.

335
02:12:32,859 --> 02:12:39,964
And accessible garden beds allow for a wheelchair to go underneath and multiple heights for students of various heights and sizes.

336
02:12:42,886 --> 02:12:44,927
Coming up next, fencing will be installed.

337
02:12:44,968 --> 02:12:49,030
We're expecting pavement to go in this week, the asphalt pavement that needs 28 days to cure.

338
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:55,021
We'll start digging and playground equipment areas and creating landforms.

339
02:12:55,081 --> 02:13:01,683
We have some hills to create throughout the remaining area and lots more to come.

340
02:13:02,283 --> 02:13:07,104
So if you have any questions, feel free to email Shanine or Amanda Santrella.

341
02:13:07,364 --> 02:13:09,284
They're really taking point and answering questions.

342
02:13:09,724 --> 02:13:16,346
I'm always happy to answer any questions, but look forward to seeing anyone who hasn't been able to make it to the site this coming

343
02:13:17,585 --> 02:13:19,005
Thursday at one o'clock.

344
02:13:19,265 --> 02:13:24,266
We're hoping that it is not a monsoon as it has been the last two Thursdays.

345
02:13:25,407 --> 02:13:29,047
So if you have any questions, feel free, or Shanine, do you want to chime in?

346
02:13:32,648 --> 02:13:37,069
I think you covered it pretty well.

347
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:41,470
Member Graham?

348
02:13:42,875 --> 02:13:43,295
Thank you.

349
02:13:44,175 --> 02:13:49,156
I actually have had a chance to tour the playground, and it's super exciting.

350
02:13:49,176 --> 02:13:57,798
I was involved in the CPC applications that started this, actually, that happened before I was on the school committee.

351
02:13:57,818 --> 02:14:05,980
And it started out as a collaboration between the PTOs at the three schools that got resurfacing at that time.

352
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:07,940
So it was the Missittuc, the Brooks,

353
02:14:08,824 --> 02:14:11,855
and the McLean and the folks at the McLean.

354
02:14:14,082 --> 02:14:27,171
were very committed to making sure that what they did for that school served the school for the long haul and not in the just the immediate, like, I want the same as everybody else kind of way.

355
02:14:27,191 --> 02:14:38,299
So I want to just say thank you to them for their patience, because this has been a long process, much to all of our, you know, chagrin, like we all could have done without COVID.

356
02:14:38,339 --> 02:14:38,959
But here we are.

357
02:14:40,802 --> 02:14:42,203
And the project is amazing.

358
02:14:42,483 --> 02:14:44,264
And we're still accepting donations.

359
02:14:44,684 --> 02:14:52,608
And maybe we can put another reminder in the weekly in the weekly update from the superintendent that that's happening.

360
02:14:53,789 --> 02:15:04,515
So we are still looking for community donations to support, you know, making sure that we can really sort of dress this proper place out the way that it deserves to be.

361
02:15:05,682 --> 02:15:07,142
There's so many trees going in.

362
02:15:08,063 --> 02:15:13,064
It's going to be the envy of every elementary school and the question is going to be which one is next.

363
02:15:13,344 --> 02:15:29,027
So I'm hopeful that we'll be able to find some money for those conversations quickly because this playground is far above anything that Medford Public Schools has ever been able to see or deliver to students before.

364
02:15:29,287 --> 02:15:29,567
Thank you.

365
02:15:31,325 --> 02:15:34,467
The thing that I do want to say publicly, I've said it to everybody here.

366
02:15:34,647 --> 02:15:51,980
I really feel that it's a smaller project, but this should serve as inspiration for everybody for the Medford High School project as to what good design, good construction oversight, and good process of getting community involvement really can do.

367
02:15:53,281 --> 02:15:53,561
Thank you.

368
02:15:53,621 --> 02:15:58,625
And just from the chair, I want to thank you, Dr. Cushing, as well as the committee that worked on this for

369
02:15:59,332 --> 02:16:00,073
quite some time.

370
02:16:00,133 --> 02:16:05,676
I know member Graham's one of those people, former member McLaughlin and Ms.

371
02:16:05,696 --> 02:16:11,480
Pellequin and a number of other people that just put their time and soul into this.

372
02:16:12,801 --> 02:16:14,962
So happy to see it come to fruition.

373
02:16:14,982 --> 02:16:17,724
It was pretty exciting to tour it.

374
02:16:17,764 --> 02:16:29,172
Like member Graham said, to see a park that's this inclusive and it's gonna be utilized by the entire community, not just those three schools is something to be proud of.

375
02:16:29,889 --> 02:16:30,189
Thank you.

376
02:16:34,271 --> 02:16:36,572
Member Rousseau, then we have Ms.

377
02:16:36,592 --> 02:16:36,952
Pelquin.

378
02:16:37,752 --> 02:16:38,132
Thank you.

379
02:16:39,873 --> 02:16:47,076
I brought my kids to the old playground when they were little and even did skate, not on skates, but it was definitely skating material.

380
02:16:47,756 --> 02:16:54,839
And it's really, I did get to tour it and it is, while it is, when I toured it, it's far from done.

381
02:16:55,539 --> 02:16:58,080
It is shocking that it's the same,

382
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:21,938
footprint really that's sort of the thing that's hard to really wrap your head around is that the old one felt frankly small and this just feels so big it's like a like a TARDIS or something from Doctor Who it's like how on earth did you get all this in here doesn't feel crowded it's really amazing and I cannot say

383
02:17:23,277 --> 02:17:27,506
enough good things about it, and I'm super excited for the stuff that's yet to come.

384
02:17:27,526 --> 02:17:32,155
I know that there's a lot of stuff that looks

385
02:17:34,198 --> 02:17:36,560
tar color, but that's going to be colorful.

386
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:41,003
And I can't remember, I think it was Ms.

387
02:17:41,023 --> 02:17:51,110
Pelequin who explained the way the color differentials will help those with low vision and just the thoughtfulness around things.

388
02:17:51,231 --> 02:17:54,593
Because when you first glance at it, you're like, there's all these opportunities for kids to fall.

389
02:17:54,673 --> 02:17:57,715
But of course, we want kids to have the opportunity to fall.

390
02:17:58,916 --> 02:18:02,419
The old playgrounds make them so safe that they are,

391
02:18:03,547 --> 02:18:10,673
can't possibly skin a knee, but also they're boring is thankfully becoming a thing of the past.

392
02:18:10,693 --> 02:18:17,178
Cause like I drive through Belmont every day and they have a beautiful playground.

393
02:18:17,218 --> 02:18:26,265
It looks like architecturally like gorgeous, but it's all brown and it is all that style of nobody can get hurt in our playgrounds.

394
02:18:28,086 --> 02:18:30,727
And I'm sure it costs probably more than our playground.

395
02:18:31,228 --> 02:18:35,969
But I'm glad we're not going there and that it's going to be a place the kids can't get enough of.

396
02:18:36,529 --> 02:18:38,910
And my kids are way too old to enjoy it.

397
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:40,051
So I'll just go by myself.

398
02:18:40,151 --> 02:18:41,811
But thank you so much for all the work.

399
02:18:41,971 --> 02:18:45,873
And it's really an enormous number of people involved.

400
02:18:46,513 --> 02:18:52,235
And I want to thank the mayor and and the residents for funding it through the CPC because

401
02:18:53,706 --> 02:19:01,091
It wasn't the cheapest thing we could have done is an understatement, but I think our kids are really going to benefit from it.

402
02:19:01,211 --> 02:19:06,054
And not just the kids at the McGlynn, like my kids didn't go to the McGlynn, but we went there anyways.

403
02:19:07,355 --> 02:19:10,737
So I think that the kids of the entire city are gonna drive there.

404
02:19:10,857 --> 02:19:12,658
There's parking, especially on a weekend.

405
02:19:12,738 --> 02:19:13,979
So thank you.

406
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:16,281
Thank you member Rousseau.

407
02:19:16,381 --> 02:19:22,325
I think we used a number of funding sources, ARPA, CDBG, CPA, and one or two other as well.

408
02:19:23,268 --> 02:19:25,830
It takes a village, including when you have to finance something.

409
02:19:26,630 --> 02:19:27,531
I'm miss Pelican.

410
02:19:28,571 --> 02:19:28,811
Sure.

411
02:19:28,831 --> 02:19:34,355
Yeah, the other funding source was a federal earmark from representative Barbara through the DCR.

412
02:19:35,336 --> 02:19:40,659
I just wanted to say for those of you who are able to visit or who are already visited, you'll hear me say this as well, but.

413
02:19:41,471 --> 02:19:45,034
I think one of the things to know is that this is the precedent setter.

414
02:19:45,354 --> 02:19:47,456
It's not that the other schools aren't going to get this.

415
02:19:47,556 --> 02:19:50,158
It's that this is the way we're doing things from now on, right?

416
02:19:50,178 --> 02:19:55,002
We want to make sure we have robust community input processes and really hear from the kids first.

417
02:19:55,082 --> 02:20:04,050
I'm really proud of the way that this community has listened to the kids and then the staff on how to make it really workable.

418
02:20:05,531 --> 02:20:09,054
And then the other thing to know, for those of you who haven't heard us present before,

419
02:20:10,051 --> 02:20:18,633
that we did also use CPC funding to do assessments of the other MPS playgrounds because there are six total that are owned.

420
02:20:19,334 --> 02:20:31,397
And we were able to get new equipment for the Roberts and Brooks that had broken equipment and a new, just a new panel for the Missitook as well to make things safe.

421
02:20:31,877 --> 02:20:38,939
So those playgrounds have been inspected and are now safe and they will last longer while we figure out the funding pieces for how to,

422
02:20:40,171 --> 02:20:42,152
improve those schoolyards when the time comes.

423
02:20:42,232 --> 02:20:50,518
But those playgrounds are, they're up to the standard of care with the new surfacing and replacement equipment.

424
02:20:50,578 --> 02:21:00,345
So those schools did get pieces of equipment and we anticipate these kinds of processes of really deciding what works for each school in the future.

425
02:21:02,346 --> 02:21:02,986
Thank you very much.

426
02:21:05,368 --> 02:21:05,648
Thank you.

427
02:21:05,808 --> 02:21:06,549
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

428
02:21:07,859 --> 02:21:13,322
We have an update also by Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent, Student Opportunity Act.

429
02:21:13,342 --> 02:21:15,983
Good evening.

430
02:21:16,103 --> 02:21:20,646
This was a report that we originally hoped to get a vote for you on April.

431
02:21:21,673 --> 02:21:31,440
sorry, on April 29th, but due to budgets and other presentations and stuff, the proverbial can was kicked.

432
02:21:32,101 --> 02:21:36,944
So I'm presenting here tonight on our Student Opportunity Act submission.

433
02:21:39,875 --> 02:21:49,446
We receive student opportunity act was first conceived to really rectify funding disparities for districts across the Commonwealth.

434
02:21:50,487 --> 02:21:52,689
Who you know typically urban.

435
02:21:54,011 --> 02:22:00,278
Typically underserved receive significant funding this Medford as part of our.

436
02:22:00,458 --> 02:22:11,204
our chapter 70 money, so this is all now rolled into our chapter 70 money, receives approximately an additional $135,000 based on the governor's allotment this year.

437
02:22:11,645 --> 02:22:16,147
We may be receiving more based on the House and the Senate.

438
02:22:16,768 --> 02:22:17,408
That's a may.

439
02:22:18,268 --> 02:22:19,469
We anticipate that we will.

440
02:22:19,849 --> 02:22:23,411
However, these are numbers that we've already really accounted for.

441
02:22:23,492 --> 02:22:24,152
This is not

442
02:22:24,887 --> 02:22:33,032
in addition to we're not getting an additional check or anything along those lines, but then there are certain requirements that we have to do as part of the plan.

443
02:22:34,553 --> 02:22:37,455
So this is our report.

444
02:22:37,535 --> 02:22:50,424
So three key priorities, continued development of a robust early literacy program for grades K to five in all four of our elementary schools, a commitment to early literacy screening,

445
02:22:51,224 --> 02:23:08,860
in grades K through 3 with continued monitoring throughout middle school and refined the Medford High School Saturday Acceleration Academy program that began in January 2024 to provide targeted support to identified high school students and rising ninth graders.

446
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:13,264
So identified eighth graders that are rising to ninth grade as well.

447
02:23:14,445 --> 02:23:16,887
So the investments that we're planning and again

448
02:23:18,021 --> 02:23:18,742
only $135,000 a year approximately.

449
02:23:18,762 --> 02:23:25,706
But these investments will come out to about $720,000 over the next three years, $165,000 for early literacy screening and support, $435,000 for comprehensive support for early literacy programming, and really intense

450
02:23:40,436 --> 02:23:46,282
in-kind professional development, $120,000 for Saturday Acceleration Academy.

451
02:23:47,243 --> 02:24:03,179
And so this is directly taken from our application that I provided to you, that the district is committed to these initiatives despite significant financial challenges on the horizon that nominal support from the Student Opportunity Act will ameliorate to a certain degree.

452
02:24:03,820 --> 02:24:14,195
Basically, we are picking up the lion's share with local money to really support this because the Student Opportunity Act doesn't really deliver a whole lot to the students of Medford.

453
02:24:16,463 --> 02:24:27,171
So one thing though that under the new Student Opportunity Act pieces that they've put in the last year, year and a half, is to really try to figure out how we're gonna measure family engagement.

454
02:24:27,711 --> 02:24:30,894
This is something that we and most districts are struggling with.

455
02:24:31,014 --> 02:24:33,856
We are trying to really engage families.

456
02:24:34,396 --> 02:24:39,040
Recently, we had about 60 families, 60 individuals sign up for an event that Ms.

457
02:24:39,060 --> 02:24:41,782
Shulman put on, we had 16 actually show up.

458
02:24:43,143 --> 02:24:43,363
So,

459
02:24:44,324 --> 02:24:49,068
just some of the challenges that we face, but we're going to review metrics from our mass communication system.

460
02:24:49,648 --> 02:24:51,970
We're going to deploy surveys as needed to families.

461
02:24:52,690 --> 02:24:59,695
Uh, we're going to monitor school site count, and that'll be a panorama survey that we're working on with the high school and hopefully get down to the other schools as well.

462
02:25:00,156 --> 02:25:12,525
We'll monitor school site council compositions to include family representatives of our targeted groups, um, review data from talking points, uh, explore and deploy further rounds, future round tables,

463
02:25:12,985 --> 02:25:14,166
for families and caregiver.

464
02:25:14,186 --> 02:25:19,928
We've had some success with those at the height of the pandemic, less success with those as we came out of the pandemic.

465
02:25:21,129 --> 02:25:28,713
So the school leadership respectfully requests a vote of the Medford School Committee to approve the plan that you have in front of you.

466
02:25:28,873 --> 02:25:29,973
I gave you the brief right now.

467
02:25:30,934 --> 02:25:37,477
And for me to also amend the date to June 3rd, 2024, as opposed to the April 29th in your packet.

468
02:25:39,637 --> 02:25:40,798
Motion to approve the plan.

469
02:25:41,538 --> 02:25:44,579
Motion to approve the plan by Member Graham, seconded by?

470
02:25:44,599 --> 02:25:45,780
Second.

471
02:25:46,300 --> 02:25:47,821
Member Olopade, all those in favor?

472
02:25:47,841 --> 02:25:49,121
Aye.

473
02:25:49,241 --> 02:25:49,741
Opposed?

474
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:50,842
Motion passes.

475
02:25:51,482 --> 02:25:52,282
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

476
02:25:52,442 --> 02:25:52,783
Thank you.

477
02:25:54,083 --> 02:25:55,904
We have no presentations of the

478
02:25:56,988 --> 02:25:58,769
public, but we do have continued business.

479
02:25:59,109 --> 02:26:09,136
We have MSBA slash MCH SBA update table from May 20th, 2024 presented by Member Graham, School Building Committee meeting, May 13th, 2024.

480
02:26:09,297 --> 02:26:09,617
Member Graham.

481
02:26:09,697 --> 02:26:09,937
Thank you.

482
02:26:12,919 --> 02:26:14,279
Just a few brief updates.

483
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:18,360
There are five deliverables in the eligibility phase.

484
02:26:18,480 --> 02:26:21,341
Two of the five have been submitted to MSBA already.

485
02:26:22,861 --> 02:26:25,202
The remaining three are on track.

486
02:26:26,402 --> 02:26:37,265
I am anticipating that in our meeting tomorrow night the chapter 74 eligibility form will be finalized and approved by the committee and they will do a first draft review of our

487
02:26:38,445 --> 02:26:42,789
our educational profile where we will look at that before June is out.

488
02:26:42,889 --> 02:26:51,215
So we are sort of pushing hard to make sure that we are getting all of our deliverables in just as quickly as we possibly can.

489
02:26:51,235 --> 02:27:01,023
I'm working with the mayor and the president of the council to make sure that the right votes get taken to fund the feasibility study, which will rely on free cash.

490
02:27:01,103 --> 02:27:05,667
So all of that also just to happen here in the month of June in some capacity.

491
02:27:07,628 --> 02:27:14,333
In terms of some of the work the committee has been doing, we have established two subcommittees so far.

492
02:27:14,894 --> 02:27:18,556
One is about communications and community engagement, actually three subcommittees.

493
02:27:19,277 --> 02:27:33,907
Communications and community engagement has built a plan that includes some surveying that we'll do in the short term to ask the community sort of what their questions are so that the website can attempt to answer some of those questions proactively.

494
02:27:34,982 --> 02:27:40,225
We also have talked about a strategy of how to start to include the community in the conversation.

495
02:27:41,106 --> 02:27:45,048
It's a little bit of a boring conversation right now because it's a lot of paperwork.

496
02:27:45,648 --> 02:27:53,492
But once we sort of move into the next phases, we're actually talking about things like feasibility study and envisioning what a new building could look like.

497
02:27:53,552 --> 02:27:56,214
That'll be a sort of a completely different scenario.

498
02:27:57,294 --> 02:28:09,461
So we have a plan that includes things like being at tables at community events and having a pitch deck for lack of a better term that we can use to go talk to all the boards and commissions who might be interested.

499
02:28:10,041 --> 02:28:14,904
So we have some like upfront planning and survey work happening really over the course of the summer.

500
02:28:15,504 --> 02:28:21,907
And then, you know, sort of really just using this time to set the stage for good proactive communication.

501
02:28:23,735 --> 02:28:26,197
We also had a rules and onboarding subcommittee meet.

502
02:28:26,697 --> 02:28:49,072
We have established and passed our operating rules, which are very similar to what they are here in terms of using Robert's Rules of Order and trying to take a more, actually a less formal tone than we do even here, but outlining the same rules of public participation that we use here so that we can make sure that our meetings can remain productive.

503
02:28:50,591 --> 02:29:09,867
And, you know, overall, have established a path for what happens when we need to onboard new people so we have sort of plans in place for all of that so that somebody coming on board can get up to speed quickly if that becomes necessary which over the life of us five to seven year project it's inevitable.

504
02:29:11,618 --> 02:29:31,629
The website, the dedicated website is just about complete in its draft form and it will include bios of all the folks that are on the committee, it will include all of our minutes and all of our agendas and all the documents that we have talked about so far, submitted documents, that kind of thing.

505
02:29:32,733 --> 02:29:35,135
And then just other helpful links, FAQs, et cetera.

506
02:29:35,195 --> 02:29:38,800
So all of that is about done and ready to be launched.

507
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:49,573
But our anticipation is that there won't be a lot of traction for that until we get into the feasibility study phase, which is just a little ways down the road for us.

508
02:29:51,630 --> 02:29:53,532
Again, we have to be done by January 27.

509
02:29:53,652 --> 02:29:57,915
We're on track to be done far sooner than that.

510
02:29:59,577 --> 02:30:05,262
And the sooner that we're done, the sooner we can get in the queue to go to the board meeting, which happens every other month.

511
02:30:06,402 --> 02:30:10,426
And then the sooner that we can move on to those next phases.

512
02:30:11,104 --> 02:30:24,658
We also had a finance subcommittee meeting, where we talked with Alicia hunt who's our director of planning and sustain a development and sustainability is that right okay.

513
02:30:24,738 --> 02:30:28,482
And she was immensely helpful there's been a lot of questions around.

514
02:30:29,705 --> 02:30:36,649
the site of the new high school and whether there are other possibilities besides where Medford High is right now.

515
02:30:36,669 --> 02:30:46,755
And she went through, she pulled up a map and went through what those options might be in terms of sort of things that she would be thinking about.

516
02:30:47,315 --> 02:30:50,377
We don't need that information just yet, but at some point we will.

517
02:30:50,437 --> 02:30:57,021
So, you know, for example, like people have asked about Playstead Park as a potential site.

518
02:30:57,061 --> 02:30:58,702
I think that has been noted before.

519
02:30:59,341 --> 02:31:13,891
She actually said that's sort of not on her hit parade of places to look, namely because we would be burying the high school further into a corner of the city that is the wealthiest corner of the city.

520
02:31:14,832 --> 02:31:21,677
So we'd be sort of advantaging students already who generally have lots of advantage in terms of getting to the high school.

521
02:31:21,737 --> 02:31:26,300
And then, you know, there's sort of a whole bunch of transportation concerns with that location as well.

522
02:31:27,739 --> 02:31:42,010
HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): She did cite Tufts Park is maybe someplace to think about because even though it is also sort of in a corner of the city, which is its own HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): Challenge from a transportation perspective, her thought was like it is in a corner of the city that

523
02:31:42,349 --> 02:31:48,173
would actually advantage students who are historically disadvantaged in terms of their ability to get back and forth.

524
02:31:49,534 --> 02:31:57,599
She also said that, you know, her planner heart says she would love to see Medford High back in the middle of the city, just like it used to be one day long ago.

525
02:31:57,999 --> 02:32:09,647
And so that's sort of also a conversation we talked about, like the complex over at Hormel, and sort of ruled that out for the most part, because it would be too congested with

526
02:32:10,208 --> 02:32:13,691
elementary, middle, and high school all sort of having to convene in the same place.

527
02:32:14,491 --> 02:32:16,213
So we had a really, really good discussion.

528
02:32:16,713 --> 02:32:28,002
We also talked with Fiona Maxwell, who's our purchasing official for the city, and she's certified and meets requirements by MSBA, and she is starting to work on collecting

529
02:32:29,543 --> 02:32:35,427
model documents for bringing on our owners project manager, which will be our next our next phase.

530
02:32:36,047 --> 02:32:44,973
And we talked about, again, an aggressive goal that on the day where they approve us to go into the owners project manager selection phase that our fee goes out the door that same day.

531
02:32:44,993 --> 02:32:48,275
And so that's going to take some advanced work and planning.

532
02:32:48,335 --> 02:32:52,678
And so she is starting to talk to the local communities around us who have done this before.

533
02:32:53,138 --> 02:32:54,779
to start to pull some of those things together.

534
02:32:54,839 --> 02:33:08,363
So everybody's like really eager to get past this phase, which is exciting and has been helpful and collaborative all throughout the process.

535
02:33:08,403 --> 02:33:09,423
So it is a big committee.

536
02:33:09,683 --> 02:33:11,424
Everything is going great so far.

537
02:33:11,464 --> 02:33:13,604
We've had great attendance and great participation.

538
02:33:13,624 --> 02:33:19,606
And there's just like a lot of sort of legwork to do between now and say the fall.

539
02:33:19,666 --> 02:33:21,507
So we'll continue to sort of work through that

540
02:33:21,887 --> 02:33:23,108
We have a meeting tomorrow night.

541
02:33:23,929 --> 02:33:26,911
Our meetings are in the bistro so people are welcome to join us in person.

542
02:33:27,592 --> 02:33:28,492
They are on zoom.

543
02:33:28,793 --> 02:33:30,534
We've not seen a lot of traction yet.

544
02:33:31,635 --> 02:33:32,315
It is June.

545
02:33:34,497 --> 02:33:38,020
There are a few million things happening at the same time so I'm not surprised but

546
02:33:38,974 --> 02:33:53,213
I also think the time for that participation is going to be once we get into the feasibility study where we're hiring a designer who's actually engaging with us to say, tell us, tell us what you want this place to look like and what you want it to be and what you want to be able to do in the space.

547
02:33:54,212 --> 02:34:03,338
much like what we talked about with McGlynn, like how do you really thoughtfully design like every last nook and cranny of a building so it both serves a need and provides some flexibility.

548
02:34:03,398 --> 02:34:14,124
So all of that's like sort of down the line and that's where really we'll be talking to, you know, to teachers, to staff, to students, to the community and all of that good stuff.

549
02:34:14,144 --> 02:34:15,725
So all that's very much to come.

550
02:34:16,526 --> 02:34:22,249
So that's just a quick update of what we're doing, but we do have a pretty robust communication plan

551
02:34:23,806 --> 02:34:27,008
getting underway, and everyone's excited.

552
02:34:28,809 --> 02:34:30,009
I'm happy to take any questions.

553
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:30,950
Thank you.

554
02:34:31,530 --> 02:34:32,050
Member Rousseau?

555
02:34:32,711 --> 02:34:33,131
Thank you.

556
02:34:34,792 --> 02:34:42,096
I have no questions other than, is there actually a bet whether we can be the fastest at this project in the history of the state?

557
02:34:42,196 --> 02:34:50,561
Because I mean, we had documents done before we begun, which has to be unusual.

558
02:34:50,741 --> 02:34:52,121
So I'm excited by

559
02:34:54,254 --> 02:35:04,727
Vice Chair Graham's ability to keep the gas pedal accelerator, excuse me, pressed to the floor in a way that amazes me.

560
02:35:05,348 --> 02:35:08,412
And I feel like nobody's getting run over, which is also kind of impressive.

561
02:35:08,432 --> 02:35:12,297
So I wanted to thank you for that because every time I come to a meeting, I can't believe

562
02:35:13,137 --> 02:35:14,998
We're done with that document already?

563
02:35:16,679 --> 02:35:25,123
We are less, we are, what, 30 days into, we have 172 days, I think?

564
02:35:25,323 --> 02:35:29,605
Yeah, so we're doing good, but I'm excited, thank you.

565
02:35:32,446 --> 02:35:34,587
Thank you, thank you, Member Graham.

566
02:35:37,148 --> 02:35:39,289
We have new business offered by Member Russo, 2024-28,

567
02:35:41,394 --> 02:35:43,576
budget preparation schedule.

568
02:35:44,116 --> 02:35:45,397
Motion to waive this reading.

569
02:35:48,459 --> 02:35:48,759
Second.

570
02:35:48,979 --> 02:35:51,961
Will this be going into committee or?

571
02:35:52,021 --> 02:35:52,181
No.

572
02:35:53,662 --> 02:35:54,503
I want to vote tonight.

573
02:35:54,983 --> 02:35:55,704
For first reading.

574
02:35:56,124 --> 02:36:00,707
So I would ask to withdraw that motion to waive the reading.

575
02:36:01,968 --> 02:36:02,549
If you don't mind.

576
02:36:03,169 --> 02:36:03,329
Sure.

577
02:36:03,349 --> 02:36:05,150
I've just it's a lot of text.

578
02:36:05,210 --> 02:36:05,611
I'm wondering.

579
02:36:05,691 --> 02:36:05,931
I know.

580
02:36:06,071 --> 02:36:06,271
Yes.

581
02:36:06,391 --> 02:36:06,571
Okay.

582
02:36:10,492 --> 02:36:21,134
budget purpose, I do believe me, I'd rather not have to read it all, but I feel like it would have to, and it's up to you, I don't care, I don't mind, I just think it should be read.

583
02:36:21,434 --> 02:36:22,315
Yeah, I'll read it.

584
02:36:22,935 --> 02:36:26,816
Let's see if I find any typos or anything as I go through.

585
02:36:26,836 --> 02:36:27,996
All right, this is,

586
02:36:34,888 --> 02:36:38,169
Policy DBC, which is really hard to say.

587
02:36:38,629 --> 02:36:40,010
Budget preparation and schedule.

588
02:36:40,110 --> 02:36:44,391
Preparation of the annual budget will be scheduled in phases with attention to specific deadlines.

589
02:36:44,491 --> 02:37:01,557
This policy aims to increase transparency into how the public school's budget is developed to ensure the school committee is appropriately involved in budget development and to increase public participation and understanding of how their tax dollars are spent educating the children of our great city.

590
02:37:02,654 --> 02:37:06,857
Phase one, planning, target dates of October 1 to December 15th.

591
02:37:08,479 --> 02:37:14,464
One, enrollment projections, staffing, current and required, recommended policy changes.

592
02:37:14,964 --> 02:37:25,513
Three, expenditure projections of the costs of this year's operation at next year's estimated prices, adjusted for enrollment changes and other cost information.

593
02:37:26,334 --> 02:37:31,178
Four, revenue projections, including best estimates of federal, state, and grant funds.

594
02:37:32,898 --> 02:37:40,823
Five, facilities information, especially projected surpluses and deficits in classroom space and future needs for repairs.

595
02:37:41,483 --> 02:37:47,827
Six, cost effectiveness and other special studies of designated programs, activities, and policies.

596
02:37:48,527 --> 02:37:54,050
Seven, draft of the basic school allocation rates and factors and other proposed changes.

597
02:37:54,571 --> 02:37:58,233
Phase two, budget request formulation.

598
02:37:58,493 --> 02:38:00,814
Target dates of December 15th to February 1st.

599
02:38:01,874 --> 02:38:05,779
Within the framework outlined in phase one, the budget is formulated as follows.

600
02:38:06,941 --> 02:38:14,931
One, issue budget manual for next fiscal year, procedures and forms, including school allocation and factors, and conduct orientation.

601
02:38:16,331 --> 02:38:21,934
Two, principals discuss budget needs with school councils and provide feedback to the superintendent.

602
02:38:22,434 --> 02:38:29,617
Three, conduct school committee of the whole meetings with public input to discuss priorities and possible initiatives.

603
02:38:30,578 --> 02:38:35,300
Four, conduct administrative review of budget requests including discussion with principals.

604
02:38:36,641 --> 02:38:41,603
Five, inclusion of net school spending eligible portions of the capital improvement plan.

605
02:38:43,081 --> 02:38:46,743
Six, develop the proposed budget for the member public schools.

606
02:38:47,543 --> 02:38:50,805

613
02:39:39,787 --> 02:39:48,755
Phase five, proposed reconciled budget developed in response to the proposed projected municipal allocation.

614
02:39:48,775 --> 02:39:49,355
Excuse me.

615
02:39:49,816 --> 02:39:51,938
Target date of March 1 through May 1.

616
02:39:53,834 --> 02:40:02,096
The proposed reconciled budget, including all required cuts to meet the projected municipal allocation is presented to the school committee for review and public testimony.

617
02:40:02,796 --> 02:40:15,419

B, the proposed reconciled budget reflecting cuts required to meet the proposed reconciled budget

619
02:40:23,959 --> 02:40:33,705
Hmm, that should actually say projected municipal allocation, sorry, will be made available to the school committee and the public.

620
02:40:34,666 --> 02:40:44,172
C, if the proposed municipal allocation is more than 1% less than the budget request, a public hearing will be scheduled pursuant to Mass General Law Chapter 17, Section 38N.

621
02:40:45,513 --> 02:40:48,655

625
02:41:06,304 --> 02:41:10,845
Three, a cover letter written by the school committee will be included with the above name documents.

626
02:41:12,665 --> 02:41:15,006
Phase seven, city council review and approval.

627
02:41:15,386 --> 02:41:17,706
Target date, May 15th through June 30.

628
02:41:18,147 --> 02:41:19,367
Let's hope it's never that late.

629
02:41:20,407 --> 02:41:35,282
The city council approves the municipal budget with the final allocation for member public met for public schools, one review and approval by the city council phase eight school committee of review and approval of final budget target date June one through June 30.

630
02:41:36,863 --> 02:41:39,805
The school committee finalizes a budget for the upcoming fiscal year.

631
02:41:40,365 --> 02:41:43,546
One, the municipal allocation received from the city council.

632
02:41:44,367 --> 02:41:50,730
If the municipal allocation is the same as the budget request, the school committee will meet to provide approval for the final budget.

633
02:41:52,151 --> 02:42:01,536
Three, if the municipal allocation is less than the budget request, A, the superintendent will provide any updates to the proposed reconciled budget presented in phase five.

634
02:42:02,645 --> 02:42:10,911
B, the updated proposed reconciled budget reflecting the recommended cuts will be made available to the school committee and the public.

635
02:42:12,011 --> 02:42:21,338
C, if the municipal allocation is more than 1% less than the budget request, a public hearing will be scheduled pursuant to Mass General Law chapter 17, section 38N.

636
02:42:23,139 --> 02:42:29,543
D, if a public hearing is required, a regular or special school committee meeting will be scheduled no less than five days

637
02:42:30,595 --> 02:42:36,080
five business days after the public hearing to approve the proposed reconciled budget.

638
02:42:37,141 --> 02:42:44,287
E, if a public hearing is not required, a regular or special school committee meeting will be scheduled to approve the proposed reconciled budget.

639
02:42:45,287 --> 02:42:49,331
And then four, the final budget will be posted to the Medford Public Schools website.

640
02:42:50,212 --> 02:42:51,212
There's a few definitions.

641
02:42:51,252 --> 02:42:52,954
Motion to waive the definitions reading.

642
02:42:58,115 --> 02:43:03,517
Motion to waive the definitions by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Graham.

643
02:43:03,697 --> 02:43:04,377
All those in favor?

644
02:43:04,877 --> 02:43:05,398
Aye.

645
02:43:05,438 --> 02:43:05,818
Opposed?

646
02:43:05,838 --> 02:43:07,178
Definition section is waived.

647
02:43:07,578 --> 02:43:20,083
Budget requests, capital improvement plan, capital improvement projects, capital budget, final budget, municipal allocation, med school spending, projected municipal allocation, and proposed reconciled budget were the definitions.

648
02:43:21,683 --> 02:43:22,424
Thank you, Member Rousseau.

649
02:43:23,797 --> 02:43:45,077
HAB-Masyn Moyer): From the chair, if I may, I just want to see if the superintendent can comment on whether or not the central administration yourself and CFO especially have reviewed this and have been able to HAB-Masyn Moyer): Implement comment on it, as I know it's pretty lengthy and I want to make sure that this is feasible.

650
02:43:45,097 --> 02:43:46,018
Okay.

651
02:43:48,390 --> 02:43:48,730
Member Rizzo.

652
02:43:48,750 --> 02:43:50,312
Can I just speak on it real quick first?

653
02:43:50,993 --> 02:43:59,061
So, most of this is actually stuff we already do, especially the budget preparation stuff and the planning.

654
02:43:59,642 --> 02:44:08,411
And, you know, those are sections that are for the administration, so obviously any changes, additions, subtractions that they would like.

655
02:44:09,355 --> 02:44:13,197
I obviously I think we would be happy to consider those changes.

656
02:44:14,258 --> 02:44:29,786
The dates are were difficult, because the city council passed the budget ordinance that says on March 1, that the mayor's office will tell the school district, or I don't know if it tells city council or the school district, what the.

657
02:44:31,547 --> 02:44:34,049
potential allocation will be.

658
02:44:34,550 --> 02:44:40,875
So we had to really, the dates on this really had to be planned around that date.

659
02:44:41,176 --> 02:44:45,980
I mean, to pretend we don't get a number when we get a number doesn't make any sense.

660
02:44:46,500 --> 02:44:52,125
So that's why a lot of this stuff is sort of backed up and that March 1 date is so important in this.

661
02:44:53,687 --> 02:44:58,111
And then, you know, one of the things in this current budget cycle that I think

662
02:44:59,537 --> 02:45:08,652
I don't know if everybody agrees, but I certainly think many people in the community would want to know is like when we had our presentation of the budget last

663
02:45:10,427 --> 02:45:17,830
time or the time before, and we we cut 2.2 million and still had 2.7 million left to figure out how to cut.

664
02:45:18,671 --> 02:45:31,797
And I understand why we did that, because, like, it was probably very hard to even wrap our heads around where we would make those cuts, but it's June, and if we still had to make those cuts.

665
02:45:32,717 --> 02:45:43,659
that's not a lot of time for the community to respond, for us to respond, for staff to be like, all right, we've just decided we're laying off another 50 people, they got families and mortgages.

666
02:45:44,139 --> 02:45:57,842
And so I felt it was really important that when we get an allocation, a projected allocation, that we take it completely seriously, and that we have a document that says, if that's our number, here is how we'll get there.

667
02:45:59,790 --> 02:46:12,617
We still don't have that now and I understand why and I, I actually support that, because this gap was so phenomenally large, but in a normal year even if there's a gap, we need to be able to say.

668
02:46:13,598 --> 02:46:21,745
This is how we're going to do it now we aren't going to put names and say these people are getting laid off all the way back in February that would or March that would make no sense.

669
02:46:22,265 --> 02:46:34,636
But, you know, how are we going to get from what we need to what we think we may get the public should know that we should know that, and not a few weeks before schools out.

670
02:46:35,296 --> 02:46:36,197
So that was sort of my.

671
02:46:37,819 --> 02:46:46,045
my point in all that and then also telling the city council I mean the city council has traditionally received our budget book that we get.

672
02:46:46,065 --> 02:46:55,012
And that's, that's the, that's the recommended budget from the school committee that's not what will actually happen.

673
02:46:55,612 --> 02:47:00,536
And I think that if we have the budget request, which is that this is what we would like.

674
02:47:02,463 --> 02:47:06,487
If we only get that projected allocation, this is what it will look like.

675
02:47:07,047 --> 02:47:09,309
And a letter that says, here's how we did it.

676
02:47:10,550 --> 02:47:17,276
And no we don't like it, but I think that they need that for their deliberations because I know the superintendent was in the hot seat.

677
02:47:18,017 --> 02:47:21,560
And, you know, it's too big of a.

678
02:47:22,779 --> 02:47:31,611
The budget is too big to just drill you for an hour or two even, and think that that's enough, that's that's not.

679
02:47:32,131 --> 02:47:39,341
It's just too much for the city council to actually take all that in, and to get to all their questions really.

680
02:47:42,418 --> 02:47:53,817
There is this other thing in here of having the budget hearing, possibly up to three times, and that is to say, if we are really going to have to make cuts.

681
02:47:55,831 --> 02:48:00,897
that are bigger than I just picked 1% because I looked at the math and thought that's, that's still a lot.

682
02:48:02,119 --> 02:48:13,873
If we have to cut 1% or more than the public should be able to have a say, just like with the regular budget hearing, which is why we have to have the budget hearing so that the public can say what they think about it.

683
02:48:15,254 --> 02:48:18,957
And so that's the overview of this.

684
02:48:19,358 --> 02:48:27,364
And I apologize for it being so long and wordy, but I just felt like I couldn't, this is shorter than it was, but thank you.

685
02:48:27,384 --> 02:48:29,486
Thank you members.

686
02:48:29,546 --> 02:48:38,434
So Dr. Edward-Vincenino, if you don't have comment, just do you think there is time needed to discuss it with Central and our CFO?

687
02:48:41,596 --> 02:48:41,756
I mean,

688
02:48:45,348 --> 02:48:53,244
I appreciate that it's mapped out the way that it is mapped out I just was looking at between phase one and phase two.

689
02:48:57,648 --> 02:49:04,956
Phase one, October one is when we have our first enrollment projections that are submitted to DC.

690
02:49:05,837 --> 02:49:12,044
So it, it definitely is a very early start, knowing that like September to October.

691
02:49:14,426 --> 02:49:16,489
I would love to be able to.

692
02:49:20,151 --> 02:49:28,674
for phase one and phase two where this, the work is mapped out, I would love to be able to just kind of unpack the timing of some of it.

693
02:49:29,875 --> 02:49:35,657
I understand the March one target date, like how you were backwards mapping.

694
02:49:36,097 --> 02:49:44,700
I'm just wondering if from October one to December 15th, with the start of school, will that give us

695
02:49:46,616 --> 02:49:55,659
you know, just for my own learning curve, honestly, that I would be starting the budget process in October and thinking about just the start of the school year and pushing it forward.

696
02:49:56,620 --> 02:50:03,462
If I could at least try to unpack the timetables for phase one and phase two, not what's listed within it.

697
02:50:05,483 --> 02:50:11,625
I am completely, you know, in support of the pieces that are listed within it.

698
02:50:12,085 --> 02:50:13,166
I'm just trying to think of,

699
02:50:14,346 --> 02:50:27,856
realistically with like the team, would they be able to get every every single piece done during that October, October one where we're still, you know, monitoring some pieces?

700
02:50:28,536 --> 02:50:28,816
Mayor?

701
02:50:29,737 --> 02:50:30,417
Member Rousseau?

702
02:50:30,798 --> 02:50:31,658
Um, you know, it is

703
02:50:33,937 --> 02:50:40,322
Phase one and phase two, frankly, are the superintendent's office, and they could have just been called phase one.

704
02:50:41,403 --> 02:50:45,927
So, those dates, you know, between October one and February one.

705
02:50:46,648 --> 02:50:56,696
Honestly, I don't, I don't think anybody cares where and how you have to switch that around so you know the December thing really bothered me when I was doing it because I'm like,

706
02:50:58,320 --> 02:51:04,042
It's like December 31st, well, like it's the holidays or winter break or whatever you call it.

707
02:51:04,282 --> 02:51:07,383
And I know that that wasn't a lot of time.

708
02:51:07,923 --> 02:51:17,466
So certainly if you wanna move the dates around or move things in phase one and two around, I think that's fine.

709
02:51:17,986 --> 02:51:25,369
Some of this language I did get from Cambridge Public Schools, which frankly, they were the only school system I could find that had anything.

710
02:51:27,944 --> 02:51:34,589
Everybody had the same block paragraph that we all inherit from MASC, which essentially says, we'll do a budget.

711
02:51:35,790 --> 02:51:36,311
Gee, thanks.

712
02:51:37,752 --> 02:51:53,004
So yeah, so definitely that stuff feels very much squishy and whatever you recommend for changes, I'm sure we would be fine with, or I would be fine with, I can't speak for the committee, but that's how those came about.

713
02:51:54,285 --> 02:51:54,786
Member Graham?

714
02:51:55,606 --> 02:51:56,026
Thank you.

715
02:51:58,267 --> 02:52:20,799
You know, one of the things that I feel like we have seen, and we see it happen in different ways every year, but certainly we're seeing it this year, is like, you know, we get to the point where we're like talking about the budget with the community, and all of a sudden, what we're asking for and what we think we're going to get all gets like mushed together and people get really confused.

716
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:25,662
What when I think about being led by a strategic plan.

717
02:52:25,682 --> 02:52:42,332
I think that means like somebody sitting down at some point in time and saying, in order to make progress strategically on whatever our objectives are like here's what we need to do next year and then you have to sort of let reality like play play its course and and you adjust from there.

718
02:52:43,072 --> 02:52:55,828
But we've not yet ever really gotten to a point where like that, what do we need to do the things that we're setting out to do is not muddied by some financial reality.

719
02:52:55,848 --> 02:53:00,073
And I think it's a disservice to the community because I think people

720
02:53:00,593 --> 02:53:03,935
have questions about, are we doing strategic thinking?

721
02:53:04,195 --> 02:53:11,459
Are we doing things that, you know, improve the arts programming across the district from, you know, K to 12?

722
02:53:11,859 --> 02:53:21,104
Like nobody sees that work because it gets sort of buried under everything that happens when you start talking about the reality.

723
02:53:21,204 --> 02:53:21,364
So,

724
02:53:22,304 --> 02:53:23,725
Um, I think it's important.

725
02:53:23,745 --> 02:53:29,189
We've, we've sort of bifurcated these two things, but it's still very, it's so tight and close together.

726
02:53:29,269 --> 02:53:30,110
It's still quite muddy.

727
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:40,437
Um, and I would also say that we are unusual in that we are in June and still talking about a budget that does not happen across the state.

728
02:53:40,857 --> 02:53:45,620
People are passing school committee budgets in January, and they're feeling like they're behind.

729
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:48,762
Like there are communities that pass budgets before January.

730
02:53:48,802 --> 02:53:51,424
Like none of this is unusual.

731
02:53:52,102 --> 02:53:55,623
in terms of sort of endeavoring to have a better process.

732
02:53:55,664 --> 02:54:14,151
And I feel like maybe those communities have figured out that like the gauntlet of May and June is just not the time to be also hashing out like the, whether you're gonna have enough paper next year, like all of the things that sort of converge in May and June, like we need to start to offload some of that stuff.

733
02:54:14,231 --> 02:54:18,133
It's just like an unsustainable amount of

734
02:54:18,971 --> 02:54:26,432
activity that has to happen during that time, both for the superintendent, for all of Medford Public Schools, for this body, for everybody.

735
02:54:26,532 --> 02:54:45,036
So I think there's a way for us to sort of be thoughtful and strategic and do our part and do so in a little bit more of a pathway when we can take advantage of what are historically like generally sort of light meetings in January and February and March to really hash out

736
02:54:45,810 --> 02:54:48,593
the strategic details and then we're sort of on our way.

737
02:54:48,733 --> 02:54:50,595
So I like the timeline.

738
02:54:50,615 --> 02:54:56,861
I have been pushing to do things sooner earlier since I started on the committee.

739
02:54:57,482 --> 02:54:58,583
And we're not there yet.

740
02:54:58,683 --> 02:55:00,685
Like and even here, here we are, it's June.

741
02:55:01,145 --> 02:55:03,227
And I was like, it's earlier than ever before.

742
02:55:03,428 --> 02:55:04,869
And it's here, it's still June.

743
02:55:05,249 --> 02:55:06,851
We're still talking about this in June.

744
02:55:07,592 --> 02:55:07,732
And

745
02:55:08,834 --> 02:55:24,108
people don't have clarity about like what exactly is happening and what that means and to some degree that will always be the case because we are dependent on the mayor putting out her budget, she has work to do to do that that has nothing to do with us, and the council has to agree to all of it.

746
02:55:24,892 --> 02:55:30,394
There, there are still those things that are going to push us to having budget discussions in June, which is fine.

747
02:55:30,894 --> 02:55:42,397
I just think we should have less of budget discussions in June and more budget discussions earlier in the cycle so that we are not part of like what the ultimate

748
02:55:43,478 --> 02:55:45,760
sort of June rush looks like, right?

749
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:51,164
So I think we have an opportunity to try this and if it doesn't work, we can revisit it.

750
02:55:51,925 --> 02:56:07,617
So I'm in full support and would make a motion to approve it with that one amendment of talking about the municipal allocation instead of the proposed reconciled budget in phase five, item 1B.

751
02:56:10,279 --> 02:56:12,001
Motion by member Graham as amended.

752
02:56:13,524 --> 02:56:15,625
have another minor text.

753
02:56:16,265 --> 02:56:36,850
I think it was in section eight, part D. I can just send this to you, but to move that phrase to approve the proposed reconciled budget to after meeting, so special school committee meeting to approve the proposed reconciled budget will be scheduled no less than five business days.

754
02:56:37,751 --> 02:56:42,812
You stumbled over it when reading it the same way that I stumbled over it at home.

755
02:56:45,303 --> 02:56:47,405
And I did have a question on this.

756
02:56:49,106 --> 02:56:53,849
So you talk in phase two about discussing the budget needs with the principals.

757
02:56:53,949 --> 02:57:02,155
I was wondering about the department heads and potentially that's part of the presentations we get regularly from the departments.

758
02:57:03,539 --> 02:57:07,182
I don't know if that's part of the budget process, or if it's part of the updates.

759
02:57:07,222 --> 02:57:11,446
This is what we've been doing, this is where we are, and this is what we anticipate needing for next year.

760
02:57:11,486 --> 02:57:21,716
So build some of that strategic planning into those updates that we're already getting, or if not, make sure it's in the process of crafting the budget.

761
02:57:21,836 --> 02:57:25,759
I think one of the big questions that people have had, that I've seen from people is,

762
02:57:28,737 --> 02:57:31,219
who exactly, how are we getting these numbers?

763
02:57:31,279 --> 02:57:36,182
Why are we, what is the plan for this department and that department and what are their needs?

764
02:57:36,262 --> 02:57:46,829
And I know it's allocated by school and the principals are really important, but thinking about the departments and giving us a better sense of where those numbers and allocations are coming from.

765
02:57:46,849 --> 02:57:52,253
Because I think that also informs how we spend our money and what our priorities are.

766
02:57:52,754 --> 02:57:54,795
Member Russo and then Dr. Edward-Vincent.

767
02:57:55,216 --> 02:57:55,636
Thank you.

768
02:57:56,496 --> 02:58:03,718
You know, in my seven and a half years now, we've done budgets, this will be the third way that we've done them.

769
02:58:04,678 --> 02:58:16,281
And when I started, the way we did them, I mean, it was just the way I've been done, I was new, was that every department head, every principal came before the committee.

770
02:58:17,366 --> 02:58:21,468
They told us what they wanted, but of course, we're not their boss.

771
02:58:22,129 --> 02:58:23,449
The superintendent's their boss.

772
02:58:23,649 --> 02:58:31,433
So everything that they were presenting, the superintendent already had, of course, like vetted, or I assumed.

773
02:58:31,453 --> 02:58:41,359
I mean, it made no sense that we were being presented with something that the superintendent had already said, yeah, that's fine, as if we were going to somehow,

774
02:58:42,099 --> 02:58:43,540
be a decision maker at it.

775
02:58:43,720 --> 02:59:02,275
It was informational, but the biggest flaw in that was that, you know, if a department head had like a big spend, they wanted to really do something big with the department and the superintendent after talking down about how much money there was, was like, we can't do it this year, or we never hear about it.

776
02:59:02,756 --> 02:59:07,980
So, you know, if we were hearing about those things that we weren't gonna get to do,

777
02:59:09,042 --> 02:59:14,106
because we didn't have the resources in those meetings, then that could have been useful and helpful.

778
02:59:14,527 --> 02:59:18,370
So that was the first couple of years.

779
02:59:18,630 --> 02:59:28,498
And then remember Graham got on and that got turned upside down where it was, here's the list of things we would do if we had the money.

780
02:59:29,459 --> 02:59:34,804
And we did that, I think, two years and then we have this pandemic thing that happened.

781
02:59:35,768 --> 02:59:38,232
Oh, actually, no, I got my time right a little off.

782
02:59:38,332 --> 02:59:41,717
But anyways, we had a laundry list of things we would do if we could.

783
02:59:42,277 --> 02:59:44,140
And many of those things were not like

784
02:59:45,157 --> 03:00:08,758
know nice to have they were things you're like wait the public schools doesn't do that stuff like how are you operating a public school and not doing that which was sort of the whole point was to have that in black and white um and this year we haven't we sort of done it a different way because we just because we knew how big the the budget gap was so a lot of that stuff kind of fell to the ways to the side as

785
03:00:10,562 --> 03:00:13,684
We could have done it, but honestly, what was the point?

786
03:00:14,804 --> 03:00:17,505
It sort of felt like this year, like what was the point?

787
03:00:19,146 --> 03:00:23,768
So I forgot what my point was in response to your question.

788
03:00:23,869 --> 03:00:25,929
What was your question?

789
03:00:26,190 --> 03:00:36,995
My question was how do we make transparent those priorities, not just in the individual schools, but across the areas, the department areas,

790
03:00:38,801 --> 03:00:39,542
That, sorry, thank you.

791
03:00:39,922 --> 03:01:00,864
So I guess part of the problem with that type of transparency is that the, I mean, it isn't really appropriate to think department heads and principals are gonna come and essentially just ignore what their boss said and say, here's what we think that the priorities for science should be.

792
03:01:01,966 --> 03:01:07,751
And if the superintendent doesn't agree, I don't think we should hear about it because that's not transparency.

793
03:01:07,831 --> 03:01:09,933
We hire and supervise the superintendent.

794
03:01:10,613 --> 03:01:26,287
And if she believes that's not the way to do it right now, or we can't afford it, I think that's not transparent for us, but it's on the other side of a veil that is like etched in stone in the law.

795
03:01:27,047 --> 03:01:28,949
And, you know, we can,

796
03:01:32,213 --> 03:01:37,295
dig and we can, you know, throw the fishing hook in and try and pull that stuff out.

797
03:01:37,455 --> 03:01:44,278
And we will hear from the community and other folks like, you know, science, which is doing great, by the way, but I'm using it as an example.

798
03:01:45,079 --> 03:01:48,220
Science has a problem like we did before we bought FOSS.

799
03:01:49,821 --> 03:01:57,644
And maybe we can push, but I just think having, it really felt like a dog and pony show where

800
03:01:58,649 --> 03:02:02,492
department heads and the principals told us stuff.

801
03:02:02,652 --> 03:02:05,094
And every year they seem to sort of have everything they needed.

802
03:02:05,935 --> 03:02:10,218
And it was like two months of committee of the halls.

803
03:02:10,838 --> 03:02:25,450
It was like on top of school committee, two months of committee of the halls, where at the end you were just like, okay, I know what's going on, but there's no strategic anything involved because it's already been decided by the superintendent, which is appropriate.

804
03:02:26,551 --> 03:02:26,711
So,

805
03:02:27,561 --> 03:02:41,126
I understand that desire, but I also feel like getting that desire satisfied is in some ways outside of our jurisdiction, if you will, so.

806
03:02:41,706 --> 03:02:52,430
Then maybe what I'm asking is if that budget presentation can be tied more closely to the strategic plan and the direction that we're headed.

807
03:02:52,490 --> 03:02:52,850
Mayor?

808
03:02:54,071 --> 03:02:54,971
Dr. Edward-Vinson,

809
03:02:56,038 --> 03:02:58,441
was next and then I'll go to member Graham.

810
03:02:58,721 --> 03:03:05,770
So in response to your question, what I started writing down and I think you were reading my mind.

811
03:03:06,940 --> 03:03:15,183
but I wrote down alignment, aligned strategic plan, curriculum review, and I also wrote down MSBA.

812
03:03:15,964 --> 03:03:26,268
And so we did have a different way of doing the budget in previous years in agreement with what member Rousseau was saying.

813
03:03:27,208 --> 03:03:35,892
And what we found at least this particular year, how the numbers were explained and how you have to work with what you're given.

814
03:03:37,793 --> 03:03:41,619
Our priority is to truly align our resources and work smarter.

815
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:43,782
On behalf of the district.

816
03:03:44,823 --> 03:03:51,753
We do have a strategic plan that we are in the process of getting ready, ready to do the next cycle.

817
03:03:52,314 --> 03:03:52,834
However, we

818
03:03:54,296 --> 03:04:06,507
temporarily push pause in working with Member Graham and other members of the committee because of all of the work and the requirements that MSBA is asking for.

819
03:04:06,987 --> 03:04:11,772
So instead of having us, you know, in isolation, work on a strategic plan.

820
03:04:12,132 --> 03:04:20,099
And then MSBA says, we need X, Y, and Z. And it's like, oh, well, we did A, B, and C. And it's like, well, forget about that work.

821
03:04:20,697 --> 03:04:21,577
let's go do this.

822
03:04:21,737 --> 03:04:31,380
So instead of trying to do things two and three times, we're kind of trying to align the work, making sure that the work is coherent.

823
03:04:32,460 --> 03:04:36,402
And again, always keeping in mind that it's about what's going to be best for the students.

824
03:04:36,982 --> 03:04:40,243
And so I do feel that

825
03:04:41,363 --> 03:05:07,822
having everyone come up to present what their wish list is, isn't necessarily the best use of time because it may not be connected, clearly connected to our strategic plan so that if everything we do is aligned to our strategy, our strategic plan, the entire district will move forward in one direction and we will see greater results for our students and we will have a more effective

826
03:05:08,442 --> 03:05:12,283
running district and do things more efficiently.

827
03:05:12,863 --> 03:05:26,347
So I just want to say that that's the reason why there has been a pause in some areas, but it's really about gathering enough information in order to make a good decision once.

828
03:05:27,947 --> 03:05:28,287
Thank you.

829
03:05:28,307 --> 03:05:32,729
Yeah, I don't support doing the same work over and over, to be clear.

830
03:05:34,966 --> 03:05:37,667
Okay, Member Graham, and then we'll take a vote.

831
03:05:38,047 --> 03:05:42,409
Sure, I just wanted to revise my motion a little bit, and I think this might help.

832
03:05:42,529 --> 03:05:48,471
So a motion to approve this on first reading with two amendments.

833
03:05:48,831 --> 03:06:02,877
One is section five, item 1B, in that second line, it shouldn't say proposed reconciled budget, it should say proposed municipal allocation.

834
03:06:03,909 --> 03:06:17,816
And then with a second amendment in phase two, item number two, it says principals and we're going to add and department heads discuss budget needs with school councils and provide feedback to the superintendent.

835
03:06:19,057 --> 03:06:27,541
Motion for approval as amended twice by member Graham, seconded by member Reinfeldt.

836
03:06:31,294 --> 03:06:31,714
All those in favor?

837
03:06:31,734 --> 03:06:31,795
Aye.

838
03:06:32,255 --> 03:06:32,675
All those opposed?

839
03:06:32,695 --> 03:06:33,016
Motion passes.

840
03:06:33,036 --> 03:06:36,639
Our next meeting is June 10th, 2024, here at the Alden Memorial Chambers.

841
03:06:36,659 --> 03:06:38,441
That's next Monday, in addition to Zoom.

842
03:06:38,461 --> 03:06:42,104
This will be the last regular meeting of the Medford School Committee for school year 23-24.

843
03:06:42,124 --> 03:06:42,765
Is there a motion to adjourn?

844
03:06:42,785 --> 03:06:43,546
Is there a motion to adjourn?

845
03:06:43,566 --> 03:06:44,206
