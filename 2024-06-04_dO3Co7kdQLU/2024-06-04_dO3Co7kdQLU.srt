56
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:39,713

57
01:42:41,454 --> 01:42:47,359
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other thing that I would add is that we will be making updates to the existing

58
01:42:49,597 --> 01:42:55,283
[SPEAKER_06]: capital plan for the schools in time for that next cycle next year, assuming that that passes tonight.

59
01:42:55,363 --> 01:43:02,110
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can get to that later, the process, which I think was the more substantive part of our conversation later on.

71
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:46,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford kicked off its celebrations with a wonderful Pride flag raising festival at City Hall on this past Friday, which I was pleased to attend.

72
01:43:47,448 --> 01:43:49,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank our mayor, thank Ms.

73
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:56,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Frances Nwaje, the city's DEI director, the members of your team that helped to set it up.

01:43:57,115 --> 01:44:00,017
[SPEAKER_09]: It was truly an enjoyable event for all.

75
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:17,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to just let the audience know that this Saturday, students from Medford High School, GSA, will join the wider Greater Boston LGBTQIA plus community in the Boston Pride Parade.

76
01:44:18,145 --> 01:44:22,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So we wish them clear skies, lots of fun, and don't forget to wear sunblock.

77
01:44:24,067 --> 01:44:27,088

78
01:44:28,715 --> 01:44:36,002

79
01:44:37,113 --> 01:44:45,280
[SPEAKER_09]: The diversity of our community is an incredible strength, with each individual contributing their unique talents and perspectives to the whole.

80
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:58,591
[SPEAKER_09]: We also firmly believe in and defend the civil and human rights of LGBTQIA plus Mustangs and all people, particularly at a time when those rights are often under attack.

81
01:44:59,551 --> 01:45:03,975
[SPEAKER_09]: We all deserve the same chance to thrive and live freely and authentically.

82
01:45:04,475 --> 01:45:05,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Pride Month.

83
01:45:06,869 --> 01:45:17,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to share that last week, we had a wonderful Special Olympics that took place in Malden for our students with disabilities.

84
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:22,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a wonderful event students from other communities participated in that.

85
01:45:23,084 --> 01:45:39,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to thank our special educators, Miss Bowen and all the members of her team, Miss Lauren Perillo, Denise DeJardins, and many other staff, Miss Principal Michelle Kroll, who was able to attend that event last week in Malden.

86
01:45:39,132 --> 01:45:42,314
[SPEAKER_09]: It was excellent, and it was wonderful weather as well.

87
01:45:43,434 --> 01:45:54,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I also would like to say that last week we had a wonderful event, the Junior Olympics for our fifth grade students that are moving on to middle school next year.

88
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:59,164
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had some pretty bad weather last week.

89
01:45:59,704 --> 01:46:05,668
[SPEAKER_09]: So at the last minute, Tufts University was willing to let us use their Gancher Center.

90
01:46:06,528 --> 01:46:08,129
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're very grateful to that.

91
01:46:08,149 --> 01:46:08,809

01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:18,795

94
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So those were two wonderful year end events for our students.

95
01:46:32,502 --> 01:46:33,483
[SPEAKER_09]: At tonight's meeting,

96
01:46:35,183 --> 01:46:51,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward to recognizing some of our district fine art students for their notable photography accomplishments and recognizing Medford students in the annual scholastic competition that recognizes teens in grades seven through 12.

97
01:46:53,178 --> 01:46:59,701
[SPEAKER_09]: with regional and national honors for their creativity in art and writing in 28 categories.

98
01:47:00,141 --> 01:47:02,463
[SPEAKER_09]: That will be presented this evening by Ms.

99
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:03,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Suzanne Fee.

100
01:47:04,283 --> 01:47:21,572
[SPEAKER_09]: After that, we will have the opportunity to welcome and celebrate two newly appointed leaders in our school district, Mrs. Nancy Sherman-Hudson, who will begin next school year as principal of the Missittuck Elementary School, and Mrs. Christina Lungo-Dudley, the new director of Kids' Corner.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for having us.

115
01:48:41,072 --> 01:48:44,454
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could just indulge me for one minute before we get to the awards.

116
01:48:44,835 --> 01:48:48,977
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a busy and exciting month in the art and music departments.

117
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:53,540
[SPEAKER_07]: May was arts month and we had six student art exhibitions.

118
01:48:54,281 --> 01:49:01,665
[SPEAKER_07]: We had five all school art shows that featured artwork from all students in the school, as well as musical performances.

119
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:11,350
[SPEAKER_07]: including the band, the jazz band, ukulele performances, recorder performances, singing performances, orchestra, and more.

120
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:17,352
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to all the music that enhanced the art show, there were four concert events and two musicals.

121
01:49:17,993 --> 01:49:30,478
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a tremendous effort that by all of our art and music staff and with the support of building principals and our PTOs and our grant partners that supplemented some of those activities, we're just really proud of

122
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:31,692
[SPEAKER_07]: the month we had.

123
01:49:31,792 --> 01:49:38,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to thank everybody who showed up and reached out about what a great series of events we had.

124
01:49:40,336 --> 01:49:44,718
[SPEAKER_07]: But now on to the photo contest and the Scholastic Art Award winners.

125
01:49:45,518 --> 01:49:47,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm joined by Ms.

126
01:49:47,099 --> 01:49:57,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Van Aken, who has been a teacher at Medford High for many, many years and plays a vital role in both the photo contest and organizing the Scholastic Art Awards.

127
01:49:57,563 --> 01:50:06,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And she is retiring at the end of this year, and neither one of these events would be possible without her extra help and time and dedication.

128
01:50:06,106 --> 01:50:07,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to acknowledge Ms.

129
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:08,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Van Aken as well.

130
01:50:14,246 --> 01:50:15,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Cushing?

131
01:50:17,849 --> 01:50:21,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have a presentation to share so you can see the winning entries.

132
01:50:25,154 --> 01:50:36,803
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll start with the photo contest winners and the photo contest is a wonderful contest that we have at MHS because it brings out a lot of kids who aren't necessarily taking art classes and stuff so it's a great way to

133
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:39,031
[SPEAKER_07]: get more kids involved in the arts.

134
01:50:40,171 --> 01:50:49,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I call you up, if you're here, we'll give you your award and your prize and your matted photo and you could shake everyone's hand and come around this way.

135
01:50:49,596 --> 01:50:56,459
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of our seniors are at the barbecue, so I'll be chasing them at graduation to give them their awards and prizes, but we do have a lot of students here.

136
01:51:01,767 --> 01:51:03,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

137
01:51:03,468 --> 01:51:05,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll just read through it and we have the photos.

138
01:51:06,488 --> 01:51:10,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Connor O'Leary in grade 12 got an honorable mention for his photo paddling down.

139
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:14,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think, I think Connor left for that over here.

140
01:51:16,691 --> 01:51:21,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaitlyn Chuang, an honorable mention for her photo shove it.

143
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:44,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Evelyn Shumway, who's not here, received an honorable mention for reflection of the sky.

226

[SPEAKER_12]: And we are thrilled that each of our students has done a project, which we'll give back to Medford.

[SPEAKER_12]: Oprah Nakira, is here this evening to share her project with us.

230
02:02:24,686 --> 02:02:26,786
[SPEAKER_12]: So without further ado, I'll allow her to speak.

231
02:02:30,812 --> 02:02:32,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, thank you for having me here today.

232
02:02:32,313 --> 02:02:34,854
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have a slideshow queued up.

233
02:02:35,435 --> 02:02:35,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

234
02:02:36,435 --> 02:02:41,158
[SPEAKER_13]: So I had the privilege of doing this program during the summer at Tufts.

235
02:02:41,838 --> 02:02:44,660
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of our projects was to do something that we're passionate about.

236
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:51,384
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did a research project about how we can increase representation and access to AP courses at Medford High School.

237
02:02:53,854 --> 02:03:01,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so just for some statistics and school segregation accounts for about 40% of segregation at schools.

238
02:03:01,886 --> 02:03:08,557
[SPEAKER_13]: And sadly, this is when you can kind of tell the level of course at the school itself by the makeup of the students in the school.

239
02:03:09,321 --> 02:03:15,265
[SPEAKER_13]: And one way that we can combat that is looking at policy changes that we can make to increase access to these courses.

240
02:03:16,085 --> 02:03:29,894
[SPEAKER_13]: And this also applies to not only minority students, but also low income students or students from single parent households who don't have access to tutoring or guidance that could help them succeed in these courses.

241
02:03:32,085 --> 02:03:38,331
[SPEAKER_13]: So some possible causes for this are a lack of diversity in the teacher workforce itself.

242
02:03:39,132 --> 02:03:48,660
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is really detrimental to the students themselves because studies actually show that students do better when they're represented within the teachers that they have.

243
02:03:49,301 --> 02:03:54,886
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also teacher expectations could be a root cause just because of implicit biases as well.

244
02:03:58,010 --> 02:04:03,491
[SPEAKER_13]: So just for some examples of policy that could lead to this, well, the first one I have is tracking.

245
02:04:03,631 --> 02:04:17,314
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think Medford High School actually got rid of this this year, but before we had this policy where you had to take a math test in sixth grade and that kind of depended where you went or what math classes you took in high school.

246
02:04:17,794 --> 02:04:24,896
[SPEAKER_13]: So this limited access to calculus, for example, for a lot of students who maybe didn't have access to tutoring to do well on these tests.

247
02:04:25,736 --> 02:04:46,677
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is not only, this is not necessarily to say that we shouldn't use tracking in schools, but just that we should also supplement tracking with, for example, more guidance for students who need them, who are either minority students or low-income students, and looking at how we can make these programs accessible for all students.

248
02:04:49,867 --> 02:04:55,649
[SPEAKER_13]: And then just some community organizations that are working on this issue are, for example, the NAACP.

249
02:04:56,070 --> 02:05:03,152
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have science fairs that encourage achievement in STEM and other academic subjects.

250
02:05:03,973 --> 02:05:10,035
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are some things that we can incorporate at Medford High School and other communities as well.

251
02:05:11,696 --> 02:05:13,497
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you for listening to my presentation.

252
02:05:13,857 --> 02:05:14,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

253
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:22,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job, thank you so much for presenting.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I just started eating a cookie.

256
02:05:27,805 --> 02:05:29,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we get that presentation sent to us, please?

257

[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for this opportunity to present.

278
02:07:07,507 --> 02:07:14,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just preface this as we head into this slideshow and presentation by saying they say a picture is worth a thousand words.

279
02:07:14,591 --> 02:07:21,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say in this instance, the pictures don't do the project justice by any stretch of the imagination.

280
02:07:22,075 --> 02:07:24,476
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that several of you have been out to the site

281

[SPEAKER_11]: We also have a tour for members of the city council, members of the school committee this Thursday at one o'clock as well.

282
02:07:33,938 --> 02:07:39,719
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we look forward to sharing with you the live in-person progress.

283
02:07:39,899 --> 02:07:49,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have online my co-chair of the design committee, Shanine Peliquin, who has been really invaluable as a part of this.

284
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:53,901
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will start to move through the slideshow right now.

285
02:07:54,923 --> 02:08:02,629
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so here is the overall conceptual design of the construction as was proposed to you.

286
02:08:02,649 --> 02:08:05,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you to hold this in your mind as we go through.

287
02:08:07,313 --> 02:08:11,977
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see here one of the areas that was really prone to flooding.

288
02:08:12,057 --> 02:08:14,759
[SPEAKER_11]: This is now where we have built an elevated deck.

289
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Playground structures last for about 20 to 25 years in the most ideal conditions.

290
02:08:20,343 --> 02:08:24,008
[SPEAKER_11]: This was installed in 2001, so we got about 22 years out of it.

291
02:08:24,028 --> 02:08:26,851
[SPEAKER_11]: It used to be part of the Mystic River.

292
02:08:27,131 --> 02:08:34,519
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really wet ground that is overly saturated, and the playground was flooded for much of the year in the winter.

293
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:38,424
[SPEAKER_11]: I would wager you could have ice skated on a significant portion of it.

294
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:41,680
[SPEAKER_11]: So why the flooding?

295
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:46,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, because it was a river and the drainage was not well maintained, well cared for.

296
02:08:46,624 --> 02:08:54,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank the DPW for in the last year and a half, they went in, they really excavated, put in some temporary drains, and they did a really great job.

297
02:08:54,771 --> 02:08:57,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And the land itself is just wet a lot of the time.

298
02:08:58,694 --> 02:09:00,195
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's going on behind the fence?

299
02:09:00,555 --> 02:09:02,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all for being at the groundbreaking back in December.

300
02:09:02,897 --> 02:09:05,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I should say the snow breaking at that time.

301
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:07,160
[SPEAKER_11]: But we,

302
02:09:09,366 --> 02:09:15,727
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been working really hard over the winter to really demolish the old playground, build in drainage.

303
02:09:15,767 --> 02:09:17,288
[SPEAKER_11]: The drainage is really amazing.

304
02:09:18,088 --> 02:09:25,250
[SPEAKER_11]: It's oversized, or I'd say properly sized, which means it's rather large to handle the amount of water that we're going through.

305
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:27,130
[SPEAKER_11]: We've put in rain gardens.

306
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:32,651
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done electricity out to the playground, so we're not running extension cords.

307
02:09:32,691 --> 02:09:36,112
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done data ports out to the playground, so that we'll have that available

308
02:09:36,584 --> 02:09:41,722
[SPEAKER_11]: The rocks and the boulders that you'll see throughout the site have actually been brought in from Carr Park.

309
02:09:42,367 --> 02:09:48,491
[SPEAKER_11]: and that work that's been done there, it's a really cool, it adds a really cool feel to the playground, just the boulders themselves.

310
02:09:49,952 --> 02:09:52,714
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been finalizing play structure, design, colors.

311
02:09:53,395 --> 02:09:58,358
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been having weekly meetings with our design team and construction team.

312
02:09:58,819 --> 02:10:05,903
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been ironing out some of our differences and some of our, you know, questions that arise.

313
02:10:07,344 --> 02:10:15,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I put this image up there again, just so that you can get a sense of the massive scale that this project was.

314
02:10:15,746 --> 02:10:23,328
[SPEAKER_11]: It started with resurfacing the playground and the CPC and others were like, how about we time out on that?

315
02:10:23,948 --> 02:10:31,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that was going to be in of itself well over half a million dollars to just rip up and replace the soft surfacing.

316
02:10:32,429 --> 02:10:41,432
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what they did was they funded a design study that was put on hold, I'm going to be honest, for probably about 18 months while COVID took precedent.

317
02:10:42,092 --> 02:10:56,397
[SPEAKER_11]: And why I want you to really get a vision for this picture, this aerial, is for how we took a lot of underutilized space, and with Shanine and others' input, really moved forward with maximizing our space.

318
02:10:56,517 --> 02:10:59,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So here you can see the pavilion in phase one.

319
02:11:01,190 --> 02:11:05,233
[SPEAKER_11]: All that gray, dark tar will be covered with poured in place.

320
02:11:06,133 --> 02:11:08,355
[SPEAKER_11]: The turf field was recently installed.

321
02:11:08,415 --> 02:11:10,336
[SPEAKER_11]: The pavilion now has its roof on.

322
02:11:11,377 --> 02:11:19,823
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope to have outdoor movies, concerts, things along those lines where families and school personnel can enjoy the turf field.

323
02:11:22,455 --> 02:11:27,457
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done 66 new native trees, countless bushes, shrubs, and other things.

324
02:11:27,857 --> 02:11:30,138
[SPEAKER_11]: The landscaping looks absolutely beautiful.

325
02:11:31,159 --> 02:11:40,122
[SPEAKER_11]: And the tree area, students repeatedly said that if anything happens to this tree, we'll just die, or we won't be able to really enjoy it.

326
02:11:40,143 --> 02:11:41,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget, Shanine can add.

327
02:11:42,078 --> 02:11:43,659
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a co-host, so she can chime in.

328
02:11:43,719 --> 02:11:49,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget their exact statement, but basically they would have been despondent if we had done anything to that tree.

329
02:11:50,282 --> 02:11:53,784
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've been extraordinarily careful with it.

330
02:11:53,804 --> 02:12:00,487
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a gradual pathway around the tree that will be covered in a semi-permeable pavement called Flexi-Pave.

331
02:12:01,188 --> 02:12:06,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the lower corner, you can see the deck that will serve as another outdoor classroom type space.

332
02:12:08,251 --> 02:12:11,694
[SPEAKER_11]: We've put in multiple picnic tables that are accessible.

333
02:12:13,355 --> 02:12:17,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And so moving through the pictures, here's our outdoor classroom.

334
02:12:17,598 --> 02:12:32,229
[SPEAKER_11]: The logs are set so that there's multiple spaces for accessible seating, wheelchair seating, and all of the gravel in this area will be covered with the flexi-pave permeable paving.

335
02:12:32,859 --> 02:12:39,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And accessible garden beds allow for a wheelchair to go underneath and multiple heights for students of various heights and sizes.

336
02:12:42,886 --> 02:12:44,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming up next, fencing will be installed.

337
02:12:44,968 --> 02:12:49,030
[SPEAKER_11]: We're expecting pavement to go in this week, the asphalt pavement that needs 28 days to cure.

338
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:55,021
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll start digging and playground equipment areas and creating landforms.

339
02:12:55,081 --> 02:13:01,683
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some hills to create throughout the remaining area and lots more to come.

340
02:13:02,283 --> 02:13:07,104
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have any questions, feel free to email Shanine or Amanda Santrella.

341
02:13:07,364 --> 02:13:09,284
[SPEAKER_11]: They're really taking point and answering questions.

342
02:13:09,724 --> 02:13:16,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm always happy to answer any questions, but look forward to seeing anyone who hasn't been able to make it to the site this coming

343
02:13:17,585 --> 02:13:19,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Thursday at one o'clock.

344
02:13:19,265 --> 02:13:24,266
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hoping that it is not a monsoon as it has been the last two Thursdays.

345
02:13:25,407 --> 02:13:29,047
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have any questions, feel free, or Shanine, do you want to chime in?

346
02:13:32,648 --> 02:13:37,069
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you covered it pretty well.

347
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:41,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

348
02:13:42,875 --> 02:13:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

349
02:13:44,175 --> 02:13:49,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have had a chance to tour the playground, and it's super exciting.

350
02:13:49,176 --> 02:13:57,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I was involved in the CPC applications that started this, actually, that happened before I was on the school committee.

351
02:13:57,818 --> 02:14:05,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And it started out as a collaboration between the PTOs at the three schools that got resurfacing at that time.

352
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:07,940
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was the Missittuc, the Brooks,

353
02:14:08,824 --> 02:14:11,855
[SPEAKER_06]: and the McLean and the folks at the McLean.

354
02:14:14,082 --> 02:14:27,171
[SPEAKER_06]: were very committed to making sure that what they did for that school served the school for the long haul and not in the just the immediate, like, I want the same as everybody else kind of way.

355
02:14:27,191 --> 02:14:38,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to just say thank you to them for their patience, because this has been a long process, much to all of our, you know, chagrin, like we all could have done without COVID.

356
02:14:38,339 --> 02:14:38,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But here we are.

357
02:14:40,802 --> 02:14:42,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And the project is amazing.

358
02:14:42,483 --> 02:14:44,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're still accepting donations.

359
02:14:44,684 --> 02:14:52,608
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we can put another reminder in the weekly in the weekly update from the superintendent that that's happening.

360
02:14:53,789 --> 02:15:04,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are still looking for community donations to support, you know, making sure that we can really sort of dress this proper place out the way that it deserves to be.

361
02:15:05,682 --> 02:15:07,142
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many trees going in.

362
02:15:08,063 --> 02:15:13,064
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the envy of every elementary school and the question is going to be which one is next.

363
02:15:13,344 --> 02:15:29,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hopeful that we'll be able to find some money for those conversations quickly because this playground is far above anything that Medford Public Schools has ever been able to see or deliver to students before.

364
02:15:29,287 --> 02:15:29,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

365
02:15:31,325 --> 02:15:34,467
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing that I do want to say publicly, I've said it to everybody here.

366
02:15:34,647 --> 02:15:51,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I really feel that it's a smaller project, but this should serve as inspiration for everybody for the Medford High School project as to what good design, good construction oversight, and good process of getting community involvement really can do.

367
02:15:53,281 --> 02:15:53,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

368
02:15:53,621 --> 02:15:58,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And just from the chair, I want to thank you, Dr. Cushing, as well as the committee that worked on this for

369
02:15:59,332 --> 02:16:00,073
[SPEAKER_05]: quite some time.

370
02:16:00,133 --> 02:16:05,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I know member Graham's one of those people, former member McLaughlin and Ms.

371
02:16:05,696 --> 02:16:11,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Pellequin and a number of other people that just put their time and soul into this.

372
02:16:12,801 --> 02:16:14,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So happy to see it come to fruition.

373
02:16:14,982 --> 02:16:17,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty exciting to tour it.

374
02:16:17,764 --> 02:16:29,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Like member Graham said, to see a park that's this inclusive and it's gonna be utilized by the entire community, not just those three schools is something to be proud of.

375
02:16:29,889 --> 02:16:30,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

376
02:16:34,271 --> 02:16:36,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, then we have Ms.

377
02:16:36,592 --> 02:16:36,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Pelquin.

378
02:16:37,752 --> 02:16:38,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

379
02:16:39,873 --> 02:16:47,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought my kids to the old playground when they were little and even did skate, not on skates, but it was definitely skating material.

380
02:16:47,756 --> 02:16:54,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really, I did get to tour it and it is, while it is, when I toured it, it's far from done.

381
02:16:55,539 --> 02:16:58,080
[SPEAKER_08]: It is shocking that it's the same,

382
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:21,938
[SPEAKER_08]: footprint really that's sort of the thing that's hard to really wrap your head around is that the old one felt frankly small and this just feels so big it's like a like a TARDIS or something from Doctor Who it's like how on earth did you get all this in here doesn't feel crowded it's really amazing and I cannot say

383
02:17:23,277 --> 02:17:27,506
[SPEAKER_08]: enough good things about it, and I'm super excited for the stuff that's yet to come.

384
02:17:27,526 --> 02:17:32,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there's a lot of stuff that looks

385
02:17:34,198 --> 02:17:36,560
[SPEAKER_08]: tar color, but that's going to be colorful.

386
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:41,003
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't remember, I think it was Ms.

387
02:17:41,023 --> 02:17:51,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Pelequin who explained the way the color differentials will help those with low vision and just the thoughtfulness around things.

388
02:17:51,231 --> 02:17:54,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when you first glance at it, you're like, there's all these opportunities for kids to fall.

389
02:17:54,673 --> 02:17:57,715
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, we want kids to have the opportunity to fall.

390
02:17:58,916 --> 02:18:02,419
[SPEAKER_08]: The old playgrounds make them so safe that they are,

391
02:18:03,547 --> 02:18:10,673
[SPEAKER_08]: can't possibly skin a knee, but also they're boring is thankfully becoming a thing of the past.

392
02:18:10,693 --> 02:18:17,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause like I drive through Belmont every day and they have a beautiful playground.

393
02:18:17,218 --> 02:18:26,265
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like architecturally like gorgeous, but it's all brown and it is all that style of nobody can get hurt in our playgrounds.

394
02:18:28,086 --> 02:18:30,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure it costs probably more than our playground.

395
02:18:31,228 --> 02:18:35,969
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm glad we're not going there and that it's going to be a place the kids can't get enough of.

396
02:18:36,529 --> 02:18:38,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And my kids are way too old to enjoy it.

397
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:40,051
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll just go by myself.

398
02:18:40,151 --> 02:18:41,811
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you so much for all the work.

399
02:18:41,971 --> 02:18:45,873
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really an enormous number of people involved.

400
02:18:46,513 --> 02:18:52,235
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank the mayor and and the residents for funding it through the CPC because

401
02:18:53,706 --> 02:19:01,091
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't the cheapest thing we could have done is an understatement, but I think our kids are really going to benefit from it.

402
02:19:01,211 --> 02:19:06,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And not just the kids at the McGlynn, like my kids didn't go to the McGlynn, but we went there anyways.

403
02:19:07,355 --> 02:19:10,737
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that the kids of the entire city are gonna drive there.

404
02:19:10,857 --> 02:19:12,658
[SPEAKER_08]: There's parking, especially on a weekend.

405
02:19:12,738 --> 02:19:13,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

406
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:16,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you member Rousseau.

407
02:19:16,381 --> 02:19:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we used a number of funding sources, ARPA, CDBG, CPA, and one or two other as well.

408
02:19:23,268 --> 02:19:25,830
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a village, including when you have to finance something.

409
02:19:26,630 --> 02:19:27,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm miss Pelican.

410
02:19:28,571 --> 02:19:28,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

411
02:19:28,831 --> 02:19:34,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the other funding source was a federal earmark from representative Barbara through the DCR.

412
02:19:35,336 --> 02:19:40,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to say for those of you who are able to visit or who are already visited, you'll hear me say this as well, but.

413
02:19:41,471 --> 02:19:45,034
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one of the things to know is that this is the precedent setter.

414
02:19:45,354 --> 02:19:47,456
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that the other schools aren't going to get this.

415
02:19:47,556 --> 02:19:50,158
[SPEAKER_14]: It's that this is the way we're doing things from now on, right?

416
02:19:50,178 --> 02:19:55,002
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to make sure we have robust community input processes and really hear from the kids first.

417
02:19:55,082 --> 02:20:04,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really proud of the way that this community has listened to the kids and then the staff on how to make it really workable.

418
02:20:05,531 --> 02:20:09,054
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other thing to know, for those of you who haven't heard us present before,

419
02:20:10,051 --> 02:20:18,633
[SPEAKER_14]: that we did also use CPC funding to do assessments of the other MPS playgrounds because there are six total that are owned.

420
02:20:19,334 --> 02:20:31,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were able to get new equipment for the Roberts and Brooks that had broken equipment and a new, just a new panel for the Missitook as well to make things safe.

421
02:20:31,877 --> 02:20:38,939
[SPEAKER_14]: So those playgrounds have been inspected and are now safe and they will last longer while we figure out the funding pieces for how to,

422
02:20:40,171 --> 02:20:42,152
[SPEAKER_14]: improve those schoolyards when the time comes.

423
02:20:42,232 --> 02:20:50,518
[SPEAKER_14]: But those playgrounds are, they're up to the standard of care with the new surfacing and replacement equipment.

424
02:20:50,578 --> 02:21:00,345
[SPEAKER_14]: So those schools did get pieces of equipment and we anticipate these kinds of processes of really deciding what works for each school in the future.

425
02:21:02,346 --> 02:21:02,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

426
02:21:05,368 --> 02:21:05,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

427
02:21:05,808 --> 02:21:06,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

428
02:21:07,859 --> 02:21:13,322
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an update also by Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent, Student Opportunity Act.

429
02:21:13,342 --> 02:21:15,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

430
02:21:16,103 --> 02:21:20,646
[SPEAKER_11]: This was a report that we originally hoped to get a vote for you on April.

431
02:21:21,673 --> 02:21:31,440
[SPEAKER_11]: sorry, on April 29th, but due to budgets and other presentations and stuff, the proverbial can was kicked.

432
02:21:32,101 --> 02:21:36,944
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm presenting here tonight on our Student Opportunity Act submission.

433
02:21:39,875 --> 02:21:49,446
[SPEAKER_11]: We receive student opportunity act was first conceived to really rectify funding disparities for districts across the Commonwealth.

434
02:21:50,487 --> 02:21:52,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Who you know typically urban.

435
02:21:54,011 --> 02:22:00,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Typically underserved receive significant funding this Medford as part of our.

436
02:22:00,458 --> 02:22:11,204
[SPEAKER_11]: our chapter 70 money, so this is all now rolled into our chapter 70 money, receives approximately an additional $135,000 based on the governor's allotment this year.

437
02:22:11,645 --> 02:22:16,147
[SPEAKER_11]: We may be receiving more based on the House and the Senate.

438
02:22:16,768 --> 02:22:17,408
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a may.

439
02:22:18,268 --> 02:22:19,469
[SPEAKER_11]: We anticipate that we will.

440
02:22:19,849 --> 02:22:23,411
[SPEAKER_11]: However, these are numbers that we've already really accounted for.

441
02:22:23,492 --> 02:22:24,152
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not

442
02:22:24,887 --> 02:22:33,032
[SPEAKER_11]: in addition to we're not getting an additional check or anything along those lines, but then there are certain requirements that we have to do as part of the plan.

443
02:22:34,553 --> 02:22:37,455
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is our report.

444
02:22:37,535 --> 02:22:50,424
[SPEAKER_11]: So three key priorities, continued development of a robust early literacy program for grades K to five in all four of our elementary schools, a commitment to early literacy screening,

445
02:22:51,224 --> 02:23:08,860
[SPEAKER_11]: in grades K through 3 with continued monitoring throughout middle school and refined the Medford High School Saturday Acceleration Academy program that began in January 2024 to provide targeted support to identified high school students and rising ninth graders.

446
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:13,264
[SPEAKER_11]: So identified eighth graders that are rising to ninth grade as well.

447
02:23:14,445 --> 02:23:16,887
[SPEAKER_11]: So the investments that we're planning and again

448
02:23:18,021 --> 02:23:18,742
[SPEAKER_11]: only $135,000 a year approximately.

449
02:23:18,762 --> 02:23:25,706
[SPEAKER_11]: But these investments will come out to about $720,000 over the next three years, $165,000 for early literacy screening and support, $435,000 for comprehensive support for early literacy programming, and really intense

450
02:23:40,436 --> 02:23:46,282
[SPEAKER_11]: in-kind professional development, $120,000 for Saturday Acceleration Academy.

451
02:23:47,243 --> 02:24:03,179
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is directly taken from our application that I provided to you, that the district is committed to these initiatives despite significant financial challenges on the horizon that nominal support from the Student Opportunity Act will ameliorate to a certain degree.

452
02:24:03,820 --> 02:24:14,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, we are picking up the lion's share with local money to really support this because the Student Opportunity Act doesn't really deliver a whole lot to the students of Medford.

453
02:24:16,463 --> 02:24:27,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So one thing though that under the new Student Opportunity Act pieces that they've put in the last year, year and a half, is to really try to figure out how we're gonna measure family engagement.

454
02:24:27,711 --> 02:24:30,894
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that we and most districts are struggling with.

455
02:24:31,014 --> 02:24:33,856
[SPEAKER_11]: We are trying to really engage families.

456
02:24:34,396 --> 02:24:39,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Recently, we had about 60 families, 60 individuals sign up for an event that Ms.

457
02:24:39,060 --> 02:24:41,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Shulman put on, we had 16 actually show up.

458
02:24:43,143 --> 02:24:43,363
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

459
02:24:44,324 --> 02:24:49,068
[SPEAKER_11]: just some of the challenges that we face, but we're going to review metrics from our mass communication system.

460
02:24:49,648 --> 02:24:51,970
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to deploy surveys as needed to families.

461
02:24:52,690 --> 02:24:59,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we're going to monitor school site count, and that'll be a panorama survey that we're working on with the high school and hopefully get down to the other schools as well.

462
02:25:00,156 --> 02:25:12,525
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll monitor school site council compositions to include family representatives of our targeted groups, um, review data from talking points, uh, explore and deploy further rounds, future round tables,

463
02:25:12,985 --> 02:25:14,166
[SPEAKER_11]: for families and caregiver.

464
02:25:14,186 --> 02:25:19,928
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had some success with those at the height of the pandemic, less success with those as we came out of the pandemic.

465
02:25:21,129 --> 02:25:28,713
[SPEAKER_11]: So the school leadership respectfully requests a vote of the Medford School Committee to approve the plan that you have in front of you.

466
02:25:28,873 --> 02:25:29,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave you the brief right now.

467
02:25:30,934 --> 02:25:37,477
[SPEAKER_11]: And for me to also amend the date to June 3rd, 2024, as opposed to the April 29th in your packet.

468
02:25:39,637 --> 02:25:40,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve the plan.

469
02:25:41,538 --> 02:25:44,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve the plan by Member Graham, seconded by?

470
02:25:44,599 --> 02:25:45,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

471
02:25:46,300 --> 02:25:47,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olapade, all those in favor?

472
02:25:47,841 --> 02:25:49,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

473
02:25:49,241 --> 02:25:49,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

474
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:50,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

475
02:25:51,482 --> 02:25:52,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

476
02:25:52,442 --> 02:25:52,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

477
02:25:54,083 --> 02:25:55,904
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no presentations of the

478
02:25:56,988 --> 02:25:58,769
[SPEAKER_05]: public, but we do have continued business.

479
02:25:59,109 --> 02:26:09,136
[SPEAKER_05]: We have MSBA slash MCH SBA update table from May 20th, 2024 presented by Member Graham, School Building Committee meeting, May 13th, 2024.

480
02:26:09,297 --> 02:26:09,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

481
02:26:09,697 --> 02:26:09,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

482
02:26:12,919 --> 02:26:14,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a few brief updates.

483
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:18,360
[SPEAKER_06]: There are five deliverables in the eligibility phase.

484
02:26:18,480 --> 02:26:21,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of the five have been submitted to MSBA already.

485
02:26:22,861 --> 02:26:25,202
[SPEAKER_06]: The remaining three are on track.

486
02:26:26,402 --> 02:26:37,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I am anticipating that in our meeting tomorrow night the chapter 74 eligibility form will be finalized and approved by the committee and they will do a first draft review of our

487
02:26:38,445 --> 02:26:42,789
[SPEAKER_06]: our educational profile where we will look at that before June is out.

488
02:26:42,889 --> 02:26:51,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are sort of pushing hard to make sure that we are getting all of our deliverables in just as quickly as we possibly can.

489
02:26:51,235 --> 02:27:01,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working with the mayor and the president of the council to make sure that the right votes get taken to fund the feasibility study, which will rely on free cash.

490
02:27:01,103 --> 02:27:05,667
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of that also just to happen here in the month of June in some capacity.

491
02:27:07,628 --> 02:27:14,333
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of some of the work the committee has been doing, we have established two subcommittees so far.

492
02:27:14,894 --> 02:27:18,556
[SPEAKER_06]: One is about communications and community engagement, actually three subcommittees.

493
02:27:19,277 --> 02:27:33,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Communications and community engagement has built a plan that includes some surveying that we'll do in the short term to ask the community sort of what their questions are so that the website can attempt to answer some of those questions proactively.

494
02:27:34,982 --> 02:27:40,225
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have talked about a strategy of how to start to include the community in the conversation.

495
02:27:41,106 --> 02:27:45,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit of a boring conversation right now because it's a lot of paperwork.

496
02:27:45,648 --> 02:27:53,492
[SPEAKER_06]: But once we sort of move into the next phases, we're actually talking about things like feasibility study and envisioning what a new building could look like.

497
02:27:53,552 --> 02:27:56,214
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be a sort of a completely different scenario.

498
02:27:57,294 --> 02:28:09,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a plan that includes things like being at tables at community events and having a pitch deck for lack of a better term that we can use to go talk to all the boards and commissions who might be interested.

499
02:28:10,041 --> 02:28:14,904
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have some like upfront planning and survey work happening really over the course of the summer.

500
02:28:15,504 --> 02:28:21,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, sort of really just using this time to set the stage for good proactive communication.

501
02:28:23,735 --> 02:28:26,197
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had a rules and onboarding subcommittee meet.

502
02:28:26,697 --> 02:28:49,072
[SPEAKER_06]: We have established and passed our operating rules, which are very similar to what they are here in terms of using Robert's Rules of Order and trying to take a more, actually a less formal tone than we do even here, but outlining the same rules of public participation that we use here so that we can make sure that our meetings can remain productive.

503
02:28:50,591 --> 02:29:09,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, overall, have established a path for what happens when we need to onboard new people so we have sort of plans in place for all of that so that somebody coming on board can get up to speed quickly if that becomes necessary which over the life of us five to seven year project it's inevitable.

504
02:29:11,618 --> 02:29:31,629
[SPEAKER_06]: The website, the dedicated website is just about complete in its draft form and it will include bios of all the folks that are on the committee, it will include all of our minutes and all of our agendas and all the documents that we have talked about so far, submitted documents, that kind of thing.

505
02:29:32,733 --> 02:29:35,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just other helpful links, FAQs, et cetera.

506
02:29:35,195 --> 02:29:38,800
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of that is about done and ready to be launched.

507
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:49,573
[SPEAKER_06]: But our anticipation is that there won't be a lot of traction for that until we get into the feasibility study phase, which is just a little ways down the road for us.

508
02:29:51,630 --> 02:29:53,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we have to be done by January 27.

509
02:29:53,652 --> 02:29:57,915
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on track to be done far sooner than that.

510
02:29:59,577 --> 02:30:05,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And the sooner that we're done, the sooner we can get in the queue to go to the board meeting, which happens every other month.

511
02:30:06,402 --> 02:30:10,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the sooner that we can move on to those next phases.

512
02:30:11,104 --> 02:30:24,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had a finance subcommittee meeting, where we talked with Alicia hunt who's our director of planning and sustain a development and sustainability is that right okay.

513
02:30:24,738 --> 02:30:28,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was immensely helpful there's been a lot of questions around.

514
02:30:29,705 --> 02:30:36,649
[SPEAKER_06]: the site of the new high school and whether there are other possibilities besides where Medford High is right now.

515
02:30:36,669 --> 02:30:46,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And she went through, she pulled up a map and went through what those options might be in terms of sort of things that she would be thinking about.

516
02:30:47,315 --> 02:30:50,377
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need that information just yet, but at some point we will.

517
02:30:50,437 --> 02:30:57,021
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, for example, like people have asked about Playstead Park as a potential site.

518
02:30:57,061 --> 02:30:58,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that has been noted before.

519
02:30:59,341 --> 02:31:13,891
[SPEAKER_06]: She actually said that's sort of not on her hit parade of places to look, namely because we would be burying the high school further into a corner of the city that is the wealthiest corner of the city.

520
02:31:14,832 --> 02:31:21,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'd be sort of advantaging students already who generally have lots of advantage in terms of getting to the high school.

521
02:31:21,737 --> 02:31:26,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, there's sort of a whole bunch of transportation concerns with that location as well.

522
02:31:27,739 --> 02:31:42,010
[SPEAKER_06]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): She did cite Tufts Park is maybe someplace to think about because even though it is also sort of in a corner of the city, which is its own HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): Challenge from a transportation perspective, her thought was like it is in a corner of the city that

523
02:31:42,349 --> 02:31:48,173
[SPEAKER_06]: would actually advantage students who are historically disadvantaged in terms of their ability to get back and forth.

524
02:31:49,534 --> 02:31:57,599
[SPEAKER_06]: She also said that, you know, her planner heart says she would love to see Medford High back in the middle of the city, just like it used to be one day long ago.

525
02:31:57,999 --> 02:32:09,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's sort of also a conversation we talked about, like the complex over at Hormel, and sort of ruled that out for the most part, because it would be too congested with

526
02:32:10,208 --> 02:32:13,691
[SPEAKER_06]: elementary, middle, and high school all sort of having to convene in the same place.

527
02:32:14,491 --> 02:32:16,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had a really, really good discussion.

528
02:32:16,713 --> 02:32:28,002
[SPEAKER_06]: We also talked with Fiona Maxwell, who's our purchasing official for the city, and she's certified and meets requirements by MSBA, and she is starting to work on collecting

529
02:32:29,543 --> 02:32:35,427
[SPEAKER_06]: model documents for bringing on our owners project manager, which will be our next our next phase.

530
02:32:36,047 --> 02:32:44,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And we talked about, again, an aggressive goal that on the day where they approve us to go into the owners project manager selection phase that our fee goes out the door that same day.

531
02:32:44,993 --> 02:32:48,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's going to take some advanced work and planning.

532
02:32:48,335 --> 02:32:52,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she is starting to talk to the local communities around us who have done this before.

533
02:32:53,138 --> 02:32:54,779
[SPEAKER_06]: to start to pull some of those things together.

534
02:32:54,839 --> 02:33:08,363
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody's like really eager to get past this phase, which is exciting and has been helpful and collaborative all throughout the process.

535
02:33:08,403 --> 02:33:09,423
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a big committee.

536
02:33:09,683 --> 02:33:11,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is going great so far.

537
02:33:11,464 --> 02:33:13,604
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had great attendance and great participation.

538
02:33:13,624 --> 02:33:19,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's just like a lot of sort of legwork to do between now and say the fall.

539
02:33:19,666 --> 02:33:21,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll continue to sort of work through that

540
02:33:21,887 --> 02:33:23,108
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a meeting tomorrow night.

541
02:33:23,929 --> 02:33:26,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Our meetings are in the bistro so people are welcome to join us in person.

542
02:33:27,592 --> 02:33:28,492
[SPEAKER_06]: They are on zoom.

543
02:33:28,793 --> 02:33:30,534
[SPEAKER_06]: We've not seen a lot of traction yet.

544
02:33:31,635 --> 02:33:32,315
[SPEAKER_06]: It is June.

545
02:33:34,497 --> 02:33:38,020
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a few million things happening at the same time so I'm not surprised but

546
02:33:38,974 --> 02:33:53,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think the time for that participation is going to be once we get into the feasibility study where we're hiring a designer who's actually engaging with us to say, tell us, tell us what you want this place to look like and what you want it to be and what you want to be able to do in the space.

547
02:33:54,212 --> 02:34:03,338
[SPEAKER_06]: much like what we talked about with McGlynn, like how do you really thoughtfully design like every last nook and cranny of a building so it both serves a need and provides some flexibility.

548
02:34:03,398 --> 02:34:14,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of that's like sort of down the line and that's where really we'll be talking to, you know, to teachers, to staff, to students, to the community and all of that good stuff.

549
02:34:14,144 --> 02:34:15,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So all that's very much to come.

550
02:34:16,526 --> 02:34:22,249
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just a quick update of what we're doing, but we do have a pretty robust communication plan

551
02:34:23,806 --> 02:34:27,008
[SPEAKER_06]: getting underway, and everyone's excited.

552
02:34:28,809 --> 02:34:30,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to take any questions.

553
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:30,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

554
02:34:31,530 --> 02:34:32,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

555
02:34:32,711 --> 02:34:33,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

556
02:34:34,792 --> 02:34:42,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no questions other than, is there actually a bet whether we can be the fastest at this project in the history of the state?

557
02:34:42,196 --> 02:34:50,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I mean, we had documents done before we begun, which has to be unusual.

558
02:34:50,741 --> 02:34:52,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited by

559
02:34:54,254 --> 02:35:04,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice Chair Graham's ability to keep the gas pedal accelerator, excuse me, pressed to the floor in a way that amazes me.

560
02:35:05,348 --> 02:35:08,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like nobody's getting run over, which is also kind of impressive.

561
02:35:08,432 --> 02:35:12,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to thank you for that because every time I come to a meeting, I can't believe

562
02:35:13,137 --> 02:35:14,998
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done with that document already?

563
02:35:16,679 --> 02:35:25,123
[SPEAKER_08]: We are less, we are, what, 30 days into, we have 172 days, I think?

564
02:35:25,323 --> 02:35:29,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we're doing good, but I'm excited, thank you.

565
02:35:32,446 --> 02:35:34,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, thank you, Member Graham.

566
02:35:37,148 --> 02:35:39,289
[SPEAKER_05]: We have new business offered by Member Ruseau, 2024-28,

02:35:48,459 --> 02:35:48,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

570
02:35:48,979 --> 02:35:51,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Will this be going into committee or?

571
02:35:52,021 --> 02:35:52,181
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

572
02:35:53,662 --> 02:35:54,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to vote tonight.

573
02:35:54,983 --> 02:35:55,704
[SPEAKER_08]: For first reading.

574
02:35:56,124 --> 02:36:00,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask to withdraw that motion to waive the reading.

575
02:36:01,968 --> 02:36:02,549
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't mind.

576
02:36:03,169 --> 02:36:03,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

577
02:36:03,349 --> 02:36:05,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just it's a lot of text.

578
02:36:05,210 --> 02:36:05,611
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering.

579
02:36:05,691 --> 02:36:05,931
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

580
02:36:06,071 --> 02:36:06,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

581
02:36:06,391 --> 02:36:06,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

582
02:36:10,492 --> 02:36:21,134
[SPEAKER_05]: budget purpose, I do believe me, I'd rather not have to read it all, but I feel like it would have to, and it's up to you, I don't care, I don't mind, I just think it should be read.

583
02:36:21,434 --> 02:36:22,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll read it.

584
02:36:22,935 --> 02:36:26,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if I find any typos or anything as I go through.

585
02:36:26,836 --> 02:36:27,996
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, this is,

586
02:36:34,888 --> 02:36:38,169

[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

645
02:43:05,438 --> 02:43:05,818

[SPEAKER_05]: Definition section is waived.

648
02:43:21,683 --> 02:43:22,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

649
02:43:23,797 --> 02:43:45,077
[SPEAKER_05]: HAB-Masyn Moyer): From the chair, if I may, I just want to see if the superintendent can comment on whether or not the central administration yourself and CFO especially have reviewed this and have been able to HAB-Masyn Moyer): Implement comment on it, as I know it's pretty lengthy and I want to make sure that this is feasible.

650
02:43:45,097 --> 02:43:46,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

651
02:43:48,390 --> 02:43:48,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rizzo.

652
02:43:48,750 --> 02:43:50,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just speak on it real quick first?

653
02:43:50,993 --> 02:43:59,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So, most of this is actually stuff we already do, especially the budget preparation stuff and the planning.

654
02:43:59,642 --> 02:44:08,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, those are sections that are for the administration, so obviously any changes, additions, subtractions that they would like.

655
02:44:09,355 --> 02:44:13,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I obviously I think we would be happy to consider those changes.

656
02:44:14,258 --> 02:44:29,786
[SPEAKER_08]: The dates are were difficult, because the city council passed the budget ordinance that says on March 1, that the mayor's office will tell the school district, or I don't know if it tells city council or the school district, what the.

657
02:44:31,547 --> 02:44:34,049
[SPEAKER_08]: potential allocation will be.

658
02:44:34,550 --> 02:44:40,875
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had to really, the dates on this really had to be planned around that date.

659
02:44:41,176 --> 02:44:45,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, to pretend we don't get a number when we get a number doesn't make any sense.

660
02:44:46,500 --> 02:44:52,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why a lot of this stuff is sort of backed up and that March 1 date is so important in this.

661
02:44:53,687 --> 02:44:58,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, one of the things in this current budget cycle that I think

662
02:44:59,537 --> 02:45:08,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if everybody agrees, but I certainly think many people in the community would want to know is like when we had our presentation of the budget last

663
02:45:10,427 --> 02:45:17,830
[SPEAKER_08]: time or the time before, and we we cut 2.2 million and still had 2.7 million left to figure out how to cut.

664
02:45:18,671 --> 02:45:31,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And I understand why we did that, because, like, it was probably very hard to even wrap our heads around where we would make those cuts, but it's June, and if we still had to make those cuts.

665
02:45:32,717 --> 02:45:43,659
[SPEAKER_08]: that's not a lot of time for the community to respond, for us to respond, for staff to be like, all right, we've just decided we're laying off another 50 people, they got families and mortgages.

666
02:45:44,139 --> 02:45:57,842
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I felt it was really important that when we get an allocation, a projected allocation, that we take it completely seriously, and that we have a document that says, if that's our number, here is how we'll get there.

667
02:45:59,790 --> 02:46:12,617
[SPEAKER_08]: We still don't have that now and I understand why and I, I actually support that, because this gap was so phenomenally large, but in a normal year even if there's a gap, we need to be able to say.

668
02:46:13,598 --> 02:46:21,745
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how we're going to do it now we aren't going to put names and say these people are getting laid off all the way back in February that would or March that would make no sense.

669
02:46:22,265 --> 02:46:34,636
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, how are we going to get from what we need to what we think we may get the public should know that we should know that, and not a few weeks before schools out.

670
02:46:35,296 --> 02:46:36,197
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was sort of my.

671
02:46:37,819 --> 02:46:46,045
[SPEAKER_08]: my point in all that and then also telling the city council I mean the city council has traditionally received our budget book that we get.

672
02:46:46,065 --> 02:46:55,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's, that's the, that's the recommended budget from the school committee that's not what will actually happen.

673
02:46:55,612 --> 02:47:00,536
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that if we have the budget request, which is that this is what we would like.

674
02:47:02,463 --> 02:47:06,487
[SPEAKER_08]: If we only get that projected allocation, this is what it will look like.

675
02:47:07,047 --> 02:47:09,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And a letter that says, here's how we did it.

676
02:47:10,550 --> 02:47:17,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And no we don't like it, but I think that they need that for their deliberations because I know the superintendent was in the hot seat.

677
02:47:18,017 --> 02:47:21,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's too big of a.

678
02:47:22,779 --> 02:47:31,611
[SPEAKER_08]: The budget is too big to just drill you for an hour or two even, and think that that's enough, that's that's not.

679
02:47:32,131 --> 02:47:39,341
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just too much for the city council to actually take all that in, and to get to all their questions really.

680
02:47:42,418 --> 02:47:53,817
[SPEAKER_08]: There is this other thing in here of having the budget hearing, possibly up to three times, and that is to say, if we are really going to have to make cuts.

681
02:47:55,831 --> 02:48:00,897
[SPEAKER_08]: that are bigger than I just picked 1% because I looked at the math and thought that's, that's still a lot.

682
02:48:02,119 --> 02:48:13,873
[SPEAKER_08]: If we have to cut 1% or more than the public should be able to have a say, just like with the regular budget hearing, which is why we have to have the budget hearing so that the public can say what they think about it.

683
02:48:15,254 --> 02:48:18,957
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's the overview of this.

684
02:48:19,358 --> 02:48:27,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And I apologize for it being so long and wordy, but I just felt like I couldn't, this is shorter than it was, but thank you.

685
02:48:27,384 --> 02:48:29,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you members.

686
02:48:29,546 --> 02:48:38,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dr. Edward-Vincenino, if you don't have comment, just do you think there is time needed to discuss it with Central and our CFO?

687
02:48:41,596 --> 02:48:41,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean,

688
02:48:45,348 --> 02:48:53,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that it's mapped out the way that it is mapped out I just was looking at between phase one and phase two.

689
02:48:57,648 --> 02:49:04,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Phase one, October one is when we have our first enrollment projections that are submitted to DC.

690
02:49:05,837 --> 02:49:12,044
[SPEAKER_09]: So it, it definitely is a very early start, knowing that like September to October.

691
02:49:14,426 --> 02:49:16,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to be able to.

692
02:49:20,151 --> 02:49:28,674
[SPEAKER_09]: for phase one and phase two where this, the work is mapped out, I would love to be able to just kind of unpack the timing of some of it.

693
02:49:29,875 --> 02:49:35,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand the March one target date, like how you were backwards mapping.

694
02:49:36,097 --> 02:49:44,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering if from October one to December 15th, with the start of school, will that give us

695
02:49:46,616 --> 02:49:55,659
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, just for my own learning curve, honestly, that I would be starting the budget process in October and thinking about just the start of the school year and pushing it forward.

696
02:49:56,620 --> 02:50:03,462
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could at least try to unpack the timetables for phase one and phase two, not what's listed within it.

697
02:50:05,483 --> 02:50:11,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I am completely, you know, in support of the pieces that are listed within it.

698
02:50:12,085 --> 02:50:13,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to think of,

699
02:50:14,346 --> 02:50:27,856
[SPEAKER_09]: realistically with like the team, would they be able to get every every single piece done during that October, October one where we're still, you know, monitoring some pieces?

700
02:50:28,536 --> 02:50:28,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor?

701
02:50:29,737 --> 02:50:30,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

702
02:50:30,798 --> 02:50:31,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, it is

703
02:50:33,937 --> 02:50:40,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Phase one and phase two, frankly, are the superintendent's office, and they could have just been called phase one.

704
02:50:41,403 --> 02:50:45,927
[SPEAKER_08]: So, those dates, you know, between October one and February one.

705
02:50:46,648 --> 02:50:56,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I don't, I don't think anybody cares where and how you have to switch that around so you know the December thing really bothered me when I was doing it because I'm like,

706
02:50:58,320 --> 02:51:04,042
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like December 31st, well, like it's the holidays or winter break or whatever you call it.

707
02:51:04,282 --> 02:51:07,383
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that that wasn't a lot of time.

708
02:51:07,923 --> 02:51:17,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So certainly if you wanna move the dates around or move things in phase one and two around, I think that's fine.

709
02:51:17,986 --> 02:51:25,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of this language I did get from Cambridge Public Schools, which frankly, they were the only school system I could find that had anything.

710
02:51:27,944 --> 02:51:34,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody had the same block paragraph that we all inherit from MASC, which essentially says, we'll do a budget.

711
02:51:35,790 --> 02:51:36,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Gee, thanks.

712
02:51:37,752 --> 02:51:53,004
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, so definitely that stuff feels very much squishy and whatever you recommend for changes, I'm sure we would be fine with, or I would be fine with, I can't speak for the committee, but that's how those came about.

713
02:51:54,285 --> 02:51:54,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

714
02:51:55,606 --> 02:51:56,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

715
02:51:58,267 --> 02:52:20,799
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, one of the things that I feel like we have seen, and we see it happen in different ways every year, but certainly we're seeing it this year, is like, you know, we get to the point where we're like talking about the budget with the community, and all of a sudden, what we're asking for and what we think we're going to get all gets like mushed together and people get really confused.

716
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:25,662
[SPEAKER_06]: What when I think about being led by a strategic plan.

717
02:52:25,682 --> 02:52:42,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that means like somebody sitting down at some point in time and saying, in order to make progress strategically on whatever our objectives are like here's what we need to do next year and then you have to sort of let reality like play play its course and and you adjust from there.

718
02:52:43,072 --> 02:52:55,828
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've not yet ever really gotten to a point where like that, what do we need to do the things that we're setting out to do is not muddied by some financial reality.

719
02:52:55,848 --> 02:53:00,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a disservice to the community because I think people

720
02:53:00,593 --> 02:53:03,935
[SPEAKER_06]: have questions about, are we doing strategic thinking?

721
02:53:04,195 --> 02:53:11,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we doing things that, you know, improve the arts programming across the district from, you know, K to 12?

722
02:53:11,859 --> 02:53:21,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Like nobody sees that work because it gets sort of buried under everything that happens when you start talking about the reality.

723
02:53:21,204 --> 02:53:21,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

724
02:53:22,304 --> 02:53:23,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think it's important.

725
02:53:23,745 --> 02:53:29,189
[SPEAKER_06]: We've, we've sort of bifurcated these two things, but it's still very, it's so tight and close together.

726
02:53:29,269 --> 02:53:30,110
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still quite muddy.

727
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:40,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I would also say that we are unusual in that we are in June and still talking about a budget that does not happen across the state.

728
02:53:40,857 --> 02:53:45,620
[SPEAKER_06]: People are passing school committee budgets in January, and they're feeling like they're behind.

729
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:48,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there are communities that pass budgets before January.

730
02:53:48,802 --> 02:53:51,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Like none of this is unusual.

731
02:53:52,102 --> 02:53:55,623
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of sort of endeavoring to have a better process.

732
02:53:55,664 --> 02:54:14,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like maybe those communities have figured out that like the gauntlet of May and June is just not the time to be also hashing out like the, whether you're gonna have enough paper next year, like all of the things that sort of converge in May and June, like we need to start to offload some of that stuff.

733
02:54:14,231 --> 02:54:18,133
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like an unsustainable amount of

734
02:54:18,971 --> 02:54:26,432
[SPEAKER_06]: activity that has to happen during that time, both for the superintendent, for all of Medford Public Schools, for this body, for everybody.

735
02:54:26,532 --> 02:54:45,036
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there's a way for us to sort of be thoughtful and strategic and do our part and do so in a little bit more of a pathway when we can take advantage of what are historically like generally sort of light meetings in January and February and March to really hash out

736
02:54:45,810 --> 02:54:48,593
[SPEAKER_06]: the strategic details and then we're sort of on our way.

737
02:54:48,733 --> 02:54:50,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like the timeline.

738
02:54:50,615 --> 02:54:56,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been pushing to do things sooner earlier since I started on the committee.

739
02:54:57,482 --> 02:54:58,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not there yet.

740
02:54:58,683 --> 02:55:00,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Like and even here, here we are, it's June.

741
02:55:01,145 --> 02:55:03,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, it's earlier than ever before.

742
02:55:03,428 --> 02:55:04,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's here, it's still June.

743
02:55:05,249 --> 02:55:06,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still talking about this in June.

744
02:55:07,592 --> 02:55:07,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And

745
02:55:08,834 --> 02:55:24,108
[SPEAKER_06]: people don't have clarity about like what exactly is happening and what that means and to some degree that will always be the case because we are dependent on the mayor putting out her budget, she has work to do to do that that has nothing to do with us, and the council has to agree to all of it.

746
02:55:24,892 --> 02:55:30,394
[SPEAKER_06]: There, there are still those things that are going to push us to having budget discussions in June, which is fine.

747
02:55:30,894 --> 02:55:42,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think we should have less of budget discussions in June and more budget discussions earlier in the cycle so that we are not part of like what the ultimate

748
02:55:43,478 --> 02:55:45,760
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of June rush looks like, right?

749
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:51,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we have an opportunity to try this and if it doesn't work, we can revisit it.

750
02:55:51,925 --> 02:56:07,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm in full support and would make a motion to approve it with that one amendment of talking about the municipal allocation instead of the proposed reconciled budget in phase five, item 1B.

751
02:56:10,279 --> 02:56:12,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by member Graham as amended.

752
02:56:13,524 --> 02:56:15,625
[SPEAKER_15]: have another minor text.

753
02:56:16,265 --> 02:56:36,850
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was in section eight, part D. I can just send this to you, but to move that phrase to approve the proposed reconciled budget to after meeting, so special school committee meeting to approve the proposed reconciled budget will be scheduled no less than five business days.

754
02:56:37,751 --> 02:56:42,812
[SPEAKER_15]: You stumbled over it when reading it the same way that I stumbled over it at home.

755
02:56:45,303 --> 02:56:47,405
[SPEAKER_15]: And I did have a question on this.

756
02:56:49,106 --> 02:56:53,849
[SPEAKER_15]: So you talk in phase two about discussing the budget needs with the principals.

757
02:56:53,949 --> 02:57:02,155
[SPEAKER_15]: I was wondering about the department heads and potentially that's part of the presentations we get regularly from the departments.

758
02:57:03,539 --> 02:57:07,182
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if that's part of the budget process, or if it's part of the updates.

759
02:57:07,222 --> 02:57:11,446
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what we've been doing, this is where we are, and this is what we anticipate needing for next year.

760
02:57:11,486 --> 02:57:21,716
[SPEAKER_15]: So build some of that strategic planning into those updates that we're already getting, or if not, make sure it's in the process of crafting the budget.

761
02:57:21,836 --> 02:57:25,759
[SPEAKER_15]: I think one of the big questions that people have had, that I've seen from people is,

762
02:57:28,737 --> 02:57:31,219
[SPEAKER_15]: who exactly, how are we getting these numbers?

763
02:57:31,279 --> 02:57:36,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are we, what is the plan for this department and that department and what are their needs?

764
02:57:36,262 --> 02:57:46,829
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know it's allocated by school and the principals are really important, but thinking about the departments and giving us a better sense of where those numbers and allocations are coming from.

765
02:57:46,849 --> 02:57:52,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think that also informs how we spend our money and what our priorities are.

766
02:57:52,754 --> 02:57:54,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau and then Dr. Edward-Vincent.

767
02:57:55,216 --> 02:57:55,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

768
02:57:56,496 --> 02:58:03,718
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in my seven and a half years now, we've done budgets, this will be the third way that we've done them.

769
02:58:04,678 --> 02:58:16,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I started, the way we did them, I mean, it was just the way I've been done, I was new, was that every department head, every principal came before the committee.

770
02:58:17,366 --> 02:58:21,468
[SPEAKER_08]: They told us what they wanted, but of course, we're not their boss.

771
02:58:22,129 --> 02:58:23,449
[SPEAKER_08]: The superintendent's their boss.

772
02:58:23,649 --> 02:58:31,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So everything that they were presenting, the superintendent already had, of course, like vetted, or I assumed.

773
02:58:31,453 --> 02:58:41,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it made no sense that we were being presented with something that the superintendent had already said, yeah, that's fine, as if we were going to somehow,

774
02:58:42,099 --> 02:58:43,540
[SPEAKER_08]: be a decision maker at it.

775
02:58:43,720 --> 02:59:02,275
[SPEAKER_08]: It was informational, but the biggest flaw in that was that, you know, if a department head had like a big spend, they wanted to really do something big with the department and the superintendent after talking down about how much money there was, was like, we can't do it this year, or we never hear about it.

776
02:59:02,756 --> 02:59:07,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, if we were hearing about those things that we weren't gonna get to do,

777
02:59:09,042 --> 02:59:14,106
[SPEAKER_08]: because we didn't have the resources in those meetings, then that could have been useful and helpful.

778
02:59:14,527 --> 02:59:18,370
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the first couple of years.

779
02:59:18,630 --> 02:59:28,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And then remember Graham got on and that got turned upside down where it was, here's the list of things we would do if we had the money.

780
02:59:29,459 --> 02:59:34,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did that, I think, two years and then we have this pandemic thing that happened.

781
02:59:35,768 --> 02:59:38,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, actually, no, I got my time right a little off.

782
02:59:38,332 --> 02:59:41,717
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, we had a laundry list of things we would do if we could.

783
02:59:42,277 --> 02:59:44,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And many of those things were not like

784
02:59:45,157 --> 03:00:08,758
[SPEAKER_08]: know nice to have they were things you're like wait the public schools doesn't do that stuff like how are you operating a public school and not doing that which was sort of the whole point was to have that in black and white um and this year we haven't we sort of done it a different way because we just because we knew how big the the budget gap was so a lot of that stuff kind of fell to the ways to the side as

785
03:00:10,562 --> 03:00:13,684
[SPEAKER_08]: We could have done it, but honestly, what was the point?

786
03:00:14,804 --> 03:00:17,505
[SPEAKER_08]: It sort of felt like this year, like what was the point?

787
03:00:19,146 --> 03:00:23,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So I forgot what my point was in response to your question.

788
03:00:23,869 --> 03:00:25,929
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your question?

789
03:00:26,190 --> 03:00:36,995
[SPEAKER_15]: My question was how do we make transparent those priorities, not just in the individual schools, but across the areas, the department areas,

790
03:00:38,801 --> 03:00:39,542
[SPEAKER_08]: That, sorry, thank you.

791
03:00:39,922 --> 03:01:00,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess part of the problem with that type of transparency is that the, I mean, it isn't really appropriate to think department heads and principals are gonna come and essentially just ignore what their boss said and say, here's what we think that the priorities for science should be.

792
03:01:01,966 --> 03:01:07,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the superintendent doesn't agree, I don't think we should hear about it because that's not transparency.

793
03:01:07,831 --> 03:01:09,933
[SPEAKER_08]: We hire and supervise the superintendent.

794
03:01:10,613 --> 03:01:26,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And if she believes that's not the way to do it right now, or we can't afford it, I think that's not transparent for us, but it's on the other side of a veil that is like etched in stone in the law.

795
03:01:27,047 --> 03:01:28,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we can,

796
03:01:32,213 --> 03:01:37,295
[SPEAKER_08]: dig and we can, you know, throw the fishing hook in and try and pull that stuff out.

797
03:01:37,455 --> 03:01:44,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will hear from the community and other folks like, you know, science, which is doing great, by the way, but I'm using it as an example.

798
03:01:45,079 --> 03:01:48,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Science has a problem like we did before we bought FOSS.

799
03:01:49,821 --> 03:01:57,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we can push, but I just think having, it really felt like a dog and pony show where

800
03:01:58,649 --> 03:02:02,492
[SPEAKER_08]: department heads and the principals told us stuff.

801
03:02:02,652 --> 03:02:05,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And every year they seem to sort of have everything they needed.

802
03:02:05,935 --> 03:02:10,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like two months of committee of the halls.

803
03:02:10,838 --> 03:02:25,450
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like on top of school committee, two months of committee of the halls, where at the end you were just like, okay, I know what's going on, but there's no strategic anything involved because it's already been decided by the superintendent, which is appropriate.

804
03:02:26,551 --> 03:02:26,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

805
03:02:27,561 --> 03:02:41,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that desire, but I also feel like getting that desire satisfied is in some ways outside of our jurisdiction, if you will, so.

806
03:02:41,706 --> 03:02:52,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Then maybe what I'm asking is if that budget presentation can be tied more closely to the strategic plan and the direction that we're headed.

807
03:02:52,490 --> 03:02:52,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

808
03:02:54,071 --> 03:02:54,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward-Vinson,

809
03:02:56,038 --> 03:02:58,441
[SPEAKER_05]: was next and then I'll go to member Graham.

810
03:02:58,721 --> 03:03:05,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So in response to your question, what I started writing down and I think you were reading my mind.

811
03:03:06,940 --> 03:03:15,183
[SPEAKER_09]: but I wrote down alignment, aligned strategic plan, curriculum review, and I also wrote down MSBA.

812
03:03:15,964 --> 03:03:26,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we did have a different way of doing the budget in previous years in agreement with what member Rousseau was saying.

813
03:03:27,208 --> 03:03:35,892
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we found at least this particular year, how the numbers were explained and how you have to work with what you're given.

814
03:03:37,793 --> 03:03:41,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Our priority is to truly align our resources and work smarter.

815
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:43,782
[SPEAKER_09]: On behalf of the district.

816
03:03:44,823 --> 03:03:51,753
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a strategic plan that we are in the process of getting ready, ready to do the next cycle.

817
03:03:52,314 --> 03:03:52,834
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we

818
03:03:54,296 --> 03:04:06,507
[SPEAKER_09]: temporarily push pause in working with Member Graham and other members of the committee because of all of the work and the requirements that MSBA is asking for.

819
03:04:06,987 --> 03:04:11,772
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of having us, you know, in isolation, work on a strategic plan.

820
03:04:12,132 --> 03:04:20,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And then MSBA says, we need X, Y, and Z. And it's like, oh, well, we did A, B, and C. And it's like, well, forget about that work.

821
03:04:20,697 --> 03:04:21,577
[SPEAKER_09]: let's go do this.

822
03:04:21,737 --> 03:04:31,380
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of trying to do things two and three times, we're kind of trying to align the work, making sure that the work is coherent.

823
03:04:32,460 --> 03:04:36,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, always keeping in mind that it's about what's going to be best for the students.

824
03:04:36,982 --> 03:04:40,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I do feel that

825
03:04:41,363 --> 03:05:07,822
[SPEAKER_09]: having everyone come up to present what their wish list is, isn't necessarily the best use of time because it may not be connected, clearly connected to our strategic plan so that if everything we do is aligned to our strategy, our strategic plan, the entire district will move forward in one direction and we will see greater results for our students and we will have a more effective

826
03:05:08,442 --> 03:05:12,283
[SPEAKER_09]: running district and do things more efficiently.

827
03:05:12,863 --> 03:05:26,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to say that that's the reason why there has been a pause in some areas, but it's really about gathering enough information in order to make a good decision once.

828
03:05:27,947 --> 03:05:28,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

829
03:05:28,307 --> 03:05:32,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I don't support doing the same work over and over, to be clear.

830
03:05:34,966 --> 03:05:37,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Member Graham, and then we'll take a vote.

831
03:05:38,047 --> 03:05:42,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I just wanted to revise my motion a little bit, and I think this might help.

832
03:05:42,529 --> 03:05:48,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So a motion to approve this on first reading with two amendments.

833
03:05:48,831 --> 03:06:02,877
[SPEAKER_06]: One is section five, item 1B, in that second line, it shouldn't say proposed reconciled budget, it should say proposed municipal allocation.

834
03:06:03,909 --> 03:06:17,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And then with a second amendment in phase two, item number two, it says principals and we're going to add and department heads discuss budget needs with school councils and provide feedback to the superintendent.

835
03:06:19,057 --> 03:06:27,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval as amended twice by member Graham, seconded by member Reinfeld.

836
03:06:31,294 --> 03:06:31,714
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

837
03:06:31,734 --> 03:06:31,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

838
03:06:32,255 --> 03:06:32,675

839

[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

840
03:06:33,036 --> 03:06:36,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next meeting is June 10th, 2024, here at the Alden Memorial Chambers.

841

842
