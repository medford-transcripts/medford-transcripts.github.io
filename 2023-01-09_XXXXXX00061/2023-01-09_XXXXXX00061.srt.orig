1
00:00:02,717 --> 00:00:04,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you both for joining me today.

2
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:10,162
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could just start our guest by introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

3
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:13,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, my name is Judy Harrington.

4
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:20,936
[SPEAKER_03]: My pronouns are she, her, and I am a writer, author, and writing coach.

5
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:29,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just released my first self-published book called Fuckery, The Life and Times of a Legend in Her Own Mind.

6
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been living in Medford for probably 23, 24 years now.

7
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:34,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And where I call home.

8
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:40,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

9
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:48,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll start with our first question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

10
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been thinking about this question since I knew it was coming on the podcast.

11
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:59,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So my favorite place to grab a bite is Saybar on Main Street.

12
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:07,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big sushi fan, but they also have all sorts of great Asian fusion.

13
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get your chicken curry, you can get some of your

14
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:15,996
[SPEAKER_03]: of traditional American Chinese, you know, egg rolls and potstickers and things like that.

15
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:18,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just I love the atmosphere there.

16
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:30,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I find what I found so surprising about the place when I started going there was that when you walk in, it's just like this small area, but there's a large room in the back.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it the party room.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's lots of great places to just like sit and have a private conversation or get together with a group of friends.

19
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:39,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've

20
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:44,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of a regular there and come in, they're like, oh, you again?

21
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, me again.

22
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Here I am.

23
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:51,388
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's probably my my number one place to hit up.

24
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:57,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been a big fan of the Ford that just opened up across from Wedmonds.

25
00:01:58,532 --> 00:01:59,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to stop in there.

26
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:04,819
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a 501 cocktail, midweek sometimes, meet friends there.

27
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's always great food and wonderful service.

28
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:09,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a great kind of neighborhood place.

29
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:15,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad we have something like that to add to the tapestry of restaurants we have here in the city.

30
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:23,077
[SPEAKER_04]: owned by an Irish person, and we'll hear a little bit more about that theme in your life as well, hopefully.

31
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:26,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, that is an ongoing theme, that's for sure.

32
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:36,184
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, you mentioned your book, which I did get a chance to read ahead of the podcast that the library, the Medford Public Library, does have your book.

33
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:41,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you could tell us a little bit about it or like how you kind of what's your kind of elevator speech about the book?

34
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:43,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

35
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I say that this is a collection of family stories celebrating my family's longstanding tradition of putting the fun in dysfunctional.

36
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:57,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sometimes I just say enough of that.

37
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:58,915
[SPEAKER_03]: People are like, oh, yeah.

38
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:01,216
[SPEAKER_03]: family family stories.

39
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:08,918
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the overarching theme that I like people to walk away with is that sometimes you think your family is the craziest group in town.

40
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:13,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm here to tell you that I'm hold hold my beer.

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some pretty wild and crazy stories myself, but it's not a competition.

42
00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also, as I say in the book, normal is a setting on a dryer.

43
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:25,665
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no normal families.

44
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:35,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, I choose to look at a lot of wild and crazy dysfunction that I grew up in growing up.

45
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:46,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've kind of come to a place in my life where I said I'd rather look at that through the lens of love and joy and see the humor in it than marinate in the pain of it.

46
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:49,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I invite readers to do the same.

47
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:56,339
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes my therapist thinks it's a terrible coping mechanism, but then again, he's no longer my therapist.

48
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at it that way, like it works for me.

49
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:03,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of invite people to do the same.

50
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:08,371
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a message to walk away from, this would be the overarching message that I would give back.

51
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:09,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.

52
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:22,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for folks listening and who are interested in writing and by that I mean me, one of the curiosities, um, is around how you decided to write a book.

53
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:26,532
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what, you know, how did you, how did this book come to fruition?

54
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:35,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe a little bit about how you made choices around censorship and what you felt comfortable sharing, what felt super private, like maybe if you could speak to some of that grappling.

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's funny.

56
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you write a book about your family, you can't really necessarily play the part of they have private life.

57
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:51,757
[SPEAKER_03]: But but in terms of how these stories came together, they really started as kind of cocktail and coffee conversation with my mom.

58
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:54,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Mafia tribe, as I call them.

59
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:54,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

60
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're meeting together and you're in the trenches of motherhood and would you hear what my kids said today type of thing.

61
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:09,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for me, the piece de resistance in this book is the story called My Jewish Kid.

62
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:12,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And it revolves around my older daughter who's

63
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,945
[SPEAKER_03]: in kindergarten embraced Hanukkah in a way that we never expected, given that we're Irish Catholics and her dad is an Irish immigrant.

64
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:25,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And our moms are Catholic Mother Hall of Famers.

65
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:35,012
[SPEAKER_03]: To have a kid who suddenly decided she wanted a menorah and expected Santa to bring it to me was like, wow, that's really unusual.

66
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:41,876
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started writing that story down because I wanted to keep it for her and her sister.

67
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:42,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

68
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:46,080
[SPEAKER_03]: has her own story too.

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Every kid has a signature story.

70
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all do.

71
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I certainly do in the book as well.

72
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:57,304
[SPEAKER_03]: But she had her whole childhood with imaginary friends and I, so delightful.

73
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:03,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And it allowed me to kind of revisit childhood through her eyes in that way.

74
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:07,589
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to, mostly I wanted to catalog these stories to give to them.

75
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:13,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And as time went on, and I've been a writer by trade for a very long time, my English degree,

76
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:19,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm a communications degree from Emerson College, and writing's always been a creative outlet for me.

77
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:31,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So in those moments I was stealing away in between karate drop-offs and basketball games, I was finding time to catalog these stories.

78
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:37,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And it reminded me of stories of my own childhood, where I knew I had this whole body of work.

79
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a while, I shared it on my blog.

80
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It was largely a secret blog.

81
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:48,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to joke that I would come on the blog and say, greetings, all four of you.

82
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:51,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming in for the next segment on Trudy's Crazy Wife.

83
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I took that down for a while.

84
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:59,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of, you know, imposter syndrome that goes on with writers.

85
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a human experience.

86
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:04,315
[SPEAKER_03]: But I couldn't really hear these stories, right?

87
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:06,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just kind of kept running and kept writing.

88
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,559
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened actually was in the pandemic, my husband and I separated.

89
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:24,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of things were going, you know, topsy-turvy for us, pandemic aside, family dynamic issues mostly.

90
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,563
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were other, I just got to this point where I said,

91
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think it's time to bring these stories to life in the form of a book.

92
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

93
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:39,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been a digital networker my whole life.

94
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:42,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I reached out to a friend of mine who just published a book.

95
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:46,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, Christina, how did you get your book done?

96
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:47,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I have this book.

97
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:50,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know how to get it into a book form.

98
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:55,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not necessarily looking to go to a publisher and go with a traditional route.

99
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that self-publishing is so

100
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Right for me.

101
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

102
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you just need to talk to get it done.

103
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:04,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Oh, I know I need to get it.

104
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:06,473
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the name of the company is called get it done.

105
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:14,976
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I reached out to them shared my manuscript and with the caveat that

106
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:18,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe these stories are funny to me and five other people.

107
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're a block.

108
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

109
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like you guys are the experts.

110
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:25,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me know what you think.

111
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:32,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably 10 days later, I met with the co-founders, Lindsay Smith and Alexander Franzen.

112
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, no way could this be a book.

113
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:36,414
[SPEAKER_03]: This has to be a book.

114
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:38,955
[SPEAKER_03]: laughing the whole time.

115
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:39,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I?

116
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:42,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I know it's it's it's funny stuff.

117
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:49,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's worth getting out in the world because these people didn't know me from Adam's house cat until I showed them this manuscript.

118
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:57,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So I signed on to work with them for a year in a coaching program where they took me from I did.

119
00:08:57,428 --> 00:08:57,548
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

120
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:08,383
[SPEAKER_03]: book came to life went to presale late September of this year and started shipping in late October.

121
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:09,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.

122
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:12,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of taken on a life of its own.

123
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:16,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also fortunate in that, um, I'm a copywriter by trade.

124
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:22,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I write for, for small to mid-sized businesses, blogs, newsletters, website copy.

125
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I knew the power of marketing.

126
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:37,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, from the beginning, once I decided to work with Alex and Lindsay to bring the book to life, I started a newsletter out to my libraries, letting them know

127
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:39,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guess what I decided to do?

128
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:48,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been kind of down to a little grassroots marketing and get the message out that way and on social.

129
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

130
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:52,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And following.

131
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:55,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just it took on a life of its own that way.

132
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the last time I checked, we're edging on a thousand copies sold.

133
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:03,882
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's super exciting.

134
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:04,963
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge benchmark.

135
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,704
[SPEAKER_03]: How can people find your book?

136
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:25,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go to my author website, judyherrington.com, and there will be links there to buy the book through Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and bookshop.org.

137
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:26,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can

138
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:43,456
[SPEAKER_03]: influence listeners I would like to also encourage them to they're going to make a choice to choose to purchase the bookshop, because that is a way to support your local independent bookstores you can choose a bookstore to support in order through them and they

139
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:47,561
[SPEAKER_03]: get some money in turn, and that's why.

140
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:52,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like to keep the independent books for community alive and well.

141
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:58,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon has its place and purpose, but it's not the only way to get book.

142
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:01,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

143
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:20,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was struck by like hearing sort of the way that you've used your own like experience growing up and your own parents and sort of I think the ways that we maybe were taught not to talk about those family experiences, right, like influenced maybe how we became parents or what we thought about as parents.

144
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:28,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's I think it's really interesting the way that you use both that and these like really endearing stories of your own kids like that.

145
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:29,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about the

146
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:34,164
[SPEAKER_04]: the chapter where you talk about your daughter's imaginary friends.

147
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:36,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, it's so sweet.

148
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:52,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, it's just like, I don't know, it's just like a really it's I think there's different ways that parents could approach, like understanding what's going on for their kids in those moments and just really like embracing that her imagination in that way was just really sweet.

149
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, me.

150
00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:02,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I was raised by an alcoholic madman and a woman who had a PhD revisionist history.

151
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:03,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my parents.

152
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,743
[SPEAKER_03]: were wonderful people in many ways that they certainly had their demons.

153
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:23,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was somehow given the gift of being able to see both and accept and come to a place of both and that you can have both of those things and still love your parent.

154
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:27,537
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's still so many things that my parents gave me as gifts.

155
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And for my dad, it was the ability to call

156
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,442
[SPEAKER_03]: BS and things I didn't think were right in the world.

157
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:50,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And my mother was really someone who really embraced imagination and someone who really encouraged me and my brother to think for ourselves and also just to be creative.

158
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:58,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the pieces I think I took from them and really come close to my heart.

159
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:05,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I saw it being imbued in my child, I'm like, what do you mean you have an imaginary brother?

160
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:08,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what a great solution to the fact that I'm not going to have any more kids.

161
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:12,268
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a brother, I'm telling you no.

162
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:15,030
[SPEAKER_03]: But okay, well, then we'll just make one up.

163
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sure.

164
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,891
[SPEAKER_03]: His name's Joey from Africa.

165
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Joe, Joey from Africa.

166
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:20,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Full name.

167
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his stage name.

168
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:26,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I was like, okay, well, this is what we're doing now.

169
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:31,414
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm going to tell you, no, you can't have a imaginary friend.

170
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:34,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the same way I said, what I'm going to say, no, you can't have a menorah for Christmas.

171
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:39,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that to me, it just felt like so limiting.

172
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's interesting that I love that you look at it.

173
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:45,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was another anecdote.

174
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:46,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

175
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:47,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

176
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,480
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, go ahead.

177
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,100
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another anecdote.

178
00:13:50,140 --> 00:14:04,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I just feel like so many of your stories I really related to as a parent and like sort of being in a community of other parents where we try to sort of hold each other's learning and like maybe mistakes or growth areas as parents and.

179
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:17,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's I think that really speaks to my experience, like as a parent in Medford and other like how I've experienced other parents in Medford is like really supporting each other and exploring like, oh, my kid did this thing and I don't really know what to make of it.

180
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel a little bit embarrassed of it.

181
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:23,975
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was the one about your daughter's fake birthday.

182
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:33,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So telling her that her birthday was sooner is to help her transition to a new preschool, which was ultimately a logistical like convenience for you as well.

183
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:33,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And like,

184
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:42,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, there's something so relatable, like how do I convince my kid to do what's best for them, but also best for me and not have shame about that?

185
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:48,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I was like, I can't sustain this anymore.

186
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:52,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't drop a kid at one school and then double back.

187
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:57,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I was literally commuting an hour every day to work out of my house.

188
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:00,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also saw that

189
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:10,946
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the preschool environment she was in at the moment, they were having their own growing pains and it just wasn't working for her anymore.

190
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:15,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is my second daughter, her struggle.

191
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:20,048
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the gift of being the second child is that your parent has learned from the first.

192
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:31,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw in my older daughter, they're going from this same kind of very intimate, insular, very small preschool, going into a big race.

193
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That transition was very hard for her.

194
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:44,224
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted my younger one to have a better foundation and be able to manage that transition in a more smooth way.

195
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:47,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So I found like a medium-sized daycare.

196
00:15:49,308 --> 00:16:00,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I knew like a crazy person and basically bad and almost put the fear of God into them in some way, like I think my pure desperation was what they really, really spoke to them.

197
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I really need a spot.

198
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, OK, we have one.

199
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:06,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, OK, I'll take it.

200
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:10,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, and then we'll figure out the rest later.

201
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:19,306
[SPEAKER_03]: But the best part of that whole story to me is when my little one said, I'll come here when I'm four.

202
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:26,211
[SPEAKER_03]: She was so clever to think of, like, I have a way to negotiate.

203
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I have leverage.

204
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:31,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, that was it just took me aback for a second.

205
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:37,240
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I'm like, OK, well, aren't you lucky your birthday's on Friday?

206
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the words were out of my mouth before I even knew what I had said.

207
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:43,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, it is.

208
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it's that age.

209
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:48,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't know really when their birthday is, but tell them.

210
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:56,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like this plausible deniability thing, which I kind of grew from.

211
00:16:56,835 --> 00:17:00,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a paralegal in a formal life, so I kind of drew that in.

212
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:03,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was this whole insanity ensued.

213
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as I'm telling people that this is what's happening, everyone was just so shocked.

214
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,097
[SPEAKER_03]: that, yeah, okay, yeah, all right.

215
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:15,058
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

216
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:23,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And the funniest part of that story is that I kind of forgot to tell about this fake birthday for almost 10 years.

217
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:26,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you mean I have a fake birthday?

218
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:27,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, why?

219
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all the parents do mean it, fake birthday.

220
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:37,005
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it still makes me laugh every time I think about it.

221
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:49,720
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned like there's a couple of themes in the book that like I do feel like relate to kind of our theme as a podcast where you talk about your daughter being raised, you know, Irish Catholic and and kind of embracing Judaism.

222
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,641
[SPEAKER_04]: You talked about another point like the.

223
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:57,784
[SPEAKER_04]: your daughter exploring like her own sexuality and gender.

224
00:17:57,804 --> 00:18:09,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I wonder like how that like in particularly like in Medford, like how that felt, how you sort of think about that sort of inclusive element as a parent and how you've experienced that with your kids growing up here.

225
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:31,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel like, well, I'd rather apologize than ask permission, generally, as a human being, that's who I am, which I'm sure right now comes as no surprise to anyone, but I'd still, like, I could tell them, okay, this is happening now, and they're like, okay.

226
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:53,997
[SPEAKER_03]: her name now and some people not to say everybody know my questions like well what do you mean that she now uses the name Ruben or what do you mean that they're changing pronouns right and I'm like well this is how she feels comfortable they feel comfortable in the world and to me I don't care what you call yourself

227
00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:00,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've changed my name and I'm still who I am.

228
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:06,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Changing your name doesn't mean that you've become a different person.

229
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:11,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a way for you to feel more comfortable in your own skin, I guess.

230
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:19,345
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did find that my community was very accepting of it.

231
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:24,726
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also believe I made it clear like this actually isn't up for a real debate.

232
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:37,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And because I thought it was my job as her mom, as their mom, to be an advocate in that way and to be an ally in that way.

233
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:50,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And not in this popular sense of like wearing a sticker or just saying like, to me, this was really an act of walking the walk and talking the talk.

234
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:53,707
[SPEAKER_03]: But my older daughter,

235
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:55,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruben.

236
00:19:57,313 --> 00:20:00,776
[SPEAKER_03]: now has returned to she her pronouns.

237
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:05,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's been like, oh, OK, well, that's what we do now.

238
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:06,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

239
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And my younger one has changed her name from Zoe to Ivy, which you may have picked up in the introduction and the dedication to the book.

240
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:17,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And her pronouns are she her.

241
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:20,210
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you say them, she's fine with that, too.

242
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:25,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just say, OK, well, this is how you navigate the world and this is how you feel good in it.

243
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:26,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Then

244
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:29,236
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I show my love.

245
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:32,318
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really nice.

246
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

247
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:53,988
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a chapter where I think it was called part time lesbian or something like where it was like, yeah, where it was clear that, you know, you're kind of in the present with them in that way of like, OK, this is where you're at today and being able to sort of be flexible with that and sort of meet them where they're at in that exploration.

248
00:20:55,233 --> 00:21:08,229
[SPEAKER_03]: But but also in in their dad's defense, you know, it was he was not at all critical or he didn't treat it as other way.

249
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,991
[SPEAKER_03]: He was feeling this.

250
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:14,015
[SPEAKER_03]: emotion too of like, but wait a minute.

251
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I thought it was this.

252
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I know I did too.

253
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:20,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

254
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:21,463
[SPEAKER_03]: They did too.

255
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:30,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And but our job is to love them no matter who they love, what they want to call themselves, what they want to use, where they want to work.

256
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:38,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Long as no one's getting hurt, then we love them as they are, as they show up in the world.

257
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:41,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And but his word choice was.

258
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,962
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she was a full time lesbian, my profession, and she's not an alien.

259
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:49,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

260
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:57,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's funny because when I elected to include that story in the book, I was nervous that

261
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I would offend people.

262
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And but then, you know, I sat with it for a while and I said, you know what?

263
00:22:06,331 --> 00:22:10,071
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, I really love my my kids as they are.

264
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that is the overarching message here.

265
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:17,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see humor in the word choice.

266
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:22,234
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't done in a derogatory way.

267
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:27,155
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done really from a place of curiosity and caring and wanting to

268
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:30,354
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, be supportive.

269
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:39,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad that it has been heard that way, because it would be very hurtful to me to know that it hadn't.

270
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:55,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, to be honest, I was a little nervous when I saw the title of the chapter, but as I read it, I think it is a really good sort of illustration of how we might not say the right thing in the moment, but that doesn't necessarily reflect how we're feeling or how we're trying to understand something.

271
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:58,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the moment, such a snapshot, right?

272
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:02,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't like when you take a picture, it's literally a snapshot in time.

273
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes our words are just a snapshot of our thoughts in the moment.

274
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:12,386
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, the thought develops and takes a different form, a different shape.

275
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:15,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really what I wanted to convey.

276
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad that that story landed as I had intended.

277
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:20,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

278
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:22,613
[SPEAKER_03]: That means a lot.

279
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:23,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

280
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:30,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you also want to mention an event you're having at the library coming up.

281
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

282
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

283
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:33,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will.

284
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:44,101
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big requests after writing the book, people who've known me for a long time have heard me say these stories like when's the audio audio book coming?

285
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:47,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, that's to be determined.

286
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:50,206
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, what I can offer are

287
00:23:50,906 --> 00:24:05,596
[SPEAKER_03]: author readings and I'll be giving one at the Metro Public Library on January 26th at 7pm and if you go to the library's website they have you know details there.

288
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:11,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a registration link I'm not sure to be perfectly honest but those are the details that's where we'll be.

289
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:24,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I understand it at the moment, I still need to confirm these details, Porter Square Books will be their preferred vendor, so there'll be an opportunity to purchase books at the event as well.

290
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:32,837
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll be reading a couple of the stories, and I usually like to find one that speaks to a theme because there's this

291
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:48,164
[SPEAKER_03]: a moment in the story, The World's Most Approachable Woman, where I talk about my life and how my parents created that imprinting moment of keeping libraries as a part of my essence.

292
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:50,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So libraries play a big part in my life.

293
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:54,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's a great story to read.

294
00:24:54,086 --> 00:25:01,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read at least one, possibly two stories, and then I'll be there to sign for a short Q&A.

295
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,150
[SPEAKER_03]: which is an ongoing joke.

296
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,791
[SPEAKER_03]: My copywriting brand is Judy411.

297
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:15,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And that harkens to the days of your when you called 411 for information.

298
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:25,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, again, as the world's most approachable woman, I answer questions daily from total and utter strangers or people who know and love me dearly.

299
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:28,877
[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts of topics, all sorts.

300
00:25:29,617 --> 00:25:32,318
[SPEAKER_03]: all sorts of things, and I always seem to have the answer.

301
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:35,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the genesis of the Judy Fallon brand.

302
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:43,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But so there'll be a Q&A, but it won't be very long and I won't be giving anyone directions to 93.

303
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:46,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a funny, definitely a funny part of the book.

304
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:57,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was striking to me was when you mentioned that neither of your parents drove and that your mom takes or did take the train or public transportation from Fall River to Medford three days a week, you said.

305
00:25:58,393 --> 00:25:58,733
[SPEAKER_04]: That is.

306
00:25:58,773 --> 00:25:58,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

307
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes dressed as the cat in the hat.

308
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:04,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she did.

309
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:04,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

310
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:05,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for real.

311
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:10,121
[SPEAKER_03]: That was her claim to fame.

312
00:26:10,622 --> 00:26:11,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Really was, I always say.

313
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:15,667
[SPEAKER_03]: She never met a form of public transportation.

314
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:19,750
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't like, and she made it her world, her life's mission to master them all.

315
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:20,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

316
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,211
[SPEAKER_03]: She really did.

317
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:24,352
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I, but yeah, it was true.

318
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:27,714
[SPEAKER_03]: My, neither of my parents drew, but they never had a driver's license.

319
00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:33,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we had a very alternative existence.

320
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:39,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we were making a positive impact on our carbon footprint before it was cool.

321
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,901
[SPEAKER_03]: We were also going to the farmer's market before it was cool.

322
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:42,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That was another thing.

323
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:42,862
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom.

324
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:54,055
[SPEAKER_03]: imbued with local produce and going to those types of events and being in your community in that way, definitely another imprinting thing that has stuck with me.

325
00:26:54,536 --> 00:27:01,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what I really love about this community and living here is that there's so many opportunities here that harken back to how I grew up.

326
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:09,621
[SPEAKER_03]: The libraries, big part of it on farmers markets being a method family network having a community and a tribe.

327
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:16,067
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Marie Cassidy is a pure genius and creating that kind of community and sustaining it.

328
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:22,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just feel like this is, I feel so lucky that I found this, I found Medford as my home.

329
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:23,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

330
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:34,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we originally moved here in 99, the husband's been working for CJ Doherty Construction for pretty much his entire career.

331
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were living in Brighton at the time.

332
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:41,544
[SPEAKER_03]: So his commute from Brighton to Medford in a diesel truck was

333
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:49,018
[SPEAKER_03]: a task, let us say, because it was enough of a struggle.

334
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:51,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, I'm not tethered to this neighborhood.

335
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I work in downtown Boston.

336
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:55,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working at Fidelity at the time.

337
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:57,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we just find something closer?

338
00:27:57,263 --> 00:28:01,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a long time, Medford was just where we hung our hats and slept at night.

339
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were a little latecomer.

340
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,810
[SPEAKER_03]: We were latecomers to the parenting game.

341
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,932
[SPEAKER_03]: We were married five or six years before we had our kids.

342
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:18,195
[SPEAKER_03]: The great surprise to me was that we had something like the Metra Family Network.

343
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:21,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, there's a there's a place where other parents hang out.

344
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:23,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember walking to the grocery store with my infant coach.

345
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:24,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the parents?

346
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I need connection.

347
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm an extrovert.

348
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:31,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to to be in community with people.

349
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:34,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So to have something like that was so amazing.

350
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:39,706
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything that I take part in here, I'm kind of grew from that.

351
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:49,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Marie was on the podcast a little while ago and talked about how that is a place that she likes to recruit people for the family network is in the aisles of the grocery store.

352
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for now, there's nothing.

353
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're right.

354
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:57,243
[SPEAKER_02]: All the show shocked parents by what's happened.

355
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:57,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

356
00:28:58,364 --> 00:28:58,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

357
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw her the other day when she picked up a couple of copies of the book.

358
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So I stepped in.

359
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:04,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

360
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:06,170
[SPEAKER_03]: We made sure they were paper bags.

361
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,471
[SPEAKER_03]: So little kids didn't see the name.

362
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:09,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, true.

363
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:11,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

364
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:13,097
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

365
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:15,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else that you want to mention while we have you here, Judy?

366
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I think that's really I really just wanted to have an opportunity to, you know, talk to the community about the book.

367
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:27,027
[SPEAKER_03]: If people haven't heard about it, I'd love them to pick up a copy.

368
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:33,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Come listen on the 26th of January and really, you know, embrace human fuckery.

369
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:35,993
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't.

370
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:38,295
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have these insane moments in life and

371
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:42,716
[SPEAKER_03]: really just take a look at them and try to see the humor.

372
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:46,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may not be funny immediately, but it will eventually be funny.

373
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:48,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

374
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I didn't give too much away in my reflections on your book.

375
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: But if anything sounded funny or interesting, which it really was, check out Judy's book.

376
00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:57,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

377
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

378
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

379
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can't wait to read it.

380
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,841
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great to spend time with you.

381
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:03,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Likewise.

382
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:05,121
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

383
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:06,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again.

384
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:07,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

385
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:10,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, what's the name of the podcast?

386
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Never Bites!
