1
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:05,173
President services and public engagement committee meeting of Medford City Council clerk, please call the role.

2
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:06,173
Present.

3
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:26,979
Resolution 24015 offered by Councilor Sang, resolution to discuss modernizing City Council communication and outreach strategy.

4
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:33,606
I believe the only point on this was the discussion of the

5
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:39,036
we have a motion to approve.

6
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,396
Social media policy.

7
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:46,559
Draft which was drafted, which was submitted by counselor Lazaro.

8
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,281
Um, counselor, do you have a. Take it away.

9
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:51,402
If you have anything to present.

10
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,784
Yes So I am happy to hear any

11
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:27,128
want to consider adding that just came to me today was that we should mention, this is sort of an assumption, but it's probably best to include it in writing, is that in an effort to be proactive about our compliance with open meeting law, just to put in the policy that we would make sure not to have any counselors

12
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:39,825
not to have a quorum of counselors replying on a thread on social media, because that could constitute an open meeting law violation.

13
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:44,906
But that doesn't, it doesn't totally apply to what we would be talking about here, but it might help to just have it on the guidelines.

14
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:47,887
So that could be one amendment we can add to it.

15
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:50,628
But what this, what this basically outlines is that

16
00:01:53,562 --> 00:02:03,247
We could create social media accounts for the major social media, like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.

17
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,089
X, I guess, not Twitter.

18
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,871
And we could have it be a city council.

19
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,340
I don't have a Twitter, I don't know.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:29,548
So it could be a city council specific account, like the mayor's office has, a mayor's office specific account, but that doesn't cover city council specific business.

21
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:37,313
And this way we could share it, things that are applicable to our work.

22
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,893
Notifications about,

23
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:48,740
important meetings that might be coming up, or listening sessions, which we'll talk about later in this meeting, that kind of thing.

24
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,641
And this is just some broad guidelines about how those accounts would be handled.

25
00:02:56,321 --> 00:03:00,022
So I'm happy to make any adjustments, but this is just a starting point.

26
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:04,803
Any other counselors?

27
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:07,783
Councilor Callahan.

28
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:10,186
I'll just say I did read through the whole thing.

29
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:11,708
It seems pretty comprehensive.

30
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:17,576
I don't see any glaring omissions or anything that I would change at this moment.

31
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:21,942
Councilor Sang.

32
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:26,024
I wanted to thank you, Councilor Lazar, for working on this.

33
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:35,029
I know this was previously on my docket of my long to-do list, and you volunteered to take it off my list.

34
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,030
So that was very, very helpful.

35
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:42,754
I'm, I think, very ecstatic to see that this is so comprehensive.

36
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:44,295
I think it's very well done.

37
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:48,818
The nuggets that I thought were

38
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:55,162
particularly important legal language to put in, that language is in there, is in this draft.

39
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:56,562
I think this is very helpful.

40
00:03:56,582 --> 00:04:01,726
I think it's very clear, which is what we need if we are to have a social media account.

41
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:02,766
Thank you for your work.

42
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,471
Any comments from any of the councilors?

43
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:18,776
Any comments from members of the public on this particular agenda item?

44
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:28,465
Okay, seeing none, do we, I don't particularly have any comments on this.

45
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:29,726
The draft looks good.

46
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:32,087
I'd like to thank Councilor Lazaro for her work on this.

47
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:36,849
Just a question of procedure.

48
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:43,811
So would we want, Councilor Lazaro, it sounds like you had some recommended edits for it.

49
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,052
So would- Yes.

50
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:51,054
So I would suggest that we would add

51
00:04:52,177 --> 00:05:21,367
Um, maybe in the, um, maybe at the, at the end of the guide, the last section guidelines for official Medford city council use at a, at a bullet point that says no, a quorum of city councilors shall not comment on a thread on social media.

52
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:25,199
which would constitute an open meeting law violation.

53
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:26,239
Okay.

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,760
Councilor Callahan.

55
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:32,744
I'm not convinced that that is accurate, and I don't want to put that in here in case it is not accurate.

56
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:40,129
I think open meeting law is open meeting law, and we don't need to write our interpretation of open meeting law into this document, is what I would say.

57
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,830
That's fine with me.

58
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:49,255
I'm sort of being overzealous about it, so I'm comfortable with not.

59
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,337
I mean, it is my understanding that

60
00:05:54,577 --> 00:06:05,881
I, as a city councilor, can post whatever I want on X, like I can say my opinion on X, and it doesn't mean that other city councilors cannot also state their opinions on, and by X, I actually mean X Twitter.

61
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:13,003
I'm talking about the actual thing, not like a thing with the letter, not the algebra.

62
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:23,506
So this is why I'm concerned, because if we're putting into this some interpretation of open meeting law that I think may not be applicable

63
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:26,298
And it doesn't really matter whether I'm right or wrong.

64
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:33,081
It just, I think, matters whether we are 100% legally sure that that is, in fact, accurate.

65
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:35,342
And even if it's accurate, we already have opening law?

66
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:35,762
I don't know.

67
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:41,164
I just feel like it might be not necessarily and potentially inaccurate.

68
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:48,347
Plus, neither of us being lawyers, it's not really our business to interpret the law yet.

69
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:50,048
Here we are.

70
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:53,890
OK, I'm comfortable with that.

71
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,541
Okay, so Councillor Sang.

72
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,622
I would concur with Councillor Palahan.

73
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:20,507
I think we have a similar understanding of open meeting law, and I would be worried that something like that would constrain what we can say, and you know, oftentimes residents do want to hear from most, if not all of us on an issue.

74
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,528
As long as we're not debating it, it should be fine.

75
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:33,398
I'm also thinking the circumstances in which maybe we share something about a city event that will happen.

76
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,302
And there are people asking what time or what place that will be.

77
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:41,988
And let's just say in a given five minutes, just four of us choose to respond to that.

78
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,371
I don't want that to be a problem as well.

79
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:57,935
Also, given the fact that I think most of our postings will be retrospectives on what we have already done, I don't think OML is necessarily applicable in that situation.

80
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,957
And so I think open meeting law stands for itself.

81
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:04,718
That obviously overrides everything.

82
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:11,140
And so as long as we follow the law itself, we should be fine without having to hamstring ourselves unnecessarily.

83
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:15,426
Thank you.

84
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:17,287
Any other councilors?

85
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:21,030
Do we have any motions on the floor?

86
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,633
Councilor Callahan?

87
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:29,995
I move to approve the social media guidelines.

88
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,257
And refer it favorably out of committee.

89
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:34,258
I'm sorry?

90
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:35,359
I refer it out of committee.

91
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:35,759
Good.

92
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,620
Second.

93
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,103
Okay, a motion from Councilor Callahan to

94
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:48,182
approve the paper favorably out of committee, seconded by Councilor Lozaro.

95
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:50,803
Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

96
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:56,624
Councilor Callahan?

97
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:57,224
Yes.

98
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:58,284
Councilor Lozaro?

99
00:08:59,184 --> 00:08:59,424
Yes.

100
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:00,485
Councilor Scarpelli?

101
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:00,585
Yes.

102
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:02,585
Councilor Sands?

103
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:03,465
Yes.

104
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:05,066
Chair Monk?

105
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:05,666
Yes.

106
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:11,267
Motion on the affirmative, one no, motion passes.

107
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:15,503
I'm just gonna stop sharing my screen.

108
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:30,253
Resolution 24-069, resolution to discuss a modernization of the Human Rights Commission's enabling ordinance offered by Councilor Sang.

109
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:34,736
Do we, Councilor Sang, take it away.

110
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:36,494
Thank you so much.

111
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,135
I have some slides to share.

112
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:44,197
But before I start, I wanted to preface that this is the beginning of a process.

113
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:47,138
I'm not expecting that we'll pass anything tonight.

114
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,520
This will take a few months to work on.

115
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,581
And I want to make sure that we're doing it comprehensively.

116
00:09:53,601 --> 00:10:01,123
I know many of you are seeing this draft for the first time today or over the weekend.

117
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,464
I'm not really sure when it was sent out to folks.

118
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:10,006
And I want to make sure that people have the time they need to digest everything.

119
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:26,230
And so today, what I'm going to do today is give people context about why residents have reached out to me about initiating this process and to also give a cursory glance at a proposal that I'm putting out that addresses a lot of those concerns.

120
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:34,393
So with that being said, and I believe there are residents here to speak in favor of some reforms as well.

121
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:44,484
But with that being said, let me do this quick, quick PowerPoint that walks through the draft that you have in front of you guys.

122
00:10:47,385 --> 00:11:05,881
And so I just wanted to, again, give context for why modernize this ordinance, walk quickly section by section to give you a quick introduction of how the structure is, and propose some motions to moving forward.

123
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:20,788
So from talking to current and previous human rights commissioners, there have been a number of issues, actually quite a litany of issues that have come up with how the ordinance is drafted.

124
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:35,165
a lot of it stemming from the fact that this ordinance uses language for HRCs that date back decades, whereas the needs of communities have changed in the last few decades as well.

125
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:41,910
The first big thing that's more procedural is just unclear language that constricts the HRC's work.

126
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:47,655
Two very glaring examples are in the current draft that says that

127
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,189
there must be 10 meetings held.

128
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,670
But it's not entirely clear whether you can hold more than 10 meetings.

129
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:08,874
And given the amount of work the HRC is tasked with doing and the amount of time that the HRC has to hold a single meeting, oftentimes the work doesn't get done.

130
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:15,837
And so a lot of commissioners have reached out to me saying that they would like more time to work on issues.

131
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:21,161
And, you know, with the language that's currently in there, it's not clear.

132
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:26,866
It's, you know, some lawyers' understandings that they can, some lawyers' understandings that they cannot.

133
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,968
And so we need to clarify that language.

134
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:36,818
The other big layering procedural problem is the quorum for meetings.

135
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:47,130
We've been finding it very difficult to fill HRCE seats, partially because our retention rate is very low and a lot of commissioners are leaving in the middle of their terms.

136
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:49,352
But with that being said,

137
00:12:51,488 --> 00:13:01,913
without being at max members, the way that the current ordinance is written is that they need, I believe, five members to call a meeting to form quorum.

138
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:06,455
And oftentimes they're not at that because they only have six or seven members.

139
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,576
I believe there's one new commissioner there.

140
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:14,079
And so just as long as one or two of them are absent, meetings cannot be held.

141
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,701
And that really hamstrings the HRC's ability to do work.

142
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:40,515
I think the next big bucket, which I've heard a lot from previous commissioners and is a very big problem when it comes to retention, is just the duties that are assigned to the HRC and the interpretation of whether the HRC can do things beyond that duty that fulfill the purpose of the HRC.

143
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:42,536
So in other words,

144
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:45,659
In the current ordinance, there's a purpose section.

145
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,505
And there are a lot of things that the HRC could be doing that fulfill that purpose section.

146
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,628
So there is a legal argument that they can do that.

147
00:13:55,108 --> 00:14:05,298
But also, there's a duty section as well that's very restrictive and really strongly focuses on housing discrimination and enforcing decisions in housing discrimination cases.

148
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,924
And that obviously is one subset of what the HRC could be doing.

149
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:21,313
A lot of what the HRC currently, what they're hearing from residents that they want to do, it falls outside of housing discrimination.

150
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:31,802
And on top of that, a lot of HRC members don't feel equipped to deal with housing discrimination issues because they're not lawyers and because these are very deep, complex legal issues.

151
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,400
I, the other 2 points I basically covered within that.

152
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:42,322
I think the 3rd major thing is just some additional concerns.

153
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:47,404
More generally, the commission has not been historically the most diverse.

154
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:51,406
A lot of that is due to structural parts of this ordinance.

155
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,327
There's as we've.

156
00:14:54,787 --> 00:15:00,109
delved into the Youth Commission Ordinance and the Gender Equity Ordinance in a last City Council term.

157
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:10,574
These are ideas from Councillor Scarpelli is one of our advocates, Councillor Knight, Councillor Morrell, they've been leaders on those issues.

158
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:15,936
It became clear to us that there's a need to rethink the organizational structure of

159
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:21,502
the HRC in context with those organizations as well.

160
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:28,870
Hearing from city staff, there's a very strong desire to have members of those commissions, at least one member of those commissions sit on the HRC as well.

161
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:30,892
We need to enable that in some way.

162
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:34,336
There's also been a lack of a chair.

163
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:41,567
Um, in the HRC for many months, the current ordinance says that the chair has to be elected in June.

164
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,715
And that means for the last few months, there has, I believe there has been no chair.

165
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:50,850
And on top of that, there's a question of resources.

166
00:15:51,950 --> 00:16:02,733
The city is expecting that the HRC throws a lot of city events, like the Lunar New Year celebration, Black History Month celebrations, Juneteenth celebrations.

167
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:07,634
A lot of that money is currently coming out of the DAI budget, which is fine.

168
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:13,235
But it really hamstrings the HRC's ability to decide which events to hold.

169
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:20,648
the current process is just much more bureaucratic and less democratic.

170
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:28,291
Now, I think all that context is really important, so that's why I went slower through it.

171
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:35,556
These next few sections, I've just basically separated out the ordinance into different sections.

172
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:41,200
So the establishment and purpose, this is largely the same as the current ordinance.

173
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:48,905
We eventually may need to make some small updates, but that really depends on the duty section later on and what we put in there.

174
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,407
And so I didn't want to touch it for now.

175
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:58,970
The next section is about membership, appointments, terms, removal, and organization.

176
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:15,075
For context, I worked on this ordinance draft with previous HRC commissioners and residents who have worked really closely with the HRC, community groups that have worked really closely with the HRC to get the work they need done.

177
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:20,578
You know, this draft is a product of that of working with them.

178
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:25,621
And to make sure, you know, this is responsive to the needs.

179
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:33,544
And I wanted to bring this before the council in an introductory manner, because in the air transparency, essentially.

180
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:57,237
there's a desire to slightly expand the HRC, but to do so basically by working more closely with existing city commissions, new proposed city commissions, and community-based organizations, some of which the examples of are the Disabilities Commission, the Council on Aging.

181
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:01,499
If we create a Youth Commission or a Gender Equity Commission, members of those commissions

182
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:13,738
community groups like the West Bedford Community Center, different religious groups, possibly housing-related groups, MHA, for example.

183
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:24,063
And so instead of because we know that there's a problem with recruiting right now, there might be a fear that we're expanding.

184
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,284
But much of the expansion comes from existing groups.

185
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:35,026
We also recognize that we need to increase diversity.

186
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:54,512
And that's why there's language in here about creating a rotation of commissioners and leadership and providing stipends, all of which are things that studies have proven to work at the municipal level for increasing diversity, income-wise, gender, race, class, everything, profession-wise.

187
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,993
on municipal boards and commissions.

188
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:06,998
There's language in here that's equity-focused about receiving training on meeting operation and parliamentary procedure.

189
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:15,422
These are things that often scare away folks who aren't as experienced with city government from working in city government on boards and commissions.

190
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:24,367
And that would be something very simple, like a half-hour module at the start of a HRC term.

191
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:31,978
There's also language, I think I basically covered everything.

192
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:41,740
Everything that I haven't covered is essentially just aligning the HRC with current city commission ordinances that we have for other commissions.

193
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:50,642
So just language that wasn't put in there in the first place, but since we've passed that, we've started to put in every, the city council has started to put in every commission ordinance.

194
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:59,897
The next section, as I talked about quite a lot previously, there's a problem with meetings and quorums.

195
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:06,198
Again, so this aligns HRC with most City Commission ordinances.

196
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:12,560
It addresses those problems with scheduling and quorums, and it allows for some flexibility.

197
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,041
The 10-meeting-per-year thing, that's to ensure regularity of meetings to make sure the Commission is doing its work.

198
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:26,285
though this next sentence basically gives the commission flexibility to have more meetings to finish that work.

199
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:34,528
This next section about independence, resources, counsel.

200
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:44,973
A lot of this language is actually just taken from the current ordinance, but there is some additional language in here about addressing the resource problem.

201
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:48,875
Essentially, this is something that

202
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:58,190
The previous iteration of this committee that worked on the Youth Commission and the Gender Equity Commission ordinances which haven't been passed yet.

203
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:04,797
This is language that they approved of when it came to creating a small budget line item for them.

204
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:08,640
This is basically just to let them hold events like

205
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,763
the Lunar New Year celebration and stuff like that.

206
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:19,608
I think this will require some talking with the city administration to see how we divvy up between the HRC and between the DEI office.

207
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:25,212
But I imagine the funds would basically be under the same umbrella and so we're not really increasing funds.

208
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,055
per se, to the HRC.

209
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:40,046
We're just redistributing to give them a little bit more easier of a time to spend those funds, whereas right now it's, again, quite bureaucratic.

210
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:48,195
This is the longest section, but it is the last section, the roles, powers, and duties section.

211
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:54,319
Again, much of the current ordinance focuses on housing discrimination.

212
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,120
This addresses that.

213
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,744
Now, I think this is the section that maybe we would want to read through and edit the most.

214
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:06,827
Again, I'm not expecting anything to change today or anything to be passed today.

215
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:14,432
I want to give counselors and commissioners the time to read this and reflect and give written feedback on it.

216
00:22:14,952 --> 00:22:17,914
But this comes out of a lot of work that I've done

217
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:34,005
talking to that I've done with previous commissioners and community members that have worked with HRC about what types of powers and duties they would like to see explicitly laid out.

218
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:41,770
A lot of, again, actually most of this language comes from neighboring municipalities HRC ordinances.

219
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:50,092
It also removes duties that commissioners have articulated that they aren't qualified to do.

220
00:22:51,233 --> 00:23:07,196
Again, the current ordinance really expects them to do quite a lot of legal responsibilities that they shouldn't be doing because they're not lawyers and could end up putting our city in a dangerous position with our law department.

221
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:20,579
more or less averts that by shifting that responsibility to offices that actually have that legal staff and that capacity, particularly at the state level, to deal with situations like that.

222
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:30,569
And with that being said, I believe the next steps are, I would move to ask counselors to submit feedback

223
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:38,935
to the chair and me before the next resident services and public engagement committee meeting on the current draft that we have in front of us.

224
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:45,020
I would also move to ask HRC members, relevant city staff and legal staff for feedback.

225
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:59,933
I know that we have some residents here with us that potentially would want to speak on this, but I would be happy to hear from councillors first.

226
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,600
Council.

227
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,982
Thank you very much, Councilor Stang.

228
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:05,982
Councilor Scarpelli.

229
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:06,422
Thank you.

230
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,204
Councilor Stang, thank you very much for all your hard work.

231
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:11,605
This is well done.

232
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:16,207
I think that this is needed.

233
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,928
I think that we need to really

234
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:36,687
If I can, I think that I'll be making the recommendation for all of our future commissions to make sure that part of the membership appointment removal organization, there's a section in there that says that the members have to be residents of the city of Medford to make sure that that is spelt out.

235
00:24:37,428 --> 00:24:40,170
And then the other piece is the independent resources.

236
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:46,375
I think it's a slippery slope when we say that we provide adequate funding to retain its own council.

237
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:53,520
This just, it just leads away from something that I'm fearing is that we're still not really going all in with the city solicitor.

238
00:24:54,621 --> 00:25:08,050
I think if we put a city with, you know, the council with partnership with the city solicitor or their designee,

239
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:24,101
I think providing funding differently opens up another concern that we hear over and over again is in the community is where are where is all of our legal money going and what we're seeing even with our

240
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:33,115
Our warrants, it's more than, for what I've counted so far, it's over $400,000.

241
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:39,683
So I just want to make sure we keep a tight leash on that if we can.

242
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:41,105
But thank you for all your hard work.

243
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:43,101
Councillor Sang.

244
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:46,742
Thank you Councillor Scapelli for your kind comments.

245
00:25:48,102 --> 00:25:50,162
I would actually agree with that point.

246
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,123
I think that's a good note.

247
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:53,523
I'd be happy to make that amendment.

248
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:59,464
Of course, there's, you know, we have a lot of time to do this as well, but I think that makes a lot of sense.

249
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:00,624
Thank you.

250
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:08,566
Councillor Callahan.

251
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:13,056
I apologize, I've been looking for this as a document.

252
00:26:13,096 --> 00:26:18,418
Do we have this, was this sent to us or is it the one that's, oh, thank you so much.

253
00:26:18,438 --> 00:26:21,539
It's sitting right on the desk, looking in electronic form.

254
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:22,419
Thank you.

255
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:38,125
And an electronic copy of this document should be available in the meeting minutes of this, so that will be submitted.

256
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:43,202
Any other discussion from councilors?

257
00:26:45,964 --> 00:26:50,047
Do we have a second on the motions made by Councilor Sang?

258
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:54,410
Motions made by Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

259
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,451
Do we have any?

260
00:26:57,213 --> 00:27:00,535
Before we vote on that, I'm gonna open it up to public participation.

261
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,056
I'm sorry, could you repeat the motions?

262
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:07,881
Oh, they're on the end of Councilor Sang's slide right there.

263
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:10,015
you.

264
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:10,556
Uh yeah.

265
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:11,317
Good clerk.

266
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:12,458
Would you be able to read them out?

267
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:20,128
What I have is the councilor said I combined it into one motion as the councilor saying move to submit feedback to the chair and in councilor saying before the next meeting.

268
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:25,876
Uh and further moved to ask commission members relevant city staff and legal for feedback.

269
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:28,219
Thank you.

270
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:43,087
All right, if anybody would like to speak publicly on this matter, feel free to raise your hand on Zoom or step up to the podium if you're here in person.

271
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,671
Just say your name and address for the record, please.

272
00:27:51,095 --> 00:27:52,395
My name is Jennifer Yanko.

273
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:55,797
I live at 16 Monument Street in West Medford.

274
00:27:56,597 --> 00:27:58,517
I want to just support this.

275
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:03,059
I'm so excited that you all are working on this.

276
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:07,480
And I want to really thank Councilor Tsang for his work on it.

277
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:14,563
I think it's really important to have a vibrant Human Rights Commission, not just to

278
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:29,175
deal with cases where people's human rights have been violated, but looking at how, as a community, we can promote human rights and make sure that everyone in our community feels seen and respected.

279
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:40,826
And we can engage, a vibrant Human Rights Commission could also engage the community in thinking about what human rights are and how we can

280
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,108
really promote them.

281
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:46,449
So I'm really excited and I want to thank you all.

282
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:51,851
Thank you.

283
00:28:54,752 --> 00:29:03,856
Anybody on Zoom seeing a hand from Lunier Germanus, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

284
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:07,438
Please say your name and address for the record.

285
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:08,478
And yeah.

286
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:16,758
Hello, yes, Munir Jermainis out of the Three Savage Road in Medford.

287
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:27,362
I served several years at the Human Rights Commission, for which I was chair of the commission.

288
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:30,464
And I was aware

289
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:48,721
of the difficulties that the current ordinance pretty much restricts or is unclear about the actual duties of the Human Rights Commission.

290
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:59,723
And I am aware also the difficulty of recruiting members and of achieving forums in these meetings.

291
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:06,179
So I applaud Councillor Tsang for this effort.

292
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:24,462
And I think, hopefully, it will lead us to a more vibrant and representative Human Rights Commission that participates actively in the city of Medford.

293
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:26,123
Thank you all.

294
00:30:26,703 --> 00:30:28,023
And that's all I have to say.

295
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:32,409
Thank you.

296
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:39,895
David Harris can ask you to unmute and please state your name and address for the record once you're unmuted.

297
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,182
Mr. Harris, you're on mute.

298
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:52,384
I'm asking you to unmute.

299
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:53,764
There's a button on Zoom.

300
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:08,052
Oh, OK, there it goes.

301
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:08,953
I don't know what I was doing there.

302
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:09,973
I apologize.

303
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:10,933
I don't know what that was about.

304
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:12,914
So thank you very much.

305
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:15,255
I appreciate the opportunity to join you all tonight.

306
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:16,635
I'm going to speak very briefly.

307
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:17,916
My name is David Harris.

308
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:20,917
I live at 151 Sharon Street, West Medford.

309
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:22,657
I've been there for 29 years.

310
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:30,220
I'm a former chair of the Human Rights Commission, and I can't remember the exact years or for how long.

311
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:35,042
But it was very important work for me, and I really appreciated it and was glad to be able to serve the city.

312
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:39,923
I want to just start by saying I certainly endorse this effort.

313
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:48,006
I think it's long overdue, and I want to commend Chancellor Tsang and those who worked on this, on crafting this.

314
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:51,387
You know, and as I thought about

315
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:53,088
things to say today.

316
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:55,830
I mean, I'm an old man, so I always have something to say.

317
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,592
But I have almost 50 years in race and justice work.

318
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,373
And over that time, I've seen a lot of changes.

319
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:08,895
And I do think that the current ordinance is somewhat outdated.

320
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:10,656
I think it's unfortunate.

321
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:17,439
And I think that my experience as chair was that it was, in a way, we were hamstrung.

322
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:36,902
I think there were expectations of what we could or would do that were unrealistic, and that we weren't able to do what we really felt we needed to do, which was to create an organization that could serve and be responsive to the needs of the entire community of medical.

323
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:42,441
And as I thought about what to say today, I was looking back on my own career.

324
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:46,524
And there are two parts of my career.

325
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:49,987
I started out in the Commission on Civil Rights in 1975.

326
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:54,590
And at the time, there was a man named Arthur Fleming, who was the chair of the commission.

327
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:57,233
Arthur Fleming was an Eisenhower Republican.

328
00:32:57,293 --> 00:33:05,760
And for those of you who don't know what the Commission on Civil Rights was, it was a temporary agency created in the Eisenhower administration, which is still supposed to last for five years.

329
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,415
It has no enforcement power.

330
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:25,655
And Arthur Fleming used to always say to us that the power of the commission, which was a significant part of the fact-finding that went into the passage of civil rights laws, was moral suasion.

331
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:38,383
And he said, in the absence of enforcement power, it was really important that we marshal facts in ways and be able to talk about them in ways that could persuade those, even those who might be resistant, to embrace them.

332
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:48,950
I also spent some time working at HUD, which is one of the most, which enforces Title 8 and the Fair Housing Act, which is one of the most powerful enforcement tools in the country.

333
00:33:49,830 --> 00:34:03,537
And I think when Councilor Sang talks about the old ordinance being kind of fixated on housing discrimination and that kind of thing, I think it holds us back from meeting the needs of the current residents.

334
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:13,421
And so I don't want to go on and on, but I do commend him and I encourage you all to embrace this conversation fully.

335
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:18,344
And I look forward to the outcome and joining you again as you continue your deliberations.

336
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:18,904
Thank you.

337
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:24,129
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

338
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,491
Do we have anybody else from public?

339
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:37,379
Matthew Page Lieberman, seeing your hand raised on Zoom, please, I'm gonna ask you to unmute and please state your name and address for the record.

340
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:45,304
Yes, Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

341
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:50,388
While I do think this is a really good idea to revise the ordinance,

342
00:34:51,590 --> 00:35:04,041
From my observations of the commission, it's not what's on paper is not going to address the critical issues that the commission continues to struggle with.

343
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:11,108
I know from watching it that there was a process a while back where many commissioners

344
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,601
were discovering what was in the actual ordinance.

345
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:18,082
It was a process, and we were looking through it.

346
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:27,986
And I know from watching meetings that there have been people on the commission, even officers, that have said during meetings, they don't know what the commission does.

347
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:30,567
They don't really know what it's supposed to do.

348
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:39,950
And so if people don't have best practices where when they start in the commission, they receive the ordinance,

349
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:52,821
you know, where people talk to them about what a chair does, what a vice chair does, what the liaison's role is, then I don't really think this is going to address those core problems.

350
00:35:53,522 --> 00:36:04,405
One problem that I've definitely seen with many of our commissions is that you have liaisons making recommendations to the mayor of who to appoint.

351
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:09,686
The liaison's role is just to facilitate, you know, tech stuff to make sure that

352
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:12,744
meeting minutes are available, that Zoom is up.

353
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:21,209
But I happen to know that there are liaisons that make decisions about who can serve on these commissions based on their personal prerogatives.

354
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:30,515
I think that that's something that really, really needs to be addressed before we can have commissions that are really effective.

355
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:39,461
In my experience also, I think that commissioners have to play a role in trying to be expansive, trying to figure out really,

356
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:49,913
what they can do, and who they want on the commission, play a role in recruiting, in interviewing people, and showing that kind of interest.

357
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:56,076
And many of these commissions, I don't mean to pick on the Human Rights, although I know that this is a serious problem with the Human Rights Commission.

358
00:36:56,836 --> 00:37:00,438
This is the kind of stuff that we need to focus on.

359
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:07,661
And I'll comment, but I'm saying that's the bigger thing that we all have to figure out.

360
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:16,937
Thank you.

361
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:25,083
Do we have any other comments from either councillors or members of the public?

362
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:31,548
Okay.

363
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,112
Matthew, I could see your hand is still raised on Zoom.

364
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:41,115
Did you have something else you wanted to add?

365
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:44,377
Or sorry, you seem to have muted kind of suddenly, so I wasn't sure.

366
00:37:49,940 --> 00:38:03,543
Okay, well, so seeing no further discussion, Clerk, would you be able to read off the motions by Councilor Seng and then we'll take a vote on it?

367
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:16,305
Councilor Seng will submit the feedback to the chair and Councilor Seng before the next meeting and further move to ask commission members, relevant city staff and legal feedback to second Councilor Zia.

368
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:19,166
Okay, well, Clerk, can you please call the roll?

369
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:21,361
Yes.

370
00:38:21,962 --> 00:38:22,203
Yes.

371
00:38:22,263 --> 00:38:22,864
Yes.

372
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:23,565
Yes.

373
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:25,267
Five of the affirmative.

374
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:38,467
City Council.

375
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:45,129
24073 offered by counselors, Callahan saying and Lazaro resolution to establish City Council.

376
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:46,869
Listening sessions.

377
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,429
I understand that there are.

378
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:55,390
A few updates on this particular, um, uh, counselor

379
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:11,177
wanted to have some further discussions about just hashing out what exactly those listening sessions would look like.

380
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:17,801
So do we have any, do we have any councillors who want to talk about this?

381
00:39:18,642 --> 00:39:20,023
Councillor Lazaro.

382
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:25,615
I thought it would be in an effort to start things moving.

383
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:42,484
We don't have to keep this appointment, but I thought I would speak to Pam at the Council on Aging and who is at the Senior Center every day to just see if we could get a meeting on the books that when there are a million activities there every day.

384
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:47,947
So I thought we could try to find a time when it's not too busy

385
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,361
there's availability at the center.

386
00:39:50,441 --> 00:40:02,330
We wouldn't be able to go as a large group of counselors because it would be a quorum and we would obviously be discussing something of interest to, you know, the things that we talk about during our meetings.

387
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,731
So we would have to just be like one or two counselors.

388
00:40:05,332 --> 00:40:15,919
And we can talk about this more, but I imagine we would just sort of hear out folks' thoughts and then bring that back to our meetings, either hearing committee or regular meetings.

389
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:22,240
The date that she and I talked about was May 31st.

390
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,663
It's a Friday at about 10 o'clock.

391
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:31,694
But again, just for the sake of getting something scheduled,

392
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:39,564
And then we can kind of go from there, either reschedule it or see if we want to move forward with that time.

393
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:50,237
I did meet with Pam and talk about, you know, if that would be something that was of interest to people at the senior center and my thinking being that if we, if we kind of

394
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:55,079
start with something like the senior center and maybe the library.

395
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:15,155
Knowing that those spaces are already fully open to the public, anybody from Medford can come at any point, and there aren't any, from my perspective, there aren't any major barriers to people accessing those spaces.

396
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:21,866
It obviously isn't available for every single person in Medford But we know that they you don't have to like pay a fee.

397
00:41:21,886 --> 00:41:32,812
You don't have to be a member you just come So if we make ourselves available to at least a couple of places to begin with Then we can get started sooner rather than later.

398
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:43,179
And I thought that was a good place to begin and I fully agree with the sentiment that you know, it's important with a

399
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:53,115
public outreach and public engagement to get things moving, you know, as soon as we can earlier.

400
00:41:53,475 --> 00:42:05,362
So one thing that I have kind of been wondering just about the logistics of open meeting law is that do you think that if there's

401
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:14,733
say, like two counselors on one side of the room and just depending on the layout of the room, like one counselor in another room talking to a different group of people with that.

402
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:14,793
No.

403
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,242
I don't know, but I would think no.

404
00:42:20,262 --> 00:42:28,028
I think the better attitude would be for one or two counselors to just mostly record it being a listening session.

405
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:33,372
The attitude isn't really to be debating things necessarily.

406
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:37,095
It would just be to say, what do you care about?

407
00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:38,616
What do you want me to know?

408
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:41,559
What do you want me to share with the rest of the council?

409
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:47,761
rather than saying like, this is what I think and this is what we're, this is what I wanna do, right?

410
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,222
Cause then it's on a listening session anyway.

411
00:42:50,742 --> 00:43:02,046
So it's more like collecting the information and then relaying it to the rest of the group when we're in open meetings and then we could talk about it more thoroughly.

412
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:04,887
That's my thinking anyway.

413
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:08,889
Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Sang.

414
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,009
would you like Councilor Sang to go first?

415
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,330
Oh, Councilor Sang.

416
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,610
Thank you.

417
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,371
I'll be brief.

418
00:43:16,531 --> 00:43:18,391
I would agree with Councilor Lozano.

419
00:43:19,492 --> 00:43:24,673
I think that's the point of the listening sessions, although I think there's back and forth is natural.

420
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,334
I think the point of it should be to listen.

421
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,776
And, you know, if there is something that we can help clarify, because sometimes, you know, we're

422
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:36,598
you know, residents want us to do something that we're already doing.

423
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:40,922
I think that's fair game for us to say, oh, like, here's here's this.

424
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:42,983
Here's this thing that we're doing.

425
00:43:43,043 --> 00:43:44,084
Here's how you get plugged in.

426
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:49,048
These are we're holding a meeting about this on, you know, May 8th, for example.

427
00:43:49,068 --> 00:43:49,929
I think that's fair.

428
00:43:50,689 --> 00:44:00,937
But I yeah, I would think the main part of it is just to note down what folks are saying and asking and then bring it back to this group or

429
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:07,341
to the city council regular meeting as a whole.

430
00:44:09,122 --> 00:44:22,589
Yeah, I would say by record, I wouldn't necessarily say we should record with a camera or recorder because that may scare some people away, but we should definitely have at least one councilor jotting down the notes to bring back.

431
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:28,892
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

432
00:44:29,622 --> 00:44:33,446
Um, so I think just for logistics, we two things.

433
00:44:33,786 --> 00:44:43,455
Number one is that we should not have more than two counselors at each one of these, we should just decide that that is what we're going to do because I think it's impossible.

434
00:44:44,537 --> 00:44:49,738
to ensure that some policy that is upcoming won't be discussed.

435
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,599
Like that's just the nature of these things.

436
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,720
And so I think we should just decide no more than two councillors.

437
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,181
And then the question is, how do we make those decisions from a logistical standpoint?

438
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:07,163
The other question that I have is, and I know that we, I was the one who proposed that we have a subcommittee, that subcommittee has not met yet.

439
00:45:08,484 --> 00:45:12,445
Given that there is a subcommittee, even any two of us on that subcommittee

440
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,586
cannot appear at the listening session.

441
00:45:15,386 --> 00:45:23,129
So I'm wondering if perhaps, given that there's already a listening session later this month, if perhaps tonight we should disband the subcommittee.

442
00:45:23,669 --> 00:45:31,712
Even though it would be nice to have a subcommittee to discuss this, I think it might be more in the way, given open meeting law, then it will help.

443
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:34,213
And maybe we just have these discussions here.

444
00:45:36,713 --> 00:45:39,294
So I will make that as a motion, but I would love to discuss it.

445
00:45:39,314 --> 00:45:40,795
I'm not, you know, for sure,

446
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:43,301
that that is the right way to do things.

447
00:45:44,643 --> 00:45:54,535
On the motion of, well, first off, do we have a second on the motion of Councilor Callahan to disband the subcommittee that we established last meeting.

448
00:45:55,396 --> 00:45:56,918
Seconded by Councilor Lozaro.

449
00:45:57,619 --> 00:45:58,219
Councilor Sang.

450
00:45:59,347 --> 00:46:05,770
Um, I so I was also thinking about that counselor Callahan and I have a different proposal.

451
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:19,715
Um, I still think it could be valuable to have a subcommittee to help organize these things and to, you know, after, for example, after the senior center listening session to have subcommittee meeting to quickly review what went right.

452
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:20,495
What went wrong?

453
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:22,156
What are best practices?

454
00:46:22,276 --> 00:46:23,957
What should we do next time?

455
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:27,438
And so I almost think would be more useful to have.

456
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:36,921
to keep that subcommittee, but to have meetings organized where out of the two counselors who are there, one of them is a member of the subcommittee and one of them isn't.

457
00:46:38,602 --> 00:46:52,606
And that way, you have basically a subcommittee liaison who can help organize and, you know, come back to the subcommittee and say, okay, this went right at the session, this went wrong, handle emergencies that way.

458
00:46:52,986 --> 00:46:55,087
And one, you know, other counselor invited.

459
00:46:58,729 --> 00:46:59,069
Councilor.

460
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,310
Councillor Scarbelli.

461
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:08,835
So the previous resolution that I voted no on, and I'll probably vote no on this.

462
00:47:11,766 --> 00:47:26,009
We're making decisions where usually in the past, I know that this council here today, I'm the only one that's actually been part of a council with the city solicitor, sees the importance of that answer.

463
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:31,710
And I know my fellow councilors don't believe in spending money with KP Law, so requesting any

464
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:47,578
questions to go their way, I think I feel reluctant to vote on anything without understanding legal ramifications or what we should be directed by legal counsel.

465
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:54,542
I mean, we can talk all we want until we find ourselves in a tricky situation where we're then called on the carpet.

466
00:47:54,982 --> 00:48:00,085
And then because of those situations, we're then brought to

467
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:10,394
court for legal issues, and then it's blown up 30 fold, like the BJ situation a few years back.

468
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:21,482
So again, I would in the past have recommended to get legal counsel, but that's not the privy of this council anymore.

469
00:48:21,562 --> 00:48:25,185
So just wanted to share my two cents with this.

470
00:48:25,245 --> 00:48:25,565
Thank you.

471
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,427
Thank you, Councilor.

472
00:48:28,747 --> 00:48:30,849
Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Sang.

473
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:42,645
Through the chair, I would be super interested in understanding if there are any specific questions, what exactly would be asked of legal counsel?

474
00:48:45,847 --> 00:48:51,191
Councilor Scarpella, do you have a, whatever comes to mind?

475
00:48:52,171 --> 00:48:52,372
Yes.

476
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:54,513
Councilor Sang.

477
00:48:56,447 --> 00:48:56,867
Thank you.

478
00:48:56,988 --> 00:49:02,391
I think with regards to legal questions, I think oftentimes Councillor Scarpelli and I have very similar questions.

479
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:15,278
In this case, I would disagree because I think as long as we're playing it safe, there should be no question about the legality of any of this.

480
00:49:15,479 --> 00:49:16,779
This is something that happens.

481
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:23,043
It is innovative for Medford, but it isn't something that is unheard of.

482
00:49:25,825 --> 00:49:43,698
And essentially, again, as long as we play it safe with open meeting law, we make sure that no two members of a subcommittee, no three members of a regular committee, and no four members of the city council are meeting, I think we should be all right.

483
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:46,800
And I think the two figure then is very, very safe.

484
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:52,604
Councilor Callahan.

485
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:56,598
I would like to withdraw withdraw my previous motion and make a different motion.

486
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,740
Motion withdrawn.

487
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,482
What is your, what is the new motion.

488
00:50:01,723 --> 00:50:10,771
My new motion is that the chair of resident services committee will appoint which one or two city counselors would attend each listening session based upon their availability.

489
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:22,074
Okay, motion from Councillor Callahan to let the chair of the resident service, sorry, was that the chair of resident service?

490
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:33,398
Okay, the chair of the resident services and public engagement committee appoint councillors to attend these listening sessions based on one or two of them based on their availability.

491
00:50:33,478 --> 00:50:34,659
Do we have a second on that motion?

492
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,841
Seconded by Councillor Lazaro.

493
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:42,542
Any further discussion on the motion?

494
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,317
Okay.

495
00:50:49,738 --> 00:50:50,658
Clerk, please call the roll.

496
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:52,459
Yes.

497
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:53,799
Yes.

498
00:50:53,999 --> 00:50:54,219
Yes.

499
00:50:58,301 --> 00:50:58,541
Yes.

500
00:51:00,121 --> 00:51:00,401
Yes.

501
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:04,803
For in the affirmative one opposing motion passes.

502
00:51:04,823 --> 00:51:06,443
All right.

503
00:51:07,323 --> 00:51:08,904
So, let's see.

504
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:09,864
Are there any other.

505
00:51:09,884 --> 00:51:09,944
Yep.

506
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:21,589
Okay.

507
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:23,609
Yep.

508
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:25,930
Um, let's see.

509
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:33,872
Is there so I guess that would be you me or counselor saying, uh, I could let's see.

510
00:51:33,912 --> 00:51:37,933
I'm just trying to think of which ones that I have the contact information for.

511
00:51:37,953 --> 00:51:46,216
I could reach out to some of the community liaisons, but obviously, if other folks would like to do that as well, you know, it'd be perfectly free to.

512
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:55,000
Okay, so we'll set up a subcommittee to figure that out.

513
00:51:55,701 --> 00:52:06,267
And I'm not 100% sure, but do you think that we need to vote officially on saying this is the listening session at this time at the Senior Center?

514
00:52:07,348 --> 00:52:08,229
I think that we should.

515
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:10,150
Okay, we should.

516
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,431
I think that we should.

517
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:13,011
Okay.

518
00:52:13,512 --> 00:52:20,176
Motion to begin listening sessions with May 31st at the Senior Center at 10 a.m.

519
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:23,643
Okay, motion by Councillor Lazaro.

520
00:52:23,803 --> 00:52:24,843
Do we have a second?

521
00:52:24,903 --> 00:52:31,587
Seconded by Councillor Callahan to establish a listening session, May 31st at 10 a.m.

522
00:52:31,627 --> 00:52:32,648
at the Senior Centre.

523
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:37,331
Clerk, will you please call the roll when you're ready?

524
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:48,598
Councillor Callahan?

525
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:49,118
Yes.

526
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:54,274
Yes.

527
00:52:54,794 --> 00:52:55,034
Yes.

528
00:52:57,255 --> 00:52:57,495
Yes.

529
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,916
Four in the affirmative, one opposing.

530
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:01,337
Motion passes.

531
00:53:01,357 --> 00:53:05,178
Do we have any public participation?

532
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:07,079
Any members of the public would like to speak?

533
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,940
Just kind of looking at Zoom.

534
00:53:13,681 --> 00:53:13,841
Yep.

535
00:53:14,701 --> 00:53:17,662
Matthew Page Lieberman asking you to unmute.

536
00:53:17,682 --> 00:53:19,823
Please state your name and address for the record.

537
00:53:20,874 --> 00:53:23,136
Yes, Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

538
00:53:23,716 --> 00:53:28,700
I'm at the new portal that we have for the resolutions and everything.

539
00:53:29,261 --> 00:53:39,629
And I was wondering if the draft resolution for the HRC reboot or remodeling would be uploaded to there, or when it should be expected.

540
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:43,512
Because I mean, I don't see how I can get a copy of the draft to look over.

541
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah, so I apologize that that wasn't included in the agenda itself.

542
00:53:52,040 --> 00:54:00,866
There were just some late submissions, but I did verify with the clerk that we could still hold the meeting as long as it's in the meeting minutes.

543
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,847
So the- That's fine.

544
00:54:02,867 --> 00:54:06,690
That's fine, I just wanted to know where I could see a copy, that's all.

545
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:12,774
Oh, the meeting minutes are posted on the civic clerk website, right, with the agenda packets?

546
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:23,043
Okay, yeah, they should be they should be posted on the civic clerk website along with the agenda materials after approval by the council.

547
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:24,023
Okay.

548
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:25,284
Yep.

549
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:31,405
So and then and then people can still send in comments.

550
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:34,466
Yes, yes, you're more than free to send in comments.

551
00:54:34,486 --> 00:54:39,407
We didn't actually vote on anything related to that tonight.

552
00:54:40,507 --> 00:54:40,988
That's all good.

553
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:41,348
Thank you.

554
00:54:42,348 --> 00:54:42,568
Thank you.

555
00:54:44,631 --> 00:54:48,034
And it looks like all the public comments that we have.

556
00:54:48,094 --> 00:54:50,376
Do we have any, any motions on the floor.

557
00:54:51,317 --> 00:54:53,859
Council, Councilor Callahan motion to adjourn.

558
00:54:53,879 --> 00:54:54,500
Do we have a second.

559
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:57,843
Seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

560
00:54:57,903 --> 00:54:59,104
Clerk, will you please call the roll.

561
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:05,209
Yes.

562
00:55:10,697 --> 00:55:10,957
Yes.

563
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:12,339
Five to zero.

564
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:15,022
Oh, sorry.

565
00:55:15,403 --> 00:55:16,144
I am so sorry.

566
00:55:16,264 --> 00:55:18,006
I'm so sorry about that.

567
00:55:18,186 --> 00:55:20,008
So that was, that was a yes.

568
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:20,289
Correct.

569
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:22,792
Councillor saying I, yes, that was the yes.

570
00:55:23,913 --> 00:55:25,255
Five zero motion passes.

571
00:55:25,295 --> 00:55:26,076
Meeting is adjourned.

572
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:27,398
Thank you.

573
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:28,980
Thank you all for joining.
