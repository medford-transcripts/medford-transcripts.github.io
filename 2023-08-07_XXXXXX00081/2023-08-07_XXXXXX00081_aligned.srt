And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:42,613
Thanks so much for joining me.

10
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:47,318
If you don't mind introducing yourself, just with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:47,418
Sure.

12
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,622
I'm Emily Lazaro, Emily K. Lazaro.

13
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:56,208
My pronouns are she, her, and I am running for city council.

14
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:01,925
Emily, we do know each other, but this is the first time I've heard you pronounce your last name, so that's helpful.

15
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:04,486
Oh my gosh, that's funny.

16
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:05,647
Well, yeah, thanks for being here.

17
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:13,510
And we do hope to talk about your run for city council, but before we get to that, if you could just share your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,530
Yeah.

19
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:16,671
Oh God, there's a lot to choose from.

20
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:19,813
My favorite place to eat in Medford, I think,

21
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:26,436
Ooh, oh, it's apples and oranges, you know, because I really like Real Gusto a ton.

22
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:30,458
I think their pizza is amazing, but I also really like Tenocht a lot.

23
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:31,839
It's like a different thing.

24
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:35,702
It's just, I don't think I could put them in competition with each other.

25
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,885
Yeah, they seem like, yeah, apples and oranges for sure.

26
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:45,371
I think that real gusto is like our standby for like, we're gonna go out to eat before a show at the Chevalier, like that's where we'll go, we know we like the food there.

27
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:54,680
It's so nice that it's, there's the Chevalier bringing in like really big shows, brings in so many people to the square and they get to experience the food that they might not have like tried before.

28
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:55,782
Oh, also Bob's!

29
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,663
Oh, there's so many places!

30
00:01:57,924 --> 00:01:58,745
Bob's is so good.

31
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:02,945
I haven't spent a lot of time there, but I hear about that one a lot.

32
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:03,666
It's really good.

33
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:04,407
Eggplant Parm.

34
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,250
Check it out.

35
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:08,051
Awesome.

36
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:12,536
So yeah, so we wanted to have you on today to talk about your run for city council.

37
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:18,223
So if you don't mind just sort of describing your path to local politics or how you decided to run for city council in Medford.

38
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:19,107
Totally.

39
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:29,999
Well, I, a few years ago, worked as the executive assistant to the superintendent of schools in Medford for Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, and I really, really loved working for her.

40
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,739
She was amazing.

41
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:33,682
And while I was there, that role

42
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:54,356
does a lot of work with the school committee because the superintendent is always present at the school committee meetings, her office sets the agenda, in that role I was like posting open meeting notices, there was a lot of sort of like clerical work to do with school committee and I learned a ton about the incidents of local government through that.

43
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:59,348
Prior to working for the superintendent, I worked in the state house for a senator.

44
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:00,868
Before that, I interned for Rep.

45
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,349
Christine Barber, who represents part of Medford.

46
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,391
And all of those experiences were wonderful.

47
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,011
And actually, I've gone backwards.

48
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,832
I'm going back in time instead of starting at the beginning.

49
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:21,056
But in 2016, I decided to go back to school and get a graduate certificate in gender leadership and public policy at UMass Boston.

50
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:26,619
So, uh, I learned a ton about public policy, a lot about it.

51
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:36,946
That program is really incredible about, um, giving students an approach that's really acknowledges, uh, intersecting marginalizations.

52
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,807
What's the word for that?

53
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:40,588
Uh, intersectional feminism.

54
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:40,889
Yes.

55
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,089
So it's public.

56
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,653
I know that it's public policy through a lens of intersectional feminism.

57
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:48,294
So it was really valuable for me.

58
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:50,075
It was like conversations that people started.

59
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,156
Having more widely in 2020.

60
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:54,318
I had been having a night 2017 2018.

61
00:03:54,838 --> 00:04:09,928
So I Was really glad to see that sort of shift Culturally, but anyway, so I had been studying public policy I was thinking I would be like a legislative aide forever and I really didn't think about running for office but that's when they start sort of saying, you know, like I

62
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:18,668
We had a speaker one day who was like, women need to be asked seven times to run for office, so let me be the first to just ask all of you to run for office please.

63
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:22,288
And suggest that it's a good idea and you can do it.

64
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:24,989
So we're kind of moving forward through that.

65
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:37,832
Then working with the superintendent, I saw a lot of how the city worked and the reason I decided, really I decided a couple of years ago I was gonna do this and I've been sort of gearing up for it in my mind.

66
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:51,613
The reason I decided I wanted to run for city council instead of school committee was because I saw most of the people on the committee were, I was in agreement with their policy ideas, but the thing that they needed more of was money.

67
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:57,315
And I know that that's something that I could have greater influence on from the city council side.

68
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:02,177
I know that the schools need money to achieve the policies that they want to achieve.

69
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:15,009
And the, the greatest way to be able to accomplish the things, accomplish your goals is to have enough funding.

70
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,630
So, um, so that's how we got here.

71
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,371
It's been, it's been a logical journey for me, but I understand why people would be like, why aren't you running for a school committee?

72
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:27,453
And, um, uh, a bunch of people said they weren't running after I had.

73
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,955
already kind of decided to do city council.

74
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:33,716
So, you know, I think they're all super valuable positions though.

75
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:39,159
Another reason though is that city council is heavily male and I think they could use a little bit more female representation.

76
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:53,086
That question was in my mind as you were talking, especially talking about your, um, your work with the superintendent, but then also in my mind was that same, the same idea of like, why would I ask a woman and I haven't been asking the male candidates, right?

77
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,547
Why they're not running for school committee.

78
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,787
So I think it's a great point.

79
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,008
And, and it sounds like,

80
00:05:57,388 --> 00:06:06,957
in the last couple of years, there have been more people, more women running for city council, definitely more women elected, more women running this time, so that's exciting to see.

81
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,038
Yeah, it's very cool.

82
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:08,739
It's exciting.

83
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:19,208
Yeah, I mean, it feels almost retrograde to say I'm running because we need more women representing on the city council.

84
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,631
It seems so basic to me, but we still need it.

85
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:34,254
I think it's interesting to think about your experience with policy and just observing what's going on in local politics over the last several years.

86
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:41,036
I think a lot of people became more engaged during COVID when we could just watch City Council over Zoom.

87
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:48,538
I wonder what your critiques are, what you'd see as elements of our city government that you'd see as priorities for change.

88
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:49,964
Yeah, absolutely.

89
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:56,879
Well, I mean, my priorities have a lot to do with some of the work I've done over the past few years with the Malden Warming Center.

90
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,485
I'm the assistant director of the Malden Warming Center.

91
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,389
which is a seasonal homeless shelter in Malden.

92
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,231
And we're open December to March.

93
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:12,054
And in the off season, we do like fundraising projects and various preparation things.

94
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:18,757
But it's, it's a service that is run by a nonprofit with a ton of support from the city of Malden.

95
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:40,375
And Medford doesn't have an equivalent to that or actually doesn't have an equivalent to a lot of the services you find in surrounding communities for addiction, um, for just housing security, um, people who are under threat of being evicted, people who are, have like food insecurity.

96
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:43,117
All of these things are not, there's not like a.

97
00:07:44,037 --> 00:08:01,651
a well of services in Medford and a really high priority for me is making sure that we're able to take care of everybody who lives in Medford and sort of bolster the support services that they might receive on the state level or the federal level.

98
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,214
Medford has more that it can offer, I think.

99
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:08,136
So that's one of my biggest priorities.

100
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:14,320
I think another thing that is important is making sure that we're prioritizing bringing revenue into the city.

101
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:29,511
So funneling funds to the areas that need it most and making sure that we're thinking deeply about how to thrive as a community and how to make sure that we're fully funding places like the library and the schools.

102
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,735
I think that's an interesting point that I haven't heard a lot of people talk about.

103
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:49,549
I think we hear a lot about development and bringing businesses into the city and increasing revenue, and not necessarily how that relates to maybe the people in Medford that are struggling, the folks that you're naming.

104
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:55,294
Struggling with staying house, struggling with mental health addiction, and how those things

105
00:08:56,215 --> 00:09:00,877
I think are often talked about separately or maybe not at all and how they really can be connected.

106
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:07,979
The income inequality in this city is really a tricky situation.

107
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:16,502
I think a lot of people who have come recently are much more interested in giving back to their community, a community that's supporting them, that's giving them a lot.

108
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:20,785
they're like, well, we should absolutely be taking care of everybody who lives here.

109
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:26,349
But the opportunity doesn't necessarily present itself if the city isn't pushing those priorities.

110
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:27,610
Yeah.

111
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:34,976
And I think that's a question that we kind of always try to think about when we're talking to people running for public office is like,

112
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:42,522
What do you see as like inequitable in the city and how do you, what do you see as like a way to try to address that?

113
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:43,022
Yeah.

114
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:54,289
Uh, I, I do think that there, there is an incredible amount of political will in Medford to take care of people on an elemental level.

115
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:01,855
Like, you know, we have free food pantries all over the place that are just, you know,

116
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,263
people walking by and like putting a bag of rice in there and taking it as needed.

117
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:11,787
Um, and like people want to help, but those small scale things are kind of stop gaps.

118
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:23,956
Um, there are food pantries, but they're run largely by nonprofit organizations, churches, and not, not with support from the city that I think we could encourage.

119
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:29,542
Yeah, no, it does remind me of sort of like the way, like our federal government is modeled, right?

120
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:34,786
That like, there are these small measures that sort of help to keep people where they're at, basically.

121
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:35,226
Like, right.

122
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,847
Like we'll do, and community efforts.

123
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:46,754
Like, I think like the, some, some groups in the city, like the, like Everything is Free Medford do a great job of sort of trying to support each other in an informal way, right?

124
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:53,639
But there could be something that comes more as like a city initiative that would be more sort of long lasting and sustainable.

125
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:53,779
Yeah.

126
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:54,382
Totally.

127
00:10:54,422 --> 00:11:05,090
I mean, city governments are made up of the people that live there and it's all, um, it's mutual aid and people are doing it on their own, but with greater infrastructure to support that, that could only be more powerful.

128
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:05,550
Yeah.

129
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,772
Are there examples from other cities that you would like?

130
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:14,437
Well, the one I know the most about is Malden and Malden is a lower income community than Medford, but it doesn't.

131
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:19,559
Income doesn't necessarily influence addiction and mental health issues.

132
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,021
And that's most of what we see as our guests at the Malden Warming Center.

133
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:28,963
So Malden supports the Warming Center because they have a whole department where

134
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:33,025
Folks on staff with the city work as recovery coaches.

135
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:50,157
They come every night to the center They have conversations with the guests if they need help Connecting to resources in the city or resources and other nonprofit organizations those folks who are deeply connected with city government know how to point them in the right direction and also have

136
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:56,238
lived experience of going through addiction and overcoming it and being in active recovery.

137
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,319
They can bring them to meetings.

138
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:07,240
They use like a city van to take anybody who wants to to an AA meeting once a week.

139
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,022
I mean, these are the kinds of things that can help support people in your town who need help.

140
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:18,302
And I believe that there have been recovery coaches in Medford before.

141
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:20,003
I'm not sure if there are now.

142
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:25,109
Another thing is even if these services are available, they're not super accessible.

143
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:34,181
If it's not super easy to find out, if you're somebody who's really struggling and you're trying to find help, if it's not available to you easily, then that's another barrier.

144
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,925
I think what you're describing in Malden is also like this.

145
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:45,268
you might have the systems in place or the services in place, but that sort of trust of the residents to access those services is really important.

146
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,669
We do have a great city social worker in Medford, Alicia Gambino.

147
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:49,709
She used to be a recovery coach.

148
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,310
I know she and the public health department are trying to expand that program.

149
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:01,552
And I think it took something like COVID to really highlight all the work that those folks do and to try to expand that program.

150
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:05,633
But you're right, I think the resources need to be allocated in that way for sure.

151
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:06,433
Yeah, definitely.

152
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:14,249
Great, so anything else that you're kind of working on or anything else that's sort of important for us to know about your campaign?

153
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:16,371
I don't know.

154
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,453
Well, right now I'm really in the fundraising zone.

155
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:33,163
You need money to sort of access a lot of the resources that are available in the larger sort of national parties and lists of voters and people to talk to and how to send out mailings and stuff.

156
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:37,326
So it's really like, it's very expensive to run a campaign, even just for a city.

157
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:45,934
So that's where I'm at right now, and I'm also just doing my best to try to meet people and have conversations and hear what people want out of their local government.

158
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:54,081
So we know each other because we do boot camp together, but it's not like real boot camp, like exercise boot camp.

159
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,484
But we also have kids in the school system.

160
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,424
My kids go to the Brooks.

161
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:04,309
They're entering first grade and third grade, which is really, oh, it's a sweet spot.

162
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:05,409
It's good stuff.

163
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,470
They're like fun.

164
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:13,535
They remain messy, but they're fun and they can entertain themselves.

165
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:17,318
And the messiness, I'm sure, will continue through their 20s.

166
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:19,359
I don't know when that stops.

167
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,255
But yeah, so I'm a mom in town.

168
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,797
I, you know, I really like running.

169
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,838
You might see me running this summer.

170
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:44,648
And, you know, I have a lot of interests outside of local government, but I think that people with well-rounded lives coming in and saying, you know, like, this is my experience in the city and this is where I see room to grow and improve, that's a great thing.

171
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:54,148
writer, working on a revision of my novel right now, and there's a lot going on, but it's all fun stuff.

172
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:56,010
It's all, like, soul-filling, you know?

173
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:09,840
Yeah, it sounds very community-oriented, so I kind of wonder, like, what, if you could share sort of what, like, I think everybody, everybody lives somewhere, right, but not everyone is so connected to the places that they live, and I wonder what kind of connects you to Medford, what

174
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,281
What do you kind of appreciate about the community here?

175
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,522
Yeah, oh, Medford is the best place I've ever lived.

176
00:15:14,562 --> 00:15:16,143
I've lived, so I grew up in Connecticut.

177
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,643
My family's from Worcester.

178
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:20,845
I moved to Boston for college, and I stuck around.

179
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:21,465
I went to BU.

180
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:26,728
And I lived in Boston, Roslindale.

181
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:29,349
I lived in Cambridge and Somerville.

182
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:38,113
And then, you know, we sort of got, we followed this, like, millennial pattern of getting pushed out of cities closer to the center of Boston.

183
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:40,154
because it was too expensive.

184
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:52,544
It got more and more expensive and we kind of rode the wave out to Medford and then we we bought our home seven years ago and it's such a wonderful place to live.

185
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:58,128
It's really got a great amount of diversity of

186
00:16:01,182 --> 00:16:14,252
racial diversity, but also income diversity and people with different life experiences and coming from different perspectives and different places and all coming together to live, to like sort of cultivate this beautiful community that we have.

187
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:17,375
You really see that when you're involved with the public schools in town, I think.

188
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:23,519
Um, and, uh, you know, it's a beautiful place to live and it's super convenient.

189
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,544
And even though they took away my favorite express bus to Boston, that's the MBTA's fault, not Medford's, but that was a good bus.

190
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:31,324
Oh man.

191
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:33,265
Take the HOV lane.

192
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,347
It was beautiful.

193
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:39,530
But it's like 354, 356, I think.

194
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,290
Maybe both of them.

195
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:43,532
Um, I really love living in Medford though.

196
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:44,533
I think it's really beautiful.

197
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:45,894
Um, it's got,

198
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,574
lakes, it's got the nature, I mean, the fells.

199
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:57,158
So I don't know, it's just like a really, I really love living in Medford.

200
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:00,721
I loved like, like the festival, Circle the Square was so fun.

201
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,542
I got my tarot cards read.

202
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,044
It was amazing.

203
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,145
That scares me a little bit.

204
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,407
No, it's a little scary, it's a little scary, but it was all good stuff.

205
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,268
It was positive.

206
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:13,312
It was really fun.

207
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:17,598
My daughter got henna and face painting and it was the best.

208
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,020
I could have stayed there all day.

209
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,844
I'm going to go to the farmer's market today.

210
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:24,287
It's just a really good community.

211
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,434
makes me feel really grounded and connected living here.

212
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:31,394
I agree.

213
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:32,974
Yeah.

214
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:37,975
And so we try to kind of provide more like humanize you a little bit.

215
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:38,076
Sure.

216
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:41,276
Politicians sometimes can feel a little like sterile.

217
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:46,817
So I wonder if you could share something about yourself that maybe people don't know or might surprise us.

218
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:47,498
Oh, okay.

219
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:48,638
Oh, I got a good one.

220
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:49,298
Okay.

221
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:56,122
Okay, so I went to BU for theater and I studied, it's like a conservatory style acting program.

222
00:17:56,802 --> 00:18:02,926
So I did that and after graduating, I worked as an actor for a while.

223
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:05,648
I did like small local theater.

224
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,451
I also was a playwright, but Massachusetts has this

225
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,611
tax break for film companies that shoot in Massachusetts.

226
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:24,094
So, you know, a lot of movies are set here and some of them that are set in like Alaska will shoot in Massachusetts because there's a tax break and it's easier to get here than to get to Alaska.

227
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:26,775
I'm thinking of The Proposal with Cinderbuck specifically.

228
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:27,715
They shot that in Rockport.

229
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:33,657
Yeah, so a lot of people that I know from like the theater community are like in the background in that movie.

230
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,657
It's really funny.

231
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:36,678
But I actually was in

232
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,212
an HBO show that shot here.

233
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:44,275
It was a miniseries called Olive Kittredge, and it was shot in Essex.

234
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:46,096
Oh, I didn't know about that book.

235
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:47,237
Yeah, the book is amazing.

236
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:49,639
And I love the second book, too, Olive Again.

237
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,081
It's Elizabeth Strout.

238
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:52,582
She's an incredible writer.

239
00:18:53,142 --> 00:19:01,289
So Frances McDormand optioned this book, and HBO made a four-part miniseries, and I was in one of the episodes.

240
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,150
I had, like, seven lines.

241
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,753
But you can't really even barely see my face.

242
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:09,815
we know you're there, but I was in it.

243
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:15,480
And sometimes I still get like residual checks for like 13 cents for like a foreign.

244
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,660
I don't know.

245
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,122
It's something I don't understand, but I'm like cashing it.

246
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:21,044
Great.

247
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:21,684
It's very fun.

248
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:23,106
Cool.

249
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,948
And what about like any advice you receive that you'd want to pass on?

250
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:27,849
Oh, interesting.

251
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:45,562
Something actually that Kit Collins said to me recently that I've been trying hard to remember because my I think a lot of people who end up in local politics or, I mean a lot of different fields that where I find myself can be.

252
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:52,552
people who give a lot of themselves to, um, causes or other people.

253
00:19:53,893 --> 00:20:02,940
She said to me, you have to be really careful with your time, really conscious of how you protect your time, kind of.

254
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:10,966
So make sure that you're doing stuff that's like, I think this, this qualifies like for your whole life, people's whole lives.

255
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:11,147
Like,

256
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:14,248
What am I saying yes to and what am I saying no to?

257
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:19,555
And am I saying yes to something for somebody else that is not sort of feeding my soul?

258
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:23,480
And am I saying no to something I really want to do because I'm afraid?

259
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,522
All of these things kind of like...

260
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:32,332
Protecting your time, the way I need to think of it is I say yes to everything, all the time.

261
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:40,899
And being more, a little bit more strategic, but mostly so that I can like, I know for myself, I would love to be in bed at 9.30 every night.

262
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,563
So every opportunity that I can take to do that, I need to take it.

263
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:52,790
And when it's unavoidable, or the balance to that is like, it's gonna be so fun that it's worth staying up till like,

264
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,793
11.

265
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,793
Like a city council budget meeting.

266
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:58,096
Well, like a city council budget meeting, I know.

267
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,959
This year wasn't as late as previous years.

268
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,581
I didn't stay up for the whole thing.

269
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:04,588
I am tired.

270
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:05,289
I get tired.

271
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,251
But it was only until like 12-15.

272
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:10,472
But last time, last year, I think it was like 1-32.

273
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:12,774
So late.

274
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:13,895
So crazy.

275
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:14,755
You can't do that every year.

276
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:16,396
Yeah.

277
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:20,139
We didn't get into that, but yeah, a whole conversation there about that whole thing.

278
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:20,379
Oh yeah.

279
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:21,460
No, it's very interesting.

280
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,041
Very interesting conversation.

281
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:23,241
Yeah.

282
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:24,302
Well, thank you.

283
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:26,063
Is there anything else you want to add before we wrap up?

284
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:27,143
No.

285
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:40,346
One thing I will add, if we're humanizing each other here, Danielle, who never gets humanized on this podcast, I don't think, is, everybody should know, an excellent and intimidating broad jumper.

286
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:43,047
Your broad jumps are so far.

287
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,508
It's so frustrating, because I try to do it.

288
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:51,629
I do these little bunny hops across the court in car park, and Danielle leaps like a gazelle.

289
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,650
It's annoying and impressive.

290
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,190
I have been called a gazelle before.

291
00:21:57,573 --> 00:22:00,577
I do think I'm the only person in that group that's never had a baby, so.

292
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:02,981
Well, great.

293
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:03,822
Well, thank you, Emily.

294
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:07,307
Yes, thank you so much for coming and asking me questions.

295
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:08,128
It was fun.

296
00:22:08,148 --> 00:22:08,989
Good luck in November.

297
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:09,550
Thank you.

298
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,359
Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.
