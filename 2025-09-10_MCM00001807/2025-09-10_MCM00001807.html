    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=390.545">So</a>  thank you all so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=392.167">Again,</a>  the intention of this brief meeting, separate meeting, is to have a discussion about funding housing development or construction projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=403.178">Currently,</a>  right now, the CPC has been receiving those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=406.101">They</a>  have been very few and far between. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=407.682">We</a>  haven't really received one in a couple of cycles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=411.17">Um,</a>  but largely it's been walking court redevelopment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=414.072">We've,</a>  we've been a good heavy investor in that project as well as fells way West, which is project that should be, um, we stopped by the end of this year, which is very exciting stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=426.221">Um,</a>  but that being said, I don't think anybody on the board would lay claim on the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=432.125">Uh,</a>  the CPC would lay claim to being a housing expert that knows everything there is to know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=436.669">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=437.367">We're</a>  all well-intentioned folks that have our own expertise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=441.409">Maybe</a>  Roberta here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=443.631">So</a>  we're so excited that the trust is coming on board with such strong expertise and skill sets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=448.533">Kayla,</a>  I mean, the stuff that you know must be insane. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=453.056">So</a>  we've got all these great people put in the right places together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=456.898">So</a>  going forward, perhaps it might be best. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=459.64">There</a>  have been some internal discussions with chair people only. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=463.522">about</a>  how do we balance this going forward? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=466.343">And</a>  the consensus of the few folks that I've talked to internally is it might be best if we shift those development requests over to the trust and kind of take it out of the CPC's hands just so it goes in front of the experts who know all the right questions to ask and know where there could be potential pitfalls and what have you.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=486.353">And</a>  so what does that mean in terms of our mission is to spend a certain percentage of our funds <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=493.633">on</a>  affordable housing every cycle, minimum of 10, but we've always tried to do a third, a third, a third, roughly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=499.675">Does</a>  that change under this calculus?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=503.776">No,</a>  because we're held to a standard of committing our funds for housing development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=509.798">That</a>  does include if we just shift our money to the trust for them to distribute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=515.18">It's</a>  still CPA money doing housing efforts out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=518.261">So</a>  it still counts towards our goals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=521.021">Roberta,</a>  did you have anything else to add to that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=523.963">as</a>  a member?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=524.903">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=526.564">Yeah,</a>  no, I think that that explains it pretty well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=529.724">The</a>  difference would be that instead of the applicants like the Medford Housing Authority coming to the CPC to apply for funding during our funding cycle, the idea is that the CPC, the housing trust would request money at the CPC and the CPC would give the money to the housing trust <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=553.87">And</a>  then that applicant, but, for example, man for housing authority would ask the housing trust or the funds to spend the money instead of the CPC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=564.745">Would</a>  we be allowing so.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001830_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=572.002">So</a>  with the Medford House, for example, the Medford Housing Authority, would they now, for all future funding requests, only go to the housing trust? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=579.245">Or</a>  would there still be an avenue for them to apply traditionally to CPC? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=585.728">And</a>  the reason I'm asking this is because, as you guys know, but the housing trust members don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=590.269">I</a>  work in Lexington at that housing authority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=593.491">I'm</a>  involved with CPC and housing trust there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=596.072">And</a>  they're going through this very similar debate <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=599.753">And</a>  as a housing authority director, I felt it was necessary to keep that avenue there for the housing authority to go traditional, just in case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=610.516">Of</a>  course, the Housing Trust right now is super supportive of housing authority goals and the mission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=615.917">And</a>  it's a really collaborative effort. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=618.118">Who</a>  knows down the road? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=619.198">And</a>  I'm just saying, you know what I mean, hypothetically? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=621.238">Is</a>  it smart? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=624.56">to</a>  keep the door open for that sort of thing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=626.942">Or</a>  do, and I totally understand the benefit and just like, here's our pot of money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=632.285">Go</a>  there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=632.946">Now</a>  you guys go there and you can go there any time of the year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=634.967">Like</a>  you're not bound by these crazy application deadlines and all that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=638.129">So</a>  I just, those are things that I've been thinking about lately.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=642.152">Those</a>  are some good thoughts, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=646.335">Lisa,</a>  I want to invite you to have any, feel free to jump in here, but personally, I think <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=654.317">I</a>  see the benefit of having another avenue for our applicants here, but I also see the benefit of streamlining the process so they have an expectation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=664.744">So</a>  all the same people are looking at the same type of projects with the same pot of money.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001830_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=668.946">Right,</a>  and it helps with budgeting, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=672.108">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=673.089">The</a>  housing authority can say, hey, housing trust, we're anticipating x amount this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=677.632">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=680.778">Are</a>  there other affordable housing type projects that we might receive applications for that wouldn't necessarily go to the trust?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=688.424">An</a>  excellent question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=690.126">Right</a>  now, most of, aside from those, those choice few development projects, we also, the CPC also funds service programs that help folks with startup costs, moving costs, as well as help with that rental arrears. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=706.439">So</a>  we do have these service programs that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=709.35">I</a>  think can continue to live in CPA because, you know, I have a good relationship with them and it's a light lift. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=715.795">So</a>  I think that we could retain the service aspect of it, but the true development construction elements might be better over in the trust.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=725.983">I</a>  jumped, I would, I would add that a reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=732.513">A</a>  value that the Affordable Housing Trust brings to determining how to spend construction, funds on construction projects, is the expertise that the trust members have, which is, surpasses the expertise that the CPC members have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=752.699">So,</a>  you know, I hear that the possibility that there could be a strain in relationship in the future, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=762.203">I</a>  think at the present time, it makes a lot of sense to lean on the trust expertise to be able to establish a program and set terms that are really an efficient and favorable use of the city's money for affordable housing and construction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=783.131">So</a>  to also like, I'm sorry, Lisa.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=784.852">I</a>  was just going to say, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=786.402">I</a>  can appreciate having two streams of funding and an applicant being able to go to the CPC as well as the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, but in the cases where, and not that it would happen, but in the cases where, what happens when the Affordable Housing Trust is looking at an application and their debt service ratios aren't as up to stock, this doesn't meet the, what's it, 3.5, 1.0, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=816.118">and</a>  we decide that maybe we're not gonna fund the whole thing, or we decide not to fund it at the time, and then they come over to the CPC, and then that actually adds to the tension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=829.146">That</a>  gap would probably be more disruptive to the applicant in not knowing, because the Affordable Housing Trust Fund has a set standard of going in, we're looking at the funding, we're looking at the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=845.775">We're</a>  looking at the development, the tenant selection, the schedule of time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=851.798">I</a>  assume you all do the same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=855.7">We've</a>  got the people with a background in the housing development field that may add the extra benefit of just having one place to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=867.526">And</a>  should the case happen, and I've seen it happen in other communities where <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=874.783">The</a>  CPC funds the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=878.166">The</a>  Affordable Housing Trust Fund commits all of their funding to a project, and that project comes back for more than what has happened in the past in other communities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=889.955">The</a>  trust fund would go to the CPC, and the trust fund would say, can we fund us a little bit more? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=896.38">And</a>  then the trust fund would then fund that development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=899.602">Again,</a>  it keeps it streamlined. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=902.184">It</a>  has the same sort of <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=905.408">terms,</a>  long terms, or grant terms, whatever it would be, and just make it easier on the borrower to get all of their finances and interest for closing policy incentives.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=919.708">That's</a>  a good segue to what I was going to mention too, is that you have flexibility on the trust side to do a grant or a forgivable loan or a non-forgivable loan, whatever that may be called, a traditional loan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=932.681">So</a>  you have some more flexibility that might work best for that particular project versus the CPC where we only get grants. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=941.87">We</a>  do have <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=943.664">we'd</a>  have to do some ordinance reworking for us to be able to have that flexibility that you would have on the trust, but that's just another benefit of the trust looking at these projects, because you have the ability to adapt to what their needs are versus trust.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=960.136">So,</a>  as we said, first of all, this must be a fairly common thing, the commonwealth for other cities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=966.8">We're</a>  not reinventing the wheel here, I don't believe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=969.082">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=969.522">So,</a>  we're following a set template that <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=972.64">or</a>  maybe slightly adapting at the Medford or less than?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=975.882">Slightly</a>  adapting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=977.323">There's</a>  no standardization of CPA, really, whenever it comes to affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=981.925">And</a>  I will say that, you know, we meet once a month with other CPA communities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=987.828">And</a>  it seems like a lot of trust all came on board right around the same time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=992.051">So</a>  this is something that a lot of communities are kind of figuring out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=996.493">We</a>  look to establish communities like Somerville has had a trust for 20, 30 years or so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1002.94">So</a>  a lot of these communities are trying to figure it out, look to our established trust for guidance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1007.624">And,</a>  you know, nothing, what we're presenting here is out of the norm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1011.768">It's</a>  not weird or anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1015.411">I</a>  can't think of a better word because I'm tired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1017.072">But,</a>  you know, it's within the realm of normalcy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1020.876">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1021.997">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1027.306">And</a>  this isn't like, hey, this is exactly what's happening going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1030.788">Just</a>  wanted to introduce the concept. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1033.43">I</a>  would certainly welcome all members to bring thoughts and obviously members of the trust as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1039.653">We</a>  want to make sure everybody's comfortable with this going forward, but we felt like it might be the best course of action.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1046.898">And</a>  what's the anticipated schedule for putting this into place that was funding cycle already underway?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1053.883">I</a>  think we should look to strongly implement this for next fiscal year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1057.805">I</a>  think right now, the requests that we have at the CPC as part of our annual funding round are just our service programs that we continuously fund every year that are meant for moving and housing families. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1072.833">And</a>  again, the trust is asking for a tranche of funding as well.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1076.616">And</a>  if I may, through the chair, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1081.793">Last</a>  week, the housing trust just awarded its 1st funding award to the affordable housing construction project, which was bells way West. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1093.369">So</a>  bells way West came in needing some additional funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1098.035">The</a>  trust fund had the $250,000 that the CPC had given them previously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1105.419">And</a>  so the CPC awarded funds to Bell's Midwest out of that pool of money to be able to finish their project.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1116.204">The</a>  trust awarded money, not the CPC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1120.766">You</a>  can go around that.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1122.066">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1124.14">I'm</a>  going to make you actual hats at Christmas.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1127.282">Why</a>  don't you just turn around.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1130.204">There</a>  you go, a double-sided hat.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1133.666">What</a>  else do we need to discuss on this subject?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1138.549">Nothing</a>  else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1139.089">Like</a>  I said, it was an introduction of members as well as a concept. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1142.832">But</a>  I would welcome comments from each and every member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1145.874">Haylene,</a>  maybe I can call you and pick your brain since you're going through exactly this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1150.276">I</a>  think you'd be a good</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1152.06">Good</a>  test subject to ask about, but... Is there some kind of formal agreement that you think we need to enter into, or is this an understanding that we can go forward with? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1164.448">I'm</a>  just curious what the method is of this.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1166.169">Yeah,</a>  I don't think we've really voted too much on procedure and policies of how we do things on the CPC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1172.672">We</a>  can certainly have it be an agenda item on the CPC's agenda as an official talking point for just us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1180.312">and</a>  we can discuss it as a group.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1184.074">I'm</a>  still learning about the process, very eager to get into my first funding cycle is tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1194.019">But</a>  I know in some of the earlier discussions leading up to this discussion, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1201.753">What</a>  I've wondered about it, or just observed, is how we set our amounts, our percentages that we're going to appropriate to each group, distribute to each category. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1214.464">And</a>  it'll just be interesting to me to see how that plays out in the future, knowing that, I think we're saying that a large tranche of funds will automatically go to the trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1228.813">And</a>  just an observation, it's a little less like, let's set this percentage and then see what kind of requests we get. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1236.938">We</a>  know that off the bat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1238.359">Yeah,</a>  see how we, it puts a little more pressure maybe on that early budgeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1245.503">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1248.892">because</a>  we know we have this commitment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1250.813">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1251.093">That's</a>  actually a really good point, because there have been years when we've had almost no dollars in the affordable bucket, so to speak, which has allowed other things to be funded that may not have been if we had a consistent power amount. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1262.78">So</a>  it's going to make it even more competitive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1264.781">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1265.981">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1266.662">For</a>  the non-housing, which is OK.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1269.103">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1270.064">And</a>  it is a best practice in other communities where they just set a percentage every year, and that percentage just goes right off the top to the trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1279.038">then</a>  they focus on historic preservation and open space projects and leave the housing to the experts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1287.9">All</a>  right, any other thoughts before we officially, I think we need a motion to adjourn this meeting to start the next meeting, but any other thoughts, questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1296.842">Yes,</a>  Joan.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1297.962">Sorry</a>  I'm late, I misread the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1301.062">I</a>  was here at 6.30 and nobody was there and I was like, oh, it's 6.45. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1303.063">So</a>  in a nutshell, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1309.122">Is</a>  the idea that we are just going to send a set dollar amount every year to the trust fund, to the housing trust, excuse me, without any sort of debate or whatever, and that if anybody, if we get an application for a housing application, are we going to send them to the trust first, or are we going to accept them?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1328.272">I</a>  think that's the general idea here is that, you know, if somebody approaches us and says, hey, I want money for development, we would kindly introduce them to our friends on the trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1338.94">I</a>  think we should have a future discussion with just the CPC about establishing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1345.183">If</a>  we should establish that percentage and just do that as an annual best practice, as well as what that percentage would be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1351.506">So</a>  I don't think we should debate that at this point, but that should be a CPC discussion at a later, maybe January. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1361.67">Does</a>  that address it for you, Joan? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1363.931">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1368.804">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1369.724">Can</a>  we end this portion of the program?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1371.205">Yeah,</a>  I could take a motion to adjourn from any, or you can, or you can, because technically you're co-chairs right now.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1376.686">I'll</a>  make a motion to adjourn.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1724.18">We're</a>  going in reverse order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1729.2">So</a>  Saturday, this one is 12 to 5, and you have to be there the whole time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1734.422">So</a>  it is a bit of a commitment there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1735.982">It's</a>  a little bit longer, but October 4th, 12 to 5. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1741.344">And</a>  where is that one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1744.365">That</a>  one will be here right here in the square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1746.025">If</a>  anybody wants to circle the square, it's nearly an identical program in terms of what's available there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1753.948">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1756.289">October</a>  5th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1758.875">I</a>  believe it's going to be, this one's interesting, October 5th, there's Community Day at Tufts, and I believe that's 12 to three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1768.739">Roberta</a>  and myself will be there, because Roberta's wearing a couple hats, I'm wearing a couple hats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1776.762">So</a>  if anybody could come and kind of help out with that, that would be wonderful as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1782.624">Additionally,</a>  this date may move, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1787.046">But</a>  because of community day encroachment, CPC is going to be partnering with the planning department to do a outreach event for the COVID Memorial Grove. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1801.272">That</a>  was a CPC funded project for the study. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1804.513">They're</a>  coming back this funding round to ask for construction money by October 5th from 1 to 3 at Riverbend Park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1815.46">But</a>  that would just be like a tabling, trying to get folks to weigh in on designs that we've got drafted up and get some feedback from the community about what that might look like.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1827.148">There's</a>  more.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1829.33">Like</a>  I said, October's shopping. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1832.432">October</a>  18th, this is a Saturday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1835.174">Harvest</a>  Your Energy Festival. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1839.377">From</a>  12 to 3. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1846.243">This</a>  is at the McGlynn playground area and Riverbend Park have that great spaces behind the playground. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1853.108">That's</a>  12 to three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1854.248">We</a>  don't have a table set up for that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1858.371">They</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1858.972">You</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1860.393">So</a>  anybody wants to come hang out with Roberta, I will probably be there in my planning department hat to help them execute the event.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1867.411">It's</a>  a great place to come and celebrate one of our biggest and most successful CPA projects to date.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1875.393">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1876.973">CPA</a>  helped fund the vast majority of the McGlynn's full playground redesign. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1883.015">So</a>  it's nice that we get to do that event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1887.136">And</a>  we can point to the things that we did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1888.836">Like</a>  the one with the stage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1890.616">Correct,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1894.237">And</a>  that's it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1897.456">I'll</a>  be hanging out with you folks on the 19th day after Harvest Energy Fest. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1903.099">So</a>  again, I will circulate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1904.82">I</a>  know I just spat out a lot of dates there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1907.002">I'll</a>  circulate this through email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1908.302">But</a>  it would be awesome, like I said, even if it's for an hour, if you can come and help out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1913.786">People</a>  are great at these tabling events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1915.587">They</a>  just want to chat about Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1917.588">And</a>  you all are here because you also love Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1919.689">So</a>  it ends up being a really great opportunity to chat with folks and connect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1926.707">Otherwise,</a>  administrative updates, I don't really have too much else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1932.87">I'm</a>  sure I can find other things to talk about, but that's what I have.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1941.315">You're</a>  doing a fine job there, Theresa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1943.696">Fine</a>  job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1944.597">You're</a>  doing a fine job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1946.038">Thank</a>  you, John. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1946.938">I</a>  appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1949.119">What's</a>  that, Reg?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1949.76">October</a>  5, you have two events, community day and outreach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1954.002">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1954.402">How</a>  are you going to split yourself?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1956.586">Well,</a>  I'm hoping you would help me with that red. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1961.612">We</a>  may be moving the cope at Memorial Grove because we really want to try and get as many people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1966.719">So</a>  that's a TV.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1968.962">But</a>  in my suggestion, Teresa, instead, I would love to get him instead of sending the dates out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1975.813">just</a>  say, here are the dates, if anybody can come. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1978.815">Let's</a>  do it like a doodle poll. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1981.057">And</a>  you have to pick a time that you can come. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1984.079">Because</a>  everybody needs to spend an hour or whatever doing these things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1988.863">I</a>  wrote them all down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1989.703">The</a>  only one I'm not available for at all is the 18th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1994.987">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1995.267">I</a>  might be able to participate in a couple of these, for sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=1997.949">But</a>  let's do it like a doodle poll. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2000.131">Let's</a>  fill in each event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2002.873">That's</a>  a great idea.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2044.575">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2045.419">We</a>  are not obligated to any of these besides Mystic River Celebration, which is the September 27th one, and Harvest Your Energy Fest. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2055.567">Those</a>  are the only two that we've officially registered for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2060.451">So</a>  it'd be great if we can be obnoxious and be out there and just oversaturate folks with CPC so that everybody knows what we do, but it's not a requirement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2071.869">Um,</a>  that's a good point healing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2073.611">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2074.551">And</a>  I'll clarify all this, you know, which ones we're committed to, which ones we're not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2080.016">Obviously,</a>  folks aren't available for the ones we're not committed to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2083.198">Then</a>  we can, we can move on with our lives, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2158.604">About</a>  the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2160.165">All</a>  of these events are highly weather dependent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2162.825">So</a>  on a good weather day, we could be mobbed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2165.526">On</a>  a bad weather day, we could be standing there shivering, waiting for the event to be over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2171.587">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2172.007">So</a>  both things can happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2178.625">Um,</a>  and I think whether is really the determining factor more than the location of the event as to how many people you tend to get the same.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2190.296">Families,</a>  you have the same community tends to come out to most of these events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2196.782">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2197.975">And</a>  they are in 3 different locations because location also is a factor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2203.079">So,</a>  for example, the October fest is same location as the circle the square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2210.426">So,</a>  we might be likely to talk to the same people for October fest. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2218.412">We</a>  were at circle the square earlier this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2220.795">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2222.422">But</a>  the other two events are in different locations, and so they might bring different, the other three events might bring different people out.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2231.866">Yeah,</a>  you usually, you do end up seeing the same couple of folks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2236.887">A</a>  couple pop into my head right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2239.148">But</a>  yeah, there is some diversity over it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2247.355">And</a>  in the community day, because it does community day does tend to bring obviously less students and younger folks, but there's families that go through it as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2256.841">We</a>  have Maisha. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2260.443">Have</a>  we heard from our friend Liz? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2267.127">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2320.197">Um,</a>  then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2328.626">So,</a>  I spend all this time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2329.988">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2358.763">always</a>  daunting to text the city council president while he's in a meeting.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2461.243">Joan,</a>  would you want to come up here and sit up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2463.784">The</a>  microphone that we have is only so robust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2468.622">And</a>  what I'll do, Joan, too, is I can bring up the application of NCROS and have it there.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2477.191">So,</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2478.472">Introduce</a>  yourself and give us a very brief overview of the project you're applying for.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2485.38">My</a>  name is Joan Keene. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2486.801">I</a>  am a representative from the Union of Church of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2491.055">and</a>  working with Liz Ammons, who we had a very successful application awarded in the spring for a major carpentry and painting restoration, preservation of the church. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2506.703">And</a>  Liz Ammons did 95% of the work on that, by the way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2512.106">And</a>  about a month ago, we invited Teresa to come and review the successful <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2521.114">And</a>  it's almost completed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2522.835">As</a>  we were going around the church, we were sharing with her our aspirations to completely the project, one being a major stained glass window on the Powder House side, Powder House Road side of the church needs new plexiglass, or which was not covered sufficiently in our grant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2549.573">trees</a>  at that time enthusiastically mentioned that there was an off-cycle small grant process that we could apply to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2557.901">So</a>  this is what it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2560.763">It</a>  is nothing religious about this particular shirt or window. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2567.289">And</a>  we find it necessary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2570.291">I</a>  don't know how long that plexiglass has been there, but it does not allow moisture <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2578.807">to</a>  pass through, it's rotted at the bottom, the wood needed to be replaced. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2583.288">They</a>  already went ahead and replaced the wood before, all the supporting wood, before we decided, oh, there's an option. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2589.889">It</a>  would be lovely to complete the whole project at one time, because it just looks so beautiful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2594.03">So</a>  we submitted the contract, a very detailed contract, and asking for $84,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2600.111">Well,</a>  $84,000 is the... $8,400. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2600.531">$8,400,</a>  rather. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2600.831">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2606.719">8500</a>  yes right not small at all almost what we already have and um i think we asked for nine because you never know what the there's always overcharges so um i know that's the window a very prominent window in our social hall where many meetings and and our mcs hold uh <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2629.483">whole</a>  regular events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2631.904">So</a>  that is the basic request. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2635.825">And</a>  there is some urgency in that the contractors are still on site completing the final list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2645.427">And</a>  it would be lovely if we knew one way or the other so we could have them maybe continue with the project while the temperatures and the season holds.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2663.094">Just</a>  one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2664.295">Is</a>  this solution, how long has this been up there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2669.976">Because</a>  it's a permanent solution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2671.736">Because</a>  this is wood that's going to rot out every quarter century or something like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2676.718">Is</a>  there, not for this round, but is there maybe a better long-term plan for something like this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2683.479">I'm</a>  just asking a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2684.739">I'm</a>  not sure what the answer is.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2686.5">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2687.618">I</a>  do not know the history of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2688.999">I've</a>  only been with the church since 21 and having been in real estate and done historic preservation in other towns on the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2700.588">Plexiglass</a>  is the cheaper way to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2707.493">From</a>  what I understand, it will, the way it's constructed at the bottom, there are ways to, the weep holes are better so that the moisture can escape, but it won't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2717.473">damaged</a>  the window. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2719.815">That</a>  has been the main problem now that the base would have been deteriorating because there was the moisture barrier was not sufficient. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2730.744">So</a>  that was the plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2732.825">I</a>  don't, as I said, I don't know what has been done in the last 50 years on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2738.049">I'm,</a>  I'm pretty sure that Plexiglas lifetime has exceeded 25 years, at least. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2746.083">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2746.663">And</a>  many of the back windows of the church, it was replaced. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2751.266">And</a>  we tested that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2753.387">It</a>  was really nice.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2754.307">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2754.587">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2754.828">It's</a>  very stark, the difference between that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2757.029">And</a>  I think this photo best represents it, how foggy and foggy it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2762.912">So</a>  you're not seeing that beautiful artwork there.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2766.134">I</a>  think that was kind of my point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2768.075">The</a>  thing with Shilali windows and some of the things you've done with windows over the course of the CPC that they're <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2776.995">This</a>  would suggest a larger grant in the future that maybe figure out what a long-term solution of that gas clear glass or something tempered or whatever, because plexiglass yellows over time, as you can see over that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2792.605">And</a>  wood just doesn't seem like the right frame long-term either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2795.987">There</a>  has to be, I think, a preservation architect component here for a future long-term vision for this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2804.412">Could</a>  there be less panels? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2806.951">You</a>  know, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2808.631">I'm</a>  not sure, you mean fewer in the support? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2812.492">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2813.272">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2813.752">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2814.492">I</a>  mean, some of them are closets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2816.373">If</a>  it were glass, though, the weight of that would seemingly require at least this amount of framework.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2825.274">Potentially.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2825.794">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2826.934">You</a>  know, but there might be alternatives. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2829.275">That's</a>  what I'm going to say, is I think long-term, that is not part of this grant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2833.115">Again,</a>  this is an emergency repair, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2837.251">a</a>  wood frame for plexi is a, it's more than a band-aid, but not much more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2843.112">But</a>  you need a band-aid right now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2845.973">Yes,</a>  and I'm not, I do not know the ratios, the moisture ratios of what a glass covering would do to the color and everything of that particular, the church has been around since the 1700s, but this particular edifice, I'm trying to remember being there a short time, the history of it, it's either 1874 or 94 when it was constructed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2867.269">the</a>  present edifice was constructed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2869.51">So</a>  that's an original window from a Boston company. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2876.494">And</a>  I think that you have all the history and the registration, the national registry of certain places in the Massachusetts one, all of that information from our previous application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2893.902">And</a>  I think just to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2896.79">I</a>  think Teresa already mentioned that she was pleased with the detail our contractor provided.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2907.663">Out</a>  of curiosity, what was the grant award in the previous cycle? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2911.684">We</a>  received $99,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2914.085">Do</a>  you anticipate other projects?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2916.865">No,</a>  this was such a drop from heaven to have this option to do everything at the same time, so maybe we are good for $30,000, $50,000, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2929.088">Until</a>  that plexiglass yellows again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2932.689">It</a>  would be just lovely to finish the whole project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2936.769">Even</a>  just an aside, just painting the front doors a color that just made the stained glass windows on the front facing High Street just awesome.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2948.955">Stand</a>  in front of it and then pull up Google Street View. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2951.676">I</a>  think it pulls it up from 2023 and then look at it now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2955.398">The</a>  way you guys were able to stretch that $99,000 so well, it made such an impact on the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2961.541">It's</a>  really lovely.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2962.441">Having</a>  done it before, I was personally astounded that they <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2969.413">and</a>  replace it with about 200 cages for starters.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2973.175">Keep</a>  that contractor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2974.496">Well,</a>  is there a motion from a member of the committee to recommend a small grant for this project?</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=2984.763">I'll</a>  make a motion to recommend awarding a small grant as requested.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3028.767">Yes,</a>  I'm sure she is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3030.608">She's</a>  a very busy lady as you all are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3031.868">So</a>  thank you very much for your time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3035.589">Thank</a>  you, Joe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3036.049">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3036.529">Good</a>  night.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3048.604">So</a>  the final item on our agenda tonight is to give a brief overview of the anticipated projects from the FY26 annual funding round. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3059.993">And</a>  I don't know if you want to share this spreadsheet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3064.456">There</a>  is a spreadsheet with the array of projects in our meeting packet for today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3073.363">and</a>  we have an embarrassing of riches request for money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3078.524">And</a>  so I'm trying to think ahead about like how can we most efficiently use our time, use the time of our applicants to be able to make the best decisions on these projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3093.666">So</a>  I wanted to perhaps make a lightning round through this list today among committee members to identify <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3103.278">What</a>  do you think you need to know in order to make a decision about this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3108.601">Are</a>  there any questions that you're hoping that the applicants are going to answer in their applications or their presentations so that we can give them that feedback and encourage them to have that information ready for us up front? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3124.095">Another</a>  thing that might be helpful for us to think through this and up the ground this evening is just a gut check on each of the projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3134.32">Maybe</a>  committee members could tell me, how do you think you would prioritize these requests individually? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3146.886">This</a>  isn't an official vote because we don't have all the information yet, but I think that <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3152.502">going</a>  through this prioritization exercise might help us to help our applicants because some in many cases the city is applying for many different projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3164.971">So</a>  it will help our applicants to prioritize what they think is really worth focusing their applications on.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3173.097">I'm</a>  trying so hard to like get this so you can see everybody and screen share and so</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3182.775">I</a>  think my initial thought would be that we want people, and we ask this every time, but asking it live in the meeting is one thing, asking it before it's even due next week, I think, is another. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3197.558">And</a>  that is, are there sources of funding? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3201.539">Can</a>  you phase it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3203.439">The</a>  obvious thing is that everyone, we've asked people to take haircuts before, when we didn't have enough money, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3210.411">So</a>  just knowing that those basic questions, if they could mention it in the grant itself, I think that helps. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3220.718">Because</a>  that gives us a head start on saying, okay, 80% funding versus 100%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3228.303">And</a>  for the city, they often have multiple sources of funding anyway, in many cases. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3232.546">Again,</a>  what percentage are we? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3235.731">you</a>  know, do you need that full 700 or 600 or whatever it is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3240.173">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3240.693">Could</a>  500 do it so that we could find one of the 100 ones here that might not get it or not get enough? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3246.756">Right,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3248.657">And</a>  those are questions on our application route is, can this be phased? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3255.32">Other</a>  fundings, we asked them to identify other funding sources and one of the questions is also, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3260.226">If</a>  CPA doesn't fund this, what's the probability of this project moving forward? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3263.908">And</a>  so we do have some qualifying questions that probably would address that, but I can certainly ask them to reinforce that in the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3272.854">Yeah,</a>  there's one that really stands out in terms of how much money they're asking for and having trouble the pathways and parking days too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3282.148">I</a>  can talk all about that.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3283.89">I'm</a>  sorry, yeah, Brooks Estate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3286.212">That's</a>  the Bedford Brooks Estate Land Trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3289.294">My</a>  heir folks, I'm sorry for the new folks who didn't recognize, but that is good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3293.058">So</a>  that's the Brooks Estate.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3295.78">And</a>  then the other one that was standing out to me was the private owner who happens to also be the Brian Hayward.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3305.408">Yes,</a>  he is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3306.469">I</a>  want to be very clear with that project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3310.17">there</a>  as a private consultant in his day job, not there at all as any sort of entity for the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3316.012">Ryan</a>  Hayward is a vice chair for the historical commission, but his day job is architect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3323.395">So</a>  I just, since we're on record, I just want to be very clear about that.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3326.376">It's</a>  the only one that I saw that's a private project.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3329.837">It</a>  caught my attention too, and I saw that it was marked as eligible, but just help me understand for a private residence converting to a private residence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3338.29">I</a>  was eligible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3339.835">Do</a>  you want to take that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3340.759">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3341.499">So</a>  preserving the carriage house, the exterior restoration preservation would be an eligible project because the members of the public benefit by being able to see the preserved building from the street, not necessarily having to go in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3360.194">But</a>  I had a question on that project, which is, would they also be seeking to put an income restriction <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3369.14">on</a>  that unit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3369.9">So</a>  that really would be a combination of historic reservation and affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3374.443">Any</a>  affordable housing would be an eligible category for doing the whole interior conversion as well.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3382.406">The</a>  reason I was noticing that one is because I feel like we established last cycle that private residents are eligible, but then there was the additional question of, do we want to fund them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3394.892">And</a>  so for me, it was less about eligibility and it was more about <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3399.061">prior</a>  to this, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3400.101">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3401.782">What's</a>  the address of that one again, Judy?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3406.583">It's</a>  just in the Hillside District.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3409.543">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3412.004">Yeah,</a>  we only have like, I think less than 10 remaining carriage houses, original carriage houses in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3418.746">That</a>  number might be a little high, but it's in my neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3421.726">Well,</a>  carriage house, is it more concrete block garage or is it true carriage house? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3429.6">like</a>  historic demolition.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3433.102">So</a>  it's something to think about strategically for the committee as well as for the applicant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3441.788">The</a>  historic preservation angle, we could put conditions on the project that would permanently protect the building to ensure that it doesn't get torn down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3452.714">On</a>  the affordable housing side, we can put conditions in place that <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3457.7">ensure</a>  that it's going to be affordable in perpetuity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3462.143">And</a>  that's actually a very cheap, affordable housing project, if that's all they need to be able to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3474.091">Benefits</a>  on both sides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3475.672">We</a>  could encourage them to go to the Affordable Housing Trust for a project like this and not capture the historic <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3487.759">preservation</a>  aspect of it, or we could split it between the two boards, or we could just fund this as a split project ourselves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3499.227">Three</a>  options.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3500.408">Any</a>  of that is predicated on them saying, yes, we intend to move that as an income restricted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3505.911">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3506.552">It</a>  had been made aware that if this project is funded, it would be subject to a deed restriction for income eligibility.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3515.373">even</a>  the X, just the exterior restoration.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3519.456">I</a>  would be curious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3521.018">I</a>  don't know if this is the conversation we want to have right now, but I'd be curious what precedent that would set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3528.284">Like,</a>  let's say this round, we're like, great, bang for our buck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3531.626">Let's</a>  fund this project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3532.847">The</a>  next round, we get five more projects, all a hundred K. And then they're like, well, why, why'd you fund that one and not mine? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3541.214">I</a>  just, I guess I'm curious about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3544.442">the</a>  precedent setting, like what we'd be signing up for if we did a bunch of these. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3549.106">And</a>  do we want to sign up for that?</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3551.748">Well,</a>  in any year, there might be any number of projects that we can't fund because of a limited pool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3562.378">Do</a>  we often try to whittle these request amounts down so that we can give any eligible project funding?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3572.355">We</a>  try to approach it, or there's no guarantee that every project will get funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3576.806">We,</a>  um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3579.21">We</a>  try to fund as many projects as we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3582.651">So</a>  last year we similarly had to, maybe the last couple of years, it's been competitive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3589.593">And</a>  so we went through a round of prioritizing the projects ourselves so that we could decide, you know, like, what do we absolutely, what are we sure we want to fund this year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3602.657">And</a>  then below that, what would we fund if we have enough money? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3607.57">And</a>  then I don't think we ever got to the list of what do we think is not worth funding.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3613.377">And</a>  are you hoping that we'll set some of those priorities tonight, or is this more of that's the next?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3652.45">I</a>  did actually have it as housing at one point, but I was tinkering with formulas down here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3657.133">Oh,</a>  it was thrown out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3659.794">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3661.435">But,</a>  you know, we have funded projects where we've said, we want 100 grand, and it straddles both <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3667.704">uh,</a>  you know, categories, well, 50% will come from, you know, open space and the other 50 will come from historic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3673.188">We've</a>  actually done that for EMBL before, so we can stipulate that so that, you know, those buckets of money, you know, are, reflect that.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3681.935">Yeah,</a>  and I agree, actually, with Roberta, that I don't, I don't really know the merits of this project, because I haven't seen it yet, but $100,000 to get an affordable unit is about 25% of what it really costs in the real world, when I can tell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3696.346">If</a>  not, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3698.266">So</a>  there's value in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3701.549">To</a>  me, the affordable component is actually bigger than the preservation component. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3705.012">Which</a>  might be an argument for some age, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3708.355">Essentially,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3709.275">And</a>  I think in the president's sense, though, is you bring us both and you'll get funded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3714.54">If</a>  you bring one or the other, you might not.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3716.782">I</a>  worry about the arbitrariness of rules and precedents that we will establish on private projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3724.948">Like,</a>  I remember the conversation we had with <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3727.623">whatever</a>  address that was on High Street.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3731.026">The</a>  armory.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3731.667">The</a>  armory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3733.148">And</a>  we were like, we think you should have a bench and sit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3737.291">And</a>  it all felt a little like I'm making it up if you're going along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3744.117">And</a>  now if we do a private residence, are we going to put, if it's affordable, does that mean we won't ask for an additional public good <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3754.57">from</a>  that or I guess I would say the affordability is a pretty huge public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3759.214">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3759.935">So</a>  like in that sense, we wouldn't expect there to be like another an additional layer.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3764.899">Yeah,</a>  I agree with my original reading of this with enlisted as historic preservation triggered the question of if we required this of the armory <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3777.607">folks</a>  to have some kind of public good that we required here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3780.988">But</a>  I fully agree that adding that kind of affordability makes it vastly more appealing to fund. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3787.63">Maybe</a>  re-categorizing it.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3790.69">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3791.17">I</a>  hate Excel.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3794.991">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3797.472">I</a>  can't seem to raise my hand, but I have a comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3802.275">Can</a>  we ask for all of the city-owned property applications? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3807.597">Can</a>  we ask somebody at the city to put these in the order of priority for the city?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3813.839">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3814.519">Yeah,</a>  that's a best practice we've done the past couple of years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3817.64">I</a>  bring it to, you know, Mayor, DPW, Commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3821.821">I'm</a>  like, but who would you ask them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3824.242">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3824.442">Because</a>  that would change the answer.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3826.703">I</a>  usually do ask, you know, Chief of Staff, Mayor, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3830.997">DPW</a>  commissioner as well as a planning director, because those tend to be like, you know, the heavy hitters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3835.979">Now,</a>  normally all of them are applicants as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3838.78">So</a>  it's interesting, but this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3840.661">So,</a>  um, but now that that's, um, so it's good to know what the city's priorities are to something you make the decision.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3851.065">Something</a>  that would be helpful for me, if you would consider it, um, Teresa would be adding a column in here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3857.736">of</a>  previous funding, like previous year or two-year backlog of funding as a way to help prioritize, like, OK, we gave you 100,000 last year and the year before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3869.223">That's</a>  a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3870.523">Maybe</a>  that's not the priority this year.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3872.244">I</a>  can definitely add that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3877.367">It's</a>  helpful information, but it also, we've given you a couple hundred thousand in the previous years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3884.672">we</a>  have already invested in your project and they might need another tranche to be able to complete the project that we've started.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3893.897">So</a>  it could have been both ways but it would help trigger some of those questions like what is this additional funding meant to accomplish?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3902.082">There's</a>  a notes column on the end so I can just add like a previous funding received and then I'll just add some color in the notes section like <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3911.865">I</a>  know there's a couple of projects on there, you know, the pathways, but continuation of project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3917.968">Probably</a>  could use more words there, but continuation of a previously funded project.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3922.55">Just</a>  for my brain to like, better organize this, the AHT is asking for half a million.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3929.073">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3929.673">However,</a>  there are additional affordable housing requests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3933.955">How</a>  should I be thinking about this?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3938.057">So</a>  the, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3940.825">The</a>  affordable house, the 25% that we dedicated to affordable housing at the beginning of the year was our minimum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3949.55">So</a>  our goal has been a third, a third, a third, as Doug mentioned earlier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3954.99">And</a>  the HT is asking for that 25% minimum, we still have the prerogative to go above that amount. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3965.865">And</a>  in fact, it would be a good idea for us to go above that amount, at least sometimes because <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3972.873">The</a>  reason it was suggested that we set 25% as our minimum is because the state rewards communities that give at least 25% of their CP. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3982.917">In</a>  the last few years, we actually fell short of 25%, but they looked back over five years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3989.0">And</a>  so we were able to pick up the big year when we gave so much to the housing authority.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3994.783">So</a>  we need to now <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3995.997">But</a>  yeah, I actually wasn't even going in the direction of percentages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=3999.418">I</a>  was going more in the direction of like, who's owning affordable housing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4002.659">Do</a>  we want them to make all those decisions and like move everything over to them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4008.66">Or</a>  do we still want to be in the business of deciding on affordable housing projects?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4013.401">That's</a>  our $2 million question, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4016.662">So</a>  the suggestion that Teresa presented when we talked with, oh, and you weren't here for the affordable housing conversation earlier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4025.599">is</a>  that for now, we keep the housing programs, the rental assistance programs in CPC, but we delegate to the Affordable Housing Trust housing construction projects so that we can take advantage of their expertise and their ability to pool money for these bigger projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4048.096">But</a>  I think it allows us to <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4052.997">maintain</a>  a little more flexibility with our funds to be able to say, like, we know that the minimum is going to be available to them, but we can respond to some of these unusual housing requests or the housing program requests.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001830_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4074.327">Theresa,</a>  can you go back up to the affordable housing projects, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4077.568">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4078.349">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4081.796">Yeah,</a>  your questions were like, it was like a quiz. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4085.177">It</a>  was like a quiz for the earlier meeting.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4087.418">Did</a>  you guys remember everything you decided? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4091.579">Good</a>  work.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4092.559">We</a>  didn't decide anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4094.1">We're</a>  just considering some proposals of what it might be as we get to know the other committee.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001830_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4104.86">So</a>  for example, if we did that model that you just explained, so the housing families, the Medford move-in, those would stay in our responsibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4117.107">And</a>  then obviously, housing trust money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4118.588">But</a>  then if there was a Medford housing walk-in for request or something or whatever, whatever, something more serious or construction related, that would get pushed the trust is what you're saying.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4131.515">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4132.655">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4133.476">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4140.078">I</a>  don't know if anybody's joined any of the trust meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4143.119">We've</a>  had quite a few in the past month, I think three, but just hearing them talk about things and like, I'm not a housing expert, but I am tasked with being responsible for housing for the city of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4153.302">And</a>  some of the things that they were talking about, like, I never would have thought, even thought of thinking about that, you know, so I'm really glad that they, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4162.486">You</a>  know, they're very rigorous. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4164.386">We</a>  actually, you missed this earlier too, the trust awarded their first loan to a project for $100,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4171.568">So</a>  seeing them kind of pull apart the application and ask those really intense questions, like, it made sense for the trust to- The first projects that we funded is- Yes.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4183.771">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4206.542">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4207.863">Teresa,</a>  just help remind me of the fiscal year 26 funding, the 2.1 million. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4216.245">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4217.226">We've</a>  said that we're going to keep 50% of that as a reserve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4221.925">How</a>  did you get to that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4224.326">The</a>  reserve is just a leftover after you apply percentages? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4228.608">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4229.288">So</a>  if we're looking at this column, this is the budget that we established earlier this year for fiscal 26. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4234.631">So</a>  that's our 10%, 10% to open space and historic preservation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4240.393">The</a>  25%, that's at 550. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4241.254">So</a>  that number is just leftovers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4243.615">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4247.725">Down</a>  here, also, in case anybody was curious, I'll scroll back up and we can look at the projects again shortly here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4253.75">But</a>  this is how the asks, the requests, are divided up into categories. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4258.754">So</a>  we've got almost 2 million in requests just for open space and recreation, over a million for historic preservation, and 750 for affordable housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4269.002">So</a>  this is our budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4272.244">This</a>  is our, well, this is our total available funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4275.265">This</a>  is our budget and how we can disseminate it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4277.506">Admin</a>  money is pulled separately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4280.287">So</a>  we've got almost 3.8 and asks to a 2.1 availability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4286.489">So</a>  we're gonna break some hearts this year.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4288.97">Just</a>  before I joined you all had set a sort of minimum target for <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4295.212">a</a>  reserve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4295.992">Remind</a>  me what that, was that an amount?</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4309.238">Yeah,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4312.199">That</a>  could be distributed.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4331.895">Why</a>  do I always end up having to do Excel formulas? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4334.235">In</a>  front of people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4334.836">In</a>  front of people, on a board, in a group.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4345.799">OK,</a>  that worked out well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4347.96">So</a>  essentially, if we wanted to still keep our 225 in reserves, that's technically what we're</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4356.001">looking</a>  at right now is such poor country. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4358.362">Yeah,</a>  that's interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4360.082">I</a>  was looking at it the other way, where there's that $1,099,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4362.163">We</a>  want to keep $250,000 of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4364.884">And</a>  so then there's a surplus there that we could apply to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4368.005">To</a>  Roberta's point, we can fund above the 25% minimum for affordable housing if we wanted to.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4382.174">Yeah,</a>  there's some really crazy math that could be done to show what is the maximum amount. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4388.438">So</a>  imagine that roughly each of the two categories, you could add $500,000 to what's potentially available in PBIC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4402.867">So</a>  it could be $700,000 in each category is what's roughly <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4412.319">Available</a>  if it were distributed evenly.</p>

So, Myra is trying to push the state to do it by... They're only asking for planning money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4643.068">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4643.448">So</a>  Myra is trying to, let's say, let's do the planning so that the state will feel obligated to fix their stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4651.295">But</a>  that is a good, like, things that jump out at me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4655.043">planning</a>  for a state-owned asset is risky. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4658.105">On</a>  the other hand, MIRA is very shy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4661.046">We've</a>  already said no to them once, and it's taken them many years to get brave enough to come back to us, and nobody else is going to do this project.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4670.632">They</a>  were unfortunate to be in the crossfire of one of the few actually controversial grants we've had. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4680.937">I</a>  don't even think it was at the time, because <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4684.348">They</a>  were trying to plan what they're planning now, what's been planned by DCR for the last couple of years, along the entire Manford, 50 acres of land from the Winchester line to Route 60, that whole, you haven't seen the plans of what they're doing, it's phenomenal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4700.421">The</a>  bike lanes, the walking paths, the historic restoration, some of the resources, it's everything.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4706.986">Along</a>  the Mystic Lakes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4709.398">On</a>  that point, I'd be curious to understand more about the scope of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4712.439">It</a>  describes it as a conditions assessment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4715.18">Does</a>  it go beyond just assessing and put forth proposals and recommendations like a planning project? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4722.463">Or</a>  is it not enough for... It's not construction level, but it's conceptual.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4730.026">So</a>  identifying what are the problems, what would be the appropriate solution and what is an estimated price that it would cost for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4739.28">We</a>  did a similar thing for the Oak Grove Cemetery World War I monument. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4744.903">They</a>  initially came to us just asking to restore the monument, and we said, wait, do you know how? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4751.286">And</a>  so we suggested, why don't you get a condition assessment and do a plan first, and then come back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4758.649">And</a>  they did that, and it was beautiful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4760.19">It</a>  turned out really well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4763.792">It</a>  did.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4766.023">So</a>  that's that project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4768.044">So</a>  then the Shiloh Church window restoration phase.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4772.567">So</a>  we have funded this project for their ADA improvements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4776.529">It</a>  started as a conditions assessment as well as window restoration project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4783.372">And</a>  now they're coming back to the windows, which is great.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4786.834">I</a>  was just curious about the notes you have over here, bonsai, NAACP effort.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4794.15">So</a>  this is a church, a large church with a smaller congregation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4801.672">Like</a>  most churches, they need funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4803.873">So</a>  Bonsai is their child care tenant that will be coming up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4810.634">So</a>  they'll be operating out of the basement there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4813.255">But</a>  there were just some other ideas about fundraising, being creative about fundraising. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4819.417">CPA</a>  has <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4821.788">Invested</a>  quite heavily in this project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4823.849">So,</a>  you know as we're looking at competitive rounds They yeah, I mean just out of context.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4830.75">They</a>  probably need a million dollars worth of restoration of windows and they can probably generate a <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4841.347">$100</a>  out of their congregation toward the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4845.108">So</a>  this is a really a community, I think, the community needs to help to keep this building standing and use it as community space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4855.89">So</a>  I think there needs to be a partnership of community fundraising combined with public money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4864.251">Because</a>  some of the windows would not be CPA eligible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4867.532">They</a>  have 40 stained glass windows in the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4870.883">And</a>  a small handful of them have religious iconography on them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4876.325">Most</a>  of them are just geometric shapes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4880.347">And</a>  they're beautiful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4883.128">They</a>  are in rough condition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4885.149">And</a>  the carpentry around them is in rough condition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4889.01">So</a>  it needs big investment that is bigger than what CPA alone can do.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4897.225">So</a>  we're encouraging them to get creative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4898.947">That's</a>  a lot of beer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4901.348">It's</a>  a lot of beer.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4903.69">So</a>  we talked already about the Ida Hill loaner garage conversion, open Memorial Grove construction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4912.978">Teresa</a>  mentioned earlier, they're going to be doing a public engagement event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4918.383">in</a>  the upcoming months to continue planning or to show people what they're doing?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4925.026">What</a>  is... We have some with the initial award for CPA of the design study, we have a couple of renderings and some treatment options. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4932.969">So</a>  it's essentially between two designs at this point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4935.63">So</a>  the point of the meeting is to get people's feedback on these two designs, seeing if there's any special elements or anything and just <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4942.64">to</a>  continue to introduce the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4944.381">I</a>  will say not a lot of folks know that this is a potential project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4949.304">So</a>  this is more of the marketing of it, really, the first introduction of it.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4955.207">I</a>  would ask whether we might be able to maybe instead of, I mean, or in addition to an event at that location, leverage all these other events on the calendar to say, what do you guys think of these two designs? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4969.175">Do</a>  you know that we're going to be doing this project? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4971.236">And</a>  then what's your feedback? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4975.22">I</a>  just want to move on quickly so we don't use up too much time because we will talk about these many more times in the future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4981.866">Riverside</a>  Plaza shade improvements.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4984.689">This</a>  was a project that CPA funded last fiscal year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4989.173">Lo</a>  and behold, when they went out to bid, it came back at $300,000 over what their original estimate is.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4997.34">I've</a>  seen this one before.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4998.261">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=4999.616">So</a>  they've done some thoughtful redesign to still incorporate the original intention by, but downscaling it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5005.94">So</a>  this was a shade structure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5007.521">It</a>  was going to go to Riverside Plaza, which is right here in Medford Square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5011.483">Great</a>  place to hang, no shade, they need more money.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5016.506">They</a>  changed the design to make it more affordable? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5019.448">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5019.909">To</a>  value engineering them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5021.009">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5022.33">Barry</a>  Park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5024.231">That</a>  depot thing that was there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5028.688">What</a>  was that?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5030.829">They</a>  took away the depot that used to be there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5032.77">Spent</a>  three days, mate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5037.473">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5039.174">So</a>  Berry Park Community Garden, and you put in the notes that likely to have neighborhood oppositions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5047.278">So</a>  maybe it's a very small amount of money for a project that will be impactful.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5058.136">I</a>  have a question about that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5059.377">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5059.937">Not</a>  to slow us down, but like the community gardens and the potential dog parks that no one's brought up, but we know people want dog parks at Barrie Park, Morrison Park, and...Tufts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5079.331">Anyways,</a>  um, these are all things people can come to us for money for, but like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5086.6">are</a>  there going to be other bodies that are going to stand in the way of the actual implementation?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5093.442">It</a>  did happen one time in our very first funding round that we made a grant that ended up the project being canceled because of public opposition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5105.045">And</a>  it was because of a community garden at that site. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5108.506">Of</a>  course, we're several years out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5111.167">That</a>  was Marsden, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5112.587">No,</a>  that was Harris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5117.899">So,</a>  you know, I think this is where we need the city's input because we don't want to be the ones who are taking the heat for a decision that the city has made to request money to go forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5131.148">This</a>  is not the city though, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5133.15">This</a>  is... This is the community guard.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5134.571">The</a>  community guard commission themselves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5137.493">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5139.134">So</a>  they came to us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5140.975">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5142.576">And</a>  they wanted to put it in the middle of the baseball field. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5146.728">Not</a>  really in the middle of the baseball field, but it was on the Boxton Street side of the field. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5153.314">At</a>  Derrick Park? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5154.235">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5155.135">And</a>  so subsequently we went down there and we took a look at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5159.479">And</a>  it was, it would have been an impediment to playing baseball there in the future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5167.106">So</a>  we took <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5168.575">took</a>  a walk around the whole park, and we decided that we would put it on the other side of the tennis court, which would be on the College Ave side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5177.34">And</a>  it would have accommodated the amount of beds that they wanted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5183.563">It</a>  would have been easier access for the water. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5190.466">We</a>  knew that there was one individual on College Ave who was vehemently opposed, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5199.883">we</a>  felt that for the greater good of the community, that the community gardens would give us more benefit in that space, because right now it's not being utilized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5210.088">So,</a>  I mean, if you want to transfer the heat, you can send it back to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5214.99">But,</a>  you know, we did our due diligence on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5223.555">we</a>  felt that that was the best place to put it.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5226.958">I'm</a>  spending too much time on it, but what avenue does that one vehemently opposed neighbor have to stop it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5234.324">Just</a>  doesn't work, does it?</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5271.359">I</a>  love that you guys approved this project, and I feel like we're going to encounter this again with community gardens and dog parks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5281.544">And</a>  it would be nice to just have a little protocol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5285.47">go</a>  to the parks commission, come back to us, get a stamp of approval from the mayor's office, like bada bing, bada boom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5291.414">Like,</a>  you know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5292.334">Just</a>  so we just.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5294.355">You</a>  know, I think one thing like we definitely want to do if we don't already do, because maybe we do already do it, but anything like this, it's adding an amenity to make sure that they come, that their application includes a commendation from the parks commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5315.048">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5315.59">So,</a>  we want that to be approved first before they ask you.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5321.634">There's</a>  currently like a community effort petition to get a dog park at Berry Park, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5329.06">Which</a>  I found out by canvassing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5330.581">We</a>  haven't seen it yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5331.922">Oh,</a>  I know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5333.743">They</a>  don't know what they're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5335.364">That's</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5336.285">They're</a>  not getting a dog park, but I don't believe because... They are losing a lot of community support. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5342.689">Well,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5343.739">But,</a>  you know, at the end of the day, you know, you can't take existing space and transfer it to something else just because. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5352.762">You</a>  know, you're going to have a doggone good reason.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5375.179">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5375.44">And</a>  that number might even be low. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5377.46">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5378.46">But</a>  it's for Mooska lighting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5380.501">It's</a>  all app controlled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5382.501">They've</a>  been slowly implementing these as they've been redoing the parks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5386.242">Tufts</a>  is a giant park with four lighting.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5402.176">Silly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5403.157">But</a>  they only want $20,000 for that?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5405.057">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5405.758">Oh,</a>  I think you're looking at Berry Park.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5408.339">The</a>  green one.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5409.42">That</a>  $700,000 number there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5412.901">And</a>  that pricing is from 2022, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5416.103">So</a>  I'm imagining it's probably more than $750,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5419.544">With</a>  contingency, it's probably $800,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5421.305">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5422.966">So</a>  can I ask a question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5426.508">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5427.268">Why</a>  is it coming from the Recreation Department? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5432.221">As</a>  opposed to?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5433.441">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5434.181">Kevin</a>  put up the Condon show lighting before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5439.843">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5439.943">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5442.503">Because</a>  he has care custody and control over the Condon.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5449.905">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5450.385">But</a>  he doesn't have care custody and control over Tufts Farm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5454.606">So</a>  I'm wondering why.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5455.846">The</a>  mayor did sign off on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5457.927">It's</a>  like an author. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5459.127">We</a>  have <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5460.085">when</a>  it's a city owned property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5461.205">I</a>  know, but are you saying that it could be a problem in a different department?</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5465.527">I'm</a>  just wondering, you know, why the recreation department is asking for $700,000 for lighting at a park when the recreation department doesn't have control, care custody control of that park.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5482.398">They</a>  do assist with events that are there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5486.359">So</a>  they are the ones that are primarily the user of the lighting or at least managing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5490.521">Are</a>  you saying their request is illegal?</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5492.921">I'm</a>  not saying it's illegal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5493.662">A</a>  question is who has authority to request money for the park? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5497.703">And</a>  if our procedure</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5507.736">That</a>  Teresa just mentioned is that when they first submit the eligibility form, there's a form that they have to submit if it's on city property that the mayor has to sign it and the mayor assigns it to somebody to manage that project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5524.955">So</a>  maybe it was that the mayor assigned it to the recreation department to manage that project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5532.079">Although</a>  they aren't necessarily the Department of Care, Custody and Control, but to Reg's point, we need to make sure that the appropriate departments are looped in because when we have one department okay a project that another department isn't in the loop about, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5553.799">we</a>  end up with conflict, and we want to avoid conflict. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5560.021">So</a>  anybody who should be aware of it, we want the full application to show us that they're aware of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5569.984">So</a>  if there is another department that has care, custody, and control, they should be mentioned in the application, and the application should mention how they are collaborating with each other.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5583.547">That</a>  answers my question, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5586.709">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5586.869">I'll</a>  bring that back to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5588.47">Because</a>  essentially, I'm looking at it, and I'm saying the recreation department does, they have the pool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5597.516">OK,</a>  but even the pool is still under the past commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5603.38">He</a>  might manage the pool, but he doesn't make the rules <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5609.132">or</a>  any improvements to the pool.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5611.913">So</a>  this would fall under the category of projects that need to at least come to the Parks Commission, just like the one, you know, the dog park or community gardens or any other, like, lighting, field lighting is an amenity that the Park Commission should review before, as part of our process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5632.557">I'll</a>  talk with Kevin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5636.585">All</a>  right, I'll move to the next one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5639.207">Carr</a>  Park dugout shelters.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5644.091">Bruce,</a>  do you have concerns about whatever they're planning right now not meeting the DPW standards? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5651.897">Just</a>  reading your note here.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5653.398">Yes,</a>  so that note came out of the Hickey Park dugout shelters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5658.362">It</a>  was proposed to do a cantilever design, and it is installed, and it looks great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5664.28">However,</a>  the engineering behind having a cantilevered rather than two post support system, the DPW has asked us kindly to no longer fund cantilever designs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5677.307">So</a>  that is why that note is there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5680.149">So</a>  we make sure that DPW is on board with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5682.87">They</a>  want a review before.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5686.032">This</a>  is exactly what we want, is left hand talking to right hand.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5693.575">I</a>  did remind DPW that DPW was the one that proposed that design. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5697.58">Moving</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5699.182">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5701.945">The</a>  shade team pop-up, I can explain this one because I have the feeling that this project is likely to drop out this round. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5709.174">This</a>  is an idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5713.078">There's</a>  a group in Cambridge that is working with teens to develop and advocate and fundraise and program and manage the community gathering space at a park that's a shade structure that they've designed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5732.69">And</a>  they'd like to expand this to other communities and get other communities to do similar things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5738.728">It</a>  is equally a, um, an investment, like the capital investment and an organizational passive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5746.754">So</a>  CPA is relatively easy to get us to make the capital investment, but the bigger challenge is that organizational piece of getting a group together to take this project on here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5761.486">And</a>  I don't know that that's going to come together, this funding round. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5764.828">So,</a>  um, but we can work on it.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5767.898">In</a>  the meantime, find that organizational support potentially for the future and bring them back.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5774.422">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5776.284">So</a>  then I think we talked about the housing program, housing programs, housing families, ABCD assistance programs, and the affordable housing trust funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5791.574">We</a>  can pass over those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5793.736">The</a>  invasives removal program,</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5796.238">I</a>  have a meeting with the internal team about this one tomorrow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5801.76">Apparently,</a>  there is a program or a group called Keep Medford Beautiful that will be taking this on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5809.543">However,</a>  I've been having some difficult time getting some details out of them as to what the program will look like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5815.185">I</a>  hope to have answers tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5816.465">Yeah,</a>  I'd definitely like to know more about it.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5820.787">And</a>  I mentioned the Hillside group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5824.318">to</a>  the mayor's office, and I'm just not sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5827.699">Sounds</a>  like they didn't connect with you.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5831.941">The</a>  mayor's office?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5833.082">I</a>  haven't heard that.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5835.423">Or</a>  Alice Hunter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5836.763">I</a>  haven't, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5839.704">But</a>  thank you for bringing it to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5841.165">I</a>  can make a lot of cases as why this is different from maintenance if we need to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5846.527">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5847.047">I</a>  was about to say is that that case needs to be made as to <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5853.995">why</a>  it's not maintenance.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5857.777">It's</a>  actually preservation in a way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5859.598">If</a>  we allow these invasive plants to displace native plants, we will lose the ecological value and function of our parks and open spaces.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5870.745">I</a>  wish CPA could pay for community-wide efforts specifically for invasives because <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5882.662">Yes,</a>  we have issues in our parks and everything, but gosh, I hate walking around my neighborhood and just seeing a tree of heaven growing out of a retaining wall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5889.466">I'm</a>  like, well, your retaining wall is going to fail in about two years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5892.828">So</a>  I wish that CPA could be used for citywide efforts, but yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5899.272">So</a>  I will certainly share with you, because Jeremy reached out as a resident CPC member saying, hey, can we do something with CPA?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5910.371">Chapel</a>  Grove Cemetery buildings restoration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5914.352">So</a>  this is a continuation of the project that we've been supporting.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5920.394">Well,</a>  here's the thing real quick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5923.075">And</a>  we can put a pin in this when I come back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5925.076">I</a>  think we only have a couple more here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5929.998">Essentially,</a>  is this a, we've kind of bantered about in the past, potentially CPC or CPA absorbing <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5941.067">the</a>  annual cost of getting a bond. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5944.068">So</a>  basically getting a loan to be able to do a massive project, which is what is needed for Brooks Estate, for Oak Grove Cemetery buildings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5952.931">These</a>  are not just million dollar, two million dollar projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5955.471">I</a>  think Oak Grove is now probably somewhere between six and eight million. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5959.413">Brooks</a>  Estate, I know you're probably approaching 10 million.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5963.594">If</a>  you're going to Terrace House Access Drive, yeah, it's probably,</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5969.731">So</a>  there has been conversations in the past about, for the right project, would the CPC be willing to take on an annual debt service? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5980.275">So</a>  it's essentially like we pay the annual fee on that bond, and that would be for a set number of years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5988.078">I</a>  can certainly look at and punch up numbers, but a ballpark on this would probably be somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=5997.452">or</a>  a $6 million bond if we were to absorb those costs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6001.094">Two</a>  to 300 annually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6002.454">Annually.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6003.174">So</a>  that's 10 to 15% of our budget.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6006.276">And</a>  it's spoken for.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6008.997">10,</a>  15 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6010.097">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6011.118">But</a>  is that the right thing to do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6016.82">I</a>  want to have a more earnest conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6019.181">It's</a>  been bubbled up before in the past, but having that concerted conversation with the mayor, DPW, and our finance director <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6027.08">and</a>  perhaps invite Roberta as well as our chairperson to have a discussion about what that looks like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6032.023">Does</a>  the debt get paid back?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6034.544">How?</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6035.185">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6037.606">By</a>  committing some of our CPA funds every year to that.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6042.428">So</a>  we're not just paying the fee to carry the debt, we are paying back the debt? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6047.111">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6051.356">I</a>  think with the Carriage House, if they were part of it, that has an income stream. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6057.461">That</a>  alone had a 20-year payback for the whole loan and interest. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6061.305">That's</a>  the estimate we had from a while ago now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6064.548">I'm</a>  sure bond rates have changed, etc., but there was a significant income that would make that self-sustaining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6072.455">That</a>  would not be <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6074.582">this</a>  different format. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6076.562">But</a>  I like the creativity of it because it's, for some projects, it's tough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6081.624">And</a>  the Oak Grove Cemetery expansion is right, literally, surrounding it and built. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6086.945">And</a>  that's also, they're talking about that right now with Tim McGibbon and Seattle Chambers to come up with a plan for that expansion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6096.707">That's</a>  seven acres that the Oak Grove Cemetery <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6100.532">When</a>  it's done, it becomes a cemetery.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6103.814">What</a>  are they expanding into?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6106.135">The</a>  seven acres of the Brooks Estate that were put aside in 1998 as part of the deal that created the Brooks Estate gave them seven acres of expansion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6112.999">It's</a>  surrounded by the Brooks Estate on three sides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6116.18">It</a>  just hasn't been acted on in 30 years.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6120.263">It</a>  makes me wonder about having an inhistorical restoration of <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6128.41">like</a>  the cemetery buildings or whatever, whether we want to have some sort of requirement around there being an income stream, or are we okay just for storing buildings that essentially have no function?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6138.957">Well,</a>  I will say, as we look at Oak Grove, I hear what you're saying about buildings that have no function. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6143.6">I</a>  just want to clarify, these are actively used by city staff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6148.843">It's</a>  the office and caretaker supporters, as well as the maintenance shed, which is used by DPW staff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6158.171">but</a>  I don't... Are they being optimally used? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6162.152">I</a>  think they're being maximally used as much as they can, but that was a fair point.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6168.814">Restoration,</a>  for example, the Brooks Estate can expand the use of the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6173.075">Right</a>  now, it is empty most of the time, but having an access road would make that another public building in our arsenal of public buildings where we could hold public meetings and do other public business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6187.538">So</a>  it would activate the site. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6191.159">Yeah,</a>  it would activate a building that is currently useless.</p>

    <p>[Ada Gunning]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6195.321">Is</a>  it bad that I went to weddings and just generated income? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6200.423">Yeah,</a>  I think that's the intention, right?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6202.663">That</a>  would be one of the challenges. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6204.264">If</a>  there's a multi-purpose function facility, that wedding won't be the primarily economic part of the plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6211.146">Maybe</a>  we can talk about that.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6213.225">All</a>  right, we have one, two more on our list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6215.586">Speaking</a>  of NBEL, the pathways and parking phase two, which is a big number.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6220.267">Yes,</a>  and I think I'm already, we already were looking at this when I talked to Carly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6226.028">Carly</a>  obviously is down the hall talking about the, of course, the expansion and partnering with those guys because they're trying to play nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6235.73">We're</a>  neighbors, NBEL's neighbors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6239.431">But</a>  remember, one of the first grants this, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6243.27">of</a>  the funding was the entire design of the access drive, the manor, to Grove Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6250.952">And</a>  then we focused on the parking lot, the full parking lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6253.812">That</a>  was like a multi-million dollar building project to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6258.854">And</a>  this piece is a portion of the parking lot that is just dedicated to the accessible spaces, to the accessible path that's less than half of the parking lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6269.491">to</a>  try to get these accessible funds and open space recreation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6273.392">But</a>  we're getting a cost estimate of $700,000 plus for that post-contingency, which is why the MSI. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6281.113">But</a>  we're already talking about taking out the lighting and doing things to cut that number down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6285.754">But</a>  I don't think we can get it to half. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6288.775">That</a>  sounds like what it might mean for you to make it viable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6292.336">So</a>  we're just going to see where the priorities are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6296.657">We</a>  recognize that this committee <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6299.478">has</a>  funded a lot of them over the years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6301.259">Not</a>  the last few years, but historically, almost every year, it's been six figures plus. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6307.522">We</a>  get cost estimates for projects.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6312.805">We</a>  get to review that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6313.605">Do</a>  we also typically get copies of the design proposal and contract documents?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6319.908">Yes,</a>  it's bid ready right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6322.03">So</a>  it's not a concept design. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6323.45">It's</a>  actually biddable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6324.671">We</a>  actually tried to bid a piece of it, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6330.353">We're</a>  going to use ARPA funds, but the ARPA funds, we thought, would be extended beyond June 30th, and we've been told flat out that they are not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6338.4">There</a>  are many reasons for that, I think.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6340.882">I'd</a>  be curious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6341.443">It's</a>  one of the more expensive halves of a parking lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6344.165">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6344.766">I've</a>  seen... Yeah, it's a lot of grading.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6348.029">It's</a>  taking out a lot of trees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6350.531">It's</a>  regrading. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6351.472">It's</a>  a lot of infrastructure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6355.335">I</a>  can see the plans.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6356.916">I'd</a>  be curious.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6358.473">Okay,</a>  and Cemetery Trustees want to know about the Memorial Plaza restoration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6363.215">Is</a>  this a continuation of the master plan that we, I mentioned earlier, that we funded? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6369.336">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6371.197">So</a>  it's a large plaza that has so many elements to it that are beautiful all together, and we're in very troubled condition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6384.561">And</a>  so, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6388.138">I</a>  don't have any problems in my life. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6389.779">I'm</a>  a family picture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6390.679">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6391.1">And</a>  so that's everything that we have on the table that adds up to more</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6410.492">but</a>  almost twice as much as the funding that we have available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6414.234">So</a>  when we meet next month, what are the dates that we're meeting in October again? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6421.259">October</a>  14. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6424.32">Did</a>  we set two dates or one date? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6426.722">We</a>  set one date for October and then one in November, November 18.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6432.185">Jeremy</a>  cannot attend the October 14 unless your life has changed.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6436.348">I</a>  cannot attend the October 14. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6437.869">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6440.665">I</a>  think I can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6441.445">I'm</a>  not sure why I said I couldn't.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6445.467">And</a>  both of those meetings are going to be dedicated to applicant presentations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6451.47">So</a>  that we'll see if we have all of these applications still on the table at that point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6463.027">We'll</a>  learn more about the projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6464.989">We</a>  will actually get the applications to review so we can ask questions of the applicants. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6471.734">And</a>  then at our December meeting, we'll actually start to try to prioritize and decide how to solve this puzzle.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6482.262">So</a>  during the presentations, there'll be time for Q&A for us to grow them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6490.342">The</a>  new folks, I don't know if Manisha's still here, but the presentations are usually just PowerPoints. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6498.984">Some</a>  folks come in person, but it's just your standard presentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6502.584">We</a>  try to give them like five minutes of them talking and then 10 to 15 minutes or so of questions from us and the public.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6514.066">What</a>  was the second date that you mentioned? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6516.327">November.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6516.967">November</a>  18th.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6519.835">And</a>  there's some Monday holidays and Veterans Day lands in there, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6523.697">So</a>  it's just kind of messing up the Monday, Tuesday meetings.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6528.46">So</a>  we have about eight to nine presentations per night over two weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6533.942">They're</a>  going to be long nights is what we're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6535.563">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6535.803">They're</a>  going to be long nights. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6537.184">And</a>  we will try to be as efficient as we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6539.585">We</a>  should bring snacks.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6541.266">Bring</a>  snacks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6541.947">I</a>  could bring a speaker timer, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6543.427">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6545.028">I</a>  actually have one of those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6546.049">We</a>  should totally do this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6548.873">I</a>  kind of like what the city council is using with those type of digital controls, just to kind of be a visual reminder. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-and-community-preservation-committee-joint-meeting-09-09-25&start=6556.198">So,</a>  yeah.</p>
