1
00:00:01,714 --> 00:00:06,997
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call to order the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee.

2
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:12,700
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Tuesday and the Affordable Housing Trust.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,003
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Tuesday, September 9, 6.30 p.m.

4
00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:28,188
[SPEAKER_11]: in Medford City Hall, room 201, and we are meeting hybrid with some members of both the Community Preservation Committee and the Affordable Housing Trust.

5
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:32,500
[SPEAKER_11]: meeting on joining with us online.

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:48,206
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like to actually hand over the chair responsibilities for the Community Preservation Committee to Vice Chair Joan, since I actually serve on both committees.

7
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:57,430
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to make sure that we have a member of only the Community Preservation Committee leading the meeting.

8
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,469
[SPEAKER_06]: John, are you available to do that?

9
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, she's on mute.

10
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:07,554
[SPEAKER_06]: She might be still setting up her computer.

11
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:22,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a volunteer from the committee to take over as chair while I attend as a member of both committees?

12
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:24,588
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I can do that.

13
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:24,888
[SPEAKER_20]: It's fine.

14
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:27,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Chairperson Carr.

15
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:32,663
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we holding the agenda?

16
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:34,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

17
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:37,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I can kind of do quick introductions.

18
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,164
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be helpful.

19
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:38,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, of course.

20
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So as staff support, I'm speaking here.

21
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:49,006
[SPEAKER_06]: We're joining our two committees together just for a brief meeting, just to do a formal introduction for everybody.

22
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:54,607
[SPEAKER_06]: We've all been talking in our separate circles, and now it's time to start joining our efforts together.

23
00:01:55,306 --> 00:02:09,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So the purpose of this meeting is to do a formal introduction, as well as to have a brief discussion about how we will be balancing out our housing construction or development requests that come to the CPC.

24
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:22,084
[SPEAKER_06]: As we now have our lovely affordable housing trust online and hitting the ground running and doing fun stuff, we want to iron out what that looks like so that we're not competing with ourselves or divide.

25
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:24,806
[SPEAKER_06]: We want that process to go smoothly.

26
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:32,036
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that being said, why don't we go around, Robin, here, and we'll start with Roberta.

27
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:42,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberta Cameron, I chair the Community Preservation Committee, normally, under most circumstances, and I also serve as a member of the Affordable Housing Trust.

28
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:44,644
[SPEAKER_20]: You have two hats today.

29
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:45,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

30
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:45,745
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

31
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:49,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Doug Carr, I'm the Historic Commission representative on the CPC.

32
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Reg Graham, I'm the Past Commission representative for the CPC.

33
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:59,928
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Kayleen, would you be willing to jump in there?

34
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Jeremy, I'll call on you next.

35
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, sure.

36
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:03,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everybody.

37
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:04,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Kayleen Foley.

38
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:08,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the chairperson of the Medford Housing Authority.

39
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:10,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I am the liaison to the CPC.

40
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Kayleen.

41
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:17,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy, would you be able to introduce yourself, even if it's just verbally?

42
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:18,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, everyone.

43
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:20,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jeremy Martin.

44
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:26,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the Conservation Commission representative on the committee.

45
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:29,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just got off the bus and am walking into City Hall now.

46
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:30,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll see you all in just a moment.

47
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:32,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.

48
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:33,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Jeremy.

49
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:37,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Joan, are you with us quite yet?

50
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:48,478
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so Joan Cyr was a founding member of this committee, helped with the running of the campaign to get CPA adopted here in Medford.

51
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:54,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Joan also serves as our vice chair and is generally an awesome human being.

52
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:57,424
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Lisa, get back in the room here.

53
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what's her?

54
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:03,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Kayla, yes, sorry, go ahead, Kayla.

55
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:08,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm Kayla lesson.

56
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:10,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I serve on the affordable housing trust fund.

57
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:18,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, if you want a little bit more background, I've worked for a mixed income developer for the past 15 years.

58
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,752
[SPEAKER_15]: So familiar with a lot of the Massachusetts housing programs.

59
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:22,572
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

60
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:27,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Lisa Davidson.

61
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:30,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I sit on the affordable housing trust fund for Redford.

62
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also serve as the chair.

63
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,572
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit of background about myself.

64
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:40,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I have worked with the in-house population for 12 years, and now I am now working for the city somewhere in their house.

65
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,477
[SPEAKER_15]: That's brand new.

66
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:55,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Sarah DeRosa, and I am the new appointee for the Medford Housing Trust and Affordable Housing Trust.

67
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:59,824
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully I'll be approved today, right?

68
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:12,324
[SPEAKER_12]: And my background is I'm a real estate agent, as well as I worked for a development company in Boston.

69
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:21,029
[SPEAKER_12]: We've done a lot of lease-ups for affordable housing, or what we call income-restricted housing.

70
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,951
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Kevin Buckingham.

71
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:29,955
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm the housing planner for the city of Medford, and I also staff the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board.

72
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:31,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

73
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you all for the introductions.

74
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:37,134
[SPEAKER_06]: We're missing a couple of folks on the CPC side.

75
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:42,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Anna Gunning will be joining us shortly, I think about an hour or so.

76
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just running a little late.

77
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,405
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have Maisha Majumder, who's another wonderful member of our board here.

78
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:51,046
[SPEAKER_06]: They just had some commitments today.

79
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:52,928
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's Junior.

80
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:57,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the trust, we're missing Carrie Weaver.

81
00:05:57,332 --> 00:05:59,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so Carrie said she was coming.

82
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:03,516
[SPEAKER_18]: I know Kenny, Malcolm Taylor can not come in the mayor.

83
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:06,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Can not come in the mayor also serves on the board.

84
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:11,640
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'm fine with that.

85
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that?

86
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,581
[SPEAKER_18]: That's sufficient.

87
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you including myself and Taylor?

88
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:21,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's not potatoes.

89
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:22,464
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

90
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:22,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Surely.

91
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:23,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Like in and out.

92
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:23,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

93
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:31,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you all so much.

94
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:42,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the intention of this brief meeting, separate meeting, is to have a discussion about funding housing development or construction projects.

95
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:46,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, right now, the CPC has been receiving those.

96
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,642
[SPEAKER_06]: They have been very few and far between.

97
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:50,125
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't really received one in a couple of cycles.

98
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but largely it's been walking court redevelopment.

99
00:06:54,072 --> 00:07:05,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We've, we've been a good heavy investor in that project as well as fells way West, which is project that should be, um, we stopped by the end of this year, which is very exciting stuff.

100
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:11,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but that being said, I don't think anybody on the board would lay claim on the committee.

101
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:16,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the CPC would lay claim to being a housing expert that knows everything there is to know.

102
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:16,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

103
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,909
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all well-intentioned folks that have our own expertise.

104
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:22,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Roberta here.

105
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:28,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're so excited that the trust is coming on board with such strong expertise and skill sets.

106
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:32,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Kayla, I mean, the stuff that you know must be insane.

107
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:36,318
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got all these great people put in the right places together.

108
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So going forward, perhaps it might be best.

109
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,322
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been some internal discussions with chair people only.

110
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,783
[SPEAKER_06]: about how do we balance this going forward?

111
00:07:46,343 --> 00:08:06,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And the consensus of the few folks that I've talked to internally is it might be best if we shift those development requests over to the trust and kind of take it out of the CPC's hands just so it goes in front of the experts who know all the right questions to ask and know where there could be potential pitfalls and what have you.

112
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:12,636
[SPEAKER_20]: And so what does that mean in terms of our mission is to spend a certain percentage of our funds

113
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:19,655
[SPEAKER_20]: on affordable housing every cycle, minimum of 10, but we've always tried to do a third, a third, a third, roughly.

114
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:23,436
[SPEAKER_20]: Does that change under this calculus?

115
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:29,538
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because we're held to a standard of committing our funds for housing development.

116
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:35,140
[SPEAKER_06]: That does include if we just shift our money to the trust for them to distribute.

117
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still CPA money doing housing efforts out there.

118
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:40,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So it still counts towards our goals.

119
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Roberta, did you have anything else to add to that?

120
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:44,883
[SPEAKER_06]: as a member?

121
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:45,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

122
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:49,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, I think that that explains it pretty well.

123
00:08:49,724 --> 00:09:13,270
[SPEAKER_11]: The difference would be that instead of the applicants like the Medford Housing Authority coming to the CPC to apply for funding during our funding cycle, the idea is that the CPC, the housing trust would request money at the CPC and the CPC would give the money to the housing trust

124
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:24,725
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that applicant, but, for example, man for housing authority would ask the housing trust or the funds to spend the money instead of the CPC.

125
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Would we be allowing so.

126
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:39,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the Medford House, for example, the Medford Housing Authority, would they now, for all future funding requests, only go to the housing trust?

127
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:45,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Or would there still be an avenue for them to apply traditionally to CPC?

128
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:50,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I'm asking this is because, as you guys know, but the housing trust members don't.

129
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I work in Lexington at that housing authority.

130
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm involved with CPC and housing trust there.

131
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:58,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going through this very similar debate

132
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:10,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a housing authority director, I felt it was necessary to keep that avenue there for the housing authority to go traditional, just in case.

133
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:15,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the Housing Trust right now is super supportive of housing authority goals and the mission.

134
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a really collaborative effort.

135
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows down the road?

136
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just saying, you know what I mean, hypothetically?

137
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:21,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it smart?

138
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,742
[SPEAKER_04]: to keep the door open for that sort of thing?

139
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:31,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do, and I totally understand the benefit and just like, here's our pot of money.

140
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:32,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Go there.

141
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you guys go there and you can go there any time of the year.

142
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're not bound by these crazy application deadlines and all that.

143
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just, those are things that I've been thinking about lately.

144
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:45,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are some good thoughts, I think.

145
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:53,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Lisa, I want to invite you to have any, feel free to jump in here, but personally, I think

146
00:10:54,317 --> 00:11:04,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the benefit of having another avenue for our applicants here, but I also see the benefit of streamlining the process so they have an expectation.

147
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:08,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the same people are looking at the same type of projects with the same pot of money.

148
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:11,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and it helps with budgeting, too.

149
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:12,969
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

150
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,612
[SPEAKER_04]: The housing authority can say, hey, housing trust, we're anticipating x amount this year.

151
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:17,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

152
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:28,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other affordable housing type projects that we might receive applications for that wouldn't necessarily go to the trust?

153
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:29,385
[SPEAKER_06]: An excellent question.

154
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:46,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, most of, aside from those, those choice few development projects, we also, the CPC also funds service programs that help folks with startup costs, moving costs, as well as help with that rental arrears.

155
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have these service programs that,

156
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I think can continue to live in CPA because, you know, I have a good relationship with them and it's a light lift.

157
00:11:55,795 --> 00:12:03,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that we could retain the service aspect of it, but the true development construction elements might be better over in the trust.

158
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:10,987
[SPEAKER_11]: I jumped, I would, I would add that a reason.

159
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:32,198
[SPEAKER_11]: A value that the Affordable Housing Trust brings to determining how to spend construction, funds on construction projects, is the expertise that the trust members have, which is, surpasses the expertise that the CPC members have.

160
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:40,561
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I hear that the possibility that there could be a strain in relationship in the future, but

161
00:12:42,203 --> 00:13:01,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at the present time, it makes a lot of sense to lean on the trust expertise to be able to establish a program and set terms that are really an efficient and favorable use of the city's money for affordable housing and construction.

162
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:04,572
[SPEAKER_11]: So to also like, I'm sorry, Lisa.

163
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:05,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to say,

164
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:32,576
[SPEAKER_10]: I can appreciate having two streams of funding and an applicant being able to go to the CPC as well as the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, but in the cases where, and not that it would happen, but in the cases where, what happens when the Affordable Housing Trust is looking at an application and their debt service ratios aren't as up to stock, this doesn't meet the, what's it, 3.5, 1.0,

165
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:49,046
[SPEAKER_10]: and we decide that maybe we're not gonna fund the whole thing, or we decide not to fund it at the time, and then they come over to the CPC, and then that actually adds to the tension.

166
00:13:49,146 --> 00:14:05,275
[SPEAKER_10]: That gap would probably be more disruptive to the applicant in not knowing, because the Affordable Housing Trust Fund has a set standard of going in, we're looking at the funding, we're looking at the,

167
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:11,778
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking at the development, the tenant selection, the schedule of time.

168
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:14,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I assume you all do the same thing.

169
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:26,746
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the people with a background in the housing development field that may add the extra benefit of just having one place to go.

170
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:34,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And should the case happen, and I've seen it happen in other communities where

171
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:38,146
[SPEAKER_10]: The CPC funds the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

172
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:49,274
[SPEAKER_10]: The Affordable Housing Trust Fund commits all of their funding to a project, and that project comes back for more than what has happened in the past in other communities.

173
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:56,220
[SPEAKER_10]: The trust fund would go to the CPC, and the trust fund would say, can we fund us a little bit more?

174
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the trust fund would then fund that development.

175
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:02,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it keeps it streamlined.

176
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,606
[SPEAKER_10]: It has the same sort of

177
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:18,822
[SPEAKER_10]: terms, long terms, or grant terms, whatever it would be, and just make it easier on the borrower to get all of their finances and interest for closing policy incentives.

178
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:31,940
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good segue to what I was going to mention too, is that you have flexibility on the trust side to do a grant or a forgivable loan or a non-forgivable loan, whatever that may be called, a traditional loan.

179
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:40,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have some more flexibility that might work best for that particular project versus the CPC where we only get grants.

180
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,511
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have

181
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:58,735
[SPEAKER_06]: we'd have to do some ordinance reworking for us to be able to have that flexibility that you would have on the trust, but that's just another benefit of the trust looking at these projects, because you have the ability to adapt to what their needs are versus trust.

182
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:06,760
[SPEAKER_20]: So, as we said, first of all, this must be a fairly common thing, the commonwealth for other cities.

183
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,982
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not reinventing the wheel here, I don't believe.

184
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:09,282
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

185
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:11,644
[SPEAKER_20]: So, we're following a set template that

186
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,602
[SPEAKER_20]: or maybe slightly adapting at the Medford or less than?

187
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:16,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Slightly adapting.

188
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:21,905
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no standardization of CPA, really, whenever it comes to affordable housing.

189
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:27,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say that, you know, we meet once a month with other CPA communities.

190
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:31,991
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems like a lot of trust all came on board right around the same time.

191
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:35,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is something that a lot of communities are kind of figuring out.

192
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:40,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We look to establish communities like Somerville has had a trust for 20, 30 years or so.

193
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of these communities are trying to figure it out, look to our established trust for guidance.

194
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:51,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, nothing, what we're presenting here is out of the norm.

195
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:55,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not weird or anything.

196
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:57,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of a better word because I'm tired.

197
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:59,775
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's within the realm of normalcy.

198
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:01,756
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

199
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:02,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

200
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:10,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And this isn't like, hey, this is exactly what's happening going forward.

201
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to introduce the concept.

202
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:19,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I would certainly welcome all members to bring thoughts and obviously members of the trust as well.

203
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:26,237
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure everybody's comfortable with this going forward, but we felt like it might be the best course of action.

204
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:32,701
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's the anticipated schedule for putting this into place that was funding cycle already underway?

205
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:37,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should look to strongly implement this for next fiscal year.

206
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:52,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I think right now, the requests that we have at the CPC as part of our annual funding round are just our service programs that we continuously fund every year that are meant for moving and housing families.

207
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, the trust is asking for a tranche of funding as well.

208
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:57,916
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I may, through the chair,

209
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:12,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week, the housing trust just awarded its 1st funding award to the affordable housing construction project, which was bells way West.

210
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:17,034
[SPEAKER_11]: So bells way West came in needing some additional funds.

211
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:24,378
[SPEAKER_11]: The trust fund had the $250,000 that the CPC had given them previously.

212
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:34,563
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the CPC awarded funds to Bell's Midwest out of that pool of money to be able to finish their project.

213
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:40,746
[SPEAKER_10]: The trust awarded money, not the CPC.

214
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:41,966
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go around that.

215
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:42,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

216
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make you actual hats at Christmas.

217
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:50,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Why don't you just turn around.

218
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:53,626
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, a double-sided hat.

219
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:58,449
[SPEAKER_20]: What else do we need to discuss on this subject?

220
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:59,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing else.

221
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it was an introduction of members as well as a concept.

222
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:05,854
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would welcome comments from each and every member.

223
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:10,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Haylene, maybe I can call you and pick your brain since you're going through exactly this.

224
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:11,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you'd be a good

225
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:24,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Good test subject to ask about, but... Is there some kind of formal agreement that you think we need to enter into, or is this an understanding that we can go forward with?

226
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious what the method is of this.

227
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:32,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think we've really voted too much on procedure and policies of how we do things on the CPC.

228
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:39,677
[SPEAKER_06]: We can certainly have it be an agenda item on the CPC's agenda as an official talking point for just us.

229
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,413
[SPEAKER_06]: and we can discuss it as a group.

230
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:50,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still learning about the process, very eager to get into my first funding cycle is tonight.

231
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,841
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know in some of the earlier discussions leading up to this discussion,

232
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:14,444
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've wondered about it, or just observed, is how we set our amounts, our percentages that we're going to appropriate to each group, distribute to each category.

233
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:26,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll just be interesting to me to see how that plays out in the future, knowing that, I think we're saying that a large tranche of funds will automatically go to the trust.

234
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:36,878
[SPEAKER_02]: And just an observation, it's a little less like, let's set this percentage and then see what kind of requests we get.

235
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:38,339
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that off the bat.

236
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:45,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see how we, it puts a little more pressure maybe on that early budgeting.

237
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:45,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

238
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,493
[SPEAKER_02]: because we know we have this commitment.

239
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:51,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

240
00:20:51,093 --> 00:21:02,119
[SPEAKER_20]: That's actually a really good point, because there have been years when we've had almost no dollars in the affordable bucket, so to speak, which has allowed other things to be funded that may not have been if we had a consistent power amount.

241
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,280
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's going to make it even more competitive.

242
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:05,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

243
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:06,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

244
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:09,083
[SPEAKER_20]: For the non-housing, which is OK.

245
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:09,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

246
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:17,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is a best practice in other communities where they just set a percentage every year, and that percentage just goes right off the top to the trust.

247
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:25,159
[SPEAKER_06]: then they focus on historic preservation and open space projects and leave the housing to the experts.

248
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:36,281
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, any other thoughts before we officially, I think we need a motion to adjourn this meeting to start the next meeting, but any other thoughts, questions?

249
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:37,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Joan.

250
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry I'm late, I misread the agenda.

251
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:43,023
[SPEAKER_14]: I was here at 6.30 and nobody was there and I was like, oh, it's 6.45.

252
00:21:43,063 --> 00:21:43,463
[SPEAKER_14]: So in a nutshell,

253
00:21:49,122 --> 00:22:07,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Is the idea that we are just going to send a set dollar amount every year to the trust fund, to the housing trust, excuse me, without any sort of debate or whatever, and that if anybody, if we get an application for a housing application, are we going to send them to the trust first, or are we going to accept them?

254
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:17,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the general idea here is that, you know, if somebody approaches us and says, hey, I want money for development, we would kindly introduce them to our friends on the trust.

255
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should have a future discussion with just the CPC about establishing it.

256
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:31,406
[SPEAKER_06]: If we should establish that percentage and just do that as an annual best practice, as well as what that percentage would be.

257
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:40,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think we should debate that at this point, but that should be a CPC discussion at a later, maybe January.

258
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that address it for you, Joan?

259
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

260
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:49,064
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

261
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:51,185
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we end this portion of the program?

262
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:56,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could take a motion to adjourn from any, or you can, or you can, because technically you're co-chairs right now.

263
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:59,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make a motion to adjourn.

264
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:07,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have to roll call because we're a hybrid.

265
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

266
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,690
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

267
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Start in a room, Doug?

268
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:10,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

269
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:12,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

270
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:14,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

271
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:15,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

272
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:17,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Not officially yet.

273
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:18,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Kayla?

274
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:20,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

275
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:21,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Kayleigh.

276
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:22,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

277
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:23,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Joan.

278
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:24,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

279
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:25,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

280
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:26,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that number is.

281
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:27,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's nine.

282
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:30,267

[SPEAKER_06]: The CPC folks hang out here for a moment.

284
00:23:33,387 --> 00:23:37,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to stop this recording, then start up a new one, but this meeting is adjourned.

[SPEAKER_10]: Recording stopped.

289

[SPEAKER_02]: You guys gave a great presentation a few weeks ago.

290
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:56,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a introduction to the goals.

291
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:57,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that posted somewhere?

292
00:23:58,058 --> 00:23:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

293
00:23:58,198 --> 00:23:59,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Recording in progress.

294
00:23:59,658 --> 00:24:00,238

I'm Jeremy here.

00:24:59,650 --> 00:24:59,850
Yes.

00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:12,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantastic.

317
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:14,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

318
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:15,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:17,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Expect them to come shortly.

320
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:18,907
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

321
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,167
[SPEAKER_11]: So let us begin.

322
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:25,148
[SPEAKER_11]: On the first thing on the agenda is approval of meeting minutes from July 8th, 2025.

323
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:26,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

324
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Wish they were in the Dropbox.

325
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a physical copy here, too, if they want to peruse.

326
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any comments on the meeting minutes from July 8th?

327
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they in the meeting packet dated 9-9-25?

328
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,978
[SPEAKER_06]: They did go in earlier this morning.

329
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,639
[SPEAKER_06]: There they are.

330
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I refreshed.

331
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

332
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I make a motion to receive the minutes?

333
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:58,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

334
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:01,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Jeremy.

335
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to abstain?

336
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:03,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't here.

337
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:04,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

338
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:06,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.

339
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't here either.

340
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll need another second.

341
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:13,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

342
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:14,773
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

343
00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:16,254
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will call the roll.

344
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:17,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy?

345
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:19,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I abstain?

346
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:20,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

347
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:21,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Reg?

348
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:22,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

349
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Doug?

350
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:24,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

351
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:25,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Joan?

352
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:26,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

353
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:27,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Hayley?

354
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:28,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Abstain.

355
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:30,627
[SPEAKER_11]: And myself?

356
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:31,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

357
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:35,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, four.

358
00:26:40,073 --> 00:26:51,895
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, and next on the agenda is a small grant application from the Unitarian Universalist Church, Eastern Window Restoration.

359
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:55,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Liz going to be joining online, or?

360
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:56,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

361
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:58,476
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought she was going to be present.

362
00:26:58,716 --> 00:26:58,796
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

363
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:01,417
[SPEAKER_19]: The person who says see there, which I'm sorry.

364
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:03,957
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to hold them up.

365
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:05,498
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

366
00:27:05,518 --> 00:27:08,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to take these out of order?

367
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:11,826
[SPEAKER_11]: We could take administrative updates first.

368
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:17,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to hold off on overviewing the anticipated funding round yet.

369
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:21,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So administrative updates while we wait for other folks to arrive.

370
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:22,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

371
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:26,509
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some upcoming tabling events.

372
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:31,330
[SPEAKER_06]: October seems to be quite heavy with social events on weekends.

373
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just going to share some dates.

374
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:39,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll circulate this by email too, but looking to see if anybody would be willing to help participate.

375
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:52,035
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of this month, on the 28th, no it's the 27th, Mystic River Celebration is the 27th, apologies.

376
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:54,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Saturday the 27th from 12 to 4.

377
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:59,873
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great if folks could come hang out at that one.

378
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:03,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's just for an hour or so, if you're in the area.

379
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:06,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So September 27th, 12 to 4.

380
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:08,195
[SPEAKER_06]: To the condom?

381
00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:09,595
[SPEAKER_06]: It is at the condom shell, yes.

382
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:12,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

383
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:17,897
[SPEAKER_06]: October 4th, and I am signed up for the Mystic River Celebration.

384
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:19,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a commitment for the CPC.

385
00:28:19,877 --> 00:28:24,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not yet signed up for the next Saturday, which is Oktoberfest.

386
00:28:25,974 --> 00:28:26,894
[SPEAKER_06]: October 4th.

387
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:27,855
[SPEAKER_06]: October?

388
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:29,215
[SPEAKER_06]: October 4th.

389
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:30,135
[SPEAKER_06]: November?

390
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:32,136
[SPEAKER_06]: October 4th.

391
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:32,636
[SPEAKER_06]: October 5th.

392
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:32,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

393
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:35,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's the Chambers.

394
00:28:35,237 --> 00:28:36,097
[SPEAKER_06]: They just announced it.

395
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:36,818
[SPEAKER_06]: It just kind of came out.

396
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:37,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

397
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:38,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't seen it.

398
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:41,279
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I had 9... I had 1027, not 927.

399
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:41,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

400
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:44,120
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I'm... Okay, there we go.

401
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,140
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going in reverse order.

402
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So Saturday, this one is 12 to 5, and you have to be there the whole time.

403
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:55,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a bit of a commitment there.

404
00:28:55,982 --> 00:29:01,224
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit longer, but October 4th, 12 to 5.

405
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:04,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And where is that one?

406
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:06,005
[SPEAKER_06]: That one will be here right here in the square.

407
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:13,408
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody wants to circle the square, it's nearly an identical program in terms of what's available there.

408
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:14,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

409
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:16,769
[SPEAKER_06]: October 5th.

410
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:28,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it's going to be, this one's interesting, October 5th, there's Community Day at Tufts, and I believe that's 12 to three.

411
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:36,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Roberta and myself will be there, because Roberta's wearing a couple hats, I'm wearing a couple hats.

412
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:42,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anybody could come and kind of help out with that, that would be wonderful as well.

413
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:46,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Additionally, this date may move,

414
00:29:47,046 --> 00:30:00,352
[SPEAKER_06]: But because of community day encroachment, CPC is going to be partnering with the planning department to do a outreach event for the COVID Memorial Grove.

415
00:30:01,272 --> 00:30:04,333
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a CPC funded project for the study.

416
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:13,037
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming back this funding round to ask for construction money by October 5th from 1 to 3 at Riverbend Park.

417
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:24,667
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would just be like a tabling, trying to get folks to weigh in on designs that we've got drafted up and get some feedback from the community about what that might look like.

418
00:30:27,148 --> 00:30:27,689
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more.

419
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, October's shopping.

420
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:35,154
[SPEAKER_06]: October 18th, this is a Saturday.

421
00:30:35,174 --> 00:30:39,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Harvest Your Energy Festival.

422
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:42,219
[SPEAKER_06]: From 12 to 3.

423
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:51,987
[SPEAKER_06]: This is at the McGlynn playground area and Riverbend Park have that great spaces behind the playground.

424
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:54,228
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 12 to three.

425
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:58,091
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a table set up for that one.

426
00:30:58,371 --> 00:30:58,952
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.

427
00:30:58,972 --> 00:30:59,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You do.

428
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:06,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So anybody wants to come hang out with Roberta, I will probably be there in my planning department hat to help them execute the event.

429
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:15,293
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great place to come and celebrate one of our biggest and most successful CPA projects to date.

430
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:16,613
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

431
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:22,975
[SPEAKER_06]: CPA helped fund the vast majority of the McGlynn's full playground redesign.

432
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:26,255
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's nice that we get to do that event.

433
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can point to the things that we did.

434
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:30,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the one with the stage.

435
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:31,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct, yes.

436
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:36,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

437
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:41,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be hanging out with you folks on the 19th day after Harvest Energy Fest.

438
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:44,800
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I will circulate.

439
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I just spat out a lot of dates there.

440
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:48,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll circulate this through email.

441
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:53,045
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would be awesome, like I said, even if it's for an hour, if you can come and help out.

442
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,567
[SPEAKER_06]: People are great at these tabling events.

443
00:31:55,587 --> 00:31:57,348
[SPEAKER_06]: They just want to chat about Medford.

444
00:31:57,588 --> 00:31:59,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And you all are here because you also love Medford.

445
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:03,831
[SPEAKER_06]: So it ends up being a really great opportunity to chat with folks and connect.

446
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:12,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, administrative updates, I don't really have too much else.

447
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure I can find other things to talk about, but that's what I have.

448
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,396
[SPEAKER_14]: You're doing a fine job there, Theresa.

449
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:24,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Fine job.

450
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:25,638
[SPEAKER_14]: You're doing a fine job.

451
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:26,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, John.

452
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:29,059
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that.

453
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,740
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that, Reg?

454
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,862
[SPEAKER_16]: October 5, you have two events, community day and outreach.

455
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:34,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

456
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:35,403
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you going to split yourself?

457
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:38,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm hoping you would help me with that red.

458
00:32:41,612 --> 00:32:45,738
[SPEAKER_06]: We may be moving the cope at Memorial Grove because we really want to try and get as many people.

459
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:47,941
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a TV.

460
00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:55,110
[SPEAKER_14]: But in my suggestion, Teresa, instead, I would love to get him instead of sending the dates out.

461
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:58,375
[SPEAKER_14]: just say, here are the dates, if anybody can come.

462
00:32:58,815 --> 00:33:00,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do it like a doodle poll.

463
00:33:01,057 --> 00:33:03,258
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to pick a time that you can come.

464
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Because everybody needs to spend an hour or whatever doing these things.

465
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:09,663
[SPEAKER_14]: I wrote them all down.

466
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:12,485
[SPEAKER_14]: The only one I'm not available for at all is the 18th.

467
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:15,227
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

468
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:17,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I might be able to participate in a couple of these, for sure.

469
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:20,031
[SPEAKER_14]: But let's do it like a doodle poll.

470
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's fill in each event.

471
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:23,693
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a great idea.

472
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:30,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I was just going to ask, like, do we have an obligation to attend all of these events?

473
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:36,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, I understand it's best to be out there for the majority, but like, that's a crazy amount.

474
00:33:36,493 --> 00:33:42,178
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, John, I totally get you, like, I want to help, but like, I have four kids and I have

475
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:44,920
[SPEAKER_04]: sports stacked on a weekend that I cannot commit to that.

476
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:56,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I mean, I'll do my very best, but like, that was a crazy amount of dates, you know, so like, like to that, you know, you know, you get a good crowd that people are responsive to and like, really, you know, do that.

477
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:04,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like, Teresa, like, I don't want you to feel like you're, you need to spend your weekends doing this either, you know, so I appreciate that.

478
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:04,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

479
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:15,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not obligated to any of these besides Mystic River Celebration, which is the September 27th one, and Harvest Your Energy Fest.

480
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the only two that we've officially registered for.

481
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:30,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'd be great if we can be obnoxious and be out there and just oversaturate folks with CPC so that everybody knows what we do, but it's not a requirement.

482
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's a good point healing.

483
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:34,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.

484
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:38,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll clarify all this, you know, which ones we're committed to, which ones we're not.

485
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, folks aren't available for the ones we're not committed to.

486
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:47,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we can, we can move on with our lives, but thank you.

487
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:49,584
[SPEAKER_14]: We know you're going to be at October fest.

488
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:51,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Kaylene don't don't lie.

489
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:51,385
[SPEAKER_14]: We know.

490
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:52,306
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

491
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:07,721
[SPEAKER_14]: As we heard from our comment about that, based on what Kayleen just said, and I agree, I know that we've got feedback from these events in the past.

492
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:14,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we take a look at where we received the most feedback and really maybe try to focus on those ones?

493
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:23,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I would, and I could be wrong, but the Tufts Community Day thing, I wonder if we'd get a lot of CPA feedback at that.

494
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:29,814
[SPEAKER_14]: as opposed to like Oktoberfest or the Mystic River Celebration, it seems to me, and Harvest Your Energy.

495
00:35:29,854 --> 00:35:32,636
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be, you know, you get a lot back.

496
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:39,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'd love to hear your thoughts too, Roberta, but I would say Community Day does bring in a lot of families.

497
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:47,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I had to rank them, I would probably put the ones that are more focused here in Bedford Square.

498
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:49,365
[SPEAKER_06]: We get a lot of, you know, interaction there.

499
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,466
[SPEAKER_06]: But Community Day, we do get a lot of

500
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,803
[SPEAKER_06]: we still do get quite a bit of interaction.

501
00:35:53,823 --> 00:35:56,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I would probably rank that third of those three that I mentioned.

502
00:35:56,984 --> 00:35:58,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Roberta, what are your thoughts?

503
00:35:58,604 --> 00:35:59,785
[SPEAKER_11]: About the same.

504
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:02,425
[SPEAKER_11]: All of these events are highly weather dependent.

505
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:05,446
[SPEAKER_11]: So on a good weather day, we could be mobbed.

506
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:11,447
[SPEAKER_11]: On a bad weather day, we could be standing there shivering, waiting for the event to be over.

507
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:11,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

508
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:14,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So both things can happen.

509
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:30,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and I think whether is really the determining factor more than the location of the event as to how many people you tend to get the same.

510
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:36,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Families, you have the same community tends to come out to most of these events.

511
00:36:36,782 --> 00:36:36,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

512
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:43,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are in 3 different locations because location also is a factor.

513
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:49,685
[SPEAKER_11]: So, for example, the October fest is same location as the circle the square.

514
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:56,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we might be likely to talk to the same people for October fest.

515
00:36:58,412 --> 00:37:00,514
[SPEAKER_11]: We were at circle the square earlier this year.

516
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:01,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

517
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:10,945
[SPEAKER_11]: But the other two events are in different locations, and so they might bring different, the other three events might bring different people out.

518
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:15,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you usually, you do end up seeing the same couple of folks.

519
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:19,068
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple pop into my head right now.

520
00:37:19,148 --> 00:37:26,871
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, there is some diversity over it.

521
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:36,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the community day, because it does community day does tend to bring obviously less students and younger folks, but there's families that go through it as well.

522
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:37,561
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Maisha.

523
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:46,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we heard from our friend Liz?

524
00:37:47,127 --> 00:37:47,428
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

525
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:50,930
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm called and left a message, so I don't know.

526
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:54,235
[SPEAKER_19]: If she was joining by Zoom, something could have come up.

527
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,476
[SPEAKER_19]: I have no photos.

528
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:56,517
[SPEAKER_19]: I have them on my phone.

529
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:57,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me just be brief about...

530
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:13,753
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to recognize a question from Maisha.

531
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:15,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm sorry.

532
00:38:15,854 --> 00:38:23,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't get into the city council meeting on Zoom because there's a pass code and I'm trying to get reappointed for this position.

533
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:26,417
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just trying to get onto that Zoom meeting.

534
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you guys can help me with that.

535
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:30,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Maisha, I'll text you.

536
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:31,878
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, thank you.

537
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:32,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to interrupt.

538
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,059
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries.

539
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:34,519
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries.

540
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: That's problematic.

541
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:45,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then.

542
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,968
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I spend all this time.

543
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:50,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

544
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:43,947
[SPEAKER_06]: always daunting to text the city council president while he's in a meeting.

545
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:57,917
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't realize that we had passcode protected public meetings now, but I thought I was doing something wrong, but I tried like everywhere and I couldn't figure out where the passcode was.

546
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:11,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Maisha, I've made the mistake before where there was a CityCount, like a Council of the Whole meeting or a different meeting listed on the same day and I clicked the wrong link.

547
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:16,816
[SPEAKER_13]: I got an email from someone.

548
00:40:16,836 --> 00:40:18,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me, I'll try out another link.

549
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see if I'm missing something.

550
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:20,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

551
00:40:21,778 --> 00:40:25,099
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to the City Calendar Mindshow and try that link.

552
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:27,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's what I was using.

553
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,561
[SPEAKER_13]: It kept saying that I needed a passcode.

554
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:30,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

555
00:40:33,002 --> 00:40:33,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll try it again.

556
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:34,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll text you.

557
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:35,603
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry for interrupting.

558
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:36,303
[SPEAKER_13]: No worries.

559
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:46,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, back to CPC.

560
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:47,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

561
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:52,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I will move to the next item on the agenda, the remaining item on the agenda.

562
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,741
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not.

563
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:53,561
[SPEAKER_11]: We have two more things.

564
00:40:54,441 --> 00:41:00,943
[SPEAKER_11]: So right now we're going to take up the small grant application from the Unitarian Universalist Church for Eastern Window Restoration.

565
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:03,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Joan, would you want to come up here and sit up?

566
00:41:03,784 --> 00:41:06,705
[SPEAKER_06]: The microphone that we have is only so robust.

567
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:17,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'll do, Joan, too, is I can bring up the application of NCROS and have it there.

568
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:18,272
[SPEAKER_11]: So, welcome.

569
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:24,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Introduce yourself and give us a very brief overview of the project you're applying for.

570
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,641
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Joan Keene.

571
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:30,385
[SPEAKER_19]: I am a representative from the Union of Church of Medford.

572
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:45,963
[SPEAKER_19]: and working with Liz Ammons, who we had a very successful application awarded in the spring for a major carpentry and painting restoration, preservation of the church.

573
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:51,606
[SPEAKER_19]: And Liz Ammons did 95% of the work on that, by the way.

574
00:41:52,106 --> 00:41:59,850
[SPEAKER_19]: And about a month ago, we invited Teresa to come and review the successful

575
00:42:01,114 --> 00:42:02,035
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's almost completed.

576
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:28,688
[SPEAKER_19]: As we were going around the church, we were sharing with her our aspirations to completely the project, one being a major stained glass window on the Powder House side, Powder House Road side of the church needs new plexiglass, or which was not covered sufficiently in our grant.

577
00:42:29,573 --> 00:42:37,880
[SPEAKER_19]: trees at that time enthusiastically mentioned that there was an off-cycle small grant process that we could apply to.

578
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:40,543
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is what it is.

579
00:42:40,763 --> 00:42:46,568
[SPEAKER_19]: It is nothing religious about this particular shirt or window.

580
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:50,271
[SPEAKER_19]: And we find it necessary.

581
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:56,637
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how long that plexiglass has been there, but it does not allow moisture

582
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:03,268
[SPEAKER_19]: to pass through, it's rotted at the bottom, the wood needed to be replaced.

583
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:09,629
[SPEAKER_19]: They already went ahead and replaced the wood before, all the supporting wood, before we decided, oh, there's an option.

584
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:13,710
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be lovely to complete the whole project at one time, because it just looks so beautiful.

585
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:20,071
[SPEAKER_19]: So we submitted the contract, a very detailed contract, and asking for $84,000.

586
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:20,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, $84,000 is the... $8,400.

587
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:20,771
[SPEAKER_19]: $8,400, rather.

588
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:21,071
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

589
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:48,111
[SPEAKER_19]: 8500 yes right not small at all almost what we already have and um i think we asked for nine because you never know what the there's always overcharges so um i know that's the window a very prominent window in our social hall where many meetings and and our mcs hold uh

590
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:51,444
[SPEAKER_19]: whole regular events.

591
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:55,045
[SPEAKER_19]: So that is the basic request.

592
00:43:55,825 --> 00:44:04,967
[SPEAKER_19]: And there is some urgency in that the contractors are still on site completing the final list.

593
00:44:05,427 --> 00:44:14,510
[SPEAKER_19]: And it would be lovely if we knew one way or the other so we could have them maybe continue with the project while the temperatures and the season holds.

594
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:17,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

595
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:20,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there questions from the members?

596
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:23,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Just one.

597
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:29,936
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this solution, how long has this been up there?

598
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:31,716
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's a permanent solution.

599
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:36,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Because this is wood that's going to rot out every quarter century or something like that.

600
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:43,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there, not for this round, but is there maybe a better long-term plan for something like this?

601
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:44,699
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just asking a question.

602
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:46,040
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure what the answer is.

603
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,640
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

604
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,939
[SPEAKER_19]: I do not know the history of this.

605
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:59,187
[SPEAKER_19]: I've only been with the church since 21 and having been in real estate and done historic preservation in other towns on the committee.

606
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:04,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Plexiglass is the cheaper way to go.

607
00:45:07,493 --> 00:45:16,620
[SPEAKER_19]: From what I understand, it will, the way it's constructed at the bottom, there are ways to, the weep holes are better so that the moisture can escape, but it won't.

608
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:19,034
[SPEAKER_19]: damaged the window.

609
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:30,083
[SPEAKER_19]: That has been the main problem now that the base would have been deteriorating because there was the moisture barrier was not sufficient.

610
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:32,645
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was the plan.

611
00:45:32,825 --> 00:45:37,909
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't, as I said, I don't know what has been done in the last 50 years on that.

612
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:45,255
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm, I'm pretty sure that Plexiglas lifetime has exceeded 25 years, at least.

613
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:46,363
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

614
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:51,146
[SPEAKER_19]: And many of the back windows of the church, it was replaced.

615
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:53,307
[SPEAKER_19]: And we tested that.

616
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:54,267
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really nice.

617
00:45:54,307 --> 00:45:54,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

618
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:54,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

619
00:45:54,828 --> 00:45:56,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very stark, the difference between that.

620
00:45:57,029 --> 00:46:02,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this photo best represents it, how foggy and foggy it is.

621
00:46:02,912 --> 00:46:06,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not seeing that beautiful artwork there.

622
00:46:06,134 --> 00:46:08,035
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that was kind of my point.

623
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:14,518
[SPEAKER_20]: The thing with Shilali windows and some of the things you've done with windows over the course of the CPC that they're

624
00:46:16,995 --> 00:46:30,283
[SPEAKER_20]: This would suggest a larger grant in the future that maybe figure out what a long-term solution of that gas clear glass or something tempered or whatever, because plexiglass yellows over time, as you can see over that.

625
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:35,847
[SPEAKER_20]: And wood just doesn't seem like the right frame long-term either.

626
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:44,392
[SPEAKER_20]: There has to be, I think, a preservation architect component here for a future long-term vision for this.

627
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:45,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Could there be less panels?

628
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,031
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I don't know.

629
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:51,852
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure, you mean fewer in the support?

630
00:46:52,492 --> 00:46:53,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

631
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:53,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

632
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:53,972
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

633
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:56,353
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, some of them are closets.

634
00:46:56,373 --> 00:47:05,174
[SPEAKER_19]: If it were glass, though, the weight of that would seemingly require at least this amount of framework.

635
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:05,774
[SPEAKER_20]: Potentially.

636
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:06,594
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

637
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:08,555
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, but there might be alternatives.

638
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:13,055
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I'm going to say, is I think long-term, that is not part of this grant.

639
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:15,376
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, this is an emergency repair,

640
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:22,552
[SPEAKER_20]: a wood frame for plexi is a, it's more than a band-aid, but not much more.

641
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:24,312
[SPEAKER_20]: But you need a band-aid right now.

642
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:45,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, and I'm not, I do not know the ratios, the moisture ratios of what a glass covering would do to the color and everything of that particular, the church has been around since the 1700s, but this particular edifice, I'm trying to remember being there a short time, the history of it, it's either 1874 or 94 when it was constructed.

643
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:49,430
[SPEAKER_19]: the present edifice was constructed.

644
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:55,853
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's an original window from a Boston company.

645
00:47:56,494 --> 00:48:09,460
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that you have all the history and the registration, the national registry of certain places in the Massachusetts one, all of that information from our previous application.

646
00:48:13,902 --> 00:48:15,023
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think just to,

647
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:22,119
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Teresa already mentioned that she was pleased with the detail our contractor provided.

648
00:48:27,663 --> 00:48:31,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of curiosity, what was the grant award in the previous cycle?

649
00:48:31,684 --> 00:48:33,324
[SPEAKER_02]: We received $99,000.

650
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:36,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you anticipate other projects?

651
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:47,988
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this was such a drop from heaven to have this option to do everything at the same time, so maybe we are good for $30,000, $50,000, I don't know.

652
00:48:49,088 --> 00:48:51,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Until that plexiglass yellows again.

653
00:48:52,689 --> 00:48:55,110
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be just lovely to finish the whole project.

654
00:48:56,769 --> 00:49:08,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Even just an aside, just painting the front doors a color that just made the stained glass windows on the front facing High Street just awesome.

655
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:11,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Stand in front of it and then pull up Google Street View.

656
00:49:11,676 --> 00:49:14,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it pulls it up from 2023 and then look at it now.

657
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:21,521
[SPEAKER_06]: The way you guys were able to stretch that $99,000 so well, it made such an impact on the building.

658
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,221
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really lovely.

659
00:49:22,441 --> 00:49:26,083
[SPEAKER_19]: Having done it before, I was personally astounded that they

660
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:32,675
[SPEAKER_19]: and replace it with about 200 cages for starters.

661
00:49:33,175 --> 00:49:34,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep that contractor.

662
00:49:34,496 --> 00:49:44,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, is there a motion from a member of the committee to recommend a small grant for this project?

663
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:53,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make a motion to recommend awarding a small grant as requested.

664
00:49:54,209 --> 00:49:54,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second.

665
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:55,470
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

666
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:58,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will call the roll.

667
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:00,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Joan?

668
00:50:01,491 --> 00:50:01,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

669
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:03,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Haylene?

670
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:04,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

671
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:05,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy?

672
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:06,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

673
00:50:07,316 --> 00:50:07,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Reg?

674
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:08,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

675
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:09,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Doug?

676
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:10,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

677
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:10,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Adam?

678
00:50:10,899 --> 00:50:11,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

679
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:12,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And myself, yes.

680
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:13,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

681
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:15,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

682
00:50:15,442 --> 00:50:16,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very, very much.

683
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:16,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

684
00:50:17,244 --> 00:50:18,285
[SPEAKER_06]: So appreciated.

685
00:50:18,345 --> 00:50:18,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

686
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll reach out to you and Liz tomorrow morning with next steps.

687
00:50:22,746 --> 00:50:23,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

688
00:50:23,246 --> 00:50:24,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

689
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:26,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing you brought your good luck charm to us over there.

690
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:26,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

691
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:26,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Well done.

692
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:27,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

693
00:50:27,587 --> 00:50:28,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope Liz is okay.

694
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:30,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm sure she is.

695
00:50:30,608 --> 00:50:31,848
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a very busy lady as you all are.

696
00:50:31,868 --> 00:50:35,489
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much for your time.

697
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:36,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Joe.

698
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:36,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all.

699
00:50:36,529 --> 00:50:37,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

700
00:50:48,604 --> 00:50:58,652
[SPEAKER_11]: So the final item on our agenda tonight is to give a brief overview of the anticipated projects from the FY26 annual funding round.

701
00:50:59,993 --> 00:51:03,635
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if you want to share this spreadsheet.

702
00:51:04,456 --> 00:51:12,502
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a spreadsheet with the array of projects in our meeting packet for today.

703
00:51:13,363 --> 00:51:17,184
[SPEAKER_11]: and we have an embarrassing of riches request for money.

704
00:51:18,524 --> 00:51:33,006
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm trying to think ahead about like how can we most efficiently use our time, use the time of our applicants to be able to make the best decisions on these projects.

705
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:42,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to perhaps make a lightning round through this list today among committee members to identify

706
00:51:43,278 --> 00:51:48,461
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think you need to know in order to make a decision about this?

707
00:51:48,601 --> 00:52:03,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any questions that you're hoping that the applicants are going to answer in their applications or their presentations so that we can give them that feedback and encourage them to have that information ready for us up front?

708
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:13,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Another thing that might be helpful for us to think through this and up the ground this evening is just a gut check on each of the projects.

709
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:24,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe committee members could tell me, how do you think you would prioritize these requests individually?

710
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:31,608
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't an official vote because we don't have all the information yet, but I think that

711
00:52:32,502 --> 00:52:43,510
[SPEAKER_11]: going through this prioritization exercise might help us to help our applicants because some in many cases the city is applying for many different projects.

712
00:52:44,971 --> 00:52:53,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So it will help our applicants to prioritize what they think is really worth focusing their applications on.

713
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:59,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying so hard to like get this so you can see everybody and screen share and so

714
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:17,538
[SPEAKER_20]: I think my initial thought would be that we want people, and we ask this every time, but asking it live in the meeting is one thing, asking it before it's even due next week, I think, is another.

715
00:53:17,558 --> 00:53:20,819
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is, are there sources of funding?

716
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:23,419
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you phase it?

717
00:53:23,439 --> 00:53:29,100
[SPEAKER_20]: The obvious thing is that everyone, we've asked people to take haircuts before, when we didn't have enough money,

718
00:53:30,411 --> 00:53:40,478
[SPEAKER_20]: So just knowing that those basic questions, if they could mention it in the grant itself, I think that helps.

719
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:47,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Because that gives us a head start on saying, okay, 80% funding versus 100%.

720
00:53:48,303 --> 00:53:52,246
[SPEAKER_20]: And for the city, they often have multiple sources of funding anyway, in many cases.

721
00:53:52,546 --> 00:53:54,388
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, what percentage are we?

722
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:59,973
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, do you need that full 700 or 600 or whatever it is?

723
00:54:00,173 --> 00:54:00,393
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

724
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:05,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Could 500 do it so that we could find one of the 100 ones here that might not get it or not get enough?

725
00:54:06,756 --> 00:54:08,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, yeah.

726
00:54:08,657 --> 00:54:13,899
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are questions on our application route is, can this be phased?

727
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Other fundings, we asked them to identify other funding sources and one of the questions is also,

728
00:54:20,226 --> 00:54:23,828
[SPEAKER_06]: If CPA doesn't fund this, what's the probability of this project moving forward?

729
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:32,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we do have some qualifying questions that probably would address that, but I can certainly ask them to reinforce that in the presentation.

730
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:40,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's one that really stands out in terms of how much money they're asking for and having trouble the pathways and parking days too.

731
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:43,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I can talk all about that.

732
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, yeah, Brooks Estate.

733
00:54:46,212 --> 00:54:49,054
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Bedford Brooks Estate Land Trust.

734
00:54:49,294 --> 00:54:53,018
[SPEAKER_06]: My heir folks, I'm sorry for the new folks who didn't recognize, but that is good.

735
00:54:53,058 --> 00:54:55,239
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the Brooks Estate.

736
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:04,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other one that was standing out to me was the private owner who happens to also be the Brian Hayward.

737
00:55:05,408 --> 00:55:06,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he is.

738
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to be very clear with that project.

739
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:15,972
[SPEAKER_06]: there as a private consultant in his day job, not there at all as any sort of entity for the city.

740
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:22,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryan Hayward is a vice chair for the historical commission, but his day job is architect.

741
00:55:23,395 --> 00:55:26,276
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, since we're on record, I just want to be very clear about that.

742
00:55:26,376 --> 00:55:29,737
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only one that I saw that's a private project.

743
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:37,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It caught my attention too, and I saw that it was marked as eligible, but just help me understand for a private residence converting to a private residence.

744
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I was eligible.

745
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:40,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to take that?

746
00:55:40,759 --> 00:55:40,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

747
00:55:41,499 --> 00:55:59,894
[SPEAKER_11]: So preserving the carriage house, the exterior restoration preservation would be an eligible project because the members of the public benefit by being able to see the preserved building from the street, not necessarily having to go in it.

748
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:08,441
[SPEAKER_11]: But I had a question on that project, which is, would they also be seeking to put an income restriction

749
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:09,840
[SPEAKER_11]: on that unit.

750
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,042
[SPEAKER_11]: So that really would be a combination of historic reservation and affordable housing.

751
00:56:14,443 --> 00:56:21,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Any affordable housing would be an eligible category for doing the whole interior conversion as well.

752
00:56:22,406 --> 00:56:34,532
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason I was noticing that one is because I feel like we established last cycle that private residents are eligible, but then there was the additional question of, do we want to fund them?

753
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for me, it was less about eligibility and it was more about

754
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:39,961
[SPEAKER_08]: prior to this, yeah.

755
00:56:40,101 --> 00:56:41,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

756
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:43,502
[SPEAKER_20]: What's the address of that one again, Judy?

757
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just in the Hillside District.

758
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:51,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

759
00:56:52,004 --> 00:56:58,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we only have like, I think less than 10 remaining carriage houses, original carriage houses in Medford.

760
00:56:58,746 --> 00:57:01,686
[SPEAKER_06]: That number might be a little high, but it's in my neighborhood.

761
00:57:01,726 --> 00:57:08,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, carriage house, is it more concrete block garage or is it true carriage house?

762
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,742
[SPEAKER_06]: like historic demolition.

763
00:57:13,102 --> 00:57:20,867
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's something to think about strategically for the committee as well as for the applicant.

764
00:57:21,788 --> 00:57:32,074
[SPEAKER_11]: The historic preservation angle, we could put conditions on the project that would permanently protect the building to ensure that it doesn't get torn down.

765
00:57:32,714 --> 00:57:37,157
[SPEAKER_11]: On the affordable housing side, we can put conditions in place that

766
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,643
[SPEAKER_11]: ensure that it's going to be affordable in perpetuity.

767
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:51,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's actually a very cheap, affordable housing project, if that's all they need to be able to do that.

768
00:57:54,091 --> 00:57:55,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Benefits on both sides.

769
00:57:55,672 --> 00:58:03,737
[SPEAKER_11]: We could encourage them to go to the Affordable Housing Trust for a project like this and not capture the historic

770
00:58:07,759 --> 00:58:18,186
[SPEAKER_11]: preservation aspect of it, or we could split it between the two boards, or we could just fund this as a split project ourselves.

771
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:20,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Three options.

772
00:58:20,408 --> 00:58:25,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of that is predicated on them saying, yes, we intend to move that as an income restricted.

773
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:26,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

774
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:34,297
[SPEAKER_06]: It had been made aware that if this project is funded, it would be subject to a deed restriction for income eligibility.

775
00:58:35,373 --> 00:58:38,095
[SPEAKER_02]: even the X, just the exterior restoration.

776
00:58:39,456 --> 00:58:40,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be curious.

777
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:47,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if this is the conversation we want to have right now, but I'd be curious what precedent that would set.

778
00:58:48,284 --> 00:58:51,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, let's say this round, we're like, great, bang for our buck.

779
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:52,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's fund this project.

780
00:58:52,847 --> 00:59:01,194
[SPEAKER_08]: The next round, we get five more projects, all a hundred K. And then they're like, well, why, why'd you fund that one and not mine?

781
00:59:01,214 --> 00:59:03,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I guess I'm curious about.

782
00:59:04,442 --> 00:59:08,686
[SPEAKER_08]: the precedent setting, like what we'd be signing up for if we did a bunch of these.

783
00:59:09,106 --> 00:59:10,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And do we want to sign up for that?

784
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:19,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in any year, there might be any number of projects that we can't fund because of a limited pool.

785
00:59:22,378 --> 00:59:30,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we often try to whittle these request amounts down so that we can give any eligible project funding?

786
00:59:32,355 --> 00:59:36,726
[SPEAKER_11]: We try to approach it, or there's no guarantee that every project will get funding.

787
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:37,928
[SPEAKER_11]: We, um.

788
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,531
[SPEAKER_11]: We try to fund as many projects as we can.

789
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:48,813
[SPEAKER_11]: So last year we similarly had to, maybe the last couple of years, it's been competitive.

790
00:59:49,593 --> 01:00:02,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we went through a round of prioritizing the projects ourselves so that we could decide, you know, like, what do we absolutely, what are we sure we want to fund this year?

791
01:00:02,657 --> 01:00:06,818
[SPEAKER_11]: And then below that, what would we fund if we have enough money?

792
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:13,022
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I don't think we ever got to the list of what do we think is not worth funding.

793
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:17,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And are you hoping that we'll set some of those priorities tonight, or is this more of that's the next?

794
01:00:18,178 --> 01:00:21,139
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be after we get all the information from them.

795
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:31,342
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you want to express that tonight, it might be able to help with giving feedback to the applicants about, is it worth submitting the whole application?

796
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:39,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Or should they really focus on some aspect of the project that will make it a higher priority project for us?

797
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:42,385
[SPEAKER_20]: If Reliance projects, yeah.

798
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:46,507
[SPEAKER_20]: is, in fact, a combination of historic preservation and affordable.

799
01:00:46,547 --> 01:00:48,888
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess we shouldn't identify it that way.

800
01:00:48,908 --> 01:00:52,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we not doing it just as historic right now?

801
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:57,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I did actually have it as housing at one point, but I was tinkering with formulas down here.

802
01:00:57,133 --> 01:00:59,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was thrown out.

803
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:00,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

804
01:01:01,435 --> 01:01:07,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we have funded projects where we've said, we want 100 grand, and it straddles both

805
01:01:07,704 --> 01:01:13,168
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, you know, categories, well, 50% will come from, you know, open space and the other 50 will come from historic.

806
01:01:13,188 --> 01:01:21,615
[SPEAKER_06]: We've actually done that for EMBL before, so we can stipulate that so that, you know, those buckets of money, you know, are, reflect that.

807
01:01:21,935 --> 01:01:35,746
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and I agree, actually, with Roberta, that I don't, I don't really know the merits of this project, because I haven't seen it yet, but $100,000 to get an affordable unit is about 25% of what it really costs in the real world, when I can tell.

808
01:01:36,346 --> 01:01:36,566
[SPEAKER_20]: If not,

809
01:01:38,266 --> 01:01:41,529
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's value in that.

810
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:44,932
[SPEAKER_20]: To me, the affordable component is actually bigger than the preservation component.

811
01:01:45,012 --> 01:01:47,774
[SPEAKER_20]: Which might be an argument for some age, too.

812
01:01:48,355 --> 01:01:49,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Essentially, yes.

813
01:01:49,275 --> 01:01:54,480
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think in the president's sense, though, is you bring us both and you'll get funded.

814
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,341
[SPEAKER_20]: If you bring one or the other, you might not.

815
01:01:56,782 --> 01:02:04,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I worry about the arbitrariness of rules and precedents that we will establish on private projects.

816
01:02:04,948 --> 01:02:06,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I remember the conversation we had with

817
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:10,385
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever address that was on High Street.

818
01:02:11,026 --> 01:02:11,526
[SPEAKER_02]: The armory.

819
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:12,247
[SPEAKER_08]: The armory.

820
01:02:13,148 --> 01:02:17,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were like, we think you should have a bench and sit.

821
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:23,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And it all felt a little like I'm making it up if you're going along.

822
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:34,046
[SPEAKER_08]: And now if we do a private residence, are we going to put, if it's affordable, does that mean we won't ask for an additional public good

823
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:39,194
[SPEAKER_08]: from that or I guess I would say the affordability is a pretty huge public.

824
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:39,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

825
01:02:39,935 --> 01:02:44,879
[SPEAKER_08]: So like in that sense, we wouldn't expect there to be like another an additional layer.

826
01:02:44,899 --> 01:02:56,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with my original reading of this with enlisted as historic preservation triggered the question of if we required this of the armory

827
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,888
[SPEAKER_02]: folks to have some kind of public good that we required here.

828
01:03:00,988 --> 01:03:07,610
[SPEAKER_02]: But I fully agree that adding that kind of affordability makes it vastly more appealing to fund.

829
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:10,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe re-categorizing it.

830
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:10,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

831
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:14,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Excel.

832
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,172
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

833
01:03:17,472 --> 01:03:20,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't seem to raise my hand, but I have a comment.

834
01:03:22,275 --> 01:03:27,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we ask for all of the city-owned property applications?

835
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:32,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we ask somebody at the city to put these in the order of priority for the city?

836
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:34,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

837
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a best practice we've done the past couple of years.

838
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I bring it to, you know, Mayor, DPW, Commissioner.

839
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:44,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, but who would you ask them?

840
01:03:44,242 --> 01:03:44,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

841
01:03:44,442 --> 01:03:46,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that would change the answer.

842
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:50,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually do ask, you know, Chief of Staff, Mayor,

843
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:55,739
[SPEAKER_06]: DPW commissioner as well as a planning director, because those tend to be like, you know, the heavy hitters.

844
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:58,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, normally all of them are applicants as well.

845
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's interesting, but this year.

846
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:10,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, but now that that's, um, so it's good to know what the city's priorities are to something you make the decision.

847
01:04:11,065 --> 01:04:16,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that would be helpful for me, if you would consider it, um, Teresa would be adding a column in here.

848
01:04:17,736 --> 01:04:29,203
[SPEAKER_02]: of previous funding, like previous year or two-year backlog of funding as a way to help prioritize, like, OK, we gave you 100,000 last year and the year before.

849
01:04:29,223 --> 01:04:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great idea.

850
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:32,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's not the priority this year.

851
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:36,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I can definitely add that.

852
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:43,391
[SPEAKER_11]: It's helpful information, but it also, we've given you a couple hundred thousand in the previous years.

853
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:53,877
[SPEAKER_11]: we have already invested in your project and they might need another tranche to be able to complete the project that we've started.

854
01:04:53,897 --> 01:05:01,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could have been both ways but it would help trigger some of those questions like what is this additional funding meant to accomplish?

855
01:05:02,082 --> 01:05:09,366
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a notes column on the end so I can just add like a previous funding received and then I'll just add some color in the notes section like

856
01:05:11,865 --> 01:05:16,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a couple of projects on there, you know, the pathways, but continuation of project.

857
01:05:17,968 --> 01:05:21,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably could use more words there, but continuation of a previously funded project.

858
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:28,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for my brain to like, better organize this, the AHT is asking for half a million.

859
01:05:29,073 --> 01:05:29,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

860
01:05:29,673 --> 01:05:32,935
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there are additional affordable housing requests.

861
01:05:33,955 --> 01:05:35,396
[SPEAKER_08]: How should I be thinking about this?

862
01:05:38,057 --> 01:05:39,818
[SPEAKER_11]: So the, um,

863
01:05:40,825 --> 01:05:48,889
[SPEAKER_11]: The affordable house, the 25% that we dedicated to affordable housing at the beginning of the year was our minimum.

864
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:53,792
[SPEAKER_11]: So our goal has been a third, a third, a third, as Doug mentioned earlier.

865
01:05:54,990 --> 01:06:05,465
[SPEAKER_11]: And the HT is asking for that 25% minimum, we still have the prerogative to go above that amount.

866
01:06:05,865 --> 01:06:10,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, it would be a good idea for us to go above that amount, at least sometimes because

867
01:06:12,873 --> 01:06:22,537
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason it was suggested that we set 25% as our minimum is because the state rewards communities that give at least 25% of their CP.

868
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:28,920
[SPEAKER_11]: In the last few years, we actually fell short of 25%, but they looked back over five years.

869
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we were able to pick up the big year when we gave so much to the housing authority.

870
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:35,543
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to now

871
01:06:35,997 --> 01:06:39,398
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I actually wasn't even going in the direction of percentages.

872
01:06:39,418 --> 01:06:42,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going more in the direction of like, who's owning affordable housing?

873
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:48,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want them to make all those decisions and like move everything over to them?

874
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:53,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do we still want to be in the business of deciding on affordable housing projects?

875
01:06:53,401 --> 01:06:56,562
[SPEAKER_11]: That's our $2 million question, right?

876
01:06:56,662 --> 01:07:04,264
[SPEAKER_11]: So the suggestion that Teresa presented when we talked with, oh, and you weren't here for the affordable housing conversation earlier.

877
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:27,415
[SPEAKER_11]: is that for now, we keep the housing programs, the rental assistance programs in CPC, but we delegate to the Affordable Housing Trust housing construction projects so that we can take advantage of their expertise and their ability to pool money for these bigger projects.

878
01:07:28,096 --> 01:07:32,279
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it allows us to

879
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:50,865
[SPEAKER_11]: maintain a little more flexibility with our funds to be able to say, like, we know that the minimum is going to be available to them, but we can respond to some of these unusual housing requests or the housing program requests.

880
01:07:54,327 --> 01:07:56,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Theresa, can you go back up to the affordable housing projects, please?

881
01:07:57,568 --> 01:07:57,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

882
01:07:58,349 --> 01:07:58,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

883
01:08:01,796 --> 01:08:04,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your questions were like, it was like a quiz.

884
01:08:05,177 --> 01:08:06,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a quiz for the earlier meeting.

885
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:11,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys remember everything you decided?

886
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:12,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Good work.

887
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:13,980
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't decide anything.

888
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:23,363
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just considering some proposals of what it might be as we get to know the other committee.

889
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:36,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, if we did that model that you just explained, so the housing families, the Medford move-in, those would stay in our responsibility.

890
01:08:37,107 --> 01:08:38,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And then obviously, housing trust money.

891
01:08:38,588 --> 01:08:49,774
[SPEAKER_04]: But then if there was a Medford housing walk-in for request or something or whatever, whatever, something more serious or construction related, that would get pushed the trust is what you're saying.

892
01:08:50,514 --> 01:08:50,714
Correct.

893
01:08:51,515 --> 01:08:51,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

894
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:52,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

895
01:08:53,476 --> 01:08:53,556
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

896
01:08:55,616 --> 01:08:59,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that they have the expertise to handle that.

897
01:09:00,078 --> 01:09:02,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anybody's joined any of the trust meetings.

898
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:13,222
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had quite a few in the past month, I think three, but just hearing them talk about things and like, I'm not a housing expert, but I am tasked with being responsible for housing for the city of Medford.

899
01:09:13,302 --> 01:09:20,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the things that they were talking about, like, I never would have thought, even thought of thinking about that, you know, so I'm really glad that they,

900
01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:23,846
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're very rigorous.

901
01:09:24,386 --> 01:09:31,068
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually, you missed this earlier too, the trust awarded their first loan to a project for $100,000.

902
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:43,111
[SPEAKER_06]: So seeing them kind of pull apart the application and ask those really intense questions, like, it made sense for the trust to- The first projects that we funded is- Yes.

903
01:09:43,771 --> 01:09:44,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

904
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:45,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

905
01:09:45,652 --> 01:09:51,833
[SPEAKER_11]: And where the CPC would have just said, okay, you know, we'll cut them a check in here, go do your project.

906
01:09:52,257 --> 01:10:00,600
[SPEAKER_11]: the trust is awarding it as a loan with the expectation that they're going to repay those funds and it comes back to the trust in the future.

907
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:06,522
[SPEAKER_11]: So like already they are, they know how to do this in a really efficient way.

908
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:07,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

909
01:10:07,863 --> 01:10:16,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Teresa, just help remind me of the fiscal year 26 funding, the 2.1 million.

910
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:16,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

911
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:20,487
[SPEAKER_02]: We've said that we're going to keep 50% of that as a reserve.

912
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:22,926
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get to that?

913
01:10:24,326 --> 01:10:28,588
[SPEAKER_02]: The reserve is just a leftover after you apply percentages?

914
01:10:28,608 --> 01:10:29,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

915
01:10:29,288 --> 01:10:33,970
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we're looking at this column, this is the budget that we established earlier this year for fiscal 26.

916
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:40,333
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's our 10%, 10% to open space and historic preservation.

917
01:10:40,393 --> 01:10:41,053
[SPEAKER_06]: The 25%, that's at 550.

918
01:10:41,254 --> 01:10:43,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So that number is just leftovers.

919
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:43,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

920
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Down here, also, in case anybody was curious, I'll scroll back up and we can look at the projects again shortly here.

921
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:58,714
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is how the asks, the requests, are divided up into categories.

922
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:08,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got almost 2 million in requests just for open space and recreation, over a million for historic preservation, and 750 for affordable housing.

923
01:11:09,002 --> 01:11:10,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is our budget.

924
01:11:12,244 --> 01:11:15,205
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our, well, this is our total available funds.

925
01:11:15,265 --> 01:11:17,326
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our budget and how we can disseminate it.

926
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Admin money is pulled separately.

927
01:11:20,287 --> 01:11:26,269
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got almost 3.8 and asks to a 2.1 availability.

928
01:11:26,489 --> 01:11:28,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're gonna break some hearts this year.

929
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:34,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Just before I joined you all had set a sort of minimum target for

930
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:35,812
[SPEAKER_02]: a reserve.

931
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind me what that, was that an amount?

932
01:11:37,933 --> 01:11:41,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, in terms of dollar amount, sorry, you're making percentages.

933
01:11:41,435 --> 01:11:41,775
[SPEAKER_06]: That was $225,000.

934
01:11:41,835 --> 01:11:41,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

935
01:11:41,935 --> 01:11:42,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

936
01:11:42,055 --> 01:11:42,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

937
01:11:42,155 --> 01:11:43,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing to consider here.

938
01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:48,157
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's, am I doing math right?

939
01:11:48,177 --> 01:11:48,898
[SPEAKER_06]: $850,000 of that reserve.

940
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.

941
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:53,139
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be distributed.

942
01:12:11,895 --> 01:12:14,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do I always end up having to do Excel formulas?

943
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:14,816
[SPEAKER_05]: In front of people.

944
01:12:14,836 --> 01:12:17,396
[SPEAKER_05]: In front of people, on a board, in a group.

945
01:12:17,676 --> 01:12:21,518
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, do you sign up for this or something?

946
01:12:21,558 --> 01:12:21,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

947
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:27,159
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, that worked out well.

948
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially, if we wanted to still keep our 225 in reserves, that's technically what we're

949
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:38,282
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at right now is such poor country.

950
01:12:38,362 --> 01:12:40,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting.

951
01:12:40,082 --> 01:12:42,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at it the other way, where there's that $1,099,000.

952
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:44,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to keep $250,000 of that.

953
01:12:44,884 --> 01:12:47,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then there's a surplus there that we could apply to.

954
01:12:48,005 --> 01:12:52,606
[SPEAKER_02]: To Roberta's point, we can fund above the 25% minimum for affordable housing if we wanted to.

955
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:08,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's some really crazy math that could be done to show what is the maximum amount.

956
01:13:08,438 --> 01:13:22,827
[SPEAKER_11]: So imagine that roughly each of the two categories, you could add $500,000 to what's potentially available in PBIC.

957
01:13:22,867 --> 01:13:25,989
[SPEAKER_11]: So it could be $700,000 in each category is what's roughly

958
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:38,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Available if it were distributed evenly.

959
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:49,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we've been talking about, we wanted to go down the line and I can try to answer questions folks may have.

960
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:53,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, why don't I just go quickly through the project?

961
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:53,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

962
01:13:54,001 --> 01:13:55,623
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll give a couple, like.

963
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,162
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only 15 seconds to each one.

964
01:13:59,262 --> 01:14:06,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Just blurt out any immediate reactions that you have to them, and that might be feedback, or we might have no reactions.

965
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:14,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Veterans Affairs, the restoration of the World War II fountain, located at Oak Grove Cemetery?

966
01:14:14,293 --> 01:14:14,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

967
01:14:15,014 --> 01:14:17,495
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go on through the main entrance, it's the one that's on the left.

968
01:14:18,456 --> 01:14:23,560
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a statue of a winged angel.

969
01:14:24,572 --> 01:14:30,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to know myself why this is, like, what is the urgency to restore that fountain?

970
01:14:30,616 --> 01:14:36,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I know when we did the World War I fountain, it looked like it was in danger of toppling over.

971
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:39,941
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't taken care of in the next couple of years.

972
01:14:40,322 --> 01:14:42,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the situation here?

973
01:14:42,343 --> 01:14:52,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are there, because we funded a number of projects at the cemetery that need more money to go forward.

974
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:55,847
[SPEAKER_11]: So is that the highest priority is my big question.

975
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:03,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Next one, Cross Street Cemetery Monument Restoration.

976
01:15:04,408 --> 01:15:05,489
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a continuation.

977
01:15:05,529 --> 01:15:08,049
[SPEAKER_06]: They had come for a small grant to do a pilot.

978
01:15:09,909 --> 01:15:12,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really lovely work that's being done up there.

979
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:16,691
[SPEAKER_06]: But now they're coming back to finish the rest of the cemetery.

980
01:15:19,411 --> 01:15:22,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Shiloh Baptist Church Window Restoration, phase two.

981
01:15:24,452 --> 01:15:28,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, did we miss the Mystic River historic crossings?

982
01:15:28,794 --> 01:15:29,114
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

983
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:30,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, yes, we did.

984
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:36,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Mystic River historic crossings.

985
01:15:36,997 --> 01:15:42,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to explain what historic crossings means, it's all the bridges that cross over the Mystic River.

986
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:50,502
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the armory bridge, which is right behind where the armory is, right at the end of the parking lot at the Conan Show.

987
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,521
[SPEAKER_06]: But that hand foot bridge, which is the pedestrian crossing from over the underneath the credit.

988
01:16:00,981 --> 01:16:04,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Went through a street bridge, which is right near the community gardens.

989
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:07,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Family walks that it's a nightmare.

990
01:16:08,643 --> 01:16:09,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I walk it every Saturday.

991
01:16:09,623 --> 01:16:09,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate it.

992
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:16,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the Auburn Street Bridge, which is up by Whole Foods that crosses over Mystic River.

993
01:16:17,065 --> 01:16:21,686
[SPEAKER_06]: These are technically in a it's not a historic district.

994
01:16:21,766 --> 01:16:22,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a historic

995
01:16:22,848 --> 01:16:24,148
[SPEAKER_06]: region or something like that?

996
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:31,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're on the National Historic Register as a district or something.

997
01:16:31,511 --> 01:16:33,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I forget exactly.

998
01:16:33,532 --> 01:16:42,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And you didn't say the Main Street Bridge because that's a... Yeah, not that, that's not the project.

999
01:16:42,315 --> 01:16:44,736
[SPEAKER_20]: We restored that a couple years ago.

1000
01:16:44,796 --> 01:16:45,936
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's been done.

1001
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:51,078
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been begging them to look at this project for years because the bridges are

1002
01:16:51,522 --> 01:17:05,071
[SPEAKER_11]: rumbling, it looks unsafe, and where the state has made repairs, they are not historically appropriate, and it looks like crap, and people are writing graffiti all over it because it looks like crap.

1003
01:17:05,711 --> 01:17:07,773
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't think they'd be doing that anyway?

1004
01:17:08,797 --> 01:17:11,139
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because they don't appreciate the end.

1005
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:11,459
[SPEAKER_20]: Why?

1006
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:13,321
[SPEAKER_20]: These guys don't own the trade.

1007
01:17:13,441 --> 01:17:14,041
[SPEAKER_20]: Why?

1008
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:15,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Why is the state not doing that?

1009
01:17:15,943 --> 01:17:22,988
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of... So, Myra is trying to push the state to do it by... They're only asking for planning money.

1010
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:23,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1011
01:17:23,448 --> 01:17:30,654
[SPEAKER_11]: So Myra is trying to, let's say, let's do the planning so that the state will feel obligated to fix their stuff.

1012
01:17:31,295 --> 01:17:34,137
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is a good, like, things that jump out at me.

1013
01:17:35,043 --> 01:17:37,885
[SPEAKER_11]: planning for a state-owned asset is risky.

1014
01:17:38,105 --> 01:17:40,966
[SPEAKER_11]: On the other hand, MIRA is very shy.

1015
01:17:41,046 --> 01:17:50,612
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already said no to them once, and it's taken them many years to get brave enough to come back to us, and nobody else is going to do this project.

1016
01:17:50,632 --> 01:18:00,917
[SPEAKER_20]: They were unfortunate to be in the crossfire of one of the few actually controversial grants we've had.

1017
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:03,599
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even think it was at the time, because

1018
01:18:04,348 --> 01:18:20,040
[SPEAKER_20]: They were trying to plan what they're planning now, what's been planned by DCR for the last couple of years, along the entire Manford, 50 acres of land from the Winchester line to Route 60, that whole, you haven't seen the plans of what they're doing, it's phenomenal.

1019
01:18:20,421 --> 01:18:26,785
[SPEAKER_20]: The bike lanes, the walking paths, the historic restoration, some of the resources, it's everything.

1020
01:18:26,986 --> 01:18:28,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Along the Mystic Lakes.

1021
01:18:29,398 --> 01:18:32,339
[SPEAKER_02]: On that point, I'd be curious to understand more about the scope of this.

1022
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:34,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It describes it as a conditions assessment.

1023
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:42,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it go beyond just assessing and put forth proposals and recommendations like a planning project?

1024
01:18:42,463 --> 01:18:49,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it not enough for... It's not construction level, but it's conceptual.

1025
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:57,509
[SPEAKER_11]: So identifying what are the problems, what would be the appropriate solution and what is an estimated price that it would cost for that.

1026
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:04,483
[SPEAKER_11]: We did a similar thing for the Oak Grove Cemetery World War I monument.

1027
01:19:04,903 --> 01:19:10,405
[SPEAKER_11]: They initially came to us just asking to restore the monument, and we said, wait, do you know how?

1028
01:19:11,286 --> 01:19:18,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we suggested, why don't you get a condition assessment and do a plan first, and then come back.

1029
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:20,090
[SPEAKER_11]: And they did that, and it was beautiful.

1030
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,811
[SPEAKER_11]: It turned out really well.

1031
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:23,992
[SPEAKER_07]: It did.

1032
01:19:26,023 --> 01:19:27,744
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's that project.

1033
01:19:28,044 --> 01:19:31,886
[SPEAKER_11]: So then the Shiloh Church window restoration phase.

1034
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:36,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have funded this project for their ADA improvements.

1035
01:19:36,529 --> 01:19:41,872
[SPEAKER_06]: It started as a conditions assessment as well as window restoration project.

1036
01:19:43,372 --> 01:19:46,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they're coming back to the windows, which is great.

1037
01:19:46,834 --> 01:19:52,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious about the notes you have over here, bonsai, NAACP effort.

1038
01:19:54,150 --> 01:20:01,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a church, a large church with a smaller congregation.

1039
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Like most churches, they need funding.

1040
01:20:03,873 --> 01:20:09,894
[SPEAKER_06]: So Bonsai is their child care tenant that will be coming up.

1041
01:20:10,634 --> 01:20:12,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll be operating out of the basement there.

1042
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:18,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But there were just some other ideas about fundraising, being creative about fundraising.

1043
01:20:19,417 --> 01:20:20,917
[SPEAKER_06]: CPA has

1044
01:20:21,788 --> 01:20:23,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Invested quite heavily in this project.

1045
01:20:23,849 --> 01:20:30,710
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know as we're looking at competitive rounds They yeah, I mean just out of context.

1046
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:39,793
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably need a million dollars worth of restoration of windows and they can probably generate a

1047
01:20:41,347 --> 01:20:44,968
[SPEAKER_11]: $100 out of their congregation toward the project.

1048
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:55,289
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a really a community, I think, the community needs to help to keep this building standing and use it as community space.

1049
01:20:55,890 --> 01:21:04,231
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there needs to be a partnership of community fundraising combined with public money.

1050
01:21:04,251 --> 01:21:07,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Because some of the windows would not be CPA eligible.

1051
01:21:07,532 --> 01:21:09,852
[SPEAKER_11]: They have 40 stained glass windows in the building.

1052
01:21:10,883 --> 01:21:15,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And a small handful of them have religious iconography on them.

1053
01:21:16,325 --> 01:21:20,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of them are just geometric shapes.

1054
01:21:20,347 --> 01:21:22,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're beautiful.

1055
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,608
[SPEAKER_11]: They are in rough condition.

1056
01:21:25,149 --> 01:21:28,310
[SPEAKER_11]: And the carpentry around them is in rough condition.

1057
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:34,032
[SPEAKER_11]: So it needs big investment that is bigger than what CPA alone can do.

1058
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're encouraging them to get creative.

1059
01:21:38,947 --> 01:21:41,328
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of beer.

1060
01:21:41,348 --> 01:21:43,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of beer.

1061
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:51,817
[SPEAKER_11]: So we talked already about the Ida Hill loaner garage conversion, open Memorial Grove construction.

1062
01:21:52,978 --> 01:21:57,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Teresa mentioned earlier, they're going to be doing a public engagement event.

1063
01:21:58,383 --> 01:22:04,966
[SPEAKER_11]: in the upcoming months to continue planning or to show people what they're doing?

1064
01:22:05,026 --> 01:22:12,869
[SPEAKER_06]: What is... We have some with the initial award for CPA of the design study, we have a couple of renderings and some treatment options.

1065
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:15,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's essentially between two designs at this point.

1066
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:22,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So the point of the meeting is to get people's feedback on these two designs, seeing if there's any special elements or anything and just

1067
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,301
[SPEAKER_06]: to continue to introduce the project.

1068
01:22:24,381 --> 01:22:28,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say not a lot of folks know that this is a potential project.

1069
01:22:29,304 --> 01:22:34,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is more of the marketing of it, really, the first introduction of it.

1070
01:22:35,207 --> 01:22:49,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I would ask whether we might be able to maybe instead of, I mean, or in addition to an event at that location, leverage all these other events on the calendar to say, what do you guys think of these two designs?

1071
01:22:49,175 --> 01:22:51,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know that we're going to be doing this project?

1072
01:22:51,236 --> 01:22:52,277
[SPEAKER_11]: And then what's your feedback?

1073
01:22:55,220 --> 01:23:01,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to move on quickly so we don't use up too much time because we will talk about these many more times in the future.

1074
01:23:01,866 --> 01:23:03,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Riverside Plaza shade improvements.

1075
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:09,153
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a project that CPA funded last fiscal year.

1076
01:23:09,173 --> 01:23:17,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Lo and behold, when they went out to bid, it came back at $300,000 over what their original estimate is.

1077
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,201
[SPEAKER_20]: I've seen this one before.

1078
01:23:18,261 --> 01:23:18,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1079
01:23:19,616 --> 01:23:25,920
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've done some thoughtful redesign to still incorporate the original intention by, but downscaling it.

1080
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:27,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was a shade structure.

1081
01:23:27,521 --> 01:23:31,463
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to go to Riverside Plaza, which is right here in Medford Square.

1082
01:23:31,483 --> 01:23:34,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Great place to hang, no shade, they need more money.

1083
01:23:36,506 --> 01:23:38,888
[SPEAKER_20]: They changed the design to make it more affordable?

1084
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:39,868
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

1085
01:23:39,909 --> 01:23:40,809
[SPEAKER_20]: To value engineering them?

1086
01:23:41,009 --> 01:23:41,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

1087
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:43,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Barry Park.

1088
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:47,113
[SPEAKER_14]: That depot thing that was there.

1089
01:23:48,688 --> 01:23:50,349
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that?

1090
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:52,750
[SPEAKER_11]: They took away the depot that used to be there.

1091
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:56,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Spent three days, mate.

1092
01:23:57,473 --> 01:23:57,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1093
01:23:58,253 --> 01:23:58,554
Yeah.

1094
01:23:59,174 --> 01:24:07,118
[SPEAKER_11]: So Berry Park Community Garden, and you put in the notes that likely to have neighborhood oppositions.

1095
01:24:07,278 --> 01:24:17,724
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe it's a very small amount of money for a project that will be impactful.

1096
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question about that one.

1097
01:24:19,377 --> 01:24:19,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1098
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:38,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to slow us down, but like the community gardens and the potential dog parks that no one's brought up, but we know people want dog parks at Barrie Park, Morrison Park, and...Tufts.

1099
01:24:39,331 --> 01:24:44,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, um, these are all things people can come to us for money for, but like,

1100
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:52,802
[SPEAKER_08]: are there going to be other bodies that are going to stand in the way of the actual implementation?

1101
01:24:53,442 --> 01:25:04,965
[SPEAKER_11]: It did happen one time in our very first funding round that we made a grant that ended up the project being canceled because of public opposition.

1102
01:25:05,045 --> 01:25:08,366
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was because of a community garden at that site.

1103
01:25:08,506 --> 01:25:10,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, we're several years out.

1104
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:12,287
[SPEAKER_11]: That was Marsden, right?

1105
01:25:12,587 --> 01:25:14,568
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that was Harris.

1106
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:31,128
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I think this is where we need the city's input because we don't want to be the ones who are taking the heat for a decision that the city has made to request money to go forward.

1107
01:25:31,148 --> 01:25:33,110
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not the city though, right?

1108
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:34,531
[SPEAKER_11]: This is... This is the community guard.

1109
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:37,112
[SPEAKER_05]: The community guard commission themselves.

1110
01:25:37,493 --> 01:25:37,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1111
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,155
[SPEAKER_17]: So they came to us.

1112
01:25:40,975 --> 01:25:41,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1113
01:25:42,576 --> 01:25:44,978
[SPEAKER_17]: And they wanted to put it in the middle of the baseball field.

1114
01:25:46,728 --> 01:25:52,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Not really in the middle of the baseball field, but it was on the Boxton Street side of the field.

1115
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:54,134
[SPEAKER_17]: At Derrick Park?

1116
01:25:54,235 --> 01:25:54,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1117
01:25:55,135 --> 01:25:58,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And so subsequently we went down there and we took a look at it.

1118
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:06,205
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was, it would have been an impediment to playing baseball there in the future.

1119
01:26:07,106 --> 01:26:07,727
[SPEAKER_17]: So we took

1120
01:26:08,575 --> 01:26:16,039
[SPEAKER_17]: took a walk around the whole park, and we decided that we would put it on the other side of the tennis court, which would be on the College Ave side.

1121
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:23,543
[SPEAKER_17]: And it would have accommodated the amount of beds that they wanted.

1122
01:26:23,563 --> 01:26:27,305
[SPEAKER_17]: It would have been easier access for the water.

1123
01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:37,730
[SPEAKER_17]: We knew that there was one individual on College Ave who was vehemently opposed, but

1124
01:26:39,883 --> 01:26:48,107
[SPEAKER_17]: we felt that for the greater good of the community, that the community gardens would give us more benefit in that space, because right now it's not being utilized.

1125
01:26:50,088 --> 01:26:53,910
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, if you want to transfer the heat, you can send it back to us.

1126
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:58,212
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, we did our due diligence on it.

1127
01:27:03,555 --> 01:27:05,837
[SPEAKER_17]: we felt that that was the best place to put it.

1128
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:13,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm spending too much time on it, but what avenue does that one vehemently opposed neighbor have to stop it?

1129
01:27:14,324 --> 01:27:16,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Just doesn't work, does it?

1130
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:22,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Organizing their neighbors to come and bring torches and burn down City Hall.

1131
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:27,474
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they burn down City Hall, right, we won't have to fund the bathrooms.

1132
01:27:36,053 --> 01:27:36,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Vote?

1133
01:27:36,993 --> 01:27:37,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Voting closed at 4.30.

1134
01:27:37,974 --> 01:27:39,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be open back up tomorrow at 8.30.

1135
01:27:39,775 --> 01:27:40,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1136
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:41,835
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

1137
01:27:42,075 --> 01:27:43,356
[SPEAKER_06]: 8.30 to 4.30.

1138
01:27:45,137 --> 01:27:45,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So?

1139
01:27:46,577 --> 01:27:48,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure, sir, but it is over with today.

1140
01:27:48,718 --> 01:27:51,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry.

1141
01:27:51,359 --> 01:28:01,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that you guys approved this project, and I feel like we're going to encounter this again with community gardens and dog parks.

1142
01:28:01,544 --> 01:28:04,085
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would be nice to just have a little protocol.

1143
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:11,374
[SPEAKER_08]: go to the parks commission, come back to us, get a stamp of approval from the mayor's office, like bada bing, bada boom.

1144
01:28:11,414 --> 01:28:12,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know what I mean?

1145
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:13,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so we just.

1146
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:34,848
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think one thing like we definitely want to do if we don't already do, because maybe we do already do it, but anything like this, it's adding an amenity to make sure that they come, that their application includes a commendation from the parks commission.

1147
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:35,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1148
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:41,014
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we want that to be approved first before they ask you.

1149
01:28:41,634 --> 01:28:48,179
[SPEAKER_08]: There's currently like a community effort petition to get a dog park at Berry Park, too.

1150
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I found out by canvassing.

1151
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:51,822
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't seen it yet.

1152
01:28:51,922 --> 01:28:53,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know.

1153
01:28:53,743 --> 01:28:55,344
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know what they're doing.

1154
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:56,205
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

1155
01:28:56,285 --> 01:29:02,589
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not getting a dog park, but I don't believe because... They are losing a lot of community support.

1156
01:29:02,689 --> 01:29:03,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's fine.

1157
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:12,742
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, at the end of the day, you know, you can't take existing space and transfer it to something else just because.

1158
01:29:12,762 --> 01:29:15,784
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you're going to have a doggone good reason.

1159
01:29:15,804 --> 01:29:23,166
[SPEAKER_11]: On that note, I want to move on to the next one.

1160
01:29:23,226 --> 01:29:27,508
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to have so many more opportunities to dig deep into each of these projects.

1161
01:29:29,269 --> 01:29:31,970
[SPEAKER_11]: The Tufts Park field lighting improvements.

1162
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:34,679
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a big number.

1163
01:29:35,179 --> 01:29:35,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1164
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And that number might even be low.

1165
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:38,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1166
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's for Mooska lighting.

1167
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:42,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all app controlled.

1168
01:29:42,501 --> 01:29:45,442
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been slowly implementing these as they've been redoing the parks.

1169
01:29:46,242 --> 01:29:49,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Tufts is a giant park with four lighting.

1170
01:29:49,162 --> 01:29:53,423
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no way to phase this, right?

1171
01:29:54,103 --> 01:29:56,484
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1172
01:29:57,184 --> 01:30:01,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, technically, I guess they could put one half in and then the next half, but that's...

1173
01:30:02,176 --> 01:30:02,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Silly.

1174
01:30:03,157 --> 01:30:04,817
[SPEAKER_17]: But they only want $20,000 for that?

1175
01:30:05,057 --> 01:30:05,438
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1176
01:30:05,758 --> 01:30:08,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think you're looking at Berry Park.

1177
01:30:08,339 --> 01:30:08,919
[SPEAKER_17]: The green one.

1178
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:12,101
[SPEAKER_06]: That $700,000 number there.

1179
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And that pricing is from 2022, I think.

1180
01:30:16,103 --> 01:30:19,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm imagining it's probably more than $750,000.

1181
01:30:19,544 --> 01:30:21,125
[SPEAKER_06]: With contingency, it's probably $800,000.

1182
01:30:21,305 --> 01:30:21,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1183
01:30:22,966 --> 01:30:26,328
[SPEAKER_17]: So can I ask a question?

1184
01:30:26,508 --> 01:30:26,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1185
01:30:27,268 --> 01:30:29,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is it coming from the Recreation Department?

1186
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:33,081
[SPEAKER_17]: As opposed to?

1187
01:30:33,441 --> 01:30:34,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

1188
01:30:34,181 --> 01:30:39,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin put up the Condon show lighting before.

1189
01:30:39,843 --> 01:30:39,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1190
01:30:39,943 --> 01:30:42,483
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure.

1191
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:49,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Because he has care custody and control over the Condon.

1192
01:30:49,905 --> 01:30:50,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1193
01:30:50,385 --> 01:30:52,966
[SPEAKER_17]: But he doesn't have care custody and control over Tufts Farm.

1194
01:30:54,606 --> 01:30:55,826
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm wondering why.

1195
01:30:55,846 --> 01:30:57,907
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor did sign off on it.

1196
01:30:57,927 --> 01:30:59,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like an author.

1197
01:30:59,127 --> 01:30:59,487
[SPEAKER_06]: We have

1198
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:01,105
[SPEAKER_06]: when it's a city owned property.

1199
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:05,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but are you saying that it could be a problem in a different department?

1200
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:20,693
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just wondering, you know, why the recreation department is asking for $700,000 for lighting at a park when the recreation department doesn't have control, care custody control of that park.

1201
01:31:22,398 --> 01:31:26,159
[SPEAKER_06]: They do assist with events that are there.

1202
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:30,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are the ones that are primarily the user of the lighting or at least managing it.

1203
01:31:30,521 --> 01:31:32,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying their request is illegal?

1204
01:31:32,921 --> 01:31:33,642
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not saying it's illegal.

1205
01:31:33,662 --> 01:31:37,503
[SPEAKER_17]: A question is who has authority to request money for the park?

1206
01:31:37,703 --> 01:31:38,503
[SPEAKER_17]: And if our procedure

1207
01:31:47,736 --> 01:32:04,405
[SPEAKER_11]: That Teresa just mentioned is that when they first submit the eligibility form, there's a form that they have to submit if it's on city property that the mayor has to sign it and the mayor assigns it to somebody to manage that project.

1208
01:32:04,955 --> 01:32:12,059
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe it was that the mayor assigned it to the recreation department to manage that project.

1209
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:33,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Although they aren't necessarily the Department of Care, Custody and Control, but to Reg's point, we need to make sure that the appropriate departments are looped in because when we have one department okay a project that another department isn't in the loop about,

1210
01:32:33,799 --> 01:32:39,541
[SPEAKER_11]: we end up with conflict, and we want to avoid conflict.

1211
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:49,904
[SPEAKER_11]: So anybody who should be aware of it, we want the full application to show us that they're aware of it.

1212
01:32:49,984 --> 01:33:00,587
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there is another department that has care, custody, and control, they should be mentioned in the application, and the application should mention how they are collaborating with each other.

1213
01:33:03,547 --> 01:33:04,988
[SPEAKER_17]: That answers my question, yes.

1214
01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:06,789
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1215
01:33:06,869 --> 01:33:08,450
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll bring that back to them.

1216
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:16,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Because essentially, I'm looking at it, and I'm saying the recreation department does, they have the pool.

1217
01:33:17,516 --> 01:33:21,039
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, but even the pool is still under the past commission.

1218
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:27,763
[SPEAKER_17]: He might manage the pool, but he doesn't make the rules

1219
01:33:29,132 --> 01:33:31,512
[SPEAKER_17]: or any improvements to the pool.

1220
01:33:31,913 --> 01:33:52,537
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would fall under the category of projects that need to at least come to the Parks Commission, just like the one, you know, the dog park or community gardens or any other, like, lighting, field lighting is an amenity that the Park Commission should review before, as part of our process.

1221
01:33:52,557 --> 01:33:54,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll talk with Kevin.

1222
01:33:56,585 --> 01:33:58,306
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I'll move to the next one.

1223
01:33:59,207 --> 01:34:00,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Carr Park dugout shelters.

1224
01:34:04,091 --> 01:34:11,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce, do you have concerns about whatever they're planning right now not meeting the DPW standards?

1225
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:12,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Just reading your note here.

1226
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:17,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so that note came out of the Hickey Park dugout shelters.

1227
01:34:18,362 --> 01:34:23,927
[SPEAKER_06]: It was proposed to do a cantilever design, and it is installed, and it looks great.

1228
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:36,307
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the engineering behind having a cantilevered rather than two post support system, the DPW has asked us kindly to no longer fund cantilever designs.

1229
01:34:37,307 --> 01:34:40,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is why that note is there.

1230
01:34:40,149 --> 01:34:42,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So we make sure that DPW is on board with that.

1231
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:45,172
[SPEAKER_06]: They want a review before.

1232
01:34:46,032 --> 01:34:51,035
[SPEAKER_11]: This is exactly what we want, is left hand talking to right hand.

1233
01:34:53,575 --> 01:34:57,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I did remind DPW that DPW was the one that proposed that design.

1234
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

1235
01:34:59,182 --> 01:35:01,405
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1236
01:35:01,945 --> 01:35:08,734
[SPEAKER_11]: The shade team pop-up, I can explain this one because I have the feeling that this project is likely to drop out this round.

1237
01:35:09,174 --> 01:35:11,016
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an idea.

1238
01:35:13,078 --> 01:35:31,729
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a group in Cambridge that is working with teens to develop and advocate and fundraise and program and manage the community gathering space at a park that's a shade structure that they've designed.

1239
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:38,073
[SPEAKER_11]: And they'd like to expand this to other communities and get other communities to do similar things.

1240
01:35:38,728 --> 01:35:46,154
[SPEAKER_11]: It is equally a, um, an investment, like the capital investment and an organizational passive.

1241
01:35:46,754 --> 01:36:00,925
[SPEAKER_11]: So CPA is relatively easy to get us to make the capital investment, but the bigger challenge is that organizational piece of getting a group together to take this project on here.

1242
01:36:01,486 --> 01:36:04,708
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know that that's going to come together, this funding round.

1243
01:36:04,828 --> 01:36:06,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, but we can work on it.

1244
01:36:07,898 --> 01:36:13,942
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, find that organizational support potentially for the future and bring them back.

1245
01:36:14,422 --> 01:36:16,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1246
01:36:16,284 --> 01:36:30,473
[SPEAKER_11]: So then I think we talked about the housing program, housing programs, housing families, ABCD assistance programs, and the affordable housing trust funding.

1247
01:36:31,574 --> 01:36:32,795
[SPEAKER_11]: We can pass over those.

1248
01:36:33,736 --> 01:36:35,657
[SPEAKER_11]: The invasives removal program,

1249
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:41,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a meeting with the internal team about this one tomorrow.

1250
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:49,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there is a program or a group called Keep Medford Beautiful that will be taking this on.

1251
01:36:49,543 --> 01:36:54,165
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I've been having some difficult time getting some details out of them as to what the program will look like.

1252
01:36:55,185 --> 01:36:56,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to have answers tomorrow.

1253
01:36:56,465 --> 01:37:00,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd definitely like to know more about it.

1254
01:37:00,787 --> 01:37:02,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mentioned the Hillside group.

1255
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:07,139
[SPEAKER_06]: to the mayor's office, and I'm just not sure.

1256
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:10,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like they didn't connect with you.

1257
01:37:11,941 --> 01:37:12,621
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor's office?

1258
01:37:13,082 --> 01:37:15,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard that.

1259
01:37:15,423 --> 01:37:16,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Alice Hunter.

1260
01:37:16,763 --> 01:37:19,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't, no.

1261
01:37:19,704 --> 01:37:21,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you for bringing it to them.

1262
01:37:21,165 --> 01:37:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make a lot of cases as why this is different from maintenance if we need to do that.

1263
01:37:26,527 --> 01:37:26,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1264
01:37:27,047 --> 01:37:29,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I was about to say is that that case needs to be made as to

1265
01:37:33,995 --> 01:37:36,817
[SPEAKER_11]: why it's not maintenance.

1266
01:37:37,777 --> 01:37:39,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually preservation in a way.

1267
01:37:39,598 --> 01:37:50,485
[SPEAKER_02]: If we allow these invasive plants to displace native plants, we will lose the ecological value and function of our parks and open spaces.

1268
01:37:50,745 --> 01:38:02,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish CPA could pay for community-wide efforts specifically for invasives because

1269
01:38:02,662 --> 01:38:09,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have issues in our parks and everything, but gosh, I hate walking around my neighborhood and just seeing a tree of heaven growing out of a retaining wall.

1270
01:38:09,466 --> 01:38:12,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, well, your retaining wall is going to fail in about two years.

1271
01:38:12,828 --> 01:38:18,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wish that CPA could be used for citywide efforts, but yes.

1272
01:38:19,272 --> 01:38:28,197
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will certainly share with you, because Jeremy reached out as a resident CPC member saying, hey, can we do something with CPA?

1273
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:32,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Chapel Grove Cemetery buildings restoration.

1274
01:38:34,352 --> 01:38:37,954
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a continuation of the project that we've been supporting.

1275
01:38:40,394 --> 01:38:42,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing real quick.

1276
01:38:43,075 --> 01:38:44,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can put a pin in this when I come back.

1277
01:38:45,076 --> 01:38:48,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we only have a couple more here.

1278
01:38:49,998 --> 01:38:58,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, is this a, we've kind of bantered about in the past, potentially CPC or CPA absorbing

1279
01:39:01,067 --> 01:39:03,508
[SPEAKER_06]: the annual cost of getting a bond.

1280
01:39:04,068 --> 01:39:12,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically getting a loan to be able to do a massive project, which is what is needed for Brooks Estate, for Oak Grove Cemetery buildings.

1281
01:39:12,931 --> 01:39:15,451
[SPEAKER_06]: These are not just million dollar, two million dollar projects.

1282
01:39:15,471 --> 01:39:19,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Oak Grove is now probably somewhere between six and eight million.

1283
01:39:19,413 --> 01:39:23,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Brooks Estate, I know you're probably approaching 10 million.

1284
01:39:23,594 --> 01:39:27,255
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're going to Terrace House Access Drive, yeah, it's probably,

1285
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:40,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So there has been conversations in the past about, for the right project, would the CPC be willing to take on an annual debt service?

1286
01:39:40,275 --> 01:39:46,758
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's essentially like we pay the annual fee on that bond, and that would be for a set number of years.

1287
01:39:48,078 --> 01:39:55,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I can certainly look at and punch up numbers, but a ballpark on this would probably be somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000.

1288
01:39:57,452 --> 01:40:00,793
[SPEAKER_06]: or a $6 million bond if we were to absorb those costs.

1289
01:40:01,094 --> 01:40:02,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Two to 300 annually.

1290
01:40:02,454 --> 01:40:02,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Annually.

1291
01:40:03,174 --> 01:40:06,256
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's 10 to 15% of our budget.

1292
01:40:06,276 --> 01:40:08,156
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's spoken for.

1293
01:40:08,997 --> 01:40:10,017
[SPEAKER_06]: 10, 15 years.

1294
01:40:10,097 --> 01:40:10,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1295
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:16,160
[SPEAKER_06]: But is that the right thing to do?

1296
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:19,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to have a more earnest conversation.

1297
01:40:19,181 --> 01:40:25,924
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been bubbled up before in the past, but having that concerted conversation with the mayor, DPW, and our finance director

1298
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:31,923
[SPEAKER_06]: and perhaps invite Roberta as well as our chairperson to have a discussion about what that looks like.

1299
01:40:32,023 --> 01:40:33,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the debt get paid back?

1300
01:40:34,544 --> 01:40:34,784
[SPEAKER_11]: How?

1301
01:40:35,185 --> 01:40:35,385
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1302
01:40:37,606 --> 01:40:41,948
[SPEAKER_11]: By committing some of our CPA funds every year to that.

1303
01:40:42,428 --> 01:40:46,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not just paying the fee to carry the debt, we are paying back the debt?

1304
01:40:47,111 --> 01:40:47,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1305
01:40:51,356 --> 01:40:57,321
[SPEAKER_20]: I think with the Carriage House, if they were part of it, that has an income stream.

1306
01:40:57,461 --> 01:41:00,925
[SPEAKER_20]: That alone had a 20-year payback for the whole loan and interest.

1307
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:04,528
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the estimate we had from a while ago now.

1308
01:41:04,548 --> 01:41:11,794
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure bond rates have changed, etc., but there was a significant income that would make that self-sustaining.

1309
01:41:12,455 --> 01:41:13,316
[SPEAKER_20]: That would not be

1310
01:41:14,582 --> 01:41:16,502
[SPEAKER_20]: this different format.

1311
01:41:16,562 --> 01:41:21,244
[SPEAKER_20]: But I like the creativity of it because it's, for some projects, it's tough.

1312
01:41:21,624 --> 01:41:26,725
[SPEAKER_20]: And the Oak Grove Cemetery expansion is right, literally, surrounding it and built.

1313
01:41:26,945 --> 01:41:36,687
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's also, they're talking about that right now with Tim McGibbon and Seattle Chambers to come up with a plan for that expansion.

1314
01:41:36,707 --> 01:41:38,928
[SPEAKER_20]: That's seven acres that the Oak Grove Cemetery

1315
01:41:40,532 --> 01:41:43,794
[SPEAKER_20]: When it's done, it becomes a cemetery.

1316
01:41:43,814 --> 01:41:45,195
[SPEAKER_08]: What are they expanding into?

1317
01:41:46,135 --> 01:41:52,939
[SPEAKER_20]: The seven acres of the Brooks Estate that were put aside in 1998 as part of the deal that created the Brooks Estate gave them seven acres of expansion.

1318
01:41:52,999 --> 01:41:56,160
[SPEAKER_20]: It's surrounded by the Brooks Estate on three sides.

1319
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:59,882
[SPEAKER_20]: It just hasn't been acted on in 30 years.

1320
01:42:00,263 --> 01:42:07,927
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me wonder about having an inhistorical restoration of

1321
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:18,316
[SPEAKER_08]: like the cemetery buildings or whatever, whether we want to have some sort of requirement around there being an income stream, or are we okay just for storing buildings that essentially have no function?

1322
01:42:18,957 --> 01:42:23,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I will say, as we look at Oak Grove, I hear what you're saying about buildings that have no function.

1323
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to clarify, these are actively used by city staff.

1324
01:42:28,843 --> 01:42:35,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the office and caretaker supporters, as well as the maintenance shed, which is used by DPW staff.

1325
01:42:38,171 --> 01:42:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: but I don't... Are they being optimally used?

1326
01:42:42,152 --> 01:42:47,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're being maximally used as much as they can, but that was a fair point.

1327
01:42:48,814 --> 01:42:52,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Restoration, for example, the Brooks Estate can expand the use of the building.

1328
01:42:53,075 --> 01:43:06,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, it is empty most of the time, but having an access road would make that another public building in our arsenal of public buildings where we could hold public meetings and do other public business.

1329
01:43:07,538 --> 01:43:10,719
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would activate the site.

1330
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:14,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it would activate a building that is currently useless.

1331
01:43:15,321 --> 01:43:19,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it bad that I went to weddings and just generated income?

1332
01:43:20,423 --> 01:43:22,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's the intention, right?

1333
01:43:22,663 --> 01:43:24,204
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be one of the challenges.

1334
01:43:24,264 --> 01:43:30,626
[SPEAKER_20]: If there's a multi-purpose function facility, that wedding won't be the primarily economic part of the plan.

1335
01:43:31,146 --> 01:43:32,427
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe we can talk about that.

1336
01:43:33,225 --> 01:43:35,566
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we have one, two more on our list.

1337
01:43:35,586 --> 01:43:39,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of NBEL, the pathways and parking phase two, which is a big number.

1338
01:43:40,267 --> 01:43:46,008
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, and I think I'm already, we already were looking at this when I talked to Carly.

1339
01:43:46,028 --> 01:43:55,530
[SPEAKER_20]: Carly obviously is down the hall talking about the, of course, the expansion and partnering with those guys because they're trying to play nice.

1340
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:57,691
[SPEAKER_20]: We're neighbors, NBEL's neighbors.

1341
01:43:59,431 --> 01:44:02,172
[SPEAKER_20]: But remember, one of the first grants this,

1342
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:09,872
[SPEAKER_20]: of the funding was the entire design of the access drive, the manor, to Grove Street.

1343
01:44:10,952 --> 01:44:13,772
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we focused on the parking lot, the full parking lot.

1344
01:44:13,812 --> 01:44:18,654
[SPEAKER_20]: That was like a multi-million dollar building project to me.

1345
01:44:18,854 --> 01:44:28,576
[SPEAKER_20]: And this piece is a portion of the parking lot that is just dedicated to the accessible spaces, to the accessible path that's less than half of the parking lot.

1346
01:44:29,491 --> 01:44:32,292
[SPEAKER_20]: to try to get these accessible funds and open space recreation.

1347
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:41,093
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're getting a cost estimate of $700,000 plus for that post-contingency, which is why the MSI.

1348
01:44:41,113 --> 01:44:45,714
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're already talking about taking out the lighting and doing things to cut that number down.

1349
01:44:45,754 --> 01:44:48,755
[SPEAKER_20]: But I don't think we can get it to half.

1350
01:44:48,775 --> 01:44:52,296
[SPEAKER_20]: That sounds like what it might mean for you to make it viable.

1351
01:44:52,336 --> 01:44:56,277
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're just going to see where the priorities are.

1352
01:44:56,657 --> 01:44:57,977
[SPEAKER_20]: We recognize that this committee

1353
01:44:59,478 --> 01:45:01,219
[SPEAKER_20]: has funded a lot of them over the years.

1354
01:45:01,259 --> 01:45:07,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Not the last few years, but historically, almost every year, it's been six figures plus.

1355
01:45:07,522 --> 01:45:12,765
[SPEAKER_20]: We get cost estimates for projects.

1356
01:45:12,805 --> 01:45:13,585
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to review that.

1357
01:45:13,605 --> 01:45:19,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we also typically get copies of the design proposal and contract documents?

1358
01:45:19,908 --> 01:45:21,229
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it's bid ready right now.

1359
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,390
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's not a concept design.

1360
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:24,391
[SPEAKER_20]: It's actually biddable.

1361
01:45:24,671 --> 01:45:26,732
[SPEAKER_20]: We actually tried to bid a piece of it,

1362
01:45:30,353 --> 01:45:37,099
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to use ARPA funds, but the ARPA funds, we thought, would be extended beyond June 30th, and we've been told flat out that they are not.

1363
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,662
[SPEAKER_20]: There are many reasons for that, I think.

1364
01:45:40,882 --> 01:45:41,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious.

1365
01:45:41,443 --> 01:45:43,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the more expensive halves of a parking lot.

1366
01:45:44,165 --> 01:45:44,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1367
01:45:44,766 --> 01:45:47,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen... Yeah, it's a lot of grading.

1368
01:45:48,029 --> 01:45:50,491
[SPEAKER_20]: It's taking out a lot of trees.

1369
01:45:50,531 --> 01:45:51,231
[SPEAKER_20]: It's regrading.

1370
01:45:51,472 --> 01:45:54,734
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a lot of infrastructure.

1371
01:45:55,335 --> 01:45:56,656
[SPEAKER_20]: I can see the plans.

1372
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:57,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious.

1373
01:45:58,473 --> 01:46:03,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and Cemetery Trustees want to know about the Memorial Plaza restoration.

1374
01:46:03,215 --> 01:46:08,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a continuation of the master plan that we, I mentioned earlier, that we funded?

1375
01:46:09,336 --> 01:46:10,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1376
01:46:11,197 --> 01:46:24,541
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a large plaza that has so many elements to it that are beautiful all together, and we're in very troubled condition.

1377
01:46:24,561 --> 01:46:24,881
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yeah.

1378
01:46:28,138 --> 01:46:29,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any problems in my life.

1379
01:46:29,779 --> 01:46:30,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a family picture.

1380
01:46:30,679 --> 01:46:30,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

1381
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:35,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's everything that we have on the table that adds up to more

1382
01:46:50,492 --> 01:46:53,714
[SPEAKER_11]: but almost twice as much as the funding that we have available.

1383
01:46:54,234 --> 01:47:01,018
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we meet next month, what are the dates that we're meeting in October again?

1384
01:47:01,259 --> 01:47:02,319
[SPEAKER_11]: October 14.

1385
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Did we set two dates or one date?

1386
01:47:06,722 --> 01:47:10,864
[SPEAKER_11]: We set one date for October and then one in November, November 18.

1387
01:47:12,185 --> 01:47:15,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy cannot attend the October 14 unless your life has changed.

1388
01:47:16,348 --> 01:47:17,748
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot attend the October 14.

1389
01:47:17,869 --> 01:47:17,909
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1390
01:47:20,665 --> 01:47:21,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can.

1391
01:47:21,445 --> 01:47:25,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why I said I couldn't.

1392
01:47:25,467 --> 01:47:30,549
[SPEAKER_11]: And both of those meetings are going to be dedicated to applicant presentations.

1393
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:40,834
[SPEAKER_11]: So that we'll see if we have all of these applications still on the table at that point.

1394
01:47:43,027 --> 01:47:44,908
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll learn more about the projects.

1395
01:47:44,989 --> 01:47:51,494
[SPEAKER_11]: We will actually get the applications to review so we can ask questions of the applicants.

1396
01:47:51,734 --> 01:48:01,581
[SPEAKER_11]: And then at our December meeting, we'll actually start to try to prioritize and decide how to solve this puzzle.

1397
01:48:02,262 --> 01:48:08,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So during the presentations, there'll be time for Q&A for us to grow them.

1398
01:48:10,342 --> 01:48:18,423
[SPEAKER_06]: The new folks, I don't know if Manisha's still here, but the presentations are usually just PowerPoints.

1399
01:48:18,984 --> 01:48:22,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks come in person, but it's just your standard presentation.

1400
01:48:22,584 --> 01:48:30,826
[SPEAKER_06]: We try to give them like five minutes of them talking and then 10 to 15 minutes or so of questions from us and the public.

1401
01:48:34,066 --> 01:48:35,967
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the second date that you mentioned?

1402
01:48:36,327 --> 01:48:36,827
[SPEAKER_02]: November.

1403
01:48:36,967 --> 01:48:37,467
[SPEAKER_02]: November 18th.

1404
01:48:39,835 --> 01:48:43,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some Monday holidays and Veterans Day lands in there, too.

1405
01:48:43,697 --> 01:48:48,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just kind of messing up the Monday, Tuesday meetings.

1406
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:53,922
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have about eight to nine presentations per night over two weeks.

1407
01:48:53,942 --> 01:48:55,543
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be long nights is what we're doing.

1408
01:48:55,563 --> 01:48:55,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1409
01:48:55,803 --> 01:48:57,164
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be long nights.

1410
01:48:57,184 --> 01:48:59,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will try to be as efficient as we can.

1411
01:48:59,585 --> 01:49:00,986
[SPEAKER_11]: We should bring snacks.

1412
01:49:01,266 --> 01:49:01,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring snacks.

1413
01:49:01,947 --> 01:49:03,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I could bring a speaker timer, too.

1414
01:49:03,427 --> 01:49:04,948
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great.

1415
01:49:05,028 --> 01:49:06,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have one of those.

1416
01:49:06,049 --> 01:49:07,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We should totally do this.

1417
01:49:08,873 --> 01:49:16,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like what the city council is using with those type of digital controls, just to kind of be a visual reminder.

1418
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:17,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1419
01:49:19,321 --> 01:49:21,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's all of our business this evening.

1420
01:49:21,142 --> 01:49:22,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everyone.

1421
01:49:22,423 --> 01:49:26,166
[SPEAKER_09]: We're starting to approve the minutes.

1422
01:49:27,126 --> 01:49:28,767
[SPEAKER_09]: We did that before you got here.

1423
01:49:28,807 --> 01:49:30,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Members to adjourn.

1424
01:49:31,429 --> 01:49:31,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1425
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:33,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me call the roll.

1426
01:49:36,863 --> 01:49:37,644
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll start in the room.

1427
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:38,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy?

1428
01:49:38,064 --> 01:49:38,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1429
