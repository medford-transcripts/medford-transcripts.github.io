00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:35,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so we can start getting some money back.

61
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:36,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

62
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:40,342

66
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any other questions from the council?

67
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:50,521
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, if I may.

68
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:57,147
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's important that we point out the good work that the Medford Mall, the 915 Elks does here in the community.

69
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:00,630
[SPEAKER_26]: When the city hall was being renovated, they donated their parking lot.

70
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,853
[SPEAKER_26]: Every flag day, they have a flag day celebration.

71
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:09,098
[SPEAKER_26]: Every Memorial Day, they help decorate the graves down at the cemetery.

72
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:13,823
[SPEAKER_26]: They do a great job decorating our war memorials here throughout the community as well.

73
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:19,226
[SPEAKER_26]: And the Elks actually gives out more scholarships nationwide than the federal government does, Mr. President.

74
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:24,730
[SPEAKER_26]: They're the largest private organization that issues college scholarships in the United States of America.

75
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:32,034
[SPEAKER_26]: But the Medford Mall and Elks have always been a great partner here in the city of Medford, and I thank them for the work that they do, and I will support this paper wholeheartedly.

76
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:33,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

77
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:40,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Ntuk, they also have a great free-throw shooting contest every year for the youth of our community, so thank you very much for everything you do.

78
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:43,244
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion- Mr. President, before you call- Councilor Marks.

79
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:44,764
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

80
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:50,905
[SPEAKER_25]: If we could just get, what type of food will be sold and what are the hours that the food will be sold?

81
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:57,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there you go.

82
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:00,187
[SPEAKER_05]: So the menu that was sent into

83
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:08,021
[SPEAKER_05]: The order help was burgers, hot dogs, chicken wings, fries, onion rings.

84
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:12,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're even going to have stuffed clams, frozen pizza.

85
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we're starting with.

86
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:16,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to see how it goes.

87
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:22,103
[SPEAKER_05]: In the hours, right now, we're just going to be Thursday to Sunday, like a soft opening, to see who's going to come back.

88
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:27,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's worth staying open, then maybe we can start opening up for those other days.

89
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:29,445
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

90
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:30,385
[SPEAKER_25]: I wish you good luck.

91
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:30,725
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

92
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:31,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

93
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:32,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

94
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:34,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions from the council?

95
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:34,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

96
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:44,419
[SPEAKER_26]: I also think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that this will allow the Elks to begin their function hall business again where they're not allowing entities to come into function halls and do buffets and stuff like that.

97
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:54,986
[SPEAKER_26]: The Elks will have the opportunity to begin renting out their function halls based upon the capacity requirements that have been established by the Board of Health and then offer their own food stuff there instead of having an outside entity come in to do that.

98
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:59,950
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think this is something that will help them with their business and their revenues during these trying times.

99
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:01,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

100
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:01,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Good point, Councilor Night.

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

172
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:54,559
[SPEAKER_04]: During this very difficult time, one of the things we're hearing are the fears and concerns of what's happening with people that are really still being sheltered in their homes and looking at the different

173
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,502
[SPEAKER_04]: how to handle some of these serious issues.

174
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:10,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And the quickly we can push this ordinance forward and establish this committee, I think it would be so beneficial right now for our community especially.

175
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:19,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And making sure that mental health and other concerns that we see with substance abuse are really forefront and we have a group that would do that.

176
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:27,985
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a wonderful group right now with Penny that's leading us, but as you move ordinance forward, it really puts some teeth into it.

177
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:32,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is a great step in the right direction.

178
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:37,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So whichever way we can move this quicker through, I would support it wholeheartedly.

182
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

183
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:47,851
[SPEAKER_25]: Last time we met to discuss this ordinance, there were a number of recommendations made and voted on by this council.

184
00:11:48,472 --> 00:12:02,397
[SPEAKER_25]: Of which I proposed under the representation section that a behavioral health specialist from Lawrence Memorial Hospital and a behavioral health specialist from Tufts University be part of the membership of the commission.

185
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:07,980
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't see that language incorporated, Mr. President, that was voted on by the council.

186
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,920
[SPEAKER_16]: You are correct.

187
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,761
[SPEAKER_16]: That was voted on by the council.

188
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:15,723
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think, I don't know if Councilor Beas had one also.

189
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I address that?

190
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:22,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerk Hertoghese.

191
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:26,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to get the committee report to the solicitor.

192
00:12:27,108 --> 00:12:28,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the issue.

193
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:32,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think, I mean, I know that she was at the meeting, but I don't know that she's been able to incorporate the changes.

194
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make sure she gets a copy of the committee report.

195
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,579
[SPEAKER_25]: So what do we ask to vote on tonight?

196
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:45,221
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of Council, I think this needs to be tabled until we get, thank you for calling this out.

197
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:50,042
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems that this here has a couple of edits that still need to be made.

198
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:56,204
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wondering if maybe the solicitor maybe made some of the corrections off of her notes.

199
00:12:56,464 --> 00:12:58,725
[SPEAKER_25]: I second the motion to table by Councilor Night.

200
00:12:58,765 --> 00:12:59,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Incorporate everything.

201

[SPEAKER_04]: Some communities, we've seen huge traffic issues with people that permit the auto repair that go to a different class, meaning 16 wheelers.

300
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:23,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see them being parked on main roads and

301
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:28,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I wanted to get distinguished.

302
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:35,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So as long as you're telling me it's not, it's just a regular car repair business, I'd support that.

303
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:46,597
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it does, if it is for 16 wheelers and bigger, I think that I'd have a question with some safety issues and traffic issues, so thank you.

304
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:47,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

307
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:58,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, this is a small garage that was operated by Bob Libby for probably the last 30, 40 years that I can remember.

308
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:05,231
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I think it's just about, it's a small garage, I think one day, that's really about it.

309
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:10,535
[SPEAKER_19]: So just a small auto repair that he's purchasing from Bob Libby.

310
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:13,398
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think he's doing anything different than Bob Libby was doing.

[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, this is just such a small amount.

439
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:32,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if this helps, but number nine says the work located at the Locust Street intersection and the Spring Street intersection appears to disturb the traffic detection loops.

440
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:43,270
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, so I'm just trying to figure out, so does this construction start after 93 on Riverside Ave and go all the way up to Locust Street?

441
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,330
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that roughly the area?

442
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:44,390
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

443
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:47,132
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me see here.

444
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,733
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me go back to this other drawing.

445
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:54,656
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, it might be in the description here.

446
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:55,917
[SPEAKER_24]: Scope of work.

447
00:30:58,218 --> 00:31:00,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Riverside Lake Guard Drive to Hall Street.

448
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,281
[SPEAKER_24]: Relay 490 feet of six-inch cast

449
00:31:05,386 --> 00:31:09,270
[SPEAKER_24]: low-pressure main with 1,508 inch plastic, low-pressure gas main.

450
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:19,480
[SPEAKER_24]: Additionally, relay of 35 feet of six pound bare steel with 70 feet of six inch plastic, 25 pounds per square inch gas, gas main.

451
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:26,567
[SPEAKER_24]: Seven main connections and approximately 39 services are included based on available records and mapping to be field confirmed.

452
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:41,909
[SPEAKER_25]: So the number of feet that's being installed of eight-inch plastic gas main and six-inch plastic gas main is about 1,700 feet.

453
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:49,610
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm just trying to figure out how much of Riverside Ave that would cover.

454
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:58,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, in the construction notes, it says Lake Guard Drive to Hall Street.

455
00:31:58,472 --> 00:31:59,632
[SPEAKER_24]: Would that include?

456
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,202
[SPEAKER_24]: The street you had questioned earlier?

457
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:06,723
[SPEAKER_25]: Lake Drive starts right across from Spring, right?

458
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:09,884
[SPEAKER_25]: Hall Street is from Spring to Hall.

459
00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:12,944
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not that big of an area.

460
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:14,525
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not that big of an area.

461
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's 500 yards.

462
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:16,545
[SPEAKER_25]: You think that's 500 yards?

463
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:17,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, three feet divided to 1,700.

464
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:29,810
[SPEAKER_16]: 1,570 feet.

465
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,811
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a quarter mile.

466
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:39,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let me get past that then.

467
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,362
[SPEAKER_25]: When is the anticipated start date and what's the duration?

468
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,255
[SPEAKER_24]: The anticipated start date is soon.

469
00:32:52,315 --> 00:33:00,199
[SPEAKER_24]: We have the traffic management plan due back to our office the first week in November, and the PE stamp drawing that the city engineer requested.

470
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:05,241
[SPEAKER_24]: So I expect that next week or the following week, we will be able to apply for a permit.

471
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:09,863
[SPEAKER_24]: And MWRA is very anxious to get started on this.

472
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:11,844
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a rather large project.

473
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:17,147
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have people on hold waiting to go.

474
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,568
[SPEAKER_24]: So pretty soon, I would say.

475
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,741
[SPEAKER_25]: So what are we looking at, the middle of November?

476
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:23,422
[SPEAKER_24]: I would guess, yeah.

477
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,583
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be my best guess.

478
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,744
[SPEAKER_25]: And what's the project duration?

479
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:29,506
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't actually know that.

480
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:34,310
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me see if I can text somebody and find out.

481
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,671
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you work for National Grid?

482
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:37,552
[SPEAKER_24]: I do, but I don't.

483
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,514
[SPEAKER_25]: This is not a Zoom bomb, is it?

484
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:41,955
No.

485
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:44,477
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't know they had them yet.

486
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,859
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, we have Zoom bombs all the time.

487
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,560
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, funny.

488
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:57,076
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, yeah, let me just see if someone can get me that information.

489
00:33:57,316 --> 00:34:08,340
[SPEAKER_25]: The reason why I ask is I've had calls from concerned neighbors because if they're going to do any type of shut off of gas, especially over the winter months, they're concerned about heating in their homes and so forth.

490
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:14,283
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's a lot of associated questions on when this work will take place and how long will it last for.

491
00:34:15,343 --> 00:34:18,386
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll see if I can get an answer on that.

492
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:23,610
[SPEAKER_24]: But typically what they do is they will install the new main and then not have it energized yet.

493
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:33,057
[SPEAKER_24]: Then they go door-to-door and they let people know that this is the anticipated date that we're energizing the new main and then bringing you offline and onto that.

494
00:34:33,117 --> 00:34:34,878
[SPEAKER_24]: There'll be a slight service interruption and then

495
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:41,624
[SPEAKER_24]: They go door to door that same day and relate everyone, make sure everybody's up and running before they leave.

496
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:45,408
[SPEAKER_25]: So when you say slight interruption, roughly how long does that changeover take?

497
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:53,175
[SPEAKER_24]: It can take, depending on how they sequence it, it can take a couple of hours, but it's definitely the same day.

498
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:53,275
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

499
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,671
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's my concern.

500
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:09,441
[SPEAKER_25]: If this work is going on, just say, in December and January, and when it's 10 below, to have your heat off for five, six hours could be a problem.

501
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:17,909
[SPEAKER_24]: So the engineer on the job said that he anticipates that it would take about six weeks to complete the work.

502
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:22,273
[SPEAKER_25]: So that brings us into probably January.

503
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:27,272
[SPEAKER_25]: November 15 is towards the end of December, beginning of January.

504
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:43,764
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'd be real curious to know how long these changeovers take, and if there's anything we can do to get a quicker changeover on behalf of the residents that are going to be impacted.

505
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:47,247
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that's definitely something that's doable.

506
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,689
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a scheduling thing.

507
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:57,141
[SPEAKER_24]: But in the winter, they definitely pay much more attention to this type of thing.

508
00:35:57,441 --> 00:36:00,223
[SPEAKER_24]: They do an outreach program in the beginning because some people are away.

509
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:10,911
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't want to have the tie-over happen and the person isn't home, so we can't turn the meter back on if no one's inside to let us get in to make sure everything's up, the pilots are lit, things like that.

510
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:12,912
[SPEAKER_24]: So they do an outreach program in the beginning.

511
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:19,596
[SPEAKER_24]: They mail notices to everybody with all the job-specific information and a hotline number.

512
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:21,837
[SPEAKER_24]: And then they go door-to-door.

513
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:30,783
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the other thing, the supervisor's out there every day, available for sequencing and scheduling questions, because sometimes it's dependent on the weather a little bit.

514
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:35,886
[SPEAKER_24]: But they do take better care of this type of thing in the winter, because it's more critical.

515
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:37,967
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

516
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:41,429
[SPEAKER_25]: So why was this project held off until the winter months?

517
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:44,627
[SPEAKER_24]: This was the request to MWRA.

518
00:36:44,687 --> 00:36:49,533
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess it took us that long to design it, or I don't know.

519
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:52,376
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know when the request came in, but I can ask that, too.

520
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:59,905
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, because to me, this would seem like the most inconvenient time to do a gas changeover in the winter months.

521
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:10,724
[SPEAKER_25]: And I realize the MWRE is requesting it, but that seems like a real selfish request to do it in the cold winter months of New England.

522
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:12,745
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't make any sense to me.

523
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:23,415
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so my next point is, and this may be a question for, is our city engineer on the call, Mr. President, do you know?

524
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:31,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clark, do you know if the city engineer is on the call?

525
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:37,907
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not see him on the call.

526
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:45,336
[SPEAKER_25]: Projects of this nature, I would just request in the future that the city engineer be part of the call as well.

527
00:37:46,382 --> 00:37:51,325
[SPEAKER_25]: especially with these conditions, there's 14 conditions that were put on by our engineering division.

528
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:58,729
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would ask that someone, a representative from the city, be present on behalf of the residents of this community.

529
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:05,152
[SPEAKER_25]: The question I had, Mr. President, and this has been an issue that's been near and dear to me for a lot of years.

530
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:08,934
[SPEAKER_25]: Many of us travel down Riverside Ave constantly.

531
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,355
[SPEAKER_25]: I happen to live right off of Riverside Ave.

532
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:14,617
[SPEAKER_25]: And many of the curbs

533
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:17,578
[SPEAKER_25]: a level with the street.

534
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:23,060
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's no distinction between a sidewalk and the street.

535
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:24,661
[SPEAKER_25]: They've become level.

536
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:29,182
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's a very dangerous proposition for area residents.

537
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:37,986
[SPEAKER_25]: We just had a house struck at the corner of Locust and Riverside, where a car plowed in to his walkway and his stairs.

538
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:39,026
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank God no one was there.

539
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:41,827
[SPEAKER_25]: And it demolished brick and cement stairs.

540
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:53,801
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was largely in part, Mr. President, bad driving, one thing, but the fact that there's no distinction between a sidewalk, there's no curbing, and it's a very dangerous situation.

541
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:57,206
[SPEAKER_25]: Under number 12, under the conditions,

542
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:05,571
[SPEAKER_25]: It says the scope of the MWRA section 57 project includes resurfacing and striping this portion of Riverside Ave.

543
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:11,995
[SPEAKER_25]: So they're saying the MWRA is responsible for the resurfacing and restriping.

544
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:13,836
[SPEAKER_25]: That's great, Mr. President.

545
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:18,098
[SPEAKER_25]: But what about the curbs that are level with the street?

546
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:23,942
[SPEAKER_25]: In my opinion, if we're going to look at resurfacing this road,

547
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:26,073
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to do it correct.

548
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:32,156
[SPEAKER_25]: If they're going to grind it up or whatever they're going to do, we have to make these curbs full curbing.

549
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:34,757
[SPEAKER_25]: And now's the time to do it.

550
00:39:34,817 --> 00:39:36,537
[SPEAKER_25]: And it would cover a large stretch.

551
00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:46,641
[SPEAKER_25]: This particular recommendation says the engineering division requests that National Grid contribute the cost of the final restoration to other paving in the city.

552
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:50,803
[SPEAKER_25]: So they're saying, we realize MWRE is going to do the paving.

553
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:53,464
[SPEAKER_25]: We're doing the job, but they're going to pay for the paving.

554
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:59,652
[SPEAKER_25]: And instead of us being responsible for something, we'll do some work somewhere else.

555
00:40:00,452 --> 00:40:07,395
[SPEAKER_25]: I would submit to you, Mr. President, the work should be on Riverside Ave, and it should be leveling off the curbs on Riverside Ave.

556
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:09,456
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't agree with this condition 12.

557
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:12,937
[SPEAKER_25]: This money should be spent on Riverside Ave.

558
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:19,700
[SPEAKER_25]: It should bring those curbs up to the current standards, the safety guidelines and highway standards of DOT.

559
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:26,968
[SPEAKER_25]: which I can guarantee you level curbs with streets are not the safety standard of DOT.

560
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:34,270
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would ask, Mr. President, I'm going to ask that we don't approve this tonight, even though this is going to prolong this a little bit.

561
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:45,732
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's why I was hoping our city engineer would be on until we can get a commitment that the curbing on Riverside Ave will be part of the condition from National Grid.

562
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:54,304
[SPEAKER_25]: to recreate the elevation on the curbing when they do the street resurfacing over for that particular stretch.

563
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:58,246
[SPEAKER_25]: So that would be my first recommendation, Mr. President.

564
00:40:58,946 --> 00:41:13,473
[SPEAKER_25]: My second recommendation is that at the corner, and I'm not sure this would be a question for National Grid, it would be a question for our engineer, but at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street, as we know, there was a fire many years ago.

565
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:21,228
[SPEAKER_25]: in the DPW public works building that held most of the plans of our engineering.

566
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:23,369
[SPEAKER_25]: And many of the plans were lost.

567
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:36,394
[SPEAKER_25]: And from what I'm being told, the plans and the drawings for the underground utilities at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street are no longer around.

568
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:39,475
[SPEAKER_25]: So you can't find these plans because they were burnt in the fire.

569
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:51,889
[SPEAKER_25]: And now would be a perfect time if they're going to be digging up that area, which they are, would be a perfect time to recreate these drawings and digitize the underground utilities in that area.

570
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:58,188
[SPEAKER_25]: That would save us a heartache, Mr. President, and also get the work done on behalf.

571
00:41:58,228 --> 00:42:10,060
[SPEAKER_25]: And I raise this question because when they were working on Wegmans and the project on Locust Street, there were many questions raised about underground utilities, and the city of Medford could not produce these plants.

572
00:42:10,621 --> 00:42:16,066
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would ask that as a second recommendation, that at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street,

573
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:32,437
[SPEAKER_25]: that during this project that the city recreate the drawings and digitize underground utilities at that particular location in the interest of our public safety and our community.

574
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:35,739
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would ask that that be part of a condition on this report.

575
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:44,505
[SPEAKER_25]: My third and final condition, Mr. President, is that that particular set of lights, as we all know, that's a busy, busy intersection.

576
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:52,167
[SPEAKER_25]: Especially now we're adding 400 and I believe it's 50 units in that area of new housing.

577
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:55,688
[SPEAKER_25]: And we have the Wegmans, which is very busy.

578
00:42:56,528 --> 00:43:06,510
[SPEAKER_25]: And the Opticom system, which you know is the little gadget that they put on the lights when ambulances and fire trucks go through intersections.

579
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:14,632
[SPEAKER_25]: It has a connection to our public safety vehicles and it allows these vehicles to go through in a quick manner and in a safe manner.

580
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:22,756
[SPEAKER_25]: And that particular intersection, we can ask head of Y's, I don't believe has the OptiComm system in place.

581
00:43:23,316 --> 00:43:29,360
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would ask that it be installed as a recommendation or a condition.

582
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,101
[SPEAKER_25]: under this particular digging, Mr. President.

583
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:39,565
[SPEAKER_25]: If we're going to dig the street, that requires wiring under the roads and so forth, and that be done during this particular project.

584
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:53,232
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would ask that that be outlined as a condition also that the Opticomp system at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street be done during this project.

585
00:43:54,147 --> 00:43:56,489
[SPEAKER_25]: So those are my three conditions, Mr. President.

586
00:43:56,909 --> 00:44:16,385
[SPEAKER_25]: I would respectfully ask that we lay this on the table for one week, Mr. President, to get answers back from our engineering department, our head of wires, and also a national grid on the curbs and other two conditions that I put on this, Mr. President.

587
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:22,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks, if I may, first and foremost, they're trying to get in touch with the engineer right now.

588
00:44:23,587 --> 00:44:26,729
[SPEAKER_16]: So a call has been made to him, or at least they're trying to contact him.

589
00:44:27,509 --> 00:44:31,771
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing I wanted to check was with our city clerk.

590
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:35,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have all of Councilor Marks' recommendations?

591
00:44:36,713 --> 00:44:37,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working on them.

592
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:43,276
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one was not to approve until there was a commitment from National Grid regarding the curbing of Riverside Avenue.

593
00:44:45,357 --> 00:44:46,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Second one I have is

594
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:56,526
[SPEAKER_09]: regarding Riverside and Locust, that the city recreate the drawings and digitize the underground utilities in the area.

595
00:44:56,546 --> 00:45:03,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And the third recommendation I have is to install the OptiComm system at the intersection of Riverside and Locust.

596
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:06,072
[SPEAKER_25]: Very accurate.

597
00:45:06,092 --> 00:45:06,392
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

598
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:08,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

599
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:13,594
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Councilor Marks, if I'm correct, you haven't officially, a number of Councilors have questions.

600
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:16,094
[SPEAKER_16]: You haven't officially asked to table this.

601
00:45:16,154 --> 00:45:17,335
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I don't want to table right now.

602
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:23,416
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to hear from my colleagues, but I am going to ultimately ask that this be tabled if we can't get answers tonight.

603
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:28,257
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a very important road, length of road in our community.

604
00:45:28,397 --> 00:45:29,777
[SPEAKER_16]: I would agree with you a hundred percent.

605
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:31,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we have a number of questions.

606
00:45:31,397 --> 00:45:35,478
[SPEAKER_16]: We have Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Beard, Vice President Caviello, Councilor Scarpelli.

607
00:45:35,538 --> 00:45:36,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

608
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:42,766
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest with you, Councilman Mox hit so many of those questions I had right in the head.

609
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:53,032
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that if you're looking at this area, you're looking at a certain time where, like you said, you're adding, we'll be adding 400 units.

610
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,554
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be in the middle of Christmas rush.

611
00:45:57,334 --> 00:46:08,323
[SPEAKER_04]: where you have a busy shopping center and hopefully the beginning of school where the parents would be traversing through that area with the school buses.

612
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:16,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it does concern me with the time of year and when we're going to be doing this.

613
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:25,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But the question that I have is, as we're moving forward, what does the National Grid team have in place to inform the neighbors of any

614
00:46:26,677 --> 00:46:29,780
[SPEAKER_04]: inconveniences to their day-to-day activities.

615
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:35,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that a lot of those homes don't have, obviously there's no parking on the street.

616
00:46:36,185 --> 00:46:38,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of these homes park in their driveway.

617
00:46:39,587 --> 00:46:41,028
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we have set up and planned?

618
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:53,502
[SPEAKER_04]: There's any inconvenience for senior citizens that need to park in their driveway and have notice that they cannot traverse their own homes.

619
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:57,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have anything in place with them or notification system in place with them?

620
00:46:59,408 --> 00:46:59,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

621
00:46:59,568 --> 00:46:59,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuddy?

622
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:10,626
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, so typically with a main replacement like this, what happens is we run an abutter list and we send out letters to all the abutters.

623
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:15,448
[SPEAKER_24]: It includes some COVID facts and updates on how we proceed now due to COVID.

624
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:21,051
[SPEAKER_24]: It includes sequencing of how it will happen and what to expect.

625
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:25,413
[SPEAKER_24]: And also there's a hotline to call in if anyone has any questions that we monitor.

626
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:30,035
[SPEAKER_24]: So they get the abutter notification approximately a month

627
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:44,636
[SPEAKER_24]: before the job starts and then They do get updates on to get the supervisor going door-to-door Sometimes it will also get like little long those little hangers on the door with some pertinent information and scheduling and stuff like that.

628
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,939
[SPEAKER_24]: So Yeah, the supervisor is out there every day.

629
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:47,979
[SPEAKER_24]: I

630
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I can appreciate that, but that's not enough.

631
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:51,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

632
00:47:51,982 --> 00:47:53,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuddy, I appreciate that.

633
00:47:53,503 --> 00:48:02,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that really communication is the number one most important factor of this job being so large and how it impacts those neighbors.

634
00:48:02,328 --> 00:48:18,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that we've had, with other jobs of this magnitude, we've had, I know Eversource has a direct line that they can actually call the project manager.

635
00:48:20,486 --> 00:48:30,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And when certain areas are going to be closed, they're notified either by robocall or by door knock.

636
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's important that we do that for

637
00:48:35,251 --> 00:48:43,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes if the notification is going to the person that owns the home but not the person living in that home, I think it might pose an issue.

638
00:48:43,198 --> 00:48:58,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So my recommendation for the city clerk, if we can make amendments to this, that we have a direct point person that our residents can talk to on a daily basis.

639
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:02,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate a hotline, but I've dealt with some other hotlines and

640
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:10,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't trust it to get back in a timely fashion when you're talking about this type of scope of work.

641
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:21,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So I look to amend this and ask the construction company and National Grid to have a dedicated person for these neighbors.

642
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:21,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you.

643
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:23,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

644
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:37,625
[SPEAKER_24]: We do have a dedicated supervisor for this particular job, and we do call the residents the night before and The other thing you said

645
00:49:41,313 --> 00:49:42,974
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we do send it to the abutters.

646
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:45,555
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't send it to the property owners only, exclusively.

647
00:49:45,595 --> 00:49:46,995
[SPEAKER_24]: We have two sets of databases.

648
00:49:47,935 --> 00:49:51,777
[SPEAKER_24]: One for this particular meeting, we send it to the property owners, the abutters that are property owners.

649
00:49:51,837 --> 00:49:57,759
[SPEAKER_24]: But the other one with regards to the main replacements, we send it to the tenants.

650
00:49:57,999 --> 00:49:59,780
[SPEAKER_24]: If they're owner-occupied, then it goes to the same person.

651
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:05,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Because those are the people who need to know about conflict with traffic or parking and things like that.

652
00:50:06,794 --> 00:50:08,735
[SPEAKER_24]: So we do send it to that group.

653
00:50:09,575 --> 00:50:11,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, with the scope of work, Ms.

654
00:50:11,256 --> 00:50:17,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuddy, I think that what we feel comfortable and what we've done in the past is really having a dedicated person that's on the job.

655
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:19,480
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned a hotline.

656
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,702
[SPEAKER_04]: The hotline, I appreciate the person on the street that's going to be there, that's in charge of the job.

657
00:50:24,742 --> 00:50:28,304
[SPEAKER_04]: But other companies, for example, Eversource,

658
00:50:31,817 --> 00:50:47,488
[SPEAKER_04]: project managers that are on site that people could reach while something was going on in a minute's notice for the fact that for some issues where it is senior citizens and they have doctor's appointments or they have to make an emergency exits.

659
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:50,511
[SPEAKER_04]: There isn't any way to park there that they can move their cars.

660
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:57,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And say that they'll just park there to prepare themselves, the only place for people to park are the driveways.

661
00:50:57,435 --> 00:51:02,838
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the driveways are affected and they're not known, they don't know what to do, I think a hotline is great.

662
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:07,500
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't, I would approve anything when it's a small scope.

663
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:16,465
[SPEAKER_04]: But this being so large and so encompassing that we have, in other instances, had a direct line.

664
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:19,707
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the day during that job.

665
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:23,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to stick with that amendment, Mr. President.

666
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:24,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.

667
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:26,009
[SPEAKER_24]: We can do that.

668
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:26,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

669
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:27,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

670
00:51:29,971 --> 00:51:31,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk Hertoghis, do you have the information?

671
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:34,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

672
00:51:34,453 --> 00:51:34,993
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

673
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:41,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli's amendment is that the national group provide a point person on the projects for residents to contact on a daily basis.

674
00:51:42,096 --> 00:51:42,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

675
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:43,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

676
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:44,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

677
00:51:46,158 --> 00:51:46,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers.

678
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:47,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

679
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:55,146
[SPEAKER_00]: My first question for National Grid, is this project going to remove the existing infrastructure from underground?

680
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,690
[SPEAKER_24]: It's replacing the existing structure.

681
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:01,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so the old stuff's coming out.

682
00:52:02,913 --> 00:52:08,518
[SPEAKER_24]: Most likely because WRA needs to get to their infrastructure, which is below ours.

683
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:09,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thanks.

684
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:12,201
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we don't have the city engineer, do we?

685
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:20,140
[SPEAKER_16]: And do not think...Clerk Hernandez, has the city engineer been contacted yet, or has he called in, do you know?

686
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Mr. Rodriguez has contacted him.

687
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:23,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the response is.

688
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:29,706
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, I just have two questions we could send to the city engineer, if possible.

689
00:52:31,808 --> 00:52:40,173
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the scope of the MWRA work, and are they going to require a grant of location, and why are only Riverside Avenue

690
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:45,110
[SPEAKER_00]: and Linden Street designated for resurfacing?

691
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:47,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my two questions for the city engineer.

692
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:51,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

693
00:52:51,514 --> 00:52:52,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

694
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:53,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Carvio.

695
00:52:54,235 --> 00:52:55,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

696
00:52:55,656 --> 00:52:57,397
[SPEAKER_19]: To Councilor Behrs, last question.

697
00:52:57,737 --> 00:53:02,579
[SPEAKER_19]: Linden Street was resurfaced about a year ago.

698
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:09,503
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's part of my question is, is any of this going to be going into Locust Street?

699
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,460
[SPEAKER_11]: She's looking into it.

700
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,060
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

701
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:31,243
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't see.

702
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:33,364
[SPEAKER_19]: There's Italian.

703
00:53:33,784 --> 00:53:42,907
[SPEAKER_24]: It looks like there is approximately, I would say, 80?

704
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:44,868
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

705
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,569
[SPEAKER_24]: Probably 40 feet going into Locust Street.

706
00:53:50,162 --> 00:53:54,564
[SPEAKER_19]: Which brings me to my next question, which Councilor Marks brought up.

707
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:58,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are we doing this project now, or why didn't we do it before?

708
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:04,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we've just gone through paving Loca Street, like two weeks ago.

709
00:54:04,428 --> 00:54:07,909
[SPEAKER_19]: So now the brand new paved street is gonna get dug up.

710
00:54:08,529 --> 00:54:10,030
[SPEAKER_19]: Linden Street was just recently paved.

711
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,210
[SPEAKER_19]: That's gonna get dug up.

712
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,132
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other thing is, we're doing this in the middle of the winter.

713
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:17,072
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, not in the middle of the winter, but the side of the winter.

714
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:25,262
[SPEAKER_19]: When people depend on the heat, three or four hours might be a long time if you've got kids at home.

715
00:54:25,282 --> 00:54:35,316
[SPEAKER_19]: Not that I want to be the bearer of bad news, but three weeks ago, National Grid did a project on Winford Way and they forgot to put the gas on.

716
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:49,733
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a call at like 7.30 at night and trying to find someone to get down there at 9 o'clock at night to put the gas on for every resident was a monumental task.

717
00:54:49,793 --> 00:54:53,074
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of them didn't get the gas on the whole night.

718
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:56,496
[SPEAKER_19]: So that has my concern also.

719
00:54:58,526 --> 00:55:09,054
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing this in the cold weather, you're going to be digging up the streets, and the patch you're going to put down is going to be of substance to the project, because all the plants get closed in the winter.

720
00:55:09,715 --> 00:55:18,241
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is going to be a temporary patch, it's going to snow, and before the end of the winter, it's going to be all dug up again.

721
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:24,683
[SPEAKER_19]: That's really what I'm concerned about, why this has to get done now in the winter.

722
00:55:25,883 --> 00:55:33,505
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, you're doing it in the holiday season, so now you're going to block Walker Street, where there's a shopping center, and the Felsbury Plaza.

723
00:55:33,545 --> 00:55:35,365
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, these stores are hurting enough.

724
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:41,907
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is their little bit of time to get some business back is November,

725
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:46,228
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're shutting one of their main streets down.

726
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:51,169
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've got concerns about the timing of this project also, Mr. President.

727
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:53,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Scott Kelly.

728
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,730
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

729
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:03,191
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's important to point out that National Grid did submit this application in August.

730
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,012
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're just getting it now.

731
00:56:07,135 --> 00:56:16,300
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there a plan to maintain any construction material or equipment along the public way during this project?

732
00:56:19,702 --> 00:56:23,644
[SPEAKER_24]: Usually there's a protocol for securing and maintaining that.

733
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:25,645
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it's awful.

734
00:56:28,827 --> 00:56:44,578
[SPEAKER_26]: We just had a project on High Street in Woburn where every weekend there were 50 or 60 cardboard boxes filled with yellow pipes sitting on the traffic island that one of the neighbors spends a lot of time maintaining.

735
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:57,867
[SPEAKER_26]: There was a bulldozer in front of a historic home in a historic district on the corner of Route 60 and Woburn Street, which is a difficult intersection, number one, and also a highly traveled thoroughfare.

736
00:56:59,027 --> 00:57:14,855
[SPEAKER_26]: In the past, I've asked the city engineer if, in fact, materials or equipment were going to be stored in a public way that a community mitigation agreement be entered into with the provider in the city.

737
00:57:15,716 --> 00:57:24,060
[SPEAKER_26]: So if you're parking a bulldozer in front of my house for six weeks, and I need a new sidewalk panel in my house, and you're doing asphalt work, why don't you replace that sidewalk panel in front of my house too?

738
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,501
[SPEAKER_26]: Mitigation issues.

739
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:26,841
[SPEAKER_26]: And as I look through this,

740
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:29,539
[SPEAKER_26]: grant a location application.

741
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,029
[SPEAKER_26]: conditions that are surrounding it.

742
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:42,557
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of these, I think, are more focused on infrastructure stuff and less focused with community mitigation and community impacts that affect the neighborhood and quality of life.

743
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:48,941
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'd ask that no equipment or materials be stored on the public way.

744
00:57:49,682 --> 00:57:58,808
[SPEAKER_26]: There's plenty of industrial zoned land down between Hall and Linden in that area that's privately owned that I believe that the

745
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:05,589
[SPEAKER_26]: public utility can secure to use as a layover or a layoff land.

746
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:12,431
[SPEAKER_26]: But I don't think we need to be using our public ways and our public roads for storage area, for materials and equipment, for projects.

747
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:16,392
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've said this consistently for a number of years.

748
00:58:17,053 --> 00:58:19,053
[SPEAKER_26]: So that would be the request that I make, Mr. President.

749
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:22,014
[SPEAKER_26]: I certainly have no problem supporting Councilor Mark's resolution.

750
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:24,195
[SPEAKER_26]: If he has questions that need to be answered, then so be it.

751
00:58:25,055 --> 00:58:27,136
[SPEAKER_26]: So with that being said, I would second his motion.

752
00:58:27,854 --> 00:58:28,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

753
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:33,158
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I may, I just want to let you know, uh, the city engineer has just joined us.

754
00:58:33,979 --> 00:58:36,400
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, come on down.

755
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,221
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like the price is right.

756
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:39,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, so let's see.

757
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:44,547
[SPEAKER_16]: First and foremost, uh, Clark, Carterbies, do you have a council nights recommendations?

758
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:47,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

759
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:54,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, no equipment or materials be stored in the public way during this project.

760
00:58:54,234 --> 00:58:55,555
[SPEAKER_26]: Absent a community mitigation agreement.

761
00:58:56,276 --> 00:58:56,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

762
00:58:56,436 --> 00:58:56,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang on.

763
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,856
[SPEAKER_24]: And that can be part of the permit too.

764
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:07,980
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, not everything needs to be ironed out for the whole job.

765
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,903
[SPEAKER_24]: Part of the permit conditions can be those types of things, sweeping the street, stockpiling materials.

766
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:18,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

767
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:20,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk, are we all set?

768
00:59:20,605 --> 00:59:20,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

769
00:59:21,185 --> 00:59:21,505
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

770
00:59:21,745 --> 00:59:26,387
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point, I recognize Consular Marks.

771
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:29,167
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe you had questions for our city engineer.

772
00:59:29,868 --> 00:59:30,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

773
00:59:30,468 --> 00:59:30,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

774
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:34,149
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to unmute Tim McGivern.

775
00:59:35,649 --> 00:59:35,789
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

776
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:36,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Tim.

777
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:37,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Consular Marks.

778
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:52,833
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Engineer, my question is, I actually had three questions, but as you know, the curbing on Riverside Ave for the most part is level with the street.

779
00:59:53,914 --> 01:00:01,136
[SPEAKER_25]: And I was wondering what your thoughts are if we are going to do a paving and a re-striping and so forth.

780
01:00:01,776 --> 01:00:12,138
[SPEAKER_25]: why we wouldn't be addressing, at least within this stretch, the restoration of the curbing and reestablish it as a true curb and not something that's level with the street.

781
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:19,080
[SPEAKER_02]: So this job, hello everybody.

782
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:28,021
[SPEAKER_02]: So this job is in preparation for an MWA job, and part of their scope is going to be resurfacing and repaving the whole stretch.

783
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually beyond the limits of National Grid.

784
01:00:31,332 --> 01:00:38,177
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking for opportunities for, you know, addressing things while they're out there.

785
01:00:38,197 --> 01:00:45,623
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the intersection with Commercial Street is one, and the condition of the manholes there.

786
01:00:45,663 --> 01:00:51,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So my thoughts on it are we look for opportunities to try to make some improvements.

787
01:00:53,826 --> 01:00:56,848
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, where we can and what's reasonable.

788
01:00:57,749 --> 01:01:12,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can take a look at it to see what, you know, what makes reasonable sense during the scope of the work for sure, whether it's National Grid is doing some piping work or MWRA has a more fuller scope project.

789
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:15,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, so as part of

790
01:01:16,637 --> 01:01:26,902
[SPEAKER_25]: Number 12, Tim, it says that the MWRA section 57 project includes resurfacing and striping of this portion of Riverside Ave.

791
01:01:27,382 --> 01:01:35,927
[SPEAKER_25]: And then it goes on to say the engineering division requests that National Grid contribute to the cost of a final restoration to other paving in the city.

792
01:01:36,728 --> 01:01:50,676
[SPEAKER_25]: So it seems to me that we could ask of National Grid to step up and look at some of our curbing conditions, but rather the condition in here states we'll look at them to do other projects in the city.

793
01:01:51,397 --> 01:02:01,743
[SPEAKER_25]: And what I'm saying is right now, I don't believe that the current condition of that curbing on most of Riverside Ave meets any safety standard of DOT.

794
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:10,608
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't see how a level curb that meets the street meets any requirement of safety standard.

795
01:02:12,089 --> 01:02:15,292
[SPEAKER_02]: There are definitely areas that need curbing and things like that.

796
01:02:15,592 --> 01:02:17,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it would require design and closer look.

797
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:18,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that.

798
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:24,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why I kind of go back to what makes sense for the scope of the job and what they have mobilized.

799
01:02:26,122 --> 01:02:26,563
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, right.

800
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:43,241
[SPEAKER_25]: So what I'll do different, and this is no reflection on you, because you're relatively new in terms of this city, is that I've been hearing about Riverside Avenue curbing for a number of years, a lot of years.

801
01:02:44,142 --> 01:02:52,526
[SPEAKER_25]: And now we have an opportunity where we have the MWRA and we have National Grid doing a fairly major project.

802
01:02:53,166 --> 01:03:01,109
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're asking to resurface a street that we already know has some potential safety issues, i.e.

803
01:03:01,149 --> 01:03:01,790
[SPEAKER_25]: the curbing.

804
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,211
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're not going to address it at this point.

805
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:06,972
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to kind of kick the can down the street again.

806
01:03:07,552 --> 01:03:11,294
[SPEAKER_25]: And I appreciate the fact that this may be much larger than the scope.

807
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:18,636
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think at this point, I assume they're going to be grinding the entire street down?

808
01:03:19,956 --> 01:03:21,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be correct, yeah.

809
01:03:21,977 --> 01:03:24,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Or full build, depending on what the condition is.

810
01:03:24,897 --> 01:03:26,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when they grind it, but yes.

811
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:27,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

812
01:03:28,378 --> 01:03:38,361
[SPEAKER_25]: So why not take this opportunity to call upon National Grid and the MWRA to step up

813
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:43,726
[SPEAKER_25]: and do this work.

814
01:03:44,147 --> 01:03:45,189
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't understand it.

815
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:55,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot more involved when you're talking about curbing than just the scope that's involved with a utility project and resurfacing.

816
01:03:56,075 --> 01:04:05,181
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no design scope involved there, taking a look at the nitty gritties of ADA accessibility to every property that's served.

817
01:04:05,621 --> 01:04:10,344
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're talking about adding curb and making those improvements, yes, I agree.

818
01:04:10,504 --> 01:04:14,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's explore that to see what the opportunities are when these projects are happening and what

819
01:04:15,207 --> 01:04:17,608
[SPEAKER_02]: utility companies can do for us what makes sense.

820
01:04:17,628 --> 01:04:18,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally there.

821
01:04:18,749 --> 01:04:31,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that if National Grid is open to it, some of that money I'm talking about, that they don't have to resurface, we could look at where it makes sense to put some curbing in and make some safety improvements.

822
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:33,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely on board, completely agree.

823
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:39,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little bit of a different animal when you try to incorporate that type of work into these types of projects.

824
01:04:39,994 --> 01:05:03,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so would you be amendable then to updating your conditions to include in the language rather than say that final restoration to other paving in the city, which is the responsibility of National Grid, that the engineering division requested National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to curbing on Riverside Ave?

825
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:05,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

826
01:05:05,491 --> 01:05:08,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be completely acceptable from my perspective.

827
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:18,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can work with National Grid to see, like I said, what makes sense and things like that, and see if we can get it incorporated into a scope somewhere and figure it out.

828
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,383
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, so I would ask, Mr. President, that that language be updated.

829
01:05:24,643 --> 01:05:33,169
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'd read, the engineering division, this is bullet point 12, requests that National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration

830
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:36,289
[SPEAKER_25]: to curbing on Riverside Ave.

831
01:05:40,046 --> 01:05:44,811
[SPEAKER_25]: And then it goes on to say, this can be coordinated with the engineering division, which is perfect.

832
01:05:44,851 --> 01:05:47,393
[SPEAKER_25]: We have our city engineer that can do that.

833
01:05:47,433 --> 01:05:49,675
[SPEAKER_25]: So that sounds good.

834
01:05:50,216 --> 01:06:04,069
[SPEAKER_25]: The second thing, Tim, and you may be able to clarify this, is I'm under the impression that many of our drawings that were lost in the fire down at the old DPW public works building

835
01:06:05,988 --> 01:06:14,092
[SPEAKER_25]: The drawings were lost that show the corner of Locust Street and Riverside Ave regarding underground utilities.

836
01:06:14,693 --> 01:06:16,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that accurate assessment?

837
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,356
[SPEAKER_02]: That specific intersection, I don't know for sure.

838
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that quite a few are lost.

839
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:27,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you received that information from my division at some point, I would back it up.

840
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:29,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they know a lot of what was lost.

841
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:47,460
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so at this point, would it make sense to put a condition in there where the road's gonna be ripped up that we look at recreating drawings and digitize our underground utilities at the corner of Locust and Riverside during this construction?

842
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:54,926
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just gonna say, I think that maybe that was for the MWRI permit.

843
01:06:54,966 --> 01:06:59,210
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if our excavation will go, we're,

844
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:02,297
[SPEAKER_24]: We're moving out of the way for MWRA.

845
01:07:02,578 --> 01:07:03,601
[SPEAKER_24]: It's really their project.

846
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:04,985
[SPEAKER_24]: We're accommodating them.

847
01:07:07,205 --> 01:07:07,985
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, right.

848
01:07:08,145 --> 01:07:11,407
[SPEAKER_25]: As you said, their pipe is well below yours.

849
01:07:11,787 --> 01:07:12,847
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

850
01:07:13,088 --> 01:07:28,734
[SPEAKER_25]: So it would seem to me that this would be a perfect time, and I defer to the city engineer, that if indeed we don't have these drawings on file, this would be the perfect time to digitize the underground utilities in that area.

851
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:30,895
[SPEAKER_24]: Our excavation would be away from that area.

852
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:36,678
[SPEAKER_24]: We're putting in a new main away from all that, and then we'll abandon it by energizing the new main.

853
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:44,610
[SPEAKER_24]: excavating out the old main, that would be part of the MWRA's demolition or excavation part of their job.

854
01:07:45,171 --> 01:07:45,991
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, right.

855
01:07:46,011 --> 01:07:47,992
[SPEAKER_25]: But you're doing this job on their behalf.

856
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:52,293
[SPEAKER_25]: So now we have leverage through you to the MWRA, right?

857
01:07:53,673 --> 01:07:55,714
[SPEAKER_25]: So now we're requesting that this take place.

858
01:07:55,754 --> 01:08:01,436
[SPEAKER_25]: So I could appreciate the fact that you don't have, National Grid doesn't really have any responsibility in that.

859
01:08:01,476 --> 01:08:04,197
[SPEAKER_25]: But now's the time that we as a community have leverage.

860
01:08:04,617 --> 01:08:06,178
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would ask the city engineer,

861
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:09,738
[SPEAKER_25]: if that would make sense at this point.

862
01:08:11,138 --> 01:08:15,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a couple thoughts, and I was thinking about this matter, that's why I was taking a moment there.

863
01:08:16,682 --> 01:08:19,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So, with the excavation that they're doing, well, two things.

864
01:08:19,984 --> 01:08:26,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a lot of it documented in GIS, I know that, so things have been recreated over time.

865
01:08:27,128 --> 01:08:30,070
[SPEAKER_02]: This specific intersection I would have to look into to see exactly what we're missing.

866
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:34,633
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they do the trenching for some of the MWI work,

867
01:08:35,817 --> 01:08:55,742
[SPEAKER_02]: or when trenching is happening through that intersection, even with national grid, if we wanted to put a condition, whether it's in the grand location or the street open permit, to document what they find, because basically they're cutting a cross section through the intersection, we could do something like that.

868
01:08:57,103 --> 01:08:58,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else is sort of,

869
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:08,115
[SPEAKER_02]: We either have the information or it doesn't make sense for them to be digging all over the intersection to try to get the information.

870
01:09:10,538 --> 01:09:14,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the value of those plans that were lost, a lot of that value is

871
01:09:15,745 --> 01:09:19,447
[SPEAKER_02]: may have been replaced, and if it hasn't yet, it can be.

872
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:28,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the opportunity here that screams out at me is, if they're trenching across the intersection, let's document what they encounter.

873
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:33,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can definitely have some sort of condition, whether it's in the grand location or the street open permit, for sure, to get that information.

874
01:09:34,446 --> 01:09:37,729
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, so I will leave that up to your expertise.

875
01:09:40,071 --> 01:09:52,882
[SPEAKER_25]: My last question, and this may be not a question to you, but the Opticom system, I know we have one further down, I believe on Riverside Ave, for fire trucks and ambulances.

876
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:56,966
[SPEAKER_25]: Does that wiring happen underground, do you know?

877
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,449
[SPEAKER_25]: When they wire the intersections?

878
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:01,730
[SPEAKER_25]: What's that?

879
01:10:04,565 --> 01:10:05,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good one though, I'll add.

880
01:10:05,426 --> 01:10:06,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

881
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:14,459
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so maybe Mr. President, if we can ask that question of Head of WIAS.

882
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:32,707
[SPEAKER_25]: to ask them, and if the case is that the wiring is underground, this would be an ideal time for the city, rather than dig it up again, because that's a very busy intersection, to run the proper wiring underground while this area is going to be open.

883
01:10:33,207 --> 01:10:37,151
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would ask that maybe if the city engineer can work in conjunction with

884
01:10:38,453 --> 01:10:48,502
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Randazzo, the head of wires, so we can check to see if the Opti-Com system and the running of wires during this particular project would be worthwhile.

885
01:10:49,483 --> 01:10:51,766
[SPEAKER_25]: And I appreciate your time, Mr. Engineer.

886
01:10:52,626 --> 01:10:53,147
[SPEAKER_02]: You have not a problem.

887
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:56,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm interested in learning more about that system now anyway, so sounds good.

888
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:56,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

889
01:10:57,371 --> 01:10:58,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you to Councilor Marks.

890
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:02,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk Hernandez, do you have all of the updated language from Councilor Marks?

891
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:14,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I have the language that the city engineer work with the head of wires to see if the optic comp system can be run during this project.

892
01:11:14,472 --> 01:11:15,794
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know if I have the rest of it.

893
01:11:17,376 --> 01:11:19,218
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that was it, Mr. Clerk.

894
01:11:19,598 --> 01:11:27,367
[SPEAKER_25]: That's perfect, that the city engineer and the head of wires get together and see if this would be an ideal time to run piping.

895
01:11:29,423 --> 01:11:31,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Mox, Councilor Behrs.

896
01:11:31,565 --> 01:11:32,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

897
01:11:32,465 --> 01:11:33,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hopping on, Tim.

898
01:11:34,507 --> 01:11:35,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of quick questions.

899
01:11:36,268 --> 01:11:43,714
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like MWRA is going to remove the existing gas main as part of their project.

900
01:11:43,754 --> 01:11:44,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what Ms.

901
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:45,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuddy just said?

902
01:11:47,998 --> 01:11:52,419
[SPEAKER_24]: And then just on the MWRA piece here, are they going to require a grant of location from us?

903
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:55,040
[SPEAKER_24]: Have we already granted that grant of location?

904
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:55,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Tim?

905
01:12:18,096 --> 01:12:18,596
[SPEAKER_14]: He's on mute.

906
01:12:21,257 --> 01:12:21,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

907
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:25,719
[SPEAKER_14]: MWI is already there.

908
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:28,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that answer your question?

909
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,920
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need a grant allocation.

910
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:30,380
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it.

911
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,080
[SPEAKER_00]: They have it.

912
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,281
[SPEAKER_02]: They have very large pipes and roofs.

913
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:32,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it.

914
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:33,261
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

915
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:33,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

916
01:12:34,901 --> 01:12:39,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think Councilor Knight answered this for me, that some of the streets are not

917
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:52,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Eligible to be resurfaced due to the five-year rule, but it does look like this project's going into Locust Street Which was just resurfaced, so I'm just wondering why that's not included in your conditions I would probably be on the permit, I would think.

918
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:58,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Any work that's happening on a sealed street like that, five year street, we have them do curb to curb regardless.

919
01:12:58,858 --> 01:13:03,859
[SPEAKER_02]: If I missed a spot, I didn't think I did, but if I missed a spot, then that would be the case.

920
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:08,420
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing on Linden, the one right next to it, the same thing is happening.

921
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:11,100
[SPEAKER_02]: They're touching that scope.

922
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So they end up doing curb to curb with an offset.

923
01:13:14,821 --> 01:13:17,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't like it, but it works out.

924
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the MWRA scope.

925
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:24,203
[SPEAKER_02]: basically in their plan set is the full length of the project resurfaced.

926
01:13:24,763 --> 01:13:24,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

927
01:13:25,023 --> 01:13:25,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

928
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:27,984
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it says in here is that Riverside will be fully resurfaced.

929
01:13:28,024 --> 01:13:31,764
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a condition for Linden Street, but there's no condition for Locust Street.

930
01:13:31,864 --> 01:13:33,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was an oversight.

931
01:13:33,585 --> 01:13:34,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I can check that out.

932
01:13:34,245 --> 01:13:36,785
[SPEAKER_02]: We can definitely incorporate that for sure.

933
01:13:36,965 --> 01:13:37,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

934
01:13:37,265 --> 01:13:37,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

935
01:13:37,926 --> 01:13:39,486
[SPEAKER_24]: And can be part of the street opening permit.

936
01:13:39,506 --> 01:13:40,626
[SPEAKER_24]: We see that a lot of times.

937
01:13:40,646 --> 01:13:42,306
[SPEAKER_24]: They come back with guaranteed status.

938
01:13:42,366 --> 01:13:43,827
[SPEAKER_24]: So we do curb to curb.

939
01:13:44,407 --> 01:13:47,628
[SPEAKER_24]: So if it's missed here, then it goes in the street opening permit.

940
01:13:48,228 --> 01:13:48,528
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

941
01:13:49,568 --> 01:13:49,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

942
01:13:51,524 --> 01:13:52,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

943
01:13:53,466 --> 01:13:54,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions from the council?

944
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:59,931
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, the chair awaits a motion.

945
01:14:01,993 --> 01:14:07,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you get all the answers you wanted to capitalize?

946
01:14:08,339 --> 01:14:16,606
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, if my colleagues feel comfortable, I'm not comfortable with when this project has taken place, but I'm not sure at this point.

947
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:24,822
[SPEAKER_24]: I could help, I would hope, with that, with communication.

948
01:14:25,923 --> 01:14:28,064
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, we have one more question from Councilor Behrs.

949
01:14:28,705 --> 01:14:29,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Either to Ms.

950
01:14:29,685 --> 01:14:35,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuddy or to Mr. McGivern, what is the urgency here on the MWRA's part to get this underway?

951
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:39,731
[SPEAKER_24]: That I don't know.

952
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:41,092
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe Tim would know better.

953
01:14:43,185 --> 01:14:48,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the urgency besides that it's a scheduled project in MWRA's scheduling.

954
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:58,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of their projects are tied to usually the large redundant project, redundant tunnel project they're working on now.

955
01:14:58,115 --> 01:15:01,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this exactly is, but a lot of their work they're doing recently is.

956
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:10,263
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know the exact urgency of the reason, but they always have a right kind of clockwork type schedule that they're always working on.

957
01:15:11,092 --> 01:15:12,912
[SPEAKER_24]: And it is, I do know it's urgent to them.

958
01:15:12,932 --> 01:15:19,093
[SPEAKER_24]: They're really anxious, you know, on us to find out when we submitted the drawings, when the hearing was going to be.

959
01:15:20,114 --> 01:15:22,894
[SPEAKER_24]: So there is some urgency on there and I just don't know what it is.

960
01:15:26,095 --> 01:15:26,375
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

961
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:35,916
[SPEAKER_25]: So, Mr. President, just, uh, Councilor Knight mentioned that, I didn't see it in here, but, um, you mentioned that this was submitted to the city back in August.

962
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:36,737
[SPEAKER_25]: That's correct.

963
01:15:37,797 --> 01:15:39,257
[SPEAKER_25]: And why, why are we seeing it now?

964
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:41,485
[SPEAKER_25]: Tim?

965
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:43,987
[SPEAKER_25]: The question was- I'm not sure.

966
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:47,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think it was in my office for longer than any grant location.

967
01:15:51,831 --> 01:15:52,992
[SPEAKER_25]: And how long would that be, Tim?

968
01:15:53,352 --> 01:15:54,853
[SPEAKER_25]: A typical grant- I don't have that in front of me.

969
01:15:54,873 --> 01:15:55,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can look.

970
01:15:55,613 --> 01:15:57,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I could try to figure that out.

971
01:15:58,455 --> 01:16:03,938
[SPEAKER_25]: So what's a typical grant allocation once you get it from your desk to when it comes before the council?

972
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:09,039
[SPEAKER_24]: It does go to other departments first, I think, right?

973
01:16:09,961 --> 01:16:11,663
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't other departments mix the rounds?

974
01:16:11,683 --> 01:16:12,664
[SPEAKER_24]: The application is done.

975
01:16:12,684 --> 01:16:15,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of clarification, Councilor, because I don't want to mislead.

976
01:16:15,188 --> 01:16:16,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of clarification, Councilor.

977
01:16:18,903 --> 01:16:25,484
[SPEAKER_26]: It should be noted that National Grid submitted two granted location petitions for the same scope of work with minor differences in routing.

978
01:16:26,005 --> 01:16:27,745
[SPEAKER_26]: However, the two plans are largely the same.

979
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:33,346
[SPEAKER_26]: The engineering division confirmed with National Grid that the petition dated 8-20-2020 is the correct petition.

980
01:16:33,786 --> 01:16:38,627
[SPEAKER_26]: The other petition received on 9-8-2020 was discarded.

981
01:16:39,447 --> 01:16:42,968
[SPEAKER_26]: So it looks like there might have been some confusion with the plan design as well.

982
01:16:43,908 --> 01:16:44,968
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

983
01:16:45,008 --> 01:16:46,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two identical submissions.

984
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:47,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

985
01:16:49,487 --> 01:16:51,688
[SPEAKER_02]: are mostly identical.

986
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:56,852
[SPEAKER_16]: And the memo from Tim McGivern is dated October 2nd, which is almost a month ago.

987
01:16:56,892 --> 01:16:57,152
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

988
01:16:57,312 --> 01:17:01,955
[SPEAKER_25]: So Mr. President, I'm curious about the urgency of this particular project.

989
01:17:01,975 --> 01:17:02,655
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, absolutely.

990
01:17:02,755 --> 01:17:06,017
[SPEAKER_25]: And ask that we lay this on the table for one week and get a response back.

991
01:17:06,337 --> 01:17:09,759
[SPEAKER_25]: Two weeks, because you're right, we won't be meeting next week.

992
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,422
[SPEAKER_25]: And get a response back from the MWA on the urgency of this project.

993
01:17:14,442 --> 01:17:18,705
[SPEAKER_25]: And to Councilor Abeas, what exactly is the project they're doing?

994
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:27,105
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, and then we can make an informed decision based on our residents and based on the fact that this will be during winter time and a huge inconvenience.

995
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:27,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

996
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:30,582

1042
01:19:19,128 --> 01:19:31,521
[SPEAKER_19]: That the superintendent of schools or the city administration provide an update to the Memphis City Council with regards to the funding that was approved to resolve the HVAC issues within our public school buildings.

1043
01:19:32,242 --> 01:19:33,023
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

1044
01:19:33,243 --> 01:19:34,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1045
01:19:34,785 --> 01:19:39,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Last month we approved a number of papers that came to us from the mayor to

1046
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:43,553
[SPEAKER_16]: funding to fix various HVAC issues throughout the Medford Public Schools.

1047
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:47,156
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe the total amount of the funding we approved was approximately about $800,000.

1048
01:19:47,756 --> 01:19:56,163
[SPEAKER_16]: The ongoing problems with the air quality throughout our district concerns me not only as a city councilor, but also as a parent.

1049
01:19:56,343 --> 01:20:01,347
[SPEAKER_16]: I have two students, two of my kids are in the Medford Public Schools, two are at Medford High School.

1050
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:14,833
[SPEAKER_16]: And like many kids, many of their peers throughout the district are accessing the curriculum virtually five days a week because our buildings are not ready to handle the entire student body yet.

1051
01:20:16,713 --> 01:20:22,255
[SPEAKER_16]: For many students, the schools are a safe place.

1052
01:20:23,415 --> 01:20:26,276
[SPEAKER_16]: They get their food on a daily basis from the Metropolitan Public Schools.

1053
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,777
[SPEAKER_16]: The emotional support, the health services that they might not actually have at home.

1054
01:20:31,477 --> 01:20:38,959
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that the custodians and the buildings and grounds people at the schools have been working really hard.

1055
01:20:39,019 --> 01:20:46,780
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know the teachers have had the literally Herculean task of trying to teach virtually each day.

1056
01:20:47,421 --> 01:20:51,922
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's not easy, and they've had that task.

1057
01:20:54,269 --> 01:20:55,330
[SPEAKER_16]: We've appropriated the money.

1058
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:57,373
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's time that we get some sort of an update.

1059
01:20:57,393 --> 01:20:58,535
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been almost two months.

1060
01:20:59,156 --> 01:21:03,982
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know I did have an opportunity to review some of the air quality reports.

1061
01:21:04,162 --> 01:21:09,249
[SPEAKER_16]: And it looks like they've made some progress at, I believe, the elementary schools, which is promising.

1062
01:21:09,309 --> 01:21:10,991
[SPEAKER_16]: And to that I say thank you.

1063
01:21:12,413 --> 01:21:23,036
[SPEAKER_16]: But I know that there's, it seems to me when I did a quick analysis of the reports that there are, I know I have numerous questions regarding Medford High School and the vocational school.

1064
01:21:23,817 --> 01:21:31,759
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know David Murphy from the, I believe he's the new superintendent of finance on the school side, is actually on the call tonight.

1065
01:21:32,099 --> 01:21:33,720
[SPEAKER_16]: And I thank him for joining us.

1066
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:37,181
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe he's new, so I also welcome him to the Met with Public Schools.

1067
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:44,744
[SPEAKER_16]: So if he could just give us an update with regards to what they're doing with regard to the funds that we sent.

1068
01:21:45,184 --> 01:21:47,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Give us a progress update as to what's happening.

1069
01:21:47,525 --> 01:21:50,286
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some further questions, but I'd love to hear an update from him.

1070
01:21:50,866 --> 01:21:53,207
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could please unmute him, that would be great.

1071
01:21:53,227 --> 01:21:53,987
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1072
01:21:54,027 --> 01:21:54,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1073
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:56,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Murphy, name and address of the record, please.

1074
01:22:03,362 --> 01:22:05,524
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Medford City Council.

1075
01:22:06,465 --> 01:22:10,789
[SPEAKER_03]: David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations for the Medford Public Schools.

1076
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:17,035
[SPEAKER_03]: My address is 87 Monroe Street, Boston, Massachusetts.

1077
01:22:17,095 --> 01:22:29,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent Edward Vinson is also joining us tonight, and so I just defer the opening comments to the superintendent, and I'm happy to add on to that and answer any questions that you might have.

1078
01:22:32,877 --> 01:22:33,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1079
01:22:34,078 --> 01:22:35,699
[SPEAKER_19]: John McLaughlin going to be joining us, Mr. President?

1080
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,220
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see him yet.

1081
01:22:39,222 --> 01:22:40,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Superintendent, name and address of the record.

1082
01:22:40,963 --> 01:22:48,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Superintendent?

1083
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:51,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the superintendent just happened to be unmuted.

1084
01:22:51,692 --> 01:22:52,973
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1085
01:22:54,815 --> 01:22:55,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

1086
01:22:56,236 --> 01:22:56,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1087
01:22:57,116 --> 01:22:59,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Maurice Edward Vincent, Metro Public Schools, 489.

1088
01:23:03,594 --> 01:23:19,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to say thank you for this opportunity to come and speak to you and address the updates of what's been happening in the public schools and the amount of work that has been taking place.

1089
01:23:20,643 --> 01:23:28,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to assure you that the investment that in the schools is going to

1090
01:23:30,596 --> 01:23:35,898
[SPEAKER_01]: further face the challenges that we have been slowly but surely making progress.

1091
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:50,665
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Dave Murphy, to complete specifics regarding an update on the information of how the monies are going to be spent in the Medicaid school.

1092
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:51,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1093
01:23:52,526 --> 01:23:53,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1094
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,067
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Murphy.

1095
01:23:55,867 --> 01:23:56,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1096
01:23:57,248 --> 01:23:58,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, uh,

1097
01:23:58,923 --> 01:24:04,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I testified before you some time ago, right shortly after my arrival in August.

1098
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:17,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that time, if you'll recall, that the district was embarking upon an effort to assess the air quality and specifically the air change

1099
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: air exchange rates that many districts and other facilities across the country and certainly across the Commonwealth are looking at now due to the heightened air quality standards that are

1100
01:24:31,331 --> 01:24:38,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important as we discuss these issues to to continue to remind folks that our our buildings are safe.

1101
01:24:38,818 --> 01:24:39,398
[SPEAKER_03]: We have children.

1102
01:24:53,911 --> 01:25:08,814
[SPEAKER_03]: in them every day, we have staff in them every day, we take their safety extremely seriously, but those of us who work in the Medford Public Schools and are here in these buildings every day, it's important that we continue to message that to the community.

1103
01:25:09,174 --> 01:25:22,697
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, given the conditions under which we are living and under which the district is operating, it is important that we adhere to the heightened air quality standards, and that's why we embarked upon the work that we have over the last several months.

1104
01:25:23,157 --> 01:25:39,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of the efforts that we've done, and I'm happy to get into specific questions as to funding sources and what the priorities are both now and going forward, but we have retained a number of environmental engineers and industrial hygienist staff.

1105
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:44,958
[SPEAKER_03]: personnel who have come in and who have examined every room throughout the Medford Public Schools.

1106
01:25:45,419 --> 01:25:57,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We have identified a number of facility repairs and improvements that are necessary and practices that need to be employed in order to make sure that we are meeting those standards.

1107
01:25:58,267 --> 01:26:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: On our website, you can access all the most up-to-date air quality reports that have been published by Precision Air and Balancing, which is the firm that is doing the bulk of this work in terms of the assessing and diagnosing of the issues.

1108
01:26:15,562 --> 01:26:22,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to walk you through what the big three, as we call them, in terms of issues that we're seeing that need to be addressed.

1109
01:26:22,408 --> 01:26:26,710
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been addressed at a number of the schools, as Mr. Falco was alluding to.

1110
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:29,871
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen significant improvement over the course of the last month.

1111
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:37,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result of that, pursuant to the superintendent's announcement this evening, that fifth grade in-person instruction will begin next week.

1112
01:26:38,154 --> 01:26:43,616
[SPEAKER_03]: As of next week, we will have grades K through six participating in in-person instruction.

1113
01:26:44,036 --> 01:26:48,738
[SPEAKER_03]: That is due to the work that's happened, both by the buildings and ground staff,

1114
01:26:49,218 --> 01:26:53,720
[SPEAKER_03]: and our schools and with the personnel that we've brought on in consultancy roles.

1115
01:26:54,420 --> 01:27:07,224
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we feel good about the progress that we're making, but I will say as the person responsible for the non-instructional elements of the district, the fact that there are children not in school due to non-instructional reasons is not sitting well with any of us.

1116
01:27:07,364 --> 01:27:14,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And we understand the urgency, both in terms of getting students back into schools and making sure that the buildings are safe for students

1117
01:27:15,227 --> 01:27:18,948
[SPEAKER_03]: for staff and for members of the community who want to visit me.

1118
01:27:18,968 --> 01:27:20,708
[SPEAKER_19]: So I will refer you as to what questions you have.

1119
01:27:20,748 --> 01:27:23,949
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be about where that funding is going, but that's the same thing as of right now.

1120
01:27:24,009 --> 01:27:25,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Murphy, hold on one second.

1121
01:27:25,269 --> 01:27:26,189
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Murphy, hold on one second.

1122
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:27,489
[SPEAKER_26]: What information council tonight?

1123
01:27:27,749 --> 01:27:34,271
[SPEAKER_26]: So as of Thursday, all students grades K through 6 will be returning to school underneath this hybrid model?

1124
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:35,891
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

1125
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:37,771
[SPEAKER_26]: So they'll be having two days in and two days out?

1126
01:27:38,852 --> 01:27:39,272
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

1127
01:27:39,292 --> 01:27:40,132
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the hybrid model.

1128
01:27:40,771 --> 01:27:45,794
[SPEAKER_03]: two cohorts of in-person instruction on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday, respectively.

1129
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:49,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Cohort A, our high-need, most vulnerable students, are in four days a week.

1130
01:27:50,036 --> 01:27:53,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday is a remote day for all students.

1131
01:27:53,858 --> 01:28:02,243
[SPEAKER_26]: Have we done an audit or conducted an assessment to ensure that we are meeting the requirements for hours of education and hours of personalized instruction?

1132
01:28:03,887 --> 01:28:16,650
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know that we've done an audit, but this is a model that's being used across the commonwealth and is one of the ones that were part of Desi's guidelines with regard to what's an acceptable form of education under these circumstances.

1133
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:23,752
[SPEAKER_26]: As a parent, Mr. Murphy, and I'm not trying to be critical because I know we're all trying to get through this and learn, but this hybrid model,

1134
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:26,833
[SPEAKER_26]: I feel as though it's significantly lacking.

1135
01:28:26,953 --> 01:28:33,318
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I'm home with my child, doing the online portion of the education.

1136
01:28:33,858 --> 01:28:40,342
[SPEAKER_26]: And when they're on their self-directed learning days, I feel as though we could do more.

1137
01:28:42,003 --> 01:28:52,830
[SPEAKER_26]: I am very fortunate to probably have my son and one of the best teachers in the Medford Public Schools classroom, and he's been able to manage.

1138
01:28:54,737 --> 01:29:03,687
[SPEAKER_26]: As a parent, I'm very concerned about the direction that we're going in and our ability to provide a high quality education to our students here.

1139
01:29:03,787 --> 01:29:09,013
[SPEAKER_26]: Because I feel as though we're really missing the mark with this hybrid model.

1140
01:29:10,315 --> 01:29:14,920
[SPEAKER_26]: So the next question would leave me to ask with this hybrid model that we have in place.

1141
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:18,522
[SPEAKER_26]: in these investments that we're making to our high school and our other schools.

1142
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:22,185
[SPEAKER_26]: Moving forward, if the schools do open, the hybrid model is what we're going to see.

1143
01:29:22,205 --> 01:29:25,987
[SPEAKER_26]: We're not going to see full in-person learning from our students this year.

1144
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,308
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that safe to say?

1145
01:29:28,308 --> 01:29:38,693
[SPEAKER_03]: It's safe to say, due to the occupancy restrictions that have been imposed on us under public health guidance, that it will be a hybrid model for this year, unless significant variables change that we don't anticipate.

1146
01:29:38,733 --> 01:29:51,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think those of us who are sick to our stomachs over the lack of in-person learning that's happening as a result of the pandemic, I don't think any of us want to concede that there's no chance of more in-person instruction.

1147
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:57,103
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this point, it has to be the plan for the year based on the public health guidance that we're operating under.

1148
01:29:58,433 --> 01:30:01,896
[SPEAKER_26]: And the public health guidance that we're working under versus, say, St.

1149
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:02,556
[SPEAKER_26]: Raphael's or St.

1150
01:30:02,576 --> 01:30:03,397
[SPEAKER_26]: Joseph's is different?

1151
01:30:06,659 --> 01:30:12,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine what the distinction would be, but as a general rule, I would say yes.

1152
01:30:14,465 --> 01:30:23,292
[SPEAKER_26]: So based upon your presentation, I mean, listen, none of us know except for Councilor Marks, I think, because he went to the vocational school and he's a lot handier than I am.

1153
01:30:24,157 --> 01:30:30,040
[SPEAKER_26]: based upon my recent electrocution when I was trying to change a light bulb.

1154
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,921
[SPEAKER_26]: With that being said, this assessment's going on.

1155
01:30:33,742 --> 01:30:38,344
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think many of us here are too interested in seeing how many particles per minute are being pushed through a room.

1156
01:30:38,704 --> 01:30:47,048
[SPEAKER_26]: I think what we all want to know is when a school's going to open so that the high school kids can get back to the high school, so that we can have a full complement of learning in person for our students K through 12.

1157
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:48,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1158
01:30:50,027 --> 01:31:07,489
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remember when we first sought the funding appropriation, that is the subject of this discussion, our hope was to commit those funds both to the HVAC repairs that are necessary to make sure that our systems are in place and that we're meeting those air quality standards.

1159
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:24,639
[SPEAKER_03]: and to procure the portable HEPA filters that would put us in a position where when the HVAC repairs were not going to fit a timeline that we were comfortable with, we would be able to essentially supplement the air exchange in each room and then meet those standards via the HEPA filters.

1160
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have done that.

1161
01:31:27,561 --> 01:31:33,645
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had vendors working in the schools essentially seven days a week over the last several months.

1162
01:31:33,665 --> 01:31:36,687
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big part of why we've been able to see the improvements that we have.

1163
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:54,754
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also procured a large, relatively large stockpile of HEPA filters that we've been able to deploy to all eight schools and have more at the ready to deploy as we're prepared to continue implementing the hybrid model and have

1164
01:31:55,194 --> 01:31:56,475
[SPEAKER_03]: more in-person instruction.

1165
01:31:56,555 --> 01:32:18,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So with regard to the high school, it is the building that both with regard to the complexity of the problem and the scale of the problem, it's where we're seeing the greatest need and where I will have more repairs that have to occur, several of which are occurring right now, and then also a larger portion of the heavens will be deployed to those rooms.

1166
01:32:18,274 --> 01:32:20,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So our priority right now is completing

1167
01:32:21,377 --> 01:32:32,186
[SPEAKER_03]: the K-8 implementation, the vocational programming due to the curriculum needs of those students is happening alongside with the K-8 priority.

1168
01:32:32,587 --> 01:32:34,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our hope is to go through the high school.

1169
01:32:34,609 --> 01:32:45,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And my expectation is that we'll open the high school for use for in-person instruction, essentially piece by piece, as we're able to bring in more rooms.

1170
01:32:46,138 --> 01:32:47,500
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said to the school committee last night,

1171
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:59,794
[SPEAKER_03]: The complexity of the secondary level is that due to the nature of the academic schedule, it is not as simple as just having a hallway that's cleared and therefore we can fit that many students and bring those students in.

1172
01:33:00,254 --> 01:33:04,940
[SPEAKER_03]: As we implement in-person instruction, in order to minimize

1173
01:33:05,446 --> 01:33:14,132
[SPEAKER_03]: the circumstances in which teachers are educating two constituencies of students concurrently, which obviously brings with it its own instructional challenges.

1174
01:33:14,632 --> 01:33:22,758
[SPEAKER_03]: When we bring in some students and have room for them, there's a domino effect as to what other students and staff have to be brought in in order to make the schedule work.

1175
01:33:23,518 --> 01:33:32,220
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a piece that's specific to the high school that makes it more complex, but it certainly doesn't make it any less urgent that we bring them in as soon as possible.

1176
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:42,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not have a specific timeline as to when that will happen, but I can tell you that it is something that we're working aggressively toward to have as much in-person instruction in the district as possible.

1177
01:33:44,674 --> 01:33:45,676
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't have a date certain.

1178
01:33:45,696 --> 01:33:47,179
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have a goal, maybe, Mr. President?

1179
01:33:47,219 --> 01:33:51,968
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there a goal date or a defined period of time we're hoping to complete these assessments?

1180
01:33:55,525 --> 01:33:56,906
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot depends on these answers.

1181
01:33:56,986 --> 01:33:59,107
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of people's lives are affected by these answers.

1182
01:33:59,147 --> 01:34:01,469
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of people have child care issues that they need to resolve.

1183
01:34:01,489 --> 01:34:05,231
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of people are paying money out of pocket that they weren't paying before for child care.

1184
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,112
[SPEAKER_26]: So these are real life issues that affect people.

1185
01:34:07,792 --> 01:34:09,613
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're looking at the high school.

1186
01:34:09,914 --> 01:34:11,635
[SPEAKER_26]: It sounds like the high school is the biggest issue, right?

1187
01:34:11,655 --> 01:34:13,736
[SPEAKER_26]: The high school is the oldest building in the district.

1188
01:34:13,756 --> 01:34:15,277
[SPEAKER_26]: The high school is the building that needs the most work.

1189
01:34:15,797 --> 01:34:17,098
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's take the high school off the table.

1190
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:19,580
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's look at the middle school.

1191
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:32,611
[SPEAKER_26]: We have K-6 now, so we're looking at 7th and 8th grade to be the next age bracket that will be, I guess we'd say, let back in to school buildings.

1192
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:39,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so as of next week, 5th grade will move forward and we'll have in-person instruction for K-6.

1193
01:34:40,218 --> 01:34:43,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Grade 6 is already in as of last week.

1194
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:46,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, as of last week.

1195
01:34:46,501 --> 01:34:47,962
[SPEAKER_03]: 3rd and 4th grade came back this week.

1196
01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:49,143
[SPEAKER_03]: 6th grade was last week.

1197
01:34:49,683 --> 01:34:50,843
[SPEAKER_03]: 5th grade will be next week.

1198
01:34:51,303 --> 01:34:57,286
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, in addition to the HVAC issues, some staffing issues that we need to work through.

1199
01:34:57,306 --> 01:35:02,528
[SPEAKER_03]: But I anticipate 7th and 8th grade will not be far behind 5th grade.

1200
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:04,029
[SPEAKER_03]: That is our expectation at this time.

1201
01:35:04,849 --> 01:35:05,389
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

1202
01:35:05,869 --> 01:35:06,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

1203
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:07,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President.

1204
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:08,650
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco, you still have the floor.

1205
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,411
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, thank you.

1206
01:35:09,451 --> 01:35:10,151
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may continue.

1207
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:14,113
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as the reports go, I've received many calls from parents

1208
01:35:16,066 --> 01:35:18,547
[SPEAKER_16]: basically asking where can they access the reports?

1209
01:35:18,807 --> 01:35:19,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you said they're online.

1210
01:35:19,988 --> 01:35:29,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you, I'm not sure if you're able to, and I don't mean to fine tune this to death, but I mean, as far as, are you able to share your screen and show us where these reports are?

1211
01:35:29,492 --> 01:35:32,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I've received numerous calls from parents and they can't find them.

1212
01:35:34,435 --> 01:35:41,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I can, if you give me a screen sharing access, I'm pretty sure that I will be able to do that relatively easily.

1213
01:35:45,688 --> 01:35:47,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Mister Clark, can you please allow him to share his screen?

1214
01:35:55,612 --> 01:35:56,252
[SPEAKER_19]: All set.

1215
01:35:56,832 --> 01:35:57,132
[SPEAKER_19]: All set?

1216
01:35:57,412 --> 01:35:57,753
[SPEAKER_19]: All righty.

1217
01:36:01,694 --> 01:36:02,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1218
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:06,616
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have the Medford Public Schools homepage up in front of you.

1219
01:36:08,296 --> 01:36:09,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we go over to, let's move.

1220
01:36:15,405 --> 01:36:22,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So over to the, scroll down to the reopening tab, school reopening tab.

1221
01:36:27,638 --> 01:36:30,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says groups that make that bound.

1222
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:36,821
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that says.

1223
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:37,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

1224
01:36:37,822 --> 01:36:38,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1225
01:36:38,462 --> 01:36:39,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so, okay.

1226
01:36:39,483 --> 01:36:44,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I've received numerous calls from, uh, from parents saying they can't find their reports.

1227
01:36:44,187 --> 01:36:45,889
[SPEAKER_16]: They want to see the reports and you know,

1228
01:36:47,447 --> 01:36:50,648
[SPEAKER_16]: To me, this process really, really needs to be transparent.

1229
01:36:50,848 --> 01:36:55,688
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that word's used a lot, but this here needs to be transparent.

1230
01:36:55,809 --> 01:37:04,650
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we're talking about the health and the safety of our children, of our teachers, our students, our staff.

1231
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:14,312
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we need to make sure that this stuff is out there so people can see it, and they can access it, and they can make their own decisions and ask educated questions.

1232
01:37:15,612 --> 01:37:18,093
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, because this is just important.

1233
01:37:18,253 --> 01:37:19,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this is important now more than ever.

1234
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:25,636
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's okay, if I could just stop sharing the screen.

1235
01:37:25,656 --> 01:37:26,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1236
01:37:26,857 --> 01:37:31,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get the page back up where it was my expectation that it would be.

1237
01:37:32,759 --> 01:37:39,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is my hope that it is where it's supposed to be.

1238
01:37:39,122 --> 01:37:39,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1239
01:37:39,682 --> 01:37:41,323
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have some further questions.

1240
01:37:41,343 --> 01:37:41,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1241
01:37:44,167 --> 01:38:07,294
[SPEAKER_16]: So when I look at the reports, and I did actually see some of the school committee meeting last night, I noticed I think one of your priorities, which I think is good, is that the vocational school goes back to school sooner than later, especially because the seniors are nearing the end of their, before they graduate, they need to make sure that they're ready to graduate and they're certified to do things they can do and whatnot.

1242
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:12,115
[SPEAKER_16]: But when I look at the reports, it looks like the vocational school, if I'm reading this correctly,

1243
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:14,702
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like it hasn't been tested yet.

1244
01:38:14,762 --> 01:38:15,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that true?

1245
01:38:17,545 --> 01:38:27,374
[SPEAKER_03]: The units that create the air circulation in the vocational areas were not functioning when the testing crew came in.

1246
01:38:30,097 --> 01:38:32,038
[SPEAKER_03]: The units were subjected to some repairs.

1247
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:33,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Those repairs are ongoing.

1248
01:38:34,063 --> 01:38:37,085
[SPEAKER_03]: The units were retested over the weekend and on Monday.

1249
01:38:37,646 --> 01:38:49,415
[SPEAKER_03]: The firm that is completing these reports has committed to publishing a new report that will include some of the rooms that have not yet been completed.

1250
01:38:50,055 --> 01:38:52,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And that report has not yet arrived.

1251
01:38:52,357 --> 01:38:54,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I expect it will before the end of the week.

1252
01:38:55,059 --> 01:38:58,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I share the frustration for those that are waiting for the report to arrive.

1253
01:39:00,123 --> 01:39:01,484
[SPEAKER_03]: The challenge, frankly, is that we're

1254
01:39:02,565 --> 01:39:26,652
[SPEAKER_03]: For this firm that's completing this work and the vendors, we are asking them to complete a, and I will say this in reference to some of the comparisons based on other districts that I'm saying from conversations with my counterparts in other districts, the amount of work that we're asking for in this period of time is significant as compared to some of our peers.

1255
01:39:27,192 --> 01:39:30,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while I'm frustrated that the report has not yet been published,

1256
01:39:31,897 --> 01:39:40,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Given the proportionality of what we're asking of these various vendors, I can't say that it's something that I'm terribly surprised by.

1257
01:39:42,808 --> 01:39:44,310
[SPEAKER_03]: But that report will be forthcoming.

1258
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:45,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

1259
01:39:46,091 --> 01:39:49,735
[SPEAKER_16]: So when I look at the, so I know there were reports that came out previously.

1260
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:51,557
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe it was maybe mid-September.

1261
01:39:52,318 --> 01:39:58,704
[SPEAKER_16]: And when I looked at the reports, I believe mid-September, I don't think at that time the vocational school was tested.

1262
01:39:58,724 --> 01:40:01,286
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that the Karen Theater was tested.

1263
01:40:01,306 --> 01:40:05,210
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think any of the three cafeterias at Medford High School were tested either.

1264
01:40:06,031 --> 01:40:14,416
[SPEAKER_16]: When I look at this report here, the most recent one, it looks like that the, like we said earlier, it didn't look like the vocational school was tested.

1265
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:19,618
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like the Caron Theater was tested, but it still doesn't look like any of the cafeterias were tested.

1266
01:40:20,018 --> 01:40:20,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you confirm that?

1267
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:28,323
[SPEAKER_03]: If the places in the report are either zeros or blank,

1268
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:42,398
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that the units that need to be functioning in order to have what I would describe as readable data were not functioning at that time.

1269
01:40:42,879 --> 01:40:50,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is why the personnel that is completing the testing will need to return in order to make those repairs.

1270
01:40:52,266 --> 01:41:05,673
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could just, if you don't, just very briefly, on the health metrics page where you can see in my screen right now, and this will be linked on the front page of the Medford Public Schools website very, very soon.

1271
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I can promise you that.

1272
01:41:07,694 --> 01:41:11,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that front page of the Medford Public Schools website, you'll be able to click on a link.

1273
01:41:12,016 --> 01:41:12,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It will bring you down.

1274
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:16,256
[SPEAKER_03]: the section that we have here underneath the health metrics.

1275
01:41:16,676 --> 01:41:22,917
[SPEAKER_03]: On the health metrics, if you click on this link, it will bring you to this folder that has all of the most updated reports.

1276
01:41:23,297 --> 01:41:27,198
[SPEAKER_03]: That does not include the Roberts Elementary School as that is a page.

1277
01:41:27,478 --> 01:41:29,279
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a report that is also forthcoming.

1278
01:41:29,299 --> 01:41:38,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you that I know, based on the verbal representations of those who completed the testing, that Roberts has only a single room that has not yet been repaired.

1279
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:40,301
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the building is fully online.

1280
01:41:40,701 --> 01:41:43,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that report should be forthcoming by the end of the week.

1281
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:45,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1282
01:41:46,118 --> 01:41:48,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Scott Belli.

1283
01:41:48,741 --> 01:41:49,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1284
01:41:49,302 --> 01:41:51,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, Council President.

1285
01:41:52,126 --> 01:41:57,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Murphy, I know we talked the other day, and I don't want to put you on the spot.

1286
01:41:57,052 --> 01:41:58,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys are very busy.

1287
01:41:58,193 --> 01:41:59,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how daunting this is.

1288
01:42:01,317 --> 01:42:07,724
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer you gave me for the Roberts classroom was that we're looking at Wednesday and Thursday, Friday possibly of last week.

1289
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:10,546
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still not yet in that room.

1290
01:42:10,606 --> 01:42:21,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know we're talking about the concerns of the kids, but like I said, we have three, it looks like three kindergarten classrooms and one room on the second floor that doesn't have a bathroom.

1291
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:23,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have an update with that?

1292
01:42:25,737 --> 01:42:30,621
[SPEAKER_03]: To the best of my knowledge, there's only one room that has not been fully repaired at the Roberts.

1293
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:33,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to go back and check on that.

1294
01:42:33,043 --> 01:42:41,771
[SPEAKER_03]: But initially, in the report that is available elsewhere on our website, there were, I believe, three classrooms that were unavailable.

1295
01:42:42,111 --> 01:42:46,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of the units were repaired in the subsequent testing.

1296
01:42:48,356 --> 01:42:49,217
[SPEAKER_03]: They passed.

1297
01:42:49,257 --> 01:42:52,340
[SPEAKER_03]: They met the high air quality standards.

1298
01:42:53,573 --> 01:42:58,276
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one room that they were not able to complete the repairs.

1299
01:42:58,296 --> 01:43:02,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that they were on site at the Roberts both this past Friday and this past Saturday.

1300
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:10,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the report I received this morning, the verbal report, that room has still not yet come online, but it is.

1301
01:43:10,868 --> 01:43:14,829
[SPEAKER_03]: We are eager to complete that work so that that building is fully online.

1302
01:43:15,369 --> 01:43:25,852
[SPEAKER_04]: If you please can check that because as of today, we have three teachers in one second floor acting kindergarten class.

1303
01:43:26,552 --> 01:43:37,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know where the confusion comes in or the information's falling by the wayside, but that's only one issue that leaves me to be a little concerned about the rest of the district.

1304
01:43:37,134 --> 01:43:38,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So please forgive my

1305
01:43:40,895 --> 01:43:41,835
[SPEAKER_04]: my apprehension.

1306
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:43,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1307
01:43:43,596 --> 01:43:46,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be clear, I don't fault you for that in any way.

1308
01:43:46,677 --> 01:43:51,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the current situation is not okay.

1309
01:43:51,598 --> 01:43:53,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Schools are supposed to have children in them.

1310
01:43:53,579 --> 01:43:54,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Ours don't have enough in them.

1311
01:43:54,939 --> 01:43:55,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That has to change.

1312
01:43:55,919 --> 01:44:05,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's any, there shouldn't be any confusion with regards to the urgency with which we take this, and I don't blame you for being apprehensive, and I don't blame anyone for being concerned about that.

1313
01:44:05,362 --> 01:44:07,683
[SPEAKER_03]: The current situation is totally unacceptable.

1314
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:08,423
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1315
01:44:08,843 --> 01:44:10,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Falco, you're still off the floor.

1316
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:10,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1317
01:44:10,524 --> 01:44:11,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1318
01:44:11,405 --> 01:44:15,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Murphy, so I'm going to go back to the Caron Theater here.

1319
01:44:15,387 --> 01:44:25,552
[SPEAKER_16]: So when I look at my report, to me I'm looking at this and it says the required ACH is 4.0 for the Caron Theater and the actual ACH is 2.97.

1320
01:44:25,612 --> 01:44:28,633
[SPEAKER_16]: So therefore it fails.

1321
01:44:30,354 --> 01:44:35,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I'm under the impression that that space is still being rented every Sunday.

1322
01:44:40,703 --> 01:44:49,249
[SPEAKER_16]: have the people that are renting that building have they been notified that they're in a building where the equality is not really up to par.

1323
01:45:00,389 --> 01:45:07,013
[SPEAKER_03]: when this room has been rented, but we have supplemented that, the air exchange rates there through HEPA filters.

1324
01:45:07,073 --> 01:45:09,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So those devices are in place.

1325
01:45:10,455 --> 01:45:15,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that was the case prior to having this report in which it didn't meet the heightened air standards.

1326
01:45:16,558 --> 01:45:25,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say that there's been additional sanitation that's been applied to that area and a series of protocols that any entity using the space is required to follow.

1327
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:30,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, those are the terms and conditions that it is my understanding have been in place for some time.

1328
01:45:31,621 --> 01:45:32,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information.

1329
01:45:32,461 --> 01:45:34,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information, Councilor Beas.

1330
01:45:35,322 --> 01:45:37,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Murphy, could you shut off your screen sharing, please?

1331
01:45:40,403 --> 01:45:40,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1332
01:45:41,663 --> 01:45:41,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1333
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:49,425
[SPEAKER_16]: When I look at my calendar, okay, it says that these reports were issued on the 20th of October.

1334
01:45:49,945 --> 01:46:04,517
[SPEAKER_16]: So if they were issued on the 20th of October, that means that last weekend, the district knew that the county theater failed, it's the equality, but yet there were still people in the building, utilizing the building, renting the building.

1335
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:08,461
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, is the city negligible for something like that?

1336
01:46:09,469 --> 01:46:13,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And to me, it doesn't seem we're putting health first.

1337
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:18,171
[SPEAKER_16]: We're still allowing people to rent the building that maybe technically shouldn't be rented.

1338
01:46:20,832 --> 01:46:27,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So the dates and the reports are the dates, to the best of my knowledge, in which the testing was done, not the dates that the district received the reports.

1339
01:46:28,793 --> 01:46:30,754
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one piece that I think is important.

1340
01:46:30,774 --> 01:46:35,535
[SPEAKER_03]: The current data didn't appear in the initial reports that we received from,

1341
01:46:36,965 --> 01:46:39,726
[SPEAKER_03]: from the front because they were focusing on classrooms.

1342
01:46:39,786 --> 01:46:41,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And that had taken a priority.

1343
01:46:41,647 --> 01:46:42,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was then tested.

1344
01:46:42,907 --> 01:46:45,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't make it into a revised report that was issued.

1345
01:46:45,928 --> 01:46:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to the best of my knowledge, we didn't have a report on the on the care there until this past Saturday night.

1346
01:46:53,530 --> 01:47:01,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, as I said, there is there are additional sanitation measures that are being put in place and protocols that

1347
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:09,673
[SPEAKER_03]: all anyone renting any of our facilities are required to adhere to under the public health guidance related to COVID-19.

1348
01:47:10,553 --> 01:47:18,216
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you say there's additional, so you're saying that they added HEPA filters to the counter theaters?

1349
01:47:18,677 --> 01:47:21,238
[SPEAKER_03]: There are now HEPAs in there permanently.

1350
01:47:21,258 --> 01:47:26,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we may have used them at other times if there was a meeting or an event of some kind.

1351
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:29,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I frankly would have to check on that, but there are definitely HEPAs in there now.

1352
01:47:30,273 --> 01:47:36,412
[SPEAKER_16]: So now the HEPA filters that are there, has the data been tested since the HEPA filters have been added?

1353
01:47:37,607 --> 01:47:41,791
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't been, but there's a formula that the firm that does this testing uses.

1354
01:47:42,191 --> 01:47:58,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And so generally, if the HEPA is functioning correctly and they're brand new, and I have no reason to believe that they're not, based on the cubic footage and the number of HEPAs and what the existing air change per hour rate, they then can issue an estimate as to what that air change per hour rate would be with the HEPAs.

1355
01:47:58,664 --> 01:48:05,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be, to the best of my knowledge, based on the representations that were made by the firm, in excess of the heightened standards.

1356
01:48:07,634 --> 01:48:20,041
[SPEAKER_16]: So as far as the, I know it's the local church is actually renting the space.

1357
01:48:20,081 --> 01:48:20,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Have they been notified?

1358
01:48:20,961 --> 01:48:24,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Have they asked any questions as to whether or not the building is safe or ready to be used?

1359
01:48:26,164 --> 01:48:28,265
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have not reached out to them.

1360
01:48:28,426 --> 01:48:30,787
[SPEAKER_16]: The school system has not reached out to them at any point in time.

1361
01:48:32,029 --> 01:48:43,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I imagine if they're renting the facility from us, we are in frequent communication with them, but they haven't, to the best of my knowledge, they haven't asked any specific questions with regard to the air change per hour rate in the room.

1362
01:48:43,756 --> 01:48:47,338
[SPEAKER_16]: And we haven't communicated with them anything from MPS?

1363
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:50,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what we would have communicated.

1364
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:56,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to communicate if anyone would like me to, but I don't know what I would be communicating.

1365
01:48:57,272 --> 01:49:00,834
[SPEAKER_16]: To me, I would think that the equality is something that should be communicated, but that's just me.

1366
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:02,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on to the cafeterias.

1367
01:49:03,195 --> 01:49:04,695
[SPEAKER_16]: The cafeterias haven't been tested.

1368
01:49:04,715 --> 01:49:06,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Where are students eating during the day?

1369
01:49:06,136 --> 01:49:07,256
[SPEAKER_16]: There are students in the building.

1370
01:49:07,276 --> 01:49:10,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you please comment on that?

1371
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:16,420
[SPEAKER_03]: They were eating in courtyards generally, and I believe that generally is still the case.

1372
01:49:17,498 --> 01:49:21,182
[SPEAKER_03]: There are HEPA filters now positioned in the cafeterias as well.

1373
01:49:22,384 --> 01:49:28,271
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened several weeks ago, or whenever we first got the HEPAs, some of the first ones that were deployed were put in the cafeterias.

1374
01:49:29,059 --> 01:49:33,342
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, as we move forward, it is New England, it's getting colder.

1375
01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:38,486
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would imagine even when it starts to rain or snow, eating outside is no longer going to be an option.

1376
01:49:38,666 --> 01:49:45,831
[SPEAKER_16]: So as far as eating in the cafeteria, we're putting in HEPA filters, which are great, and I'm sure that's going to improve the situation.

1377
01:49:46,492 --> 01:49:54,718
[SPEAKER_16]: But how do we know that if the cafeterias have not been tested yet, how do we know that we're putting enough HEPA filters in?

1378
01:49:55,675 --> 01:49:57,215
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, to me as a parent, that's a concern.

1379
01:49:57,235 --> 01:49:58,256
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like it's a gamble.

1380
01:49:58,276 --> 01:50:01,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we'll throw three or four and hopefully it does the job.

1381
01:50:01,196 --> 01:50:05,357
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you know, parents deserve answers to these questions.

1382
01:50:05,397 --> 01:50:08,378
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like, you know, and I understand it and you're frustrated.

1383
01:50:08,398 --> 01:50:13,259
[SPEAKER_16]: I think everyone's frustrated with it, but you know, we deserve answers.

1384
01:50:13,299 --> 01:50:14,499
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like, you know what?

1385
01:50:15,239 --> 01:50:20,160
[SPEAKER_16]: So a lot of these questions really, I feel like we're guessing at, you know, with regard to the answers.

1386
01:50:22,273 --> 01:50:35,156
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I said, for each room, based on the usage of the room, the cubic footage of the room, and the specifications of the HEPA filter, there is a formula that can essentially determine what the air change per hour rate is.

1387
01:50:35,616 --> 01:50:37,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's with things like windows closed.

1388
01:50:38,096 --> 01:50:43,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are other variables that can be changed that can enhance the air change and air exchange rate.

1389
01:50:43,537 --> 01:50:47,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is what's happening in the cafeterias to the best of my knowledge.

1390
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:51,339
[SPEAKER_16]: And the cafeteria is going to be tested at some point?

1391
01:50:52,162 --> 01:50:55,224
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, they were initially tested.

1392
01:50:55,244 --> 01:50:59,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the air changes rates were supplemented with the HEPA filters.

1393
01:50:59,527 --> 01:51:03,210
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the building will continue to be tested, particularly at the high school.

1394
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:12,677
[SPEAKER_03]: The testing will be ongoing for some time to make sure that we are both employing strategies that enhance the air quality and make sure that those strategies are sustainable.

1395
01:51:13,037 --> 01:51:13,237
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1396
01:51:13,397 --> 01:51:17,720
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, when I look at my report, unless I'm missing it, I don't think I see the cafeteria.

1397
01:51:19,101 --> 01:51:29,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Those don't, I think the cafeteria is in there if it's the latest report, but that report in that instance, doesn't factor in the use of the heifers in the cafeterias.

1398
01:51:29,705 --> 01:51:37,947
[SPEAKER_03]: When the use of the heifers are factored in, it does meet the high air quality standards based on the guidance we received from the experts.

1399
01:51:43,129 --> 01:51:48,151
[SPEAKER_16]: So as far as, so as I moved to the report, I also noticed that,

1400
01:51:50,142 --> 01:52:02,097
[SPEAKER_16]: the nurse, the nurse's office, that from what I can tell, if I look at this report, it looks like it doesn't look like any of that space passed.

1401
01:52:02,137 --> 01:52:02,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I correct?

1402
01:52:02,698 --> 01:52:05,802
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about the high school report, correct?

1403
01:52:05,982 --> 01:52:06,523
[SPEAKER_16]: You are correct.

1404
01:52:07,425 --> 01:52:25,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, my understanding is that the nurses office were beneath the standard of the heightened air quality standards and that was why the nurses offices across the district and even in nurses offices that are now exceeding the heightened air standards were keeping HEPA filters there due to the nature of the work that's taking place in those rooms.

1405
01:52:25,778 --> 01:52:28,100
[SPEAKER_16]: And have those rooms been retested with HEPA filters?

1406
01:52:29,832 --> 01:52:41,081
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they haven't been, not to my knowledge, no, they haven't been retested because they've been focusing on diagnosing the issues in the vocational areas to try to make sure that those systems are online as fast as possible.

1407
01:52:41,501 --> 01:52:43,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think we should be retesting the nurse's office?

1408
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:59,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if we have a formula that makes it clear that with the HEPA filters we're exceeding the height and air quality standards, and there's a limitation as to how much can be tested in one narrow set of time, I think it's important that we prioritize and establish a sequence in which

1409
01:53:00,282 --> 01:53:05,104
[SPEAKER_03]: we can try to have students into in-person instruction as fast as possible under the public health guidance.

1410
01:53:05,164 --> 01:53:07,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, again, I think the nurse's office has to be a priority.

1411
01:53:08,006 --> 01:53:24,834
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why even for the nurse's office that have exceeded the heightened air quality standards, we've deployed HEPA filters to those areas and we'll continue to do that and to retest the nurse's office and all other areas to make sure that the repairs that we're applying to the HVAC systems are working and are being effective.

1412
01:53:36,492 --> 01:53:41,495
[SPEAKER_16]: bathroom safe at the high school?

1413
01:53:43,095 --> 01:53:51,019
[SPEAKER_03]: There are bathrooms that are temporarily closed due to the assessment of the air quality and there are bathrooms that are open due to the assessment of the air quality.

1414
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:56,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's certainly many restrooms that are fully operational and open.

1415
01:53:57,443 --> 01:53:58,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you say many?

1416
01:53:58,223 --> 01:53:59,844
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some that are temporarily closed.

1417
01:54:02,625 --> 01:54:12,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I correct in saying that most of the space that's being utilized now by the students that are actually going to Medford High School are in the science wing?

1418
01:54:13,042 --> 01:54:29,325
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct, we've temporarily relocated several of the programs that are part of Cohort A, those are our high need, most vulnerable students, into the most newly renovated area of the high school due to the favorable data we had on the air exchange rates in those areas.

1419
01:54:29,365 --> 01:54:41,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of our special ed programs and our English language learner programs are currently in what was referred to as the science wing because that was the highest quality area we had with regard to air quality.

1420
01:54:44,103 --> 01:54:48,208
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can ask you a question going back to the beginning, why were the buildings tested so late?

1421
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:56,337
[SPEAKER_16]: The very beginning, we knew this was an airborne illness back in April, back in April of this year.

1422
01:54:58,199 --> 01:55:00,762
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think anyone came in to test anything until August.

1423
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:07,124
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not a formula for success, that's just too late.

1424
01:55:07,444 --> 01:55:16,892
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there are other school districts throughout the commonwealth that are back to school and they might not have their buildings at full capacity, but they're able to utilize their buildings.

1425
01:55:16,952 --> 01:55:20,915
[SPEAKER_16]: I would think that if we're out front, we started testing in the springtime.

1426
01:55:21,676 --> 01:55:37,764
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, when a lot of these companies probably had more capacity to, you know, give us more resources, we probably wouldn't have the opportunity to maybe get in front of this and actually, you know, get our kids into school if their parents are okay with that.

1427
01:55:37,784 --> 01:55:42,606
[SPEAKER_16]: So can you tell us a little bit about why this started so late?

1428
01:55:44,083 --> 01:55:50,068
[SPEAKER_16]: And this might even, this might even, this I think actually predates you, but if you could please answer that question.

1429
01:55:50,508 --> 01:56:01,657
[SPEAKER_03]: What I can speak to is that I'm in touch on a fairly regular basis with individuals at school districts that have positions similar or identical to mine and our timeline is not

1430
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:05,239
[SPEAKER_03]: well off from other districts.

1431
01:56:05,259 --> 01:56:09,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we find ourselves in relatively comparable situations.

1432
01:56:09,722 --> 01:56:23,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the understanding the nature and depth of these issues is something that given, I think this is true frankly for every walk of life right now, but that is the first worldwide pandemic any of us, most of us have lived through.

1433
01:56:23,949 --> 01:56:25,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's a variety of things that if

1434
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:32,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think any of us want to do this again, but if we ever did, I think we would do a number of things differently.

1435
01:56:32,115 --> 01:56:38,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's true for me, just in the two and a half months I've been here, I could make a long list of things I would probably do differently.

1436
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:50,152
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would just say, I find that our situation is relatively comparable to other districts in terms of the complexity of the issue and the urgency with which we're addressing it.

1437
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:55,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't have much more to offer that other than that.

1438
01:56:55,221 --> 01:56:57,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And that we're working as hard as we can.

1439
01:56:57,341 --> 01:57:01,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And we understand the frustration that's been expressed by some of the members tonight.

1440
01:57:02,282 --> 01:57:04,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expressed by members of the school committee.

1441
01:57:04,802 --> 01:57:15,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we recognize that both the city council and the committee, that frustration is being expressed as an echo of the frustration that people in the community are feeling because they want their kids in school.

1442
01:57:15,804 --> 01:57:17,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And there really is no counterpoint to that.

1443
01:57:18,124 --> 01:57:19,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids belong in school.

1444
01:57:19,065 --> 01:57:19,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We want them in school.

1445
01:57:19,965 --> 01:57:21,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do everything we can to get them there.

1446
01:57:24,556 --> 01:57:35,451
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, does the, does the board of health have any type of input as to, you know, the cafeterias being tested or not being tested, the bathrooms, that type of thing?

1447
01:57:35,491 --> 01:57:38,596
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, have they, have they given any input during this whole process?

1448
01:57:39,602 --> 01:57:49,951
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with the Board of Health closely and they've been an invaluable partner in ensuring that we're able to establish both our testing regime that we test all of our staff every week.

1449
01:57:51,252 --> 01:57:53,594
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll happen again tomorrow here at this building.

1450
01:57:54,114 --> 01:58:04,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also just as a partner in advising us in the development of the health metrics that will play a critical role in determining how we move forward with the continued implementation of the hybrid plan.

1451
01:58:04,423 --> 01:58:06,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So with regard to the testing specific,

1452
01:58:07,625 --> 01:58:09,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm extremely grateful for their support.

1453
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:35,834
[SPEAKER_16]: I still think at the end of the day, when you look at the cafeterias, I mean, I know you're talking about a formula, but I would think that these things need to be retested at some point in time.

1454
01:58:35,854 --> 01:58:44,157
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, as a parent, you want the, you know, the comfort of knowing, okay, you know what, they tested it, they retested it, it's finally up to the point where it passes.

1455
01:58:44,677 --> 01:58:51,960
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like, you know, I know you're saying, well, they have a formula and it shouldn't pass once we have these HEPA filters in, but I would think that, you know, I mean,

1456
01:58:54,212 --> 01:59:00,156
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to retest after the HEPA filters to get the comfort knowing, OK, you've got a good reading.

1457
01:59:00,176 --> 01:59:00,936
[SPEAKER_16]: We're ready to go.

1458
01:59:00,957 --> 01:59:07,681
[SPEAKER_16]: We can put our kids back in the classroom or back in the cafeteria or back in the Vogue, wherever it is.

1459
01:59:07,761 --> 01:59:10,884
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would think that there needs to be retesting at the end of the day.

1460
01:59:12,065 --> 01:59:14,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll direct them to retest it on Thursday.

1461
01:59:14,426 --> 01:59:16,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're back on Thursday.

1462
01:59:16,088 --> 01:59:18,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to have them retest that and circulate that information.

1463
01:59:19,230 --> 01:59:20,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that it is not.

1464
01:59:22,648 --> 01:59:29,352
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason it's not been retested is because there's a formula that tells us what the rating is and tells us that it's safe.

1465
01:59:29,873 --> 01:59:41,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, every amount of time they spend testing a cafeteria, it's time that they're not spending diagnosing problems in the vocational area and getting those units to a place where they can be retested and then reopened for students.

1466
01:59:41,981 --> 01:59:44,863
[SPEAKER_03]: But I certainly understand the point and

1467
01:59:45,623 --> 01:59:50,524
[SPEAKER_03]: the nature of the activity that takes place in the cafeteria, you do want to make sure you want to have a belt and suspense approach.

1468
01:59:50,704 --> 01:59:55,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have no objection at all to asking for a retest of the cafeterias later this week.

1469
01:59:55,965 --> 02:00:04,027
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I just, I know at the end of the day, as a parent, I want to make sure that the buildings are safe for my kids to go to school and for everyone's kids to go to school.

1470
02:00:04,627 --> 02:00:05,627
[SPEAKER_16]: And I like to see numbers.

1471
02:00:05,647 --> 02:00:06,588
[SPEAKER_16]: I like to see metrics.

1472
02:00:06,628 --> 02:00:11,109
[SPEAKER_16]: I like to see that the testing is being done and that these areas are actually passing the test.

1473
02:00:11,249 --> 02:00:12,149
[SPEAKER_16]: That means a lot to me.

1474
02:00:13,029 --> 02:00:20,434
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I don't want to just assume that, you know what, they've worked a formula and it looks like you're going to be able to eat lunch today and be safe.

1475
02:00:21,075 --> 02:00:25,978
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think the option should be in February eating on a snowbank because you've got to eat outside.

1476
02:00:25,998 --> 02:00:34,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we need to make sure that these buildings are tested, the air quality's there, it's at where it should be.

1477
02:00:34,504 --> 02:00:38,767
[SPEAKER_16]: And that as parents and as residents and as taxpayers, people feel safe about the buildings.

1478
02:00:40,162 --> 02:00:49,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally concur with that, and for that reason, as I did at the presentation of the school committee last night, I do have to say again that we have no reason to believe these areas are unsafe.

1479
02:00:50,009 --> 02:00:51,770
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford Public Schools are safe.

1480
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:54,892
[SPEAKER_03]: While we do have to adhere to the heightened air quality standards,

1481
02:00:55,192 --> 02:01:04,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And I fully take the point that we should make sure that we're producing the data necessary to give everyone the peace of mind that they are entitled to, and we will make sure that we continue to do that.

1482
02:01:04,661 --> 02:01:15,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want there to be a situation where a community member only hears a fraction of this conversation and draws the inaccurate conclusion that there's something unsafe about eating in a Medford Public Schools cafeteria.

1483
02:01:16,011 --> 02:01:17,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no basis to believe that that is true.

1484
02:01:18,213 --> 02:01:31,561
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of the experts who have looked at these situations and have applied the formulas that they are applying here in the higher ed context and in other school districts have confirmed that with the supplemental air exchange that we are creating through the HEPA filters those routes are in fact safe.

1485
02:01:32,602 --> 02:01:35,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay so we'll say it's we'll say they're just not ready.

1486
02:01:37,285 --> 02:01:42,530
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as the HEPA filters go, do you have enough HEPA filters for the high school and all the other schools?

1487
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:46,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I have a concern that we're going to be just rolling these things around in and out of rooms.

1488
02:01:47,854 --> 02:01:54,039
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely don't want the equivalent of art on a car with HEPA filters, with teachers needing to drag around the HEPA filters.

1489
02:01:54,119 --> 02:01:56,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree that that is something we have to be very, very careful about.

1490
02:01:56,901 --> 02:01:59,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems as though right now we're in relatively good shape.

1491
02:01:59,563 --> 02:02:05,126
[SPEAKER_03]: The supply line that had been causing some of the delays in the delivery seems to have accelerated over the last couple of weeks.

1492
02:02:05,166 --> 02:02:07,747
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, we are in relatively good shape.

1493
02:02:07,787 --> 02:02:15,571
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to get us in a position where I will feel very confident about that is making sure that the K-8 schools are fully online and their HVAC systems are functioning.

1494
02:02:15,631 --> 02:02:19,733
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of why our strategy has been to make sure that those issues are resolved.

1495
02:02:20,093 --> 02:02:27,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Because once we do that, we're going to not need as many HEPAs in some of the spaces that they're currently supplementing the air exchange rate at the elementary and middle schools.

1496
02:02:27,818 --> 02:02:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to be able to relocate those to the high school to add to the significant stockpile that we have here already.

1497
02:02:34,542 --> 02:02:42,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, that's when I'll feel more comfortable about being able to say that we're able to use as much of the facility as we need to to bring students in.

1498
02:02:43,388 --> 02:02:48,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the goal to basically have fresh air without opening a window?

1499
02:02:49,508 --> 02:02:58,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think the nature, as I think you've alluded to earlier tonight, running a school district in New England means that you can't rely on fresh air based on open windows.

1500
02:02:58,759 --> 02:03:02,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just, that's not something that we, that's not something we have a luxury to do.

1501
02:03:02,723 --> 02:03:07,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all of these numbers that we're talking about are tests that are done with the windows closed.

1502
02:03:08,995 --> 02:03:20,981
[SPEAKER_03]: With the windows open, frankly, even in an area where there's no HVAC system, the air change per hour rate, as a general rule, is not a problem.

1503
02:03:21,001 --> 02:03:28,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is another reason why the data alone in those reports is not sufficient to draw conclusions about the safety of these roads or the schools.

1504
02:03:29,926 --> 02:03:36,830
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as the, can you say with any confidence that kids will be back

1505
02:03:38,315 --> 02:03:42,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you say with any confidence that you think kids will be back at Memphis High School by the end of the year?

1506
02:03:42,641 --> 02:03:46,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's our job to make sure that that happens.

1507
02:03:50,011 --> 02:03:50,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1508
02:03:50,111 --> 02:03:53,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if my colleagues have any other questions.

1509
02:03:55,274 --> 02:03:56,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1510
02:03:56,095 --> 02:03:57,157
[SPEAKER_19]: Congressman Scott Pelley.

1511
02:03:58,118 --> 02:03:58,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1512
02:03:59,781 --> 02:04:02,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Murphy, thank you for taking these questions.

1513
02:04:02,264 --> 02:04:08,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the frustration sometimes parents reach out to us because we do have

1514
02:04:10,817 --> 02:04:15,480
[SPEAKER_04]: school age children and they feel the same pain.

1515
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:21,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that if you can, again, please check on that Roberts Kindergarten.

1516
02:04:22,885 --> 02:04:30,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if that's accurate, if those kindergartens or three classes are in their classrooms.

1517
02:04:31,410 --> 02:04:31,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1518
02:04:33,151 --> 02:04:38,836
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're seeing now is some of the other information we're talking about is really making sure people are informed.

1519
02:04:39,937 --> 02:04:41,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I had a great conversation today with Ms.

1520
02:04:41,758 --> 02:04:44,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Shulman, who's the head of guidance right now.

1521
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:52,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe talk with Mr. DeLaver and the principal at the high school and really allow him to

1522
02:04:55,527 --> 02:04:59,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that he was notorious for two a week and was very informative.

1523
02:05:00,589 --> 02:05:06,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the things that parents or seniors are saying, the SATs went well today.

1524
02:05:07,911 --> 02:05:11,171
[SPEAKER_04]: We did have some parents that didn't know about it for one reason or another.

1525
02:05:11,191 --> 02:05:13,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have another.

1526
02:05:14,774 --> 02:05:23,526
[SPEAKER_04]: senior evening on Thursday night that some parents don't know anything about with the guidance department to update those seniors.

1527
02:05:23,587 --> 02:05:28,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's a very stressful time right now, and I only say that right now, that it's important because.

1528
02:05:28,734 --> 02:05:33,935
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking early decision is due on Friday, and there's some easiness.

1529
02:05:33,975 --> 02:05:48,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can stress that back to your administration and your organization to really try to find a way to get more information out to make sure that while they're not in school, that they're informed of what's happening.

1530
02:05:48,377 --> 02:05:49,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much.

1531
02:05:49,678 --> 02:05:50,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate your time, Mr. Marchion.

1532
02:05:52,118 --> 02:05:53,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1533
02:05:53,958 --> 02:05:54,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Beast.

1534
02:05:54,999 --> 02:05:57,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.

1535
02:05:58,721 --> 02:06:05,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave, Mr. Murphy, I want to ask you some questions about the CARES Act funds.

1536
02:06:06,087 --> 02:06:16,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there was a release that $1.6 million or so, maybe a little bit more than that, was spent on the schools out of the $5 million total that we've received here as a city.

1537
02:06:17,035 --> 02:06:20,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Has any additional money been spent on the schools beyond that $1.6 million?

1538
02:06:24,446 --> 02:06:25,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Ms.

1539
02:06:25,607 --> 02:06:29,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Lumley is on the call as well and may want to add to my answer.

1540
02:06:31,192 --> 02:06:50,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we initially sought the appropriation of the $116,000 that was originally earmarked for capital improvements, it was our intention to use that funding to some of the capital work that is necessary in order to meet the height and air quality standards that we've been discussing tonight.

1541
02:06:51,033 --> 02:07:00,318
[SPEAKER_03]: The variable that changed between the time that that authorization was made and now is that the timeline for the use of the CARES Act funding was accelerated.

1542
02:07:00,979 --> 02:07:19,090
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of that, and due to the eligibility of the expenses that were identified that were necessary for HVAC and the consultancy work that was necessary, and testing that was necessary, and the HEPA filter procurement that we've discussed tonight,

1543
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:26,434
[SPEAKER_03]: We determined that it would be more prudent to use the CARES Act funding for those expenses.

1544
02:07:26,834 --> 02:07:34,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are in the process of making sure that that's well organized so that we have a full read of as to what all of those expenses are.

1545
02:07:34,659 --> 02:07:39,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is going to be charged to those CARES Act accounts.

1546
02:07:40,022 --> 02:08:07,262
[SPEAKER_03]: because we're on such a short timeline, that puts us in a position where the capital improvement funding that you authorized, that you authorized in either the last week of August or the first week of September, that was subject to the discussion that we're having now, that funding will be available for the more significant, and hopefully, not exclusively this, but it will be available for the more significant HVAC repairs that reasonably will need to occur

1547
02:08:08,082 --> 02:08:15,203
[SPEAKER_03]: in order to make the work that we've done now to get the schools reopened sustainable for this year and going forward.

1548
02:08:15,243 --> 02:08:30,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So the answer to your question is with regard to the CARES Act funding, again, there's nothing I suspect walked through with greater specificity, in part because my screens are now loaded up with windows that I opened to try to get you the webpage so you can see the folders with the reports.

1549
02:08:32,626 --> 02:08:36,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a focus on procurement, vendors for both electrical and HVAC,

1550
02:08:37,207 --> 02:08:53,215
[SPEAKER_03]: repairs necessary to meet the heightened air quality standards and the consultants and test and environmental and industrial hygienists and environmental engineers that are coming in to do the work in order to assess where we are and where we need to go from an air quality perspective.

1551
02:08:53,676 --> 02:09:01,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Well just before we do that, is that in addition to the 1.6 million that was in a press release or a patch article a couple months ago?

1552
02:09:03,195 --> 02:09:07,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that my reading that I just referenced would be in addition to that, yes.

1553
02:09:07,279 --> 02:09:08,300
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to, okay.

1554
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:12,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may be for you or for Alicia and only Benjamin.

1555
02:09:13,904 --> 02:09:20,110
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of the 3.4 million, you know, that was not allocated to schools, how much of that has been spent or unspent?

1556
02:09:20,150 --> 02:09:25,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's my understanding that the expenditure deadline for these CARES Act funds is this Friday.

1557
02:09:25,954 --> 02:09:27,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would hope that we are getting

1558
02:09:28,708 --> 02:09:33,189
[SPEAKER_00]: that money out the door to address these issues, so how much is remaining unspent?

1559
02:09:33,209 --> 02:09:39,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I heard the term not with the schools, so that means it's my turn to defer.

1560
02:09:39,691 --> 02:09:47,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if it's with the schools or not, but whatever the 3.4 million or less that remains other than what's been released to the public.

1561
02:09:49,274 --> 02:09:50,194
[SPEAKER_19]: Alicia, can you answer that?

1562
02:09:51,575 --> 02:09:52,535
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

1563
02:10:00,759 --> 02:10:06,864
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm Alicia Benjamin, Finance Director for the City of Medford, 85 George P. Hess Drive, Medford, Massachusetts.

1564
02:10:07,525 --> 02:10:09,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Honorable Counselors.

1565
02:10:09,186 --> 02:10:15,031
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been working closely with David Murphy, actually, a lot.

1566
02:10:15,571 --> 02:10:25,099
[SPEAKER_20]: And for the CARES Act money, we were let know that there's $150,000 capital improvement cap, which actually is, the schools are exempt from that for their HVAC.

1567
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:27,921
[SPEAKER_20]: because of CDC guidelines for the air.

1568
02:10:28,681 --> 02:10:37,304
[SPEAKER_20]: So he and I have been working really, really hard to try to get all that data, all the stuff that he spent, everything encumbered in time to meet the deadline for Friday.

1569
02:10:37,904 --> 02:10:39,965
[SPEAKER_20]: So he's been working extremely hard to get that done.

1570
02:10:40,605 --> 02:10:41,925
[SPEAKER_20]: That's still a work in process.

1571
02:10:41,965 --> 02:10:45,526
[SPEAKER_20]: I've moved some of the POs over that they have.

1572
02:10:45,606 --> 02:10:50,408
[SPEAKER_20]: I've moved some of their expenditures, but I'm going to have all of their expenditures to meet by Thursday.

1573
02:10:51,570 --> 02:10:52,770
[SPEAKER_20]: So he's been working very diligently.

1574
02:10:53,011 --> 02:11:01,054
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can give the numbers, the actual true figures to council by next week, because I don't have the whole thing in cupboard and moved until Thursday.

1575
02:11:01,534 --> 02:11:03,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Just an estimate, we got 5 million total.

1576
02:11:03,835 --> 02:11:10,337
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are we leaving money on the table if the deadline is this Friday and an estimate of how much we might be leaving on the table?

1577
02:11:12,638 --> 02:11:14,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, as of right now, so we were awarded $5,093,008.

1578
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:19,921
[SPEAKER_20]: last year $132,155.

1579
02:11:19,961 --> 02:11:21,162
[SPEAKER_20]: We uncovered $65,756.22 at the end of the year.

1580
02:11:21,222 --> 02:11:23,924
[SPEAKER_20]: And then in fiscal year 21, we've uncovered $1,357,866.74.

1581
02:11:23,984 --> 02:11:24,564
[SPEAKER_20]: We've expended $361,685.86.

1582
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:49,372
[SPEAKER_20]: So as of right now, I don't have all of their expenses, but we've expended over $2 million.

1583
02:11:49,853 --> 02:11:50,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1584
02:11:50,234 --> 02:11:54,662
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the deadline is Friday, that leaves $3 million that we haven't spent.

1585
02:11:55,779 --> 02:11:57,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, for Friday is my drawdown.

1586
02:11:57,940 --> 02:12:01,140
[SPEAKER_20]: So what I'm doing on Friday is I have to draw down based on an estimate.

1587
02:12:01,601 --> 02:12:09,083
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition to that, I also found out from them because in the beginning they had said that we could only take backfill for people who had COVID.

1588
02:12:09,103 --> 02:12:10,483
[SPEAKER_20]: We couldn't charge COVID costs.

1589
02:12:10,523 --> 02:12:13,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they're changing and saying we can charge back COVID costs.

1590
02:12:14,124 --> 02:12:16,665
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand that there's different targets and what

1591
02:12:34,339 --> 02:12:37,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you expect that you have $3 million in chart?

1592
02:12:38,262 --> 02:12:43,585
[SPEAKER_00]: That just seems unreasonable to me, that you would come up with $3 million in the next week.

1593
02:12:43,625 --> 02:12:47,108
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not a task that should be put on you on such a short timeline.

1594
02:12:47,148 --> 02:12:49,249
[SPEAKER_00]: But are we losing that money?

1595
02:12:49,269 --> 02:12:53,672
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I think that, honestly, the way this is set up is very unusual.

1596
02:12:54,553 --> 02:12:57,195
[SPEAKER_20]: Most grants, when you have a grant, they're on a reimbursement basis.

1597
02:12:57,875 --> 02:13:01,578
[SPEAKER_20]: So spend it, and then you would do a report at the end and get your money pulled in.

1598
02:13:03,258 --> 02:13:09,282
[SPEAKER_20]: What I'm doing is I'm constantly estimating what I believe I'm going to expend, not what I'm actually expending.

1599
02:13:09,342 --> 02:13:14,806
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm taking my actuals and then I'm taking estimates, and that's what I'm giving to the government to get money back.

1600
02:13:15,447 --> 02:13:18,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Then they're saying to me, okay, do that in October 30th.

1601
02:13:18,249 --> 02:13:19,270
[SPEAKER_20]: You've got to do that right now.

1602
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:20,811
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the same time, they're telling FEMA.

1603
02:13:21,331 --> 02:13:23,092
[SPEAKER_20]: FEMA, you do that by October 15th.

1604
02:13:23,272 --> 02:13:27,334
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even know what FEMA is covering versus what CARES is covering.

1605
02:13:27,694 --> 02:13:31,636
[SPEAKER_20]: So there could be costs that are rejected on the level from FEMA that has to go back to CARES.

1606
02:13:32,236 --> 02:13:34,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Then I have to do a report in November.

1607
02:13:34,477 --> 02:13:36,318
[SPEAKER_20]: Then I do another report in December.

1608
02:13:36,819 --> 02:13:37,779
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a lot.

1609
02:13:37,919 --> 02:13:41,061
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not very clear cut, to be completely honest with you, Councilor.

1610
02:13:41,101 --> 02:13:41,661
[SPEAKER_20]: This is not

1611
02:13:43,083 --> 02:13:45,525
[SPEAKER_20]: the usual way I've ever seen a grant managed or done.

1612
02:13:45,925 --> 02:13:52,730
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just following the guidelines of the federal government and what we're being told on a municipal level how to do this as sub-recipients of the Commonwealth.

1613
02:13:53,251 --> 02:14:01,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Well certainly the federal government has failed us, but I mean, again, I mean, I'm a little baffled.

1614
02:14:01,597 --> 02:14:08,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any way that those numbers are going to end up adding up to $5 million, or do you expect that we will be leaving some amount of money on the table at the end of this process?

1615
02:14:09,817 --> 02:14:17,960
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, our hopes were in the beginning when we come to you during the budgetary process that we could use something less as a stimulus for a revenue offset, which the government never did.

1616
02:14:18,793 --> 02:14:24,576
[SPEAKER_20]: So now we're in the place where if we don't spend it, we could possibly have to return those funds.

1617
02:14:24,676 --> 02:14:29,859
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we're doing is we're trying to expend it as fast as possible using the guidelines.

1618
02:14:29,919 --> 02:14:34,242
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very, very, very strict on how we can use those funds.

1619
02:14:34,302 --> 02:14:41,526
[SPEAKER_20]: So they actually have us fill out a form that I send in to a liaison that tells me what's eligible and what's not eligible based on what we're spending.

1620
02:14:42,159 --> 02:14:47,243
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's kind of a complex process I've been managing and trying to get through.

1621
02:14:47,744 --> 02:14:56,130
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've been managing it with the schools, trying to get the schools covered as best they can to make sure that they can get all their needs covered while also covering all the needs of the city.

1622
02:14:56,311 --> 02:14:57,652
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly appreciate that, Alicia.

1623
02:14:57,672 --> 02:14:59,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm about to say has nothing to do with you.

1624
02:14:59,533 --> 02:15:00,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have an impossible task.

1625
02:15:01,034 --> 02:15:03,236
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like we gambled and we lost here.

1626
02:15:03,697 --> 02:15:06,159
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we might be able to use this money to cover a deficit.

1627
02:15:06,199 --> 02:15:06,599
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not.

1628
02:15:06,679 --> 02:15:08,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're leaving money on the table.

1629
02:15:08,481 --> 02:15:10,642
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a huge mistake by the administration.

1630
02:15:10,662 --> 02:15:11,323
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's putting you

1631
02:15:11,850 --> 02:15:16,091
[SPEAKER_00]: and our city departments and our school system in an impossible position right now.

1632
02:15:16,291 --> 02:15:19,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a disaster, in my opinion.

1633
02:15:21,932 --> 02:15:25,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes to another point, which I'd redirect back at Mr. Murphy.

1634
02:15:26,653 --> 02:15:32,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency, clarity, and transparency are essential across all of these decisions, right?

1635
02:15:33,595 --> 02:15:40,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's HVAC or reopening or hybrid, we need consistent, clear, and transparent communication

1636
02:15:40,824 --> 02:15:53,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there ever a proposal or was the mayor ever amenable or the city administration ever amenable to using CARES Act funding or other supplemental funding to increase our communications capacity?

1637
02:15:53,914 --> 02:15:56,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my understanding is that we have people doing four jobs.

1638
02:15:56,896 --> 02:15:59,097
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's focused specifically on communication.

1639
02:15:59,538 --> 02:16:01,519
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the perfect example of it tonight.

1640
02:16:01,559 --> 02:16:03,661
[SPEAKER_00]: We clicked something on the city website and it took us to a 404.

1641
02:16:03,821 --> 02:16:06,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, where is it?

1642
02:16:07,443 --> 02:16:09,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Has there been any plan or proposal

1643
02:16:10,230 --> 02:16:20,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Or has it been rejected to increase the communications capacity of the school system to address some of these communications issues that have been rampant?

1644
02:16:20,796 --> 02:16:24,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's been significantly discussed at school committee.

1645
02:16:24,933 --> 02:16:26,455
[SPEAKER_00]: The school committee can only do so much.

1646
02:16:26,515 --> 02:16:31,419
[SPEAKER_00]: It really needs to be the staff, and it needs to be this administration, the city administration, accepting that.

1647
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:43,171
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just would like to hear if there's been any discussion or proposals for increased communication staff that has been accepted by the city administration using the emergency funding from the CARES Act.

1648
02:16:44,051 --> 02:16:48,175
[SPEAKER_20]: If I could interject on that one, if that's OK, Councilors?

1649
02:16:48,235 --> 02:16:48,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1650
02:16:49,634 --> 02:16:56,982
[SPEAKER_20]: the eligibility would be at hand, I'd have to ask, can we use that vacation?

1651
02:16:58,204 --> 02:17:06,493
[SPEAKER_20]: They're very adamant about us using it for certain things, such as you can use it for personnel to assist with hybrid things, but you can't use it for this.

1652
02:17:06,553 --> 02:17:08,055
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can use it for this, but you can't.

1653
02:17:08,195 --> 02:17:10,178
[SPEAKER_20]: They're very, very stringent on their rules.

1654
02:17:11,003 --> 02:17:15,950
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's not as easy as Dave Murphy just saying, OK, I want to use CARES Act funding, Alicia, for this.

1655
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:21,136
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually have to go back to our federal state liaison to see if that's even an eligible expense for him to use it.

1656
02:17:22,158 --> 02:17:25,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Has that question been asked of you about communications staff, Alicia?

1657
02:17:26,322 --> 02:17:28,763
[SPEAKER_20]: Dave Murphy has come to me for staffing questions.

1658
02:17:29,103 --> 02:17:38,065
[SPEAKER_20]: He has, especially when it comes to education and the kids and backfill and any way he could get additional staffing for his hybrid model, which was yes.

1659
02:17:39,025 --> 02:17:46,207
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as communication specifically, that wasn't exactly what we had discussed, but we have been discussing personnel and backfilling.

1660
02:17:46,227 --> 02:17:50,128
[SPEAKER_20]: But as you know, the CARES Act ends December 29th, or December 30th, so really,

1661
02:17:52,287 --> 02:17:56,629
[SPEAKER_20]: even if we got things in place, it's only going to be for a couple of months and then that funding ends.

1662
02:17:56,949 --> 02:17:57,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right.

1663
02:17:57,429 --> 02:17:58,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hear that.

1664
02:18:01,210 --> 02:18:06,632
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying in June, you know, we've had a summer and a fall where communication hasn't been what it needs to be.

1665
02:18:06,732 --> 02:18:19,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand their specifics, but I would, it seems like the federal, I mean, are you calling the federal liaison and they're saying yes or no to every specific item or is that how this is working on your end?

1666
02:18:20,026 --> 02:18:26,114
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually have to go online into a form, fill in the form, and submit it that way to get any of my questions answered.

1667
02:18:26,494 --> 02:18:26,815
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1668
02:18:27,115 --> 02:18:30,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, I think that's been a huge area in question.

1669
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:34,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's been raised by the school committee, by parents, by the community.

1670
02:18:36,378 --> 02:18:46,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that there can be some effort put into increasing the communications capacity of Medford Public Schools, as people have been talking about extensively, because it's needed.

1671
02:18:46,625 --> 02:18:53,530
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have assistant superintendents and superintendents doing the job of communications and their own job and the job of assistants and secretaries.

1672
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:54,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is just not sustainable.

1673
02:18:54,971 --> 02:18:59,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the people on this call know it best, because they're the ones who are experiencing it.

1674
02:19:00,514 --> 02:19:02,736
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, my last question was just going to be,

1675
02:19:03,642 --> 02:19:07,890
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where do we go if the map turns red tomorrow, what happens?

1676
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:11,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an answer for that, Mr. Murphy?

1677
02:19:13,854 --> 02:19:23,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the event that the community is declared in the red category, I anticipate that we will continue to have in-person instruction.

1678
02:19:23,741 --> 02:19:25,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are caveats to that.

1679
02:19:26,042 --> 02:19:34,628
[SPEAKER_03]: If the red is caused by an outbreak or if there's evidence of in-school transmission, that's something obviously we'll have to look at very, very closely.

1680
02:19:34,688 --> 02:19:42,013
[SPEAKER_03]: But as Commissioner Riley stated today, it is the expectation of DESE, and I think it's inconsistent with

1681
02:19:43,114 --> 02:19:48,619
[SPEAKER_03]: The mandate by the community to keep students in school has provided that it's safe.

1682
02:19:49,940 --> 02:20:00,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the public health guidance that we have and the data that we have, I don't anticipate that we would immediately cease in-person instruction solely because the community goes into the red.

1683
02:20:00,329 --> 02:20:03,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we will continue to look at the metrics every single week.

1684
02:20:04,738 --> 02:20:16,262
[SPEAKER_03]: The virus transmission rates will absolutely be a factor in the superintendent's decision as to whether to maintain in-person instruction and whether to continue the progression of the implementation of the hybrid program.

1685
02:20:16,722 --> 02:20:25,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But a red designation alone will not be sufficient to cease in-person instruction.

1686
02:20:25,725 --> 02:20:32,527
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing I'll say very quickly with regard to the communication issue, I just want the council to know and the community to know that

1687
02:20:32,973 --> 02:20:36,217
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us see communication as something that has an organization.

1688
02:20:36,557 --> 02:20:38,199
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be continuously improving.

1689
02:20:38,499 --> 02:20:41,443
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have staff that are dedicated to communication.

1690
02:20:41,883 --> 02:20:47,349
[SPEAKER_03]: They work extremely hard, as do our people on the instructional side, as people do on the operational side.

1691
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:49,592
[SPEAKER_03]: But for those of us in leadership roles,

1692
02:20:50,348 --> 02:20:55,253
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a responsibility to communicate effectively with the community and to keep the community informed.

1693
02:20:55,613 --> 02:21:07,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I'm presenting in front of you and a website doesn't work and therefore I can't effectively convey to you the instructions that people need to get to the information that they need, then that's on me.

1694
02:21:08,125 --> 02:21:11,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get the point that you're saying that we all can't wear a million different hats.

1695
02:21:11,844 --> 02:21:18,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Frankly, when you're in a role like assistant superintendent or superintendent, all of us are being paid to wear multiple hats.

1696
02:21:18,549 --> 02:21:20,370
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is just the nature of our roles.

1697
02:21:20,830 --> 02:21:22,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something we have to do better.

1698
02:21:22,952 --> 02:21:28,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want there to be any misunderstanding as to the degree to which all of us, our team, is aware of that.

1699
02:21:29,396 --> 02:21:32,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mr. Murphy, I mean, I appreciate that, and I understand it.

1700
02:21:32,238 --> 02:21:35,460
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can wear four hats.

1701
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:36,701
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't wear 40 hats.

1702
02:21:36,941 --> 02:21:39,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a clear capacity issue here.

1703
02:21:39,657 --> 02:21:46,202
[SPEAKER_00]: a clear need has been outlined at very many school committee meetings for increased communication even prior to COVID-19.

1704
02:21:46,222 --> 02:21:49,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to put that.

1705
02:21:50,026 --> 02:21:50,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree with that.

1706
02:21:50,846 --> 02:21:52,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's our responsibility and we have to do it better.

1707
02:21:53,268 --> 02:21:53,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1708
02:21:53,549 --> 02:21:54,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.

1709
02:21:54,349 --> 02:21:59,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's also responsibility of the city administration and the people who make the budget to make that a priority.

1710
02:22:01,635 --> 02:22:12,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, I don't envy you having to work with Commissioner Riley, who's flip-flopping back and forth every other day on what DESI means or doesn't mean, or how big of a bully or a gangster they're going to be this week.

1711
02:22:12,199 --> 02:22:18,981
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do... Sure, I quoted him from this afternoon, so I might have to go back and check.

1712
02:22:19,021 --> 02:22:22,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I don't envy at all, but I will just say,

1713
02:22:22,942 --> 02:22:25,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that just going back into the red doesn't mean that.

1714
02:22:25,603 --> 02:22:32,327
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the wastewater results and the number of tests per day, we are headed quickly back into a COVID surge.

1715
02:22:32,427 --> 02:22:41,212
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think, again, the consistency, clarity, and transparency of your communication around that is going to be essential whatever happens.

1716
02:22:41,392 --> 02:22:43,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that resources are available.

1717
02:22:43,993 --> 02:22:50,197
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we're not leaving thousands or millions of dollars on the table to address those challenges.

1718
02:22:50,497 --> 02:22:50,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1719
02:22:51,505 --> 02:22:52,426
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Beas.

1720
02:22:52,466 --> 02:22:53,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Council Member Rowe.

1721
02:22:54,808 --> 02:22:55,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1722
02:22:56,149 --> 02:23:00,493
[SPEAKER_12]: I thank my fellow councilors for their extensive questioning, so I really don't have many questions left.

1723
02:23:01,193 --> 02:23:02,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Just have one question for Ms.

1724
02:23:02,274 --> 02:23:02,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Nunley and Benjamin.

1725
02:23:03,015 --> 02:23:10,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Just for my own edification, could you remind me when the city was alerted of the CARES funding we were receiving, the amount we were getting?

1726
02:23:10,101 --> 02:23:12,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

1727
02:23:12,362 --> 02:23:13,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Rowe, could you clarify your question?

1728
02:23:13,724 --> 02:23:14,304
[SPEAKER_20]: I apologize.

1729
02:23:14,644 --> 02:23:16,446
[SPEAKER_12]: When were we told of the amount we were receiving?

1730
02:23:16,486 --> 02:23:19,388
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the date we got the information about that $5 million?

1731
02:23:21,087 --> 02:23:23,088
[SPEAKER_12]: How long have we known that we had access to that?

1732
02:23:23,108 --> 02:23:25,949
[SPEAKER_20]: It was fiscal year 20.

1733
02:23:26,229 --> 02:23:29,390
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that.

1734
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:35,632
[SPEAKER_20]: But what also was frustrating to me is, as Councilor Beeson said, the rules just keep changing.

1735
02:23:35,692 --> 02:23:42,854
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're being told we can't use the funds one way, and now we're being told we can't use the funds that way.

1736
02:23:45,265 --> 02:23:46,286
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a little frustrating.

1737
02:23:46,486 --> 02:23:48,707
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd love to give you the exact date, Councilor, but I didn't.

1738
02:23:48,867 --> 02:23:51,328
[SPEAKER_20]: I brought all my numbers, but not the award letter.

1739
02:23:51,628 --> 02:23:53,329
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, but it's been several months?

1740
02:23:54,510 --> 02:23:55,851
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's been a few months.

1741
02:23:55,931 --> 02:23:59,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Because when we did the budget, we came up with a four-year honorable body.

1742
02:23:59,292 --> 02:24:02,434
[SPEAKER_20]: And we were hoping that we could use it as an offset.

1743
02:24:02,454 --> 02:24:05,396
[SPEAKER_20]: When we found out, we were going to wait until August, we told you.

1744
02:24:05,936 --> 02:24:09,518
[SPEAKER_20]: And when we didn't hear back, we just started using the funding as much as possible.

1745
02:24:09,598 --> 02:24:11,419
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what we've been doing.

1746
02:24:11,659 --> 02:24:13,440
[SPEAKER_20]: And then on top of that, we've been told

1747
02:24:14,067 --> 02:24:17,976
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, now you can capture things from fiscal year 20 that originally I hadn't captured.

1748
02:24:18,016 --> 02:24:19,399
[SPEAKER_20]: So now I'm actually able to go back.

1749
02:24:20,412 --> 02:24:26,953
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we're going to have a lot of frustration right now.

1750
02:24:27,613 --> 02:24:29,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1751
02:24:30,774 --> 02:24:31,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1752
02:24:31,794 --> 02:24:33,055
[SPEAKER_12]: And then question for Mister Murphy.

1753
02:24:33,135 --> 02:24:42,416
[SPEAKER_12]: So you were discussing mentioned essentially the $800,000 that I guess we're getting an update on tonight actually hasn't been applied yet because the cares funding is being applied in the 800,000 is being

1754
02:24:51,658 --> 02:24:52,959
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very fair question.

1755
02:24:53,019 --> 02:25:09,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a specific timeline, but I can tell you that there will need to be a sense of urgency because the work that we're doing right now, while it is a good strategy and a safe strategy, it has not been billed to me as a long-term sustainable strategy.

1756
02:25:09,984 --> 02:25:21,013
[SPEAKER_03]: with regard to making sure that our VAVs, which for those who are not familiar with it, and if this is, I'm the only one who wasn't prior to all this, I apologize, but essentially a computerized Q&A.

1757
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:27,716
[SPEAKER_03]: that allows, that controls our dampers, that determines how much air is coming into a room.

1758
02:25:28,456 --> 02:25:30,898
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a need for those to be recalibrated.

1759
02:25:30,918 --> 02:25:36,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of three sort of buckets of work that will need to happen in the near future.

1760
02:25:36,404 --> 02:25:44,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would anticipate it would be in the course of this fiscal year that we will be identifying a specific scope of work and

1761
02:25:45,712 --> 02:25:47,553
[SPEAKER_03]: the process of doing that work.

1762
02:25:48,254 --> 02:25:51,756
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't have, I don't know whether that's measured in weeks or months at this point.

1763
02:25:52,076 --> 02:25:56,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I just would say that I definitely think it needs to begin during this, the course of this fiscal year.

1764
02:25:57,180 --> 02:26:05,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so if we're looking at this fiscal year, then it's conceivable the work, I mean, the school year essentially ends the same time around as the fiscal year.

1765
02:26:05,145 --> 02:26:08,748
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be implemented or started or

1766
02:26:10,598 --> 02:26:15,981
[SPEAKER_03]: this work does not work generally speaking that needs to be completed in order to have students in the building.

1767
02:26:16,162 --> 02:26:19,144
[SPEAKER_03]: We're bringing students in the building while identifying these issues.

1768
02:26:19,444 --> 02:26:25,068
[SPEAKER_03]: We've essentially triaged a number of problems and have applied

1769
02:26:25,568 --> 02:26:37,692
[SPEAKER_03]: what our, it's probably not accurate to call it a band-aid because these are more than really, really short-term solutions, but they're not solutions that are going to put us in a position where we don't have to do this work for another five or 10 years.

1770
02:26:37,972 --> 02:26:41,914
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of work that has to take place, as I understand, during the course of the next year.

1771
02:26:42,694 --> 02:26:43,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1772
02:26:43,534 --> 02:26:43,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1773
02:26:43,894 --> 02:26:44,434
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I have.

1774
02:26:44,454 --> 02:26:45,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1775
02:26:45,335 --> 02:26:48,456
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1776
02:26:48,516 --> 02:26:52,077
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make it clear for everyone outside, all the people that are listening, that

1777
02:26:52,632 --> 02:26:55,054
[SPEAKER_20]: We weren't spending the CARES Act from day one.

1778
02:26:55,074 --> 02:27:01,660
[SPEAKER_20]: We just weren't rapidly spending it because we were hoping that they would give us some stimulus by August, but they didn't.

1779
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:12,428
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's when we started rapidly spending, but we've been spending CARES Act all the way through based on our needs for the city, as far as PPE, gloves, technology, technology for the school.

1780
02:27:12,469 --> 02:27:14,350
[SPEAKER_20]: So expenditures have been occurring the entire time.

1781
02:27:16,312 --> 02:27:16,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1782
02:27:17,112 --> 02:27:17,653
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Locks.

1783
02:27:18,769 --> 02:27:19,790
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1784
02:27:19,810 --> 02:27:26,253
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to thank Council President Falco for bringing this very important issue forward tonight.

1785
02:27:26,894 --> 02:27:29,475
[SPEAKER_25]: I know my council colleagues asked a lot of questions.

1786
02:27:30,476 --> 02:27:44,244
[SPEAKER_25]: I do want to say on the lines of Councilor Beers that if we do indeed leave money on the table, that would be a complete disgrace to leave any money on the table.

1787
02:27:48,026 --> 02:28:09,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Knowing what we know now, Dave, I know you've just been around for a little period of time, but I have a tough time believing over the years that we have not identified through our building grounds and maintenance the need to make updates to exhaust fans, ventilation, HVAC, and so forth.

1788
02:28:10,205 --> 02:28:15,209
[SPEAKER_25]: These issues, issues that have been recognized over the previous years,

1789
02:28:18,437 --> 02:28:42,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say I have a limited amount of knowledge as to what's happened historically, but my understanding as to everything I've been able to learn in the period of time that I've been here, there have been some priorities that haven't, there's always competing priorities, so anytime there was an infrastructure related priority that was not at the forefront

1790
02:28:42,812 --> 02:28:58,372
[SPEAKER_03]: from a budgetary perspective, I'm sure that there were a set of instructional priorities that were, and I'm sure vice versa were true, but I'm just candidly I'm making that observation more based on just general municipal and school administration experience than I am specific to Medford.

1791
02:28:58,731 --> 02:29:12,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there are definitely issues with roof fan, exhaust fans, and again, the VAP calibration point that I raised earlier that have been identified and now have a different sense of urgency behind them.

1792
02:29:13,966 --> 02:29:32,823
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, so what I'm hearing tonight is that the school district has been aware for many years that they've had some non-instructional reasons that there may be concerns with portions of our buildings, but those particular items have been

1793
02:29:33,544 --> 02:29:38,846
[SPEAKER_25]: kick down, push down the list of priorities for other priorities.

1794
02:29:39,467 --> 02:29:49,832
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think what we're seeing right now and part of the frustration is, and this is no reflection on you in particular, Dave, or the superintendent, or the school committee.

1795
02:29:49,852 --> 02:30:00,857
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think when we look at lack of maintenance within our buildings, and this is not exclusive to the school department because the city side is at fault as well.

1796
02:30:01,577 --> 02:30:07,359
[SPEAKER_25]: We've always kicked the can down the street when it comes to building maintenance and upkeep.

1797
02:30:07,959 --> 02:30:18,763
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think what we're seeing right now is a system that is plagued with a lot of concerns.

1798
02:30:18,783 --> 02:30:23,785
[SPEAKER_25]: And concerns that should have been addressed over the years, now are being addressed because of COVID.

1799
02:30:24,425 --> 02:30:42,159
[SPEAKER_25]: So the one thing that we did get out of COVID was the fact that, in my opinion, these building maintenance concerns, which get brought up every year, and why we don't allocate a certain amount of money to address these needs, because it gets pushed off.

1800
02:30:42,839 --> 02:30:46,762
[SPEAKER_25]: I think this was, if anything, a great learning experience.

1801
02:30:47,543 --> 02:30:52,046
[SPEAKER_25]: And I hope it doesn't become any other experience other than a learning experience at this point.

1802
02:30:53,327 --> 02:31:16,744
[SPEAKER_25]: But the question I have, Dave, is do we anticipate, and this may be a question for Alicia, and I know it's tough to tell, do we anticipate any additional funding, knowing that some of the money's going to dry up at the end of this month, and then we heard at the end of December, do we anticipate any additional funding to address the air quality concerns that are being addressed now?

1803
02:31:18,807 --> 02:31:19,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1804
02:31:19,748 --> 02:31:31,697
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, the administration's working on an extensive five-year capital improvement plan, which takes into account maintenance and projects, all different projects throughout the city, including the schools.

1805
02:31:32,497 --> 02:31:32,677
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1806
02:31:33,118 --> 02:31:46,748
[SPEAKER_25]: And are we able to tap into any of this particular CARES Act money or stimulus money that may be available to address this capital plan that the school committee and the administration is looking at?

1807
02:31:47,699 --> 02:31:51,520
[SPEAKER_20]: The capital plan was actually funded through a state grant that the administration received.

1808
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:56,261
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what's funding the development of the extensive capital plan.

1809
02:31:56,641 --> 02:32:04,183
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as the CARES Act money, we're gonna use whatever the school needs as far as their HVAC needs up until our expiration date.

1810
02:32:04,203 --> 02:32:07,964
[SPEAKER_20]: It just has to be done and we're completed with invoice and paid by December 29th.

1811
02:32:09,464 --> 02:32:16,326
[SPEAKER_20]: So I haven't the ability of amending my drawdown, but I need to draw down as much as I can by this Friday.

1812
02:32:17,354 --> 02:32:19,517
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a big task, I'm working on it, so.

1813
02:32:19,778 --> 02:32:21,140
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, no, I understand.

1814
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:24,144
[SPEAKER_25]: And I understand this is new to everyone, believe me.

1815
02:32:24,805 --> 02:32:29,993
[SPEAKER_25]: This is an emergency that we've never seen the likes of before, so I understand that.

1816
02:32:32,496 --> 02:32:44,539
[SPEAKER_25]: Relating to Council President Falco's question regarding that we knew that COVID-19 was airborne and we knew about this in early March, April.

1817
02:32:45,339 --> 02:32:59,542
[SPEAKER_25]: And I am very concerned why it took so long for the school administration and the school committee to act on moving forward on some of these needs that we have regarding air quality, exhaust fans, and so forth.

1818
02:33:00,262 --> 02:33:16,827
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's pretty troubling to me that we let a fair amount of time go by, and in doing so, potentially a fair amount of money be left on the table, which is very concerning in these troubling times to leave any type of money on the table.

1819
02:33:17,527 --> 02:33:28,131
[SPEAKER_25]: And that really bothers me that there wasn't more of an emphasis on finding out air quality, which is a major concern.

1820
02:33:28,551 --> 02:33:29,411
[SPEAKER_25]: Now to that point,

1821
02:33:30,412 --> 02:33:33,254
[SPEAKER_25]: Have we reached out to the EPA?

1822
02:33:33,274 --> 02:33:42,121
[SPEAKER_25]: Have we exhausted all the rules and regulations and standards from Mass DEP or the Clean Air, Mass Clean Air Act?

1823
02:33:43,643 --> 02:33:48,206
[SPEAKER_25]: And are we required as a school system to look at air quality?

1824
02:33:48,607 --> 02:33:52,470
[SPEAKER_25]: And if so, what, how often are we required to do so?

1825
02:33:54,552 --> 02:33:58,215
[SPEAKER_20]: If I'd like to make a point of information to Councilor Marks,

1826
02:33:59,130 --> 02:34:06,215
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as the CARES Act, and I know the schools are spending on the HVAC, they aren't considered a recipient of the CARES money.

1827
02:34:06,415 --> 02:34:09,557
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the city, and the city is a sub-recipient of the Commonwealth.

1828
02:34:09,953 --> 02:34:17,899
[SPEAKER_20]: So the school is actually considered a sub-recipient of the city, which even though they're the largest department, that's the way the federal government is looking at it.

1829
02:34:18,519 --> 02:34:25,304
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the time when we were awarded the CARES Act money, that was not an allowable cost, but now they're telling us it's an allowable cost.

1830
02:34:25,385 --> 02:34:32,790
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to stress to everybody, to the council, that it's not just we're sitting on money, it's that we're told, no, you can't use it for this.

1831
02:34:32,910 --> 02:34:35,312
[SPEAKER_20]: And then later, a month later, yes, you can use it for this.

1832
02:34:35,552 --> 02:34:38,574
[SPEAKER_20]: No, you can't use it for that personnel, but now, yes, you can.

1833
02:34:39,635 --> 02:34:49,138
[SPEAKER_20]: I just need you to understand that the federal government has flip-flopped on their rules for expenditures, and that's one reason for why we are where we are today.

1834
02:34:49,478 --> 02:34:51,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information if I can, Mr. President.

1835
02:34:51,199 --> 02:34:53,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Scott Pelley.

1836
02:34:53,679 --> 02:34:55,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia, I'm just a little concerned.

1837
02:34:55,200 --> 02:35:00,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't... I work in a municipality where that is the flip-flopping.

1838
02:35:00,722 --> 02:35:04,523
[SPEAKER_04]: You do see it happening, but for example, I have

1839
02:35:05,743 --> 02:35:12,847
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 employees that are working 20 hours a week and we were told that we couldn't use that funding to pay for those employees.

1840
02:35:13,467 --> 02:35:20,450
[SPEAKER_04]: We got word last week that we could, so all we did is revert back all of those hours for reimbursement.

1841
02:35:21,531 --> 02:35:30,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does it seem so simple in some communities and why does it seem so difficult the way you're making it sound right now that it's really monumental?

1842
02:35:31,756 --> 02:35:33,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it that different?

1843
02:35:34,973 --> 02:35:44,236
[SPEAKER_20]: It is because, depending on the tracking, so you have to think, you have a police department, a fire department, a school department, a DPW department, me, a finance department, a treasury department.

1844
02:35:44,497 --> 02:35:45,577
[SPEAKER_20]: I could go on and on and on.

1845
02:35:45,597 --> 02:35:48,358
[SPEAKER_20]: We have multiple departments with multiple staff.

1846
02:35:48,538 --> 02:35:52,379
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, if somebody's out with COVID, I don't know who had COVID.

1847
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:53,760
[SPEAKER_20]: If somebody's being quarantined,

1848
02:35:54,652 --> 02:36:05,096
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if we've been quarantined, so I have to rely on each department's department head to gather that information for each of their departments for all their staff from the beginning of the disaster until now.

1849
02:36:05,416 --> 02:36:12,239
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I understand if somebody was infected, but we're talking about part-time employees.

1850
02:36:12,539 --> 02:36:24,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very simple for us just to say that this is what we spent prior to approving it, and now we're asking for the CARES Act for reimbursement to our budget, and it's being done.

1851
02:36:26,227 --> 02:36:27,128
[SPEAKER_20]: That wasn't how it was.

1852
02:36:27,168 --> 02:36:35,113
[SPEAKER_20]: So what happened was we were told if anybody, for instance, me when I was sick, anybody from my position who helped out in backfield, we could pay for that expenditure.

1853
02:36:35,133 --> 02:36:35,934
[SPEAKER_20]: So we tracked it.

1854
02:36:36,694 --> 02:36:38,676
[SPEAKER_20]: My position could not be paid.

1855
02:36:38,756 --> 02:36:40,257
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they're saying, yes, it can.

1856
02:36:40,717 --> 02:36:44,860
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition, they're saying if anybody was quarantined, that money can also be.

1857
02:36:44,940 --> 02:36:49,803
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's all has to be by department tracked, put in a spreadsheet and put together.

1858
02:36:49,844 --> 02:36:50,804
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not just part-time.

1859
02:36:51,144 --> 02:36:54,547
[SPEAKER_20]: It's part-time, it's full-time, and it's all across the city and the schools.

1860
02:36:55,143 --> 02:36:59,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know what you're saying, but I'm confused, maybe I'm not saying it right.

1861
02:37:00,326 --> 02:37:04,128
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is this has nothing to do with an infection or anybody being infected.

1862
02:37:05,096 --> 02:37:13,101
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're running programs for a COVID-based program, we were told we can't pay salaries through that back then.

1863
02:37:13,942 --> 02:37:22,027
[SPEAKER_04]: We found out we could, and all we did is revert back to all those months and salaries that we paid, and we reimbursed that through the COVID money.

1864
02:37:22,427 --> 02:37:25,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just my small department.

1865
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:29,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it's so difficult here.

1866
02:37:30,212 --> 02:37:32,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have an incident command system in place?

1867
02:37:33,975 --> 02:37:35,816
[SPEAKER_04]: In Medford, do we have a team in place?

1868
02:37:38,118 --> 02:37:43,162
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Dave Rodriguez nodding his head, but I can't unmute him to speak.

1869
02:37:44,743 --> 02:37:46,364
[SPEAKER_19]: If we can unmute the Chief of Staff.

1870
02:37:49,867 --> 02:37:50,868
[SPEAKER_19]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

1871
02:37:52,229 --> 02:37:53,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1872
02:37:53,110 --> 02:37:55,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we do have an ICS system in place.

1873
02:37:55,031 --> 02:37:56,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary Ann O'Connor is answering.

1874
02:37:57,098 --> 02:37:58,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's what I'm saying, Dave.

1875
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:00,841
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where I'm confused.

1876
02:38:01,261 --> 02:38:17,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Other communities have used the COVID money to directly put together an incident command system and a team together that focuses on what we're doing with our employees that have to do the day-to-day activities just to survive without the COVID.

1877
02:38:17,955 --> 02:38:25,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just seems like, I can understand why it seems so overwhelming to so many people.

1878
02:38:25,141 --> 02:38:26,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just a little confused.

1879
02:38:26,771 --> 02:38:28,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for answering that, and I appreciate it.

1880
02:38:29,673 --> 02:38:30,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1881
02:38:31,014 --> 02:38:31,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1882
02:38:31,815 --> 02:38:32,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks, you still have the floor.

1883
02:38:33,156 --> 02:38:33,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1884
02:38:34,476 --> 02:38:48,687
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, Mr. President, if I could, I asked the question, maybe it's a question for Dave Murphy, but what MAS DP rules or regulations or standards or MAS Clean Air Act or the EPA are we bound by as a school system?

1885
02:38:49,147 --> 02:38:53,370
[SPEAKER_25]: And how often, if any, are we required to do air quality testing?

1886
02:38:55,540 --> 02:39:15,416
[SPEAKER_03]: My knowledge, there isn't a regulatory requirement with regard to the air exchange rate, which is the specific element of the air quality that, under public health guidance, is cause for concern with regard to virus transmission.

1887
02:39:15,556 --> 02:39:19,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not familiar with any regulatory requirement on that piece.

1888
02:39:21,687 --> 02:39:38,144
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial standards that all governmental buildings and public spaces obviously have to comply with, although I can't say that I know, I can speak to the binding nature of them one way or another, but to the best of my knowledge, there is no legal requirement that is sort of

1889
02:39:39,757 --> 02:39:44,879
[SPEAKER_03]: that is dictating this particular piece of air quality that we are measuring.

1890
02:39:45,379 --> 02:39:59,485
[SPEAKER_03]: It's based on public health guidance and public health experts saying that in order to reduce the likelihood of transmission, this is the piece of the air quality that you generally want to try to improve and that's where our focus has been.

1891
02:40:01,476 --> 02:40:12,563
[SPEAKER_25]: And if I could, and maybe this is a question for you, Dave, would this money also be available to do improvements such as relating to air quality, such as windows and so forth?

1892
02:40:13,784 --> 02:40:18,267
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say this money, are you referring to the CARES money or the capital improvements expenditure?

1893
02:40:18,467 --> 02:40:20,309
[SPEAKER_25]: The CARES money in particular.

1894
02:40:20,669 --> 02:40:21,109
[SPEAKER_03]: CARES money.

1895
02:40:21,509 --> 02:40:24,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my understanding, and Alicia may want to speak to this, but

1896
02:40:26,322 --> 02:40:32,526
[SPEAKER_03]: The money is designed for items that are expenses that are caused by the pandemic, essentially.

1897
02:40:32,567 --> 02:40:36,809
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a more complicated way of saying that, but that's pretty much what it is.

1898
02:40:37,030 --> 02:40:41,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if there are facilities or infrastructure,

1899
02:40:42,389 --> 02:40:58,283
[SPEAKER_03]: improvements that we are doing specifically to respond to the conditions under which we're operating related to the pandemic, then, yes, I think we would certainly take the position, and I would advocate to Alicia, and I imagine Alicia would advocate to the state, and the state would advocate to the federal government, that that is, in fact, an eligible expense.

1900
02:40:58,763 --> 02:41:04,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the short answer to your question is, yes, that's essentially the conversation that we're engaged in right now.

1901
02:41:04,909 --> 02:41:08,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I can offer just a very quick illustration of the complexity of our personnel piece.

1902
02:41:08,992 --> 02:41:15,615
[SPEAKER_03]: When we had staff who were quarantined, we had other staff who were deployed into those roles.

1903
02:41:16,035 --> 02:41:24,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when the new guidance was provided to us that a personnel expenditure of that kind could be an eligible expense, we are now going back

1904
02:41:24,927 --> 02:41:32,034
[SPEAKER_03]: and analyzing who was filling in for whom and then finding a way to make the argument that that's funding that should be eligible.

1905
02:41:32,314 --> 02:41:45,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a really short way of explaining what is a fairly complicated task because so much of the work that administrators and other staff are engaged in, depending on the day,

1906
02:41:46,467 --> 02:41:52,310
[SPEAKER_03]: that they are more or less in either the role that they're adopting due to someone else's absence or their normal role.

1907
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of overlap between the two.

1908
02:41:53,931 --> 02:42:01,536
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to draw that line as consistently as possible so that we can be good faith participants in the CARES Act program.

1909
02:42:01,576 --> 02:42:12,542
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same point, we don't want to leave any money on the table, so we're analyzing at a very close level what staff are deployed where so that we can make stated appropriate arguments.

1910
02:42:14,634 --> 02:42:20,417
[SPEAKER_25]: So just moving forward, Dave, what did we learn about the lack of building maintenance?

1911
02:42:21,037 --> 02:42:22,297
[SPEAKER_25]: Have we learned anything from this?

1912
02:42:23,078 --> 02:42:23,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

1913
02:42:23,638 --> 02:42:30,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, I'm not sure, Councilor, if it was your question or one of your colleagues, but the point about what's learning, I think there's a number of things.

1914
02:42:30,481 --> 02:42:36,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we have to, and I'm not suggesting that the Metro Public Schools was unaware of this by any means.

1915
02:42:36,844 --> 02:42:38,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just say that based on

1916
02:42:39,185 --> 02:42:55,695
[SPEAKER_03]: being in my role during this situation, what I would answer as an individual is that we need to look at the organization as a whole and always be thinking about how, in the way I always describe district leadership positions as, what are the problems that you don't want your successors to have to deal with?

1917
02:42:56,075 --> 02:42:59,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we have to have that type of forward-looking perspective to make sure that we're

1918
02:43:00,418 --> 02:43:20,247
[SPEAKER_03]: we're building our priorities and developing our plans accordingly because there will be other infrastructure related crises and there will be other superintendents and assistant superintendents before the Medford City Council and I think if we do our job well those individuals will have fewer and different problems to confront with or without a pandemic.

1919
02:43:22,130 --> 02:43:33,734
[SPEAKER_25]: And just my last point, and I know we talk about school buildings, a lot of people don't envision the vocational school.

1920
02:43:34,795 --> 02:43:45,179
[SPEAKER_25]: But let me tell you, we do have a very well functioning vocational school that's been recognized over the years and there's been a lot of improvements.

1921
02:43:45,959 --> 02:43:56,368
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's very troubling to me, as a former graduate of the vocational school, to hear that we have shops that have poor air quality.

1922
02:43:57,168 --> 02:44:15,083
[SPEAKER_25]: And knowing what takes place in a vocational shop, which is welding, which is automotive, things that emit toxic fumes, knowing that our students are being subjected in these shops to a poor air quality.

1923
02:44:15,683 --> 02:44:17,524
[SPEAKER_25]: really raises a red flag to me.

1924
02:44:18,345 --> 02:44:26,669
[SPEAKER_25]: And I've yet to hear anything really about the vocational school, but it's a major, major concern.

1925
02:44:27,369 --> 02:44:30,110
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it's something that needs to be addressed immediately.

1926
02:44:30,751 --> 02:44:34,212
[SPEAKER_25]: I know Dave, you mentioned that it's an area that's being looked at, but

1927
02:44:35,493 --> 02:44:44,517
[SPEAKER_25]: With the nature of our shops and the work that's taking place, it's unacceptable to have poor air quality in those particular shops.

1928
02:44:45,218 --> 02:44:47,919
[SPEAKER_25]: And I hope that that's something that's on the radar.

1929
02:44:48,439 --> 02:44:55,983
[SPEAKER_25]: And moving forward, it's something that's reviewed not on an annual basis, but maybe a monthly basis in these shops.

1930
02:44:56,843 --> 02:45:01,606
[SPEAKER_25]: We probably have the same filters in some of those shops when I attended some 40 years ago.

1931
02:45:02,546 --> 02:45:06,771
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's not a joke because of the lack of maintenance and the lack of upkeep.

1932
02:45:07,713 --> 02:45:13,880
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would hope that this special attention paid to our vocational school in those particular shops.

1933
02:45:17,384 --> 02:45:17,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1934
02:45:18,065 --> 02:45:19,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

1935
02:45:19,527 --> 02:45:20,267
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

1936
02:45:22,072 --> 02:45:22,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1937
02:45:23,173 --> 02:45:24,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Alicia, one question.

1938
02:45:25,253 --> 02:45:34,077
[SPEAKER_16]: When you mentioned about the CARES money and how some of the funds are reimbursed, some things are reimbursable and some things are not reimbursable and how things have flip-flopped.

1939
02:45:34,277 --> 02:45:35,037
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the process?

1940
02:45:35,057 --> 02:45:40,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the federal government notify you through like bulletins or how do you get notified about that?

1941
02:45:41,413 --> 02:45:56,040
[SPEAKER_20]: So literally, I've gone on a Q&A session with them, and what they did is they gave us a link, and each community goes onto that link, fills out a form for their questions, and then we wait for the federal state liaison to get back to us with an answer on whether it's eligible or not.

1942
02:45:59,061 --> 02:46:01,122
[SPEAKER_16]: So you like just submit questions back and forth?

1943
02:46:01,242 --> 02:46:02,803
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, that's how I've been doing it.

1944
02:46:02,903 --> 02:46:07,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, they have an overall of what's eligible, obviously like PPE and things like that.

1945
02:46:07,906 --> 02:46:15,150
[SPEAKER_20]: But anything that's questionable, like I asked about the HVAC for the schools because they had $150,000 capital improvement cap.

1946
02:46:15,330 --> 02:46:18,671
[SPEAKER_20]: And then they were like, well, that doesn't apply to the HVAC for the schools, they're exempt.

1947
02:46:19,232 --> 02:46:21,213
[SPEAKER_20]: So I wouldn't have known that unless I sent that question.

1948
02:46:21,553 --> 02:46:23,614
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have thought, oh, I can only spend up to 150,000 on HVAC.

1949
02:46:23,714 --> 02:46:23,874
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1950
02:46:29,934 --> 02:46:31,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your answer on that.

1951
02:46:31,596 --> 02:46:40,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I get one final question for Dave, Dave, with regard to the Curtis Tufts, is that, I've been told that they're using fans down there.

1952
02:46:40,305 --> 02:46:40,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that true?

1953
02:46:40,866 --> 02:46:42,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Do they have HEPA filters at the Curtis Tufts?

1954
02:46:43,092 --> 02:46:44,653
[SPEAKER_03]: They have both.

1955
02:46:45,054 --> 02:46:48,036
[SPEAKER_03]: They have HEPA filters in the classrooms, nurse's office, and the restroom.

1956
02:46:48,396 --> 02:47:00,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have a supply of fans that are inverted in the windows just to create additional air circulation, which the HEPA Curtis-Thompson, as I'm sure you know, does not have an HVAC system.

1957
02:47:00,105 --> 02:47:07,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no sort of organic way to, I'm not going to use the windows as the organic way, but there's no systemic way to circulate air.

1958
02:47:08,171 --> 02:47:10,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why the HEPAs will be there indefinitely.

1959
02:47:11,378 --> 02:47:12,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1960
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:14,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I thank you for answering all the questions tonight.

1961
02:47:15,001 --> 02:47:18,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I know they're not easy, and I know you're all there.

1962
02:47:18,324 --> 02:47:20,847
[SPEAKER_16]: But there are many concerns throughout the community.

1963
02:47:21,507 --> 02:47:26,972
[SPEAKER_16]: My council has great questions, and I appreciate the answers that you gave.

1964
02:47:26,992 --> 02:47:30,756
[SPEAKER_16]: And look forward to hopefully another update soon.

1965
02:47:30,796 --> 02:47:32,037
[SPEAKER_16]: So I thank you very much.

1966
02:47:33,398 --> 02:47:34,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1967
02:47:35,059 --> 02:47:36,801
[SPEAKER_19]: Chief of staff, did you have your hands up?

1968
02:47:36,981 --> 02:47:37,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you want to say something?

1969
02:47:39,097 --> 02:47:40,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it's from the floor.

1970
02:47:40,158 --> 02:47:40,558
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, thank you.

1971
02:47:40,859 --> 02:47:41,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

1972
02:47:43,240 --> 02:47:43,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

1973
02:47:44,722 --> 02:47:46,523
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, any more questions?

1974
02:47:48,545 --> 02:47:53,569
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

1975
02:47:54,729 --> 02:47:55,270
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk.

1976
02:47:55,650 --> 02:47:57,011
[SPEAKER_19]: If I may, can I ask you a quick question?

1977
02:47:57,071 --> 02:47:57,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold on a second.

1978
02:47:57,932 --> 02:47:58,592
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

1979
02:47:59,133 --> 02:48:00,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave Rodriguez.

1980
02:48:01,255 --> 02:48:02,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Dave Rodriguez, Mr. Chief of Staff.

1981
02:48:05,378 --> 02:48:05,618
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, sir.

1982
02:48:06,552 --> 02:48:07,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dave.

1983
02:48:07,573 --> 02:48:08,273
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate it.

1984
02:48:09,074 --> 02:48:09,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Quick question.

1985
02:48:09,554 --> 02:48:23,582
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed recently, I think the mayor released an update video with updates that were going on in the city, and there were some good things on there, but there was no update with regard to the schools.

1986
02:48:23,682 --> 02:48:25,703
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that is part of the city, right?

1987
02:48:25,723 --> 02:48:28,845
[SPEAKER_16]: I would think that that should have been part of that presentation.

1988
02:48:28,865 --> 02:48:29,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I wrong?

1989
02:48:31,526 --> 02:48:31,927
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.

1990
02:48:32,327 --> 02:48:35,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mayor participates regularly in the school community meetings.

1991
02:48:36,383 --> 02:48:41,628
[SPEAKER_08]: in expressing her opinion, and she's very strongly, strongly opinion and getting kids back to school as quickly as possible.

1992
02:48:42,349 --> 02:48:47,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Any updates regarding the school, the school administration from the school committee will happen in conjunction with them.

1993
02:48:48,415 --> 02:48:55,642
[SPEAKER_08]: That was not intended, it was intended to be a comprehensive update, but not intended to capture all the stuff that we've been working on or accomplished in the last 10 months.

1994
02:48:56,403 --> 02:48:57,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not the last, it will be,

1995
02:48:58,645 --> 02:49:03,650
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one of the first updates, it won't be the last, and we sure have to fold with some educational updates.

1996
02:49:03,670 --> 02:49:10,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, I would think that a comprehensive update would be comprehensive and involve the school system.

1997
02:49:10,337 --> 02:49:14,621
[SPEAKER_16]: And the school, when you think about it, the budget that comes before us is a lot of money.

1998
02:49:15,181 --> 02:49:19,225
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a big part of our city, the Medford Public Schools is part of the city of Medford.

1999
02:49:19,265 --> 02:49:21,507
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would think that that update should have been included.

2000
02:49:23,356 --> 02:49:27,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said, there were some good things in there, but there needs to be updates on everything.

2001
02:49:27,417 --> 02:49:31,598
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, sometimes it's bad news, but there should still be an update.

2002
02:49:32,178 --> 02:49:34,438
[SPEAKER_16]: The parents of the residents of the city deserve an update.

2003
02:49:35,099 --> 02:49:38,799
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that that should have been included, and I would hope that that's included in the next update.

2004
02:49:40,740 --> 02:49:41,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2005
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:41,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2006
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:44,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, do we have any hands raised?

2007
02:49:44,320 --> 02:49:45,220
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see any, but.

2008
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:47,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not see any, Mr. President.

2009
02:49:50,095 --> 02:49:54,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, on the motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2010
02:49:54,459 --> 02:49:55,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2011
02:49:56,801 --> 02:49:57,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Paters?

2012
02:49:59,083 --> 02:49:59,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2013
02:50:00,024 --> 02:50:00,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Nikes?

2014
02:50:00,765 --> 02:50:03,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2015
02:50:04,208 --> 02:50:04,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

2016
02:50:05,269 --> 02:50:05,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2017
02:50:07,211 --> 02:50:07,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morrell?

2018
02:50:08,192 --> 02:50:08,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2019
02:50:09,113 --> 02:50:09,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2020
02:50:09,933 --> 02:50:10,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2021
02:50:10,894 --> 02:50:11,735
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco?

2022
02:50:11,775 --> 02:50:12,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2023
02:50:12,656 --> 02:50:13,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Kerrio?

2024
02:50:13,417 --> 02:50:13,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2025
02:50:13,847 --> 02:50:16,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

2026
02:50:16,788 --> 02:50:18,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, while we're under suspension, motion to take 2617.

2027
02:50:18,869 --> 02:50:24,170
[SPEAKER_19]: While we're under suspension, I'm sorry, Councilor Bares, what was that again?

2028
02:50:24,290 --> 02:50:26,491
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're under suspension, motion to take paper 20-617, 617.

2029
02:50:26,531 --> 02:50:35,674
[SPEAKER_00]: 20-617, communications from the mayor to the honorable presidents and members of city council.

2030
02:50:41,998 --> 02:50:45,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Request for appropriation of Community Preservation Committee.

2031
02:50:46,219 --> 02:50:55,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee.

2032
02:50:55,142 --> 02:51:07,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Number one, requesting the appropriation of $125,000 from the Community Preservation Act, Community Housing Reserve to the Action for Boston Community Development

2033
02:51:08,770 --> 02:51:12,991
[SPEAKER_19]: for ABCD rental assistance for Meffitt Residence Program.

2034
02:51:13,011 --> 02:51:32,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Number two, requesting the appropriation of $2,835 from the CPA General Reserve to the City of Meffitt Department of Veterans Services to restore the USMCKA Markey Memorial located at the intersection of Lawrence Road and Winthrop Street.

2035
02:51:32,237 --> 02:51:32,617
[SPEAKER_19]: Number three,

2036
02:51:34,344 --> 02:51:47,987
[SPEAKER_19]: requesting the appropriation of $3,500 from the CPA General Reserve to the trees, Medford slash City of Medford Tree Warden to undertake an inventory of all existing trees located in Oak Row Cemetery.

2037
02:51:48,247 --> 02:51:55,469
[SPEAKER_19]: All projects will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category, Community Hazard Reserve, and General Reserve.

2038
02:51:56,449 --> 02:52:00,150
[SPEAKER_19]: We have Roberta Cameron on hand.

2039
02:52:00,530 --> 02:52:01,290
[SPEAKER_19]: Roberta, where are you?

2040
02:52:03,113 --> 02:52:10,199
[SPEAKER_19]: Roberta, could you give us a brief synopsis here?

2041
02:52:10,439 --> 02:52:11,219
[SPEAKER_19]: If we can unmute her.

2042
02:52:11,259 --> 02:52:14,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, thank you.

2043
02:52:15,523 --> 02:52:16,383
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry for my.

2044
02:52:16,403 --> 02:52:21,467
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you very much.

2045
02:52:21,707 --> 02:52:29,674
[SPEAKER_23]: As you are aware, back last spring, the Community Preservation Committee approved a recommended funding of $250,000.

2046
02:52:33,083 --> 02:52:49,255
[SPEAKER_23]: for an emergency rental assistance program to assist households who are affected by COVID-19 to be able to preserve their housing if they're in danger of

2047
02:52:50,983 --> 02:52:52,204
[SPEAKER_23]: not being able to pay their rent.

2048
02:52:52,884 --> 02:53:17,523
[SPEAKER_23]: So the Community Preservation Committee recommended $250,000 at the time, and the City Council approved the first half of that funding in last spring, and asked that we return when the first half of the funding had been utilized to request a second half of the funding.

2049
02:53:18,081 --> 02:53:32,445
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've submitted a report to the city council, or we've submitted a report to the city, which I hope has been made available to the councilors, that details how the funding has been spent over the past several months.

2050
02:53:32,985 --> 02:53:35,706
[SPEAKER_23]: And in fact, most of that funding has been utilized.

2051
02:53:36,526 --> 02:53:48,431
[SPEAKER_23]: And we are asking that the council will release the remaining funding for that program, especially as the eviction moratorium has been lifted statewide.

2052
02:53:48,471 --> 02:53:57,074
[SPEAKER_23]: We anticipate that many more households are going to be impacted economically by their loss of income due to this crisis.

2053
02:54:01,082 --> 02:54:05,964
[SPEAKER_23]: requested or recommended funding for two small grant applications.

2054
02:54:06,084 --> 02:54:11,387
[SPEAKER_23]: Small grants, as you know, are projects that request less than $5,000 of CPA funding.

2055
02:54:11,427 --> 02:54:13,928
[SPEAKER_23]: And we make the committee reserves $50,000 a year for these types of projects.

2056
02:54:13,968 --> 02:54:16,069
[SPEAKER_23]: And the two applicants for these projects,

2057
02:54:28,652 --> 02:54:36,295
[SPEAKER_23]: this month are perfect examples of the types of projects that we hope to be able to support with these small grant applications.

2058
02:54:37,036 --> 02:54:45,339
[SPEAKER_23]: With that, I'd like to ask the Council if you have any questions for us or for our applicants.

2059
02:54:46,480 --> 02:54:47,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2060
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:48,000
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a number of questions.

2061
02:54:48,020 --> 02:54:51,002
[SPEAKER_16]: You have Councilor Morrell, Councilor Behrs, Councilor Nye, Councilor Morrell.

2062
02:54:51,913 --> 02:54:52,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2063
02:54:52,934 --> 02:54:54,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you, Roberta, for presenting on this.

2064
02:54:54,916 --> 02:54:57,278
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to confirm doing some quick math.

2065
02:54:57,698 --> 02:55:05,926
[SPEAKER_12]: The amount that's been expended through the emergency rental assistance is $102,000 based on what we have in this report.

2066
02:55:05,966 --> 02:55:08,588
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the $67,000 and then the $35,000.

2067
02:55:09,509 --> 02:55:12,172
[SPEAKER_12]: That's been processed and about to be processed.

2068
02:55:16,936 --> 02:55:17,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberta, do you want to?

2069
02:55:19,545 --> 02:55:28,850
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, actually, I'd like to defer to ABCD, if I may, to provide some details about how their funding has been spent up to date.

2070
02:55:29,271 --> 02:55:31,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that Ann, correct?

2071
02:55:32,813 --> 02:55:34,073
[SPEAKER_23]: Ann Corbin from ABCD.

2072
02:55:34,154 --> 02:55:36,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'll try to unmute you, Ann, one minute.

2073
02:55:36,895 --> 02:55:37,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there we go.

2074
02:55:37,535 --> 02:55:38,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Ann, you have the floor.

2075
02:55:45,975 --> 02:55:47,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

2076
02:55:47,756 --> 02:55:51,939
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just I was just confirming based on the numbers as far as what's been expended.

2077
02:55:51,959 --> 02:55:58,623
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks the size of applications for those completed at 67,000, you know, a little more than 67,000.

2078
02:55:59,183 --> 02:56:02,825
[SPEAKER_12]: And those pending, which are soon to be completed is 35 more than 35,000.

2079
02:56:03,126 --> 02:56:05,567
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's about 102,000.

2080
02:56:06,127 --> 02:56:13,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there money that I guess because you is there a more specific accounting for the money that's been spent so far?

2081
02:56:14,698 --> 02:56:21,644
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just trying to get to the point that I think the first amount that was allocated for this was a 125,000.

2082
02:56:21,865 --> 02:56:22,585
[SPEAKER_18]: So 102,000 were

2083
02:56:47,532 --> 02:56:50,857
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to so that the first allocation from the council is a 125,000.

2084
02:56:50,898 --> 02:56:51,819
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just trying to understand.

2085
02:56:58,225 --> 02:57:00,807
[SPEAKER_12]: expended and is pending.

2086
02:57:01,067 --> 02:57:03,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just seeing an amount of around $102,000.

2087
02:57:03,188 --> 02:57:06,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's correct.

2088
02:57:06,390 --> 02:57:07,671
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the full amount that's been.

2089
02:57:07,691 --> 02:57:08,692
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, thank you.

2090
02:57:08,712 --> 02:57:09,753
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just what I was trying to get to.

2091
02:57:09,773 --> 02:57:24,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, obviously, I think, Roberta, for raising the fact of the state eviction moratorium expiring, I guess I would assume you anticipate more demand with that moratorium expiring.

2092
02:57:26,008 --> 02:57:27,489
[SPEAKER_12]: that's all I have.

2093
02:57:27,549 --> 02:57:27,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2094
02:57:52,673 --> 02:57:53,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2095
02:57:54,474 --> 02:58:00,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to the CPC and Roberta Cameron for bringing these three proposals before us.

2096
02:58:00,079 --> 02:58:02,700
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're all of incredible value.

2097
02:58:03,981 --> 02:58:10,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to Councilor Morrell's point, and I think basically what we've heard here the past couple hours, federal government has failed us.

2098
02:58:10,566 --> 02:58:14,809
[SPEAKER_00]: The state government has failed us, especially on this issue of housing.

2099
02:58:15,630 --> 02:58:19,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really glad that as a local government, we've been able to, you know,

2100
02:58:20,694 --> 02:58:24,978
[SPEAKER_00]: do something to help people because people need a lot of help and things are bad out there.

2101
02:58:26,319 --> 02:58:28,841
[SPEAKER_00]: RAFT, which is the state's program, is really overburdened.

2102
02:58:29,341 --> 02:58:34,225
[SPEAKER_00]: The eviction and foreclosure moratorium expired a couple weeks ago.

2103
02:58:35,646 --> 02:58:39,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Judges are being rushed to the housing courts to process evictions.

2104
02:58:40,310 --> 02:58:41,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Housing is tenuous.

2105
02:58:41,811 --> 02:58:42,792
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in a housing crisis.

2106
02:58:42,812 --> 02:58:44,053
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in a housing crisis before.

2107
02:58:44,754 --> 02:58:46,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have mass unemployment.

2108
02:58:47,216 --> 02:58:48,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And the federal and state government aren't

2109
02:58:49,280 --> 02:58:50,681
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their job, quite frankly.

2110
02:58:50,781 --> 02:58:52,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really glad that we can do this.

2111
02:58:52,622 --> 02:58:54,163
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to get this money out there.

2112
02:58:54,263 --> 02:58:58,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping we can support more Medford residents and Medford families in keeping them in their homes.

2113
02:58:59,786 --> 02:59:08,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also just want to thank Mr. Durham from Veteran Services for the proposal to renovate and restore another one of our memorials.

2114
02:59:09,031 --> 02:59:15,515
[SPEAKER_00]: And to Therese Medford and Warden Tootin to look at all the trees in Oak Grove Cemetery.

2115
02:59:15,595 --> 02:59:18,177
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be voting yes on this tonight.

2116
02:59:18,397 --> 02:59:18,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2117
02:59:19,514 --> 02:59:20,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

2118
02:59:20,614 --> 02:59:21,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2119
02:59:22,075 --> 02:59:23,195
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2120
02:59:23,255 --> 02:59:25,456
[SPEAKER_26]: In terms of the two small grants, I have no problem with that.

2121
02:59:26,576 --> 02:59:38,499
[SPEAKER_26]: In terms of the $125,000 appropriation for rental assistance, this is something that I've supported in the past, but I think it was important to point out that initially this council didn't support this paper when it was first brought before us.

2122
02:59:39,284 --> 02:59:46,849
[SPEAKER_26]: And the reason this council didn't support this paper when it was first brought before us was because these funds were not going to be maintained exclusively in our community.

2123
02:59:47,490 --> 02:59:51,252
[SPEAKER_26]: Community Preservation Act funds are generated through an assessment on a property tax.

2124
02:59:52,153 --> 02:59:58,657
[SPEAKER_26]: And when this program was first presented to us, people were going to be eligible from all across the state, not just Medford only.

2125
02:59:59,858 --> 03:00:05,565
[SPEAKER_26]: And this council worked with ABCD to ensure that only Medford residents were going to be able to receive these funds.

2126
03:00:05,825 --> 03:00:11,111
[SPEAKER_26]: And because of that, if you look at the data that they've given us, you'll see that 35 applications have been approved.

2127
03:00:12,672 --> 03:00:15,536
[SPEAKER_26]: The aggregate amount requested is $101,679,000, the $102,000 that Councilor Morrell was referring to.

2128
03:00:15,556 --> 03:00:16,737
[SPEAKER_26]: In reading this paper, you'll also see that

2129
03:00:23,073 --> 03:00:26,296
[SPEAKER_26]: 35 applications have been approved for residents that live in the city.

2130
03:00:27,217 --> 03:00:30,220
[SPEAKER_26]: 49 applications were rejected because those people were outside the service area.

2131
03:00:30,260 --> 03:00:31,221
[SPEAKER_26]: They didn't live in the community.

2132
03:00:31,701 --> 03:00:36,165
[SPEAKER_26]: So these restrictions that we put on this to keep these dollars in our community are paying off, Mr. President.

2133
03:00:36,185 --> 03:00:38,647
[SPEAKER_26]: They're allowing us to service more Medford residents in the community.

2134
03:00:40,008 --> 03:00:40,909
[SPEAKER_26]: and keep that money here.

2135
03:00:41,770 --> 03:00:51,019
[SPEAKER_26]: If we looked at the number of applications that came in and the number of applications that were kicked out because they weren't residents of the city of Medford, we'd see that this money would have been spent far faster.

2136
03:00:51,419 --> 03:00:54,402
[SPEAKER_26]: And these money, these are monies that are generated through property taxes.

2137
03:00:54,542 --> 03:01:00,909
[SPEAKER_26]: So these are monies that should maintain a space right here in this community and go no further than the walls of Medford or the borders of Medford, Mr. President.

2138
03:01:01,349 --> 03:01:08,156
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's very important that we point that out, that the council did its due diligence the last time this paper was before us, and put some safeguards and protections in.

2139
03:01:08,757 --> 03:01:17,386
[SPEAKER_26]: And I would assume that these safeguards and protections would extend to the second appropriation, and I'd like to get that commitment from ABCD.

2140
03:01:17,786 --> 03:01:21,350
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'd also like to include that as a condition on the paper, should it be approved this evening.

2141
03:01:25,124 --> 03:01:29,327
[SPEAKER_18]: We are committed to ensuring that this funding stays in the City of Monroe.

2142
03:01:29,827 --> 03:01:30,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Excellent.

2143
03:01:30,188 --> 03:01:30,848
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

2144
03:01:31,308 --> 03:01:32,469
[SPEAKER_26]: Music to my ears, as they say.

2145
03:01:33,730 --> 03:01:35,851
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm also looking at this report that was given.

2146
03:01:35,891 --> 03:01:41,535
[SPEAKER_26]: It says 35 households which have completed active applications.

2147
03:01:41,935 --> 03:01:43,916
[SPEAKER_26]: The aggregate amount requested is $101,679.

2148
03:01:44,157 --> 03:01:46,978
[SPEAKER_26]: The aggregate amount requested.

2149
03:01:47,038 --> 03:01:48,479
[SPEAKER_26]: This amount has been appropriated.

2150
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:49,400
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that correct?

2151
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:52,602
[SPEAKER_26]: It sounded like you confirmed that with Councilor Morrell's questions?

2152
03:01:53,643 --> 03:01:53,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2153
03:01:54,298 --> 03:01:56,479
[SPEAKER_26]: So the money's expended, gone, no longer in the bank.

2154
03:01:57,400 --> 03:02:00,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, so there is, we did just put in a request.

2155
03:02:00,982 --> 03:02:02,603
[SPEAKER_18]: There were two different installments.

2156
03:02:04,124 --> 03:02:19,554
[SPEAKER_18]: We have, we are continuing to process the applications while we wait on a second installment, but we didn't want to hold up the payment to landlords and risk people possibly becoming unhoused.

2157
03:02:20,775 --> 03:02:20,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2158
03:02:21,598 --> 03:02:25,964
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, so yeah, and looking at this, Mr. President, you know, addresses my concerns and my questions.

2159
03:02:26,765 --> 03:02:33,855
[SPEAKER_26]: It looks like, you know, the safeguards that we put in place are helping us meet the objectives of the program, and I wholeheartedly support the paper this evening.

2160
03:02:34,215 --> 03:02:35,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2161
03:02:35,773 --> 03:02:36,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions?

2162
03:02:36,773 --> 03:02:38,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott, do you have a question?

2163
03:02:38,954 --> 03:02:40,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2164
03:02:40,075 --> 03:02:58,161
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the exact comments I was going to make that Councilor Knight made, that we really focused on the Community Preservation Act coming from taxes, revenue created by our residents, and focusing on making sure that our residents that are in need are the first ones that could use those fundings.

2165
03:02:58,241 --> 03:03:04,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I appreciate the question and the answers, so I'll be supporting this paper tonight.

2166
03:03:04,544 --> 03:03:04,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2167
03:03:04,984 --> 03:03:06,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

2168
03:03:06,104 --> 03:03:06,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

2169
03:03:07,585 --> 03:03:08,525
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2170
03:03:08,926 --> 03:03:16,448
[SPEAKER_25]: So from my understanding on Councilor Morrell's question, they have spent $84,000.

2171
03:03:16,628 --> 03:03:19,109
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that not correct?

2172
03:03:20,130 --> 03:03:20,290
[SPEAKER_25]: Not $102,000.

2173
03:03:21,030 --> 03:03:23,431
[SPEAKER_25]: So only $84,000 has been expended.

2174
03:03:24,011 --> 03:03:30,994
[SPEAKER_18]: So the $102,000 includes those that are continuing to go through the application process.

2175
03:03:31,554 --> 03:03:33,655
[SPEAKER_18]: But we've already

2176
03:03:34,796 --> 03:03:36,497
[SPEAKER_18]: They've already submitted paperwork.

2177
03:03:37,497 --> 03:03:41,698
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just getting agreements from landlords in order to continue the payment process.

2178
03:03:42,378 --> 03:03:44,959
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, but that's not money that's been expended.

2179
03:03:45,739 --> 03:03:52,642
[SPEAKER_25]: So out of the 35 method applicants, all 35 were accepted, or were there more method applicants?

2180
03:03:57,203 --> 03:03:59,164
[SPEAKER_18]: Barbera, were you going to say something?

2181
03:04:00,884 --> 03:04:02,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you repeat the question, Councilwoman Lox, please?

2182
03:04:02,685 --> 03:04:02,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2183
03:04:03,285 --> 03:04:03,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2184
03:04:06,955 --> 03:04:23,102
[SPEAKER_23]: If I may, I have a question actually as to whether the correct number was 35 applicants or at another place in the report it said 51 applicants, which would make sense given the average.

2185
03:04:25,244 --> 03:04:31,187
[SPEAKER_23]: Household given was just about $2000 per household.

2186
03:04:31,888 --> 03:04:39,411
[SPEAKER_23]: And I had a suspicion that there might have been a typo in the report that was given.

2187
03:04:39,431 --> 03:04:43,153
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought that we had sent a corrected report.

2188
03:04:47,782 --> 03:04:53,443
[SPEAKER_23]: have been that we didn't send the correction of the correction.

2189
03:04:53,523 --> 03:04:56,184
[SPEAKER_23]: The the original report with to the council.

2190
03:04:56,224 --> 03:04:56,444
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

2191
03:04:56,484 --> 03:04:56,784
[SPEAKER_23]: So so the

2192
03:05:16,100 --> 03:05:17,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Numbers are all over the place.

2193
03:05:17,241 --> 03:05:33,129
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, I just wanted to correct that I believe that the number of households assisted to date, including the ones who are still in the application process, is 51 households with an average of $2,200 per household, rather than only 35 households assisted.

2194
03:05:33,149 --> 03:05:39,432
[SPEAKER_23]: So the 35 households are the households that have actually received payment.

2195
03:05:45,913 --> 03:05:48,214
[SPEAKER_25]: So Mr. President, just if I could.

2196
03:05:48,914 --> 03:05:55,696
[SPEAKER_25]: So the report that we have in front of us tonight says 26 applicants, and it says 67,423.

2197
03:05:56,896 --> 03:06:07,859
[SPEAKER_25]: And then there were nine applicants that are waiting to be finalized and require additional documentation at a request of 35,881.

2198
03:06:10,818 --> 03:06:17,143
[SPEAKER_25]: So now we're being asked or stated that it's no longer 35, it's 51.

2199
03:06:17,824 --> 03:06:30,053
[SPEAKER_25]: So out of the 51, what percent or how many are applications that have already received assistance, compared to those that are currently in process?

2200
03:06:30,774 --> 03:06:37,139
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are 35 applicants right now that have actually, payments have been made and sent to landlords.

2201
03:06:39,961 --> 03:06:41,022
[SPEAKER_25]: And I thought you said that was $84,000.

2202
03:06:41,062 --> 03:06:42,123
[SPEAKER_25]: That is $84,000.

2203
03:06:42,663 --> 03:06:47,027
[SPEAKER_18]: And the remainder are payments that are in process.

2204
03:06:47,427 --> 03:06:49,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I'll check the PEP on Wednesday.

2205
03:06:49,689 --> 03:06:54,893
[SPEAKER_18]: So to get to the 102, the remainder of those checks will be PEP tomorrow.

2206
03:06:56,574 --> 03:07:04,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Once we've approved applications, we have a seven-day turnaround in order for landlords to receive payments.

2207
03:07:06,468 --> 03:07:14,895
[SPEAKER_25]: So currently we have then, not nine, we have 16 applicants that are waiting to be finalized or require additional documentation.

2208
03:07:15,635 --> 03:07:15,975
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

2209
03:07:16,816 --> 03:07:17,096
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2210
03:07:17,877 --> 03:07:21,940
[SPEAKER_25]: And all 51 Method residents.

2211
03:07:23,181 --> 03:07:24,702
[SPEAKER_18]: All 51 Method residents.

2212
03:07:25,142 --> 03:07:28,625
[SPEAKER_25]: And how many total applications did we receive from Method residents?

2213
03:07:32,368 --> 03:07:33,529
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it was 67.

2214
03:07:44,340 --> 03:07:53,925
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so I assume the 16 that didn't get anything because they didn't meet the eligibility requirements.

2215
03:07:54,986 --> 03:08:00,649
[SPEAKER_18]: It's either they didn't meet the eligibility requirements or their landlord refused to participate.

2216
03:08:03,468 --> 03:08:10,311
[SPEAKER_25]: And so the number I come up with is, I know Councilor Morrell just gave a ballpark, but it's 103,304.

2217
03:08:10,351 --> 03:08:12,131
[SPEAKER_25]: That means we have roughly $22,000 or $21,700 left in the account.

2218
03:08:12,151 --> 03:08:17,113
[SPEAKER_25]: And your average is $2,000 per person, so that would lead me to believe there's about 11 or

2219
03:08:32,301 --> 03:08:34,482
[SPEAKER_25]: more residents that we can get on this.

2220
03:08:36,262 --> 03:08:40,543
[SPEAKER_25]: And how many applications do we have in the bucket right now?

2221
03:08:41,703 --> 03:08:42,644
[SPEAKER_25]: Not including the 51.

2222
03:08:42,684 --> 03:08:45,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Not including the 51.

2223
03:08:45,264 --> 03:08:46,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, we have nine.

2224
03:08:47,165 --> 03:08:47,685
[SPEAKER_25]: You have nine.

2225
03:08:48,025 --> 03:08:53,486
[SPEAKER_25]: So you have ample money in there right now to address the needs that you currently have.

2226
03:08:53,546 --> 03:08:53,666
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2227
03:08:53,686 --> 03:08:53,726
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

2228
03:08:57,658 --> 03:09:12,349
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think one of the issues that this council was concerned about, and that's why we didn't move forward, although you run a great program and I thank you for all your efforts, that we didn't want to allocate all the money because we didn't know the demand on this program and so forth.

2229
03:09:13,070 --> 03:09:14,791
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm glad to see there is a demand.

2230
03:09:15,952 --> 03:09:18,934
[SPEAKER_25]: Not glad to see there's a demand, I'm glad to see we're able to meet the demand.

2231
03:09:20,555 --> 03:09:23,257
[SPEAKER_25]: It's unfortunate that there's a demand, but

2232
03:09:25,949 --> 03:09:44,052
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if my colleagues want to appropriate the full 125,000, or should we take a portion of that knowing that we already have money in the account, $21,000 in the account, and we can accommodate everyone that's in the queue right now.

2233
03:09:44,712 --> 03:09:49,853
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we want to give half of the 125 and then revisit it in another few months when you need it?

2234
03:09:49,873 --> 03:09:51,754
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, that seems to be the,

2235
03:09:56,347 --> 03:09:59,208
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know the oversight that I think we should have as a body.

2236
03:10:00,308 --> 03:10:02,928
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm open to any of my suggestions from my colleagues.

2237
03:10:04,468 --> 03:10:06,089
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would just put that out on the floor.

2238
03:10:06,469 --> 03:10:18,611
[SPEAKER_25]: I wouldn't be opposed to allocating half of the 125 at this point, knowing that we have enough for an additional 11, and there's only eight or nine in the queue, I think was just mentioned.

2239
03:10:19,051 --> 03:10:21,151
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would oppose that to my colleagues.

2240
03:10:21,972 --> 03:10:22,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2241
03:10:23,012 --> 03:10:23,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morrell.

2242
03:10:25,334 --> 03:10:26,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2243
03:10:26,375 --> 03:10:30,478
[SPEAKER_12]: So this report, I know it's, the report is dated September 10th through October 6th.

2244
03:10:30,959 --> 03:10:42,229
[SPEAKER_12]: So the 51 applicants and what time period, this was a month and a half that we went through 51 applicants or what was the actual time period for this, I guess?

2245
03:10:42,249 --> 03:10:45,972
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that is a, that is a cumulative number.

2246
03:10:47,977 --> 03:10:54,661
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe we started, I started in June, so I believe the first month was the month of June.

2247
03:10:54,882 --> 03:10:55,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2248
03:10:55,102 --> 03:11:00,485
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it was June.

2249
03:11:00,505 --> 03:11:07,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, we started advertising the program in May, but I believe that the first applications came in in June.

2250
03:11:09,255 --> 03:11:12,477
[SPEAKER_12]: And were those applications, were they evenly spread out?

2251
03:11:12,538 --> 03:11:19,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they start to come, you know, have you had more in recent times as opposed to back in June or July?

2252
03:11:19,162 --> 03:11:25,747
[SPEAKER_18]: So from June, they really, they kind of tripled in in June.

2253
03:11:25,787 --> 03:11:38,297
[SPEAKER_18]: We are starting to see a little uptick, but we also are providing stabilization services and making sure that people can sustain housing once we provide assistance.

2254
03:11:39,400 --> 03:11:41,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we're starting to see the uptick.

2255
03:11:41,501 --> 03:11:50,968
[SPEAKER_18]: I think people are getting a little nervous because of the backlog with the RAP funding and they're starting to look for other resources.

2256
03:11:52,874 --> 03:11:53,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2257
03:11:53,835 --> 03:12:04,401
[SPEAKER_12]: So would you anticipate this need would probably be at a faster rate or a higher rate than came through in the previous months?

2258
03:12:04,461 --> 03:12:09,044
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to see as we're extrapolating out the amount of money that's needed.

2259
03:12:09,104 --> 03:12:18,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you anticipate based on the trends you're seeing, understanding that the expiration of the eviction moratorium and people's concern about RAF, do you

2260
03:12:18,770 --> 03:12:23,035
[SPEAKER_12]: that we're going to have a higher rate of these applications coming through.

2261
03:12:23,055 --> 03:12:26,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Anticipate probably just a higher rate of these applications coming through.

2262
03:12:30,918 --> 03:12:31,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caviello.

2263
03:12:31,939 --> 03:12:34,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2264
03:12:34,401 --> 03:12:40,928
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to thank our council for last time for making sure that this money all went to Memphis residents.

2265
03:12:40,948 --> 03:12:45,712
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think we all did the right thing in assisting that happen.

2266
03:12:46,233 --> 03:12:51,778
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will support Councilor Marks' motion for the $75, similar to what we did last time.

2267
03:12:52,939 --> 03:12:55,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Because as I say, you can come back any time and get more.

2268
03:12:55,944 --> 03:12:59,189
[SPEAKER_19]: So I will support his motion for that.

2269
03:12:59,710 --> 03:13:01,833
[SPEAKER_19]: On the veteran services.

2270
03:13:03,030 --> 03:13:08,212
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, these are monuments, a lot of these monuments you see throughout the city have deteriorated over the years.

2271
03:13:08,952 --> 03:13:16,155
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm glad to see Mike Durham is getting out there, doing some a little bit at a time.

2272
03:13:16,235 --> 03:13:22,657
[SPEAKER_19]: I know the Cemetery Board is trying to do some of the monuments up there.

2273
03:13:23,057 --> 03:13:30,100
[SPEAKER_19]: And these are monuments for our history in Medford, and they should be restored to their position.

2274
03:13:30,980 --> 03:13:31,501
[SPEAKER_19]: I know they did,

2275
03:13:32,601 --> 03:13:36,467
[SPEAKER_19]: A great job was done on the World War I memorial on Forest Street.

2276
03:13:36,827 --> 03:13:42,655
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, this is a good thing that we're doing, bringing back some of the monuments.

2277
03:13:42,855 --> 03:13:45,559
[SPEAKER_19]: As I say, it's part of our history and people should know about them.

2278
03:13:46,478 --> 03:13:57,142
[SPEAKER_19]: And as far as on the trees, I would hope that after we do these trees, the assessment that we get out there quickly and replace the trees in the cemetery again.

2279
03:13:57,642 --> 03:14:08,026
[SPEAKER_19]: Cemetery is, again, that's one of our, it's a great thing in our city, and it should be maintained with the proper trees.

2280
03:14:10,373 --> 03:14:13,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Because as I said, it is an old cemetery and a lot of them are falling.

2281
03:14:14,275 --> 03:14:17,996
[SPEAKER_19]: And I hate to see one of them fall down on somebody or take down someone's grave.

2282
03:14:18,016 --> 03:14:22,078
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm glad we're doing an assessment of that and getting them all off the stuff.

2283
03:14:22,698 --> 03:14:23,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2284
03:14:25,519 --> 03:14:26,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

2285
03:14:29,502 --> 03:14:30,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2286
03:14:30,523 --> 03:14:31,403
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to go on record.

2287
03:14:31,563 --> 03:14:37,947
[SPEAKER_12]: I think ABCD has done a wonderful job administering this program.

2288
03:14:37,987 --> 03:14:47,192
[SPEAKER_12]: They've adhered to the parameters set by the council, and I think they're being very responsive and understanding of really what we're facing in this state, what residents of the state are facing.

2289
03:14:47,232 --> 03:14:56,738
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would be in favor of the full amount, you know, releasing the full amount that's been requested, the $125,000, as opposed to a smaller amount and asking them to come back.

2290
03:14:57,824 --> 03:14:58,444
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

2291
03:14:58,544 --> 03:14:59,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

2292
03:15:00,305 --> 03:15:00,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers.

2293
03:15:01,585 --> 03:15:04,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would also be supportive of the full amount, I think.

2294
03:15:06,626 --> 03:15:07,987
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the phrase?

2295
03:15:08,027 --> 03:15:09,107
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dark winter ahead.

2296
03:15:09,607 --> 03:15:11,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we want to be in a position where we don't have the resources.

2297
03:15:12,868 --> 03:15:25,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be happy to maybe come to a compromise position that any surplus funds still with ABCD by the end of the next fiscal year be revert to the CPA.

2298
03:15:26,799 --> 03:15:30,406
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if there are additional funds, then we know they're coming back.

2299
03:15:32,249 --> 03:15:36,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect there to be, but that would be my proposal.

2300
03:15:36,958 --> 03:15:37,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

2301
03:15:37,879 --> 03:15:38,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

2302
03:15:39,443 --> 03:15:44,145
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, in my opinion, clearly the process that we laid out is working.

2303
03:15:44,165 --> 03:15:45,246
[SPEAKER_25]: We allocated $125,000.

2304
03:15:45,346 --> 03:15:46,246
[SPEAKER_25]: ABCD is coming back to us now.

2305
03:15:46,266 --> 03:15:49,048
[SPEAKER_25]: They have a total of 21,696 that they still haven't expended.

2306
03:15:57,932 --> 03:16:00,795
[SPEAKER_25]: And now they're asking for more money, because the need's there, which is great.

2307
03:16:01,455 --> 03:16:05,839
[SPEAKER_25]: But we are in the process of giving them more money.

2308
03:16:06,420 --> 03:16:08,481
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't see a lag here.

2309
03:16:08,862 --> 03:16:12,705
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't see a reason why not for us to oversee the taxpayers' money.

2310
03:16:13,145 --> 03:16:15,648
[SPEAKER_25]: This is not money we pulled off the tree in the back of our house.

2311
03:16:16,208 --> 03:16:21,110
[SPEAKER_25]: This is taxpayers' money, and I think us as an oversight body is important, Mr. President.

2312
03:16:21,431 --> 03:16:26,393
[SPEAKER_25]: And it doesn't take much to present a paper to us like they are here tonight presenting a paper.

2313
03:16:26,733 --> 03:16:33,836
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we release $62,500 of the $125,000.

2314
03:16:34,077 --> 03:16:40,900
[SPEAKER_25]: And if need be, they can come back before us once that's expended and we can reallocate some more money.

2315
03:16:41,668 --> 03:16:43,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off with that in the form of a motion.

2316
03:16:44,089 --> 03:16:47,271
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Cardiello.

2317
03:16:47,731 --> 03:16:48,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Pierce.

2318
03:16:49,032 --> 03:16:51,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Would Councilor Marks be amenable to an amendment of $75,000?

2319
03:16:51,734 --> 03:16:55,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of half, we do $75,000 and $50,000.

2320
03:16:56,136 --> 03:17:00,259
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure.

2321
03:17:00,559 --> 03:17:01,319
[SPEAKER_25]: What's the difference?

2322
03:17:02,300 --> 03:17:04,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my concern is I think we should do all of it.

2323
03:17:04,961 --> 03:17:08,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the, we have the eviction moratorium expiring.

2324
03:17:08,532 --> 03:17:09,473
[SPEAKER_00]: We have winter coming.

2325
03:17:09,493 --> 03:17:13,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the time where we're going to see a surge in applications, which is what they've said over there.

2326
03:17:13,858 --> 03:17:20,985
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd just like to err on the side of caution and give them a little bit more in case demand is incredibly high.

2327
03:17:22,487 --> 03:17:22,687
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

2328
03:17:23,468 --> 03:17:26,611
[SPEAKER_25]: So in my opinion, and I could appreciate that,

2329
03:17:28,014 --> 03:17:32,238
[SPEAKER_25]: I as one member of the council, I'm not going to withhold one nickel from them if they're able to spend it.

2330
03:17:32,719 --> 03:17:34,940
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think my fellow colleagues feel the same way.

2331
03:17:35,601 --> 03:17:46,791
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm not sure why we wouldn't, I don't know why we'd want to give up our responsibility on behalf of the taxpayers to oversee this money and make sure it's judiciously spent.

2332
03:17:47,792 --> 03:17:51,375
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that's a responsibility of us as the governing body.

2333
03:17:51,395 --> 03:17:52,276
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.

2334
03:17:52,356 --> 03:17:53,277
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that at all.

2335
03:17:55,515 --> 03:17:56,976
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the time where it's going to come through.

2336
03:17:58,698 --> 03:18:02,220
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just heard that, you know, they have applications.

2337
03:18:02,440 --> 03:18:04,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we've heard that there may be a cash flow question, right?

2338
03:18:05,003 --> 03:18:06,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to try to avoid that.

2339
03:18:07,104 --> 03:18:15,811
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just what I heard here is, you know, we kept processing payments were coming back, but we, you know, we didn't want to run up to the edge here is basically what I think was said.

2340
03:18:15,911 --> 03:18:18,093
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just, I just want to err on the side of caution.

2341
03:18:19,288 --> 03:18:22,951
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my proposal, amend to 75,000, and then we can come back for the additional 50.

2342
03:18:24,312 --> 03:18:27,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I know we're all approving the money, that's just my suggestion.

2343
03:18:27,355 --> 03:18:31,338
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, so right now if we approve this 625, they would have 84,196 at their disposal.

2344
03:18:36,203 --> 03:18:41,609
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, I think that's appropriate, Mr. President, and I do believe that we should have the oversight.

2345
03:18:42,430 --> 03:18:48,257
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm glad at the beginning that we, as Councilor Knight mentioned, said that this can only go to Method residents.

2346
03:18:48,858 --> 03:18:51,441
[SPEAKER_25]: Because as you can see, this money would have been spent elsewhere.

2347
03:18:52,401 --> 03:18:59,285
[SPEAKER_25]: not our residents, and that we withheld half of it originally to take a look how this is going.

2348
03:18:59,545 --> 03:19:01,926
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's going well, and that's why we're releasing more money.

2349
03:19:02,826 --> 03:19:05,568
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm comfortable with what we're doing tonight, Mr. President.

2350
03:19:06,088 --> 03:19:09,930
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't think anyone behind this reeling wants to withhold money, Mr. President.

2351
03:19:10,268 --> 03:19:11,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2352
03:19:11,209 --> 03:19:17,613
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a motion on the floor by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caviello, amended by Councilor Knight.

2353
03:19:17,993 --> 03:19:23,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight, if I'm correct, Clerk Herderby didn't- Just that the money stays in the community.

2354
03:19:23,757 --> 03:19:25,678
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you want to make that as an amendment?

2355
03:19:26,219 --> 03:19:28,000
[SPEAKER_26]: Or a condition of appropriation.

2356
03:19:28,020 --> 03:19:33,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so Clerk Herderby, he sent me a message saying he needed clarification on that.

2357
03:19:34,544 --> 03:19:36,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk Herderby, are you okay with that?

2358
03:19:37,733 --> 03:19:41,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a condition of appropriation that there be a commitment to keep.

2359
03:19:42,018 --> 03:19:44,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

2360
03:19:44,762 --> 03:19:45,724
[SPEAKER_14]: One minute, please.

2361
03:19:51,219 --> 03:20:09,885
[SPEAKER_26]: Then I also had a question how much money do we have in the CPA housing reserve presently and I do believe last time the CPA was before us for this paper They were seeking us to appropriate 50% of the total at that point in time, so I'm just seeing where we are in terms of I think last time we were at about 550,000

2362
03:20:12,086 --> 03:20:13,868
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, about $500,000 in the CPA trust fund when they came for the $250,000 appropriation.

2363
03:20:13,888 --> 03:20:16,071
[SPEAKER_26]: We took that $250,000 appropriation and we turned it into $125,000 appropriation.

2364
03:20:16,091 --> 03:20:18,173
[SPEAKER_26]: So I guess the question is how much money remains in that?

2365
03:20:18,213 --> 03:20:20,276
[SPEAKER_26]: Roberta, would you be able to answer that question?

2366
03:20:32,347 --> 03:20:34,308
[SPEAKER_23]: I will try from memory.

2367
03:20:34,428 --> 03:20:36,589
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not prepared with that number off the top of my head.

2368
03:20:36,609 --> 03:20:48,036
[SPEAKER_23]: But in fact, the $500,000 was based on the funds that were estimated to be available for this fiscal year.

2369
03:20:48,536 --> 03:21:00,183
[SPEAKER_23]: And those were just the funds that were solely reserved for housing, not taking into account additional funds that could potentially be added to support housing this funding round.

2370
03:21:00,910 --> 03:21:09,317
[SPEAKER_23]: So there remains to be $250,000 in the housing reserve, approximately.

2371
03:21:10,158 --> 03:21:12,180
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't have the exact numbers in front of me.

2372
03:21:13,321 --> 03:21:18,125
[SPEAKER_23]: That has been reserved to be used exclusively for housing.

2373
03:21:21,430 --> 03:21:25,533
[SPEAKER_23]: As I said, that doesn't count the funds that could be added to the housing reserve this year.

2374
03:21:25,613 --> 03:21:25,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Hold on.

2375
03:21:25,834 --> 03:21:27,595
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me start with that because that confused me for a second.

2376
03:21:27,615 --> 03:21:31,358
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's $250,000 in the housing reserve that's planned to be used for housing.

2377
03:21:31,438 --> 03:21:33,800
[SPEAKER_26]: All the money in the housing reserve is used for housing, right?

2378
03:21:35,901 --> 03:21:36,182
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

2379
03:21:36,402 --> 03:21:38,063
[SPEAKER_23]: All the money that's in the housing reserve.

2380
03:21:38,123 --> 03:21:39,845
[SPEAKER_26]: I think what you were saying is we have $250,000 there.

2381
03:21:39,885 --> 03:21:45,669
[SPEAKER_26]: There's more money that we can put towards housing through other vehicles.

2382
03:21:47,586 --> 03:21:53,049
[SPEAKER_23]: Each year, the CPC has to set aside a minimum of 10% of its funds.

2383
03:21:53,169 --> 03:22:02,935
[SPEAKER_23]: And we receive approximately $1.5 million in funding a year through Medford taxpayers and through the state matching grant.

2384
03:22:03,675 --> 03:22:05,737
[SPEAKER_23]: Those are very rough numbers.

2385
03:22:05,837 --> 03:22:08,059
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't have the actual figures in front of me right now.

2386
03:22:08,479 --> 03:22:14,765
[SPEAKER_23]: So out of the $1.5 million a year, 10% of that automatically gets put toward the housing reserve.

2387
03:22:15,325 --> 03:22:26,395
[SPEAKER_23]: And last year, the CPC recommended to transfer an additional amount of money into the housing reserve above that automatic minimum.

2388
03:22:26,615 --> 03:22:28,496
[SPEAKER_26]: And that money was transferred from the general fund, right?

2389
03:22:28,556 --> 03:22:30,497
[SPEAKER_23]: And so at the beginning... Oh, stop, stop.

2390
03:22:30,557 --> 03:22:31,078
[SPEAKER_26]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2391
03:22:31,098 --> 03:22:31,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Slow down, slow down, slow down.

2392
03:22:32,018 --> 03:22:32,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Roberto, one minute, please.

2393
03:22:32,959 --> 03:22:33,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information.

2394
03:22:33,719 --> 03:22:42,284
[SPEAKER_26]: That money that got transferred into the housing reserve was money from the general bucket that we... Yes, from the general bucket.

2395
03:22:42,584 --> 03:22:42,924
[SPEAKER_23]: Correct.

2396
03:22:44,225 --> 03:22:47,807
[SPEAKER_23]: So, but once it's in the housing reserve, it can only be used for affordable housing.

2397
03:22:47,847 --> 03:22:48,047
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

2398
03:22:49,048 --> 03:22:49,208
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

2399
03:22:50,911 --> 03:22:55,133
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I guess the answer to the question is you don't know how much is in there, right?

2400
03:22:55,153 --> 03:23:00,116
[SPEAKER_23]: That was $500,000 in there at the time that we made the initial grant of $250,000.

2401
03:23:02,207 --> 03:23:06,850
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've committed the $250,000 toward this program.

2402
03:23:07,371 --> 03:23:14,296
[SPEAKER_23]: However, the money does not, first of all, we have set aside the full $250,000 toward this program.

2403
03:23:14,316 --> 03:23:16,177
[SPEAKER_23]: The city council only approved this program.

2404
03:23:16,197 --> 03:23:18,999
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, it's just a question.

2405
03:23:19,040 --> 03:23:21,982
[SPEAKER_26]: How much money do we have in the bucket, in the affordable housing bucket?

2406
03:23:22,722 --> 03:23:28,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Robert, I guess the question the councilor tonight is asking is how much money is in the affordable housing category.

2407
03:23:28,747 --> 03:23:30,388
[SPEAKER_26]: Category, bucket, account, whatever you want to call it.

2408
03:23:31,243 --> 03:23:37,987
[SPEAKER_23]: We still have the $250,000 in that category that was left over.

2409
03:23:39,048 --> 03:23:44,151
[SPEAKER_23]: We also have the $125,000 that the council did not recommend.

2410
03:23:44,591 --> 03:23:49,014
[SPEAKER_23]: So that makes, what, $375,000 are sitting in that bucket.

2411
03:23:50,175 --> 03:23:57,779
[SPEAKER_26]: And- And then those buckets don't get appropriate, those buckets don't get filled until the council makes the appropriation to spread the money out across them, correct?

2412
03:23:57,799 --> 03:23:58,940
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we do that annually usually?

2413
03:23:59,694 --> 03:24:00,754
[SPEAKER_26]: for compliance purposes.

2414
03:24:00,814 --> 03:24:01,054
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

2415
03:24:01,634 --> 03:24:02,855
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

2416
03:24:02,895 --> 03:24:04,555
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's $375,000 in there right now.

2417
03:24:05,055 --> 03:24:08,196
[SPEAKER_26]: Of that $375,000, 2 thirds of it is dedicated to housing.

2418
03:24:12,797 --> 03:24:13,257
[SPEAKER_26]: Or is it?

2419
03:24:13,577 --> 03:24:20,039
[SPEAKER_23]: Of the $375,000 that's in the housing reserve, all of that can only be used for housing.

2420
03:24:20,099 --> 03:24:20,359
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

2421
03:24:20,519 --> 03:24:25,320
[SPEAKER_26]: And 2 thirds of that is, I'm sorry, 1 third of that is dedicated to this project.

2422
03:24:26,200 --> 03:24:29,043
[SPEAKER_26]: this program as of right now.

2423
03:24:30,265 --> 03:24:31,766
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there any anticipation that you're going to come?

2424
03:24:31,846 --> 03:24:42,037
[SPEAKER_23]: One quarter of it is dedicated to this program as of right now and we have not touched the remaining portion.

2425
03:24:42,818 --> 03:24:43,219
[SPEAKER_26]: Pretty sure 125

2426
03:24:45,278 --> 03:24:50,861
[SPEAKER_26]: Is a third of 375, but we're not going to get into a math dispute over here.

2427
03:24:51,361 --> 03:24:54,222
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, so ultimately, we have some money in the account still.

2428
03:24:55,723 --> 03:24:58,804
[SPEAKER_26]: Six and one half a dozen, the other one, me, Mr. President, I think the program's doing well.

2429
03:24:58,864 --> 03:25:02,826
[SPEAKER_26]: Like Councilor Mark said, I'm not looking to hold a nickel back from this project.

2430
03:25:03,166 --> 03:25:04,667
[SPEAKER_26]: or this program, I think it's doing well.

2431
03:25:04,727 --> 03:25:09,169
[SPEAKER_26]: I can support it tonight in its full funding, or I can support it tonight in half funding.

2432
03:25:09,669 --> 03:25:17,213
[SPEAKER_26]: If the intent is to maintain a close and watchful eye on the funds as the board of directors of this community, then so be it.

2433
03:25:17,293 --> 03:25:22,575
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll support the resolution as amended that Councilor Marks put forward, if that's the direction that we want to go in.

2434
03:25:23,675 --> 03:25:26,077
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said, Mr. President, they're going to come back before us again.

2435
03:25:26,097 --> 03:25:27,737
[SPEAKER_26]: They're going to put another report before us.

2436
03:25:28,138 --> 03:25:30,859
[SPEAKER_26]: The report's either going to show that they're making strides or they're not.

2437
03:25:31,737 --> 03:25:34,099
[SPEAKER_26]: at which time we can reassess the situation.

2438
03:25:34,139 --> 03:25:36,542
[SPEAKER_26]: So I see no harm in erring on the side of caution.

2439
03:25:37,212 --> 03:25:37,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Layton.

2440
03:25:38,053 --> 03:25:39,894
[SPEAKER_16]: We have Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Beers.

2441
03:25:39,934 --> 03:25:40,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2442
03:25:40,735 --> 03:25:42,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick question to Roberta.

2443
03:25:42,036 --> 03:25:44,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberta, thank you for everything you do.

2444
03:25:44,217 --> 03:25:54,305
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we do only do half, it's not daunting or anything out of the ordinary that you'd have to go back and come back in a month.

2445
03:25:54,345 --> 03:26:01,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's say it is the, I hope, God bless, we don't get the funding spent in a month.

2446
03:26:01,830 --> 03:26:06,834
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not a daunting task to just come back to this council for the other half, correct?

2447
03:26:08,136 --> 03:26:28,487
[SPEAKER_23]: It does create an administrative burden because each time that we release more funding, we have to go back and recreate the grant agreement and have the grant agreement go through the legal department and to be signed by the grantee again.

2448
03:26:28,627 --> 03:26:33,450
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's an upfront administrative burden.

2449
03:26:33,590 --> 03:26:36,991
[SPEAKER_23]: And then again, coming back to the council,

2450
03:26:39,892 --> 03:26:40,995
[SPEAKER_23]: We have to do what we have to do.

2451
03:26:41,872 --> 03:26:51,036
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the council's prerogative to decide that you want to release the funding in smaller amounts rather than all at once.

2452
03:26:51,116 --> 03:26:59,039
[SPEAKER_23]: But it creates an administrative burden for both the city as well as the applicant to repeatedly come back to the council.

2453
03:26:59,319 --> 03:27:00,699
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2454
03:27:01,080 --> 03:27:09,483
[SPEAKER_26]: Through these Community Preservation Act funds, do we not fund a Community Preservation Act administrator to perform these administrative functions?

2455
03:27:11,040 --> 03:27:11,380
[SPEAKER_13]: We do.

2456
03:27:11,520 --> 03:27:12,101
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2457
03:27:12,301 --> 03:27:13,281
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a bird.

2458
03:27:13,602 --> 03:27:14,182
[SPEAKER_16]: She's right here.

2459
03:27:14,242 --> 03:27:15,523
[SPEAKER_16]: She has her, she has her hand up.

2460
03:27:15,543 --> 03:27:16,923
[SPEAKER_16]: She's going to be speaking next.

2461
03:27:18,124 --> 03:27:20,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have, I'd like to hear from her, John.

2462
03:27:20,706 --> 03:27:20,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2463
03:27:20,986 --> 03:27:21,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2464
03:27:21,726 --> 03:27:22,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

2465
03:27:22,667 --> 03:27:23,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Danielle Evans.

2466
03:27:24,128 --> 03:27:25,689
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to lower your hand here.

2467
03:27:25,709 --> 03:27:26,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

2468
03:27:27,470 --> 03:27:27,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2469
03:27:27,910 --> 03:27:28,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Daniel.

2470
03:27:30,932 --> 03:27:33,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott, do you want to hear from Danielle?

2471
03:27:33,933 --> 03:27:34,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott?

2472
03:27:35,614 --> 03:27:37,976
[SPEAKER_04]: If she can answer that question that I asked that, you know,

2473
03:27:39,876 --> 03:27:41,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Danielle, would you like to answer Councilor?

2474
03:27:41,217 --> 03:27:42,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

2475
03:27:42,297 --> 03:27:44,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you answer Councilor Scott Peli's question?

2476
03:27:47,260 --> 03:27:48,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Can he repeat the question?

2477
03:27:48,440 --> 03:27:48,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

2478
03:27:49,001 --> 03:27:51,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott Peli, can you please repeat the question?

2479
03:27:51,482 --> 03:27:52,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very simple.

2480
03:27:52,302 --> 03:27:59,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we split this in half, and I can understand why Council Marks is asking for that, how daunting is it?

2481
03:27:59,166 --> 03:28:04,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it, you know, would it be too difficult to come back in a month to ask for the other half?

2482
03:28:05,129 --> 03:28:06,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a difficult...

2483
03:28:08,992 --> 03:28:14,257
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it does, there is an administrative process that we have to go through.

2484
03:28:14,718 --> 03:28:23,166
[SPEAKER_22]: First, we have to wait for the council paper to make it to Alicia, who then has to transfer funds to the account.

2485
03:28:23,947 --> 03:28:29,852
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we have to amend the grant agreement, circulate it for all the signatures, and then,

2486
03:28:31,668 --> 03:28:35,089
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it shouldn't be too hard to amend the agreement, because it's written.

2487
03:28:35,149 --> 03:28:38,509
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a pretty detailed agreement.

2488
03:28:39,330 --> 03:28:40,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not months.

2489
03:28:40,730 --> 03:28:41,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Pardon me?

2490
03:28:42,150 --> 03:28:43,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not months, correct?

2491
03:28:43,911 --> 03:28:44,791
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weeks.

2492
03:28:45,431 --> 03:28:47,051
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it'll take at least a couple of weeks.

2493
03:28:47,291 --> 03:28:47,931
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

2494
03:28:48,331 --> 03:28:48,531
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

2495
03:28:50,072 --> 03:28:55,933
[SPEAKER_22]: But President Delto, if I could just add one thing, if I may, about oversight.

2496
03:28:57,673 --> 03:28:58,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Please continue.

2497
03:29:01,419 --> 03:29:07,043
[SPEAKER_22]: to mention, and I hope this could alleviate some concerns, is that we don't front the entire amount.

2498
03:29:07,563 --> 03:29:14,427
[SPEAKER_22]: The only, so ABCD has only been given 75K initially, and we do that with all the grants.

2499
03:29:14,868 --> 03:29:16,509
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't give them all the money.

2500
03:29:17,349 --> 03:29:22,172
[SPEAKER_22]: We'd like to see how a portion of it is spent, and then they provide all the backup documentation.

2501
03:29:22,212 --> 03:29:29,297
[SPEAKER_22]: So Anne sent me copies of all the checks in the amounts to everyone they went to, to the landlords that they went to,

2502
03:29:29,884 --> 03:29:34,467
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I was satisfied with how it had spent down in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement.

2503
03:29:34,987 --> 03:29:42,493
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I processed the remaining $60,000, and that check should hopefully go out this week.

2504
03:29:43,133 --> 03:29:48,817
[SPEAKER_22]: And they also have the finance department, which is looking at it, and they wanted a little bit more detail.

2505
03:29:49,317 --> 03:29:53,180
[SPEAKER_22]: So that slowed it down, but it shows that there's so many eyes on it.

2506
03:29:53,820 --> 03:29:59,364
[SPEAKER_22]: And so what you appropriated tonight, we wouldn't be just writing them a check for that.

2507
03:29:59,897 --> 03:30:07,180
[SPEAKER_22]: We would, again, kind of divvy it up into what's in the pipeline, wait for the backup, see how it looks then.

2508
03:30:07,861 --> 03:30:16,125
[SPEAKER_22]: And then once they have the grantees lined up, we would release the rest.

2509
03:30:16,265 --> 03:30:22,187
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's not a situation where we're clawing back a huge amount of funds.

2510
03:30:22,227 --> 03:30:27,530
[SPEAKER_22]: They're pretty much, the money is pretty much spoken for before the checks are cut.

2511
03:30:30,927 --> 03:30:32,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to add that.

2512
03:30:32,928 --> 03:30:33,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for that.

2513
03:30:34,109 --> 03:30:36,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for updating us with that information.

2514
03:30:37,151 --> 03:30:37,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2515
03:30:37,852 --> 03:30:45,817
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want to go off on a tangent, but so what I'm hearing is when the council takes a vote to appropriate funds, those funds don't get appropriated until all at once.

2516
03:30:45,997 --> 03:30:52,041
[SPEAKER_26]: Or is this a situation where it's a monitoring of the grant agreement to ensure that there's compliance?

2517
03:30:54,302 --> 03:30:54,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it the latter?

2518
03:30:56,335 --> 03:30:58,397
[SPEAKER_26]: And you can just say the first or the latter, the former or the latter.

2519
03:30:58,437 --> 03:31:08,445
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I'm not looking for a dissertation, but from the way I just heard it was that the council takes a vote, they vote to expend $125,000, then it goes into an office and the office only gives them 50 or 80 or 70.

2520
03:31:09,085 --> 03:31:10,306
[SPEAKER_26]: That's not what the council voted for.

2521
03:31:10,606 --> 03:31:16,411
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm assuming that the reason why all the money's not released is because you wanted to monitor the grant for compliance, but that's not really what I heard.

2522
03:31:16,491 --> 03:31:17,732
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just wanted a confirmation on that.

2523
03:31:19,834 --> 03:31:24,958
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's monitoring to make sure that it's going to the correct places, to the correct people.

2524
03:31:25,178 --> 03:31:25,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2525
03:31:26,203 --> 03:31:26,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

2526
03:31:27,403 --> 03:31:28,744
[SPEAKER_16]: Move the motion, Mr. President.

2527
03:31:28,784 --> 03:31:30,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers had a question that I believe.

2528
03:31:30,765 --> 03:31:31,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers, you had a question, right?

2529
03:31:32,686 --> 03:31:32,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2530
03:31:32,986 --> 03:31:39,108
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just don't, it took weeks to get the grant agreement and all the signatures and everything processed last time.

2531
03:31:39,148 --> 03:31:40,569
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take them weeks to do it this time.

2532
03:31:40,609 --> 03:31:45,211
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take them weeks to do it the next time when we have multiple offices, multiple eyes looking at it.

2533
03:31:45,691 --> 03:31:53,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a reason for a successful program, why we would appropriate less money to a successful program on the second round, add red tape and add administrative burden.

2534
03:31:53,954 --> 03:31:55,395
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this program's working well,

2535
03:31:55,893 --> 03:32:01,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're just asking people to come back here, have another hour long conversation about it, ask them to do two weeks of extra work.

2536
03:32:02,077 --> 03:32:03,217
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make sense to me.

2537
03:32:03,278 --> 03:32:04,878
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, I support the program.

2538
03:32:05,319 --> 03:32:12,243
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this moment in time, when we have so much on our plate as a council, when city staff has so much on their plate,

2539
03:32:12,900 --> 03:32:13,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not add to it.

2540
03:32:14,121 --> 03:32:15,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we trust this.

2541
03:32:15,401 --> 03:32:17,142
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen the results.

2542
03:32:17,422 --> 03:32:19,703
[SPEAKER_00]: We all agree that it's a good program that's successful.

2543
03:32:19,803 --> 03:32:21,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's appropriate the $125,000.

2544
03:32:22,524 --> 03:32:24,325
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being monitored by multiple offices.

2545
03:32:24,425 --> 03:32:30,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see a reason to do, again, we appropriated $125,000 on the first round.

2546
03:32:30,587 --> 03:32:32,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were clearly comfortable with it then.

2547
03:32:32,108 --> 03:32:33,568
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should be comfortable with it now.

2548
03:32:33,849 --> 03:32:34,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2549
03:32:35,391 --> 03:32:36,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Beres.

2550
03:32:36,973 --> 03:32:41,999
[SPEAKER_16]: So the motion on the floor is offered by Councilor Marks to reduce it to 62,500.

2551
03:32:43,200 --> 03:32:48,487
[SPEAKER_25]: Remember, Mr. President, that this program has been in effect since June.

2552
03:32:48,967 --> 03:32:54,934
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's been almost five months, Mr. President, and they still haven't expended the original amount we gave them.

2553
03:32:55,515 --> 03:32:57,656
[SPEAKER_25]: So they haven't still gone through the original amount.

2554
03:32:58,656 --> 03:33:04,577
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think this is being very careful and cautious with our money, Mr. President, taxpayer money.

2555
03:33:05,077 --> 03:33:10,479
[SPEAKER_25]: And as everyone behind this reel has stated, no one's going to hold back one nickel, Mr. President.

2556
03:33:11,119 --> 03:33:12,919
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think we're doing our due diligence here.

2557
03:33:12,939 --> 03:33:13,800
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all we're asking.

2558
03:33:14,800 --> 03:33:15,040
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2559
03:33:16,500 --> 03:33:22,502
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caviello, as amended by Councilor Knight.

2560
03:33:23,737 --> 03:33:28,478
[SPEAKER_00]: And one quick, is this just a motion to change the amount or would this also approve the amount?

2561
03:33:28,498 --> 03:33:31,899
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a motion to change the amount.

2562
03:33:31,919 --> 03:33:32,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Approve the 625.

2563
03:33:33,419 --> 03:33:34,820
[SPEAKER_16]: It is basically to approve the 625, yes.

2564
03:33:34,840 --> 03:33:37,680
[SPEAKER_16]: It's to change the amount and to approve.

2565
03:33:38,181 --> 03:33:38,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2566
03:33:41,882 --> 03:33:44,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I make a motion to approve the next 625 right after that?

2567
03:33:47,543 --> 03:33:48,443
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd like to do.

2568
03:33:50,284 --> 03:33:51,384
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor.

2569
03:33:58,517 --> 03:34:03,421
[SPEAKER_12]: The small grants are on the same paper, so would this be the 625 and both small grants?

2570
03:34:03,481 --> 03:34:04,942
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we should vote on these individually.

2571
03:34:04,962 --> 03:34:06,683
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's probably the best bet.

2572
03:34:07,224 --> 03:34:08,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep it nice and clean.

2573
03:34:09,525 --> 03:34:11,387
[SPEAKER_16]: So these will be separate.

2574
03:34:11,407 --> 03:34:11,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2575
03:34:12,868 --> 03:34:13,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Separate.

2576
03:34:15,453 --> 03:34:24,439
[SPEAKER_26]: By way of prior deliberation on a similar matter, we've always voted for each item individually for a CPA grant request.

2577
03:34:24,719 --> 03:34:31,222
[SPEAKER_26]: If you recall, there was an item before us where they wanted to fund a master plan for the DCR with no commitment for further construction.

2578
03:34:31,262 --> 03:34:37,526
[SPEAKER_26]: So we were going to put the upfront cost up to do the design and study for some sort of walking

2579
03:34:38,046 --> 03:34:42,309
[SPEAKER_26]: and there was no commitment from the state thereafter.

2580
03:34:42,369 --> 03:34:45,891
[SPEAKER_26]: So we said, why are we putting our money up for a plan that we don't know if we're going to get funding for?

2581
03:34:45,911 --> 03:34:51,814
[SPEAKER_26]: So we've approved a bunch of appropriations out of the CPA, but we didn't approve that one.

2582
03:34:52,194 --> 03:34:53,995
[SPEAKER_26]: So we've always taken them up as well.

2583
03:34:54,075 --> 03:34:56,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2584
03:34:57,617 --> 03:34:58,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2607
03:35:39,088 --> 03:35:39,548

2653

2654
03:37:20,470 --> 03:37:30,635
[SPEAKER_25]: regarding if an inventory was done on trees within Oak Grove over the last decade.

2655
03:37:31,215 --> 03:37:33,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, hasn't that paper been dispensed?

2656
03:37:34,517 --> 03:37:35,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me?

2657
03:37:36,118 --> 03:37:37,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't we dispensed with that paper?

2658
03:37:37,438 --> 03:37:40,940
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with trees.

2659
03:37:40,960 --> 03:37:49,204
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, if we can get a report back from tree wanted, whether or not there's been an inventory on trees at Oak Grove Summer Park.

2660
03:37:49,544 --> 03:37:49,684
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2661
03:37:50,862 --> 03:37:57,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Aggie, are you able to, we have Aggie on the line with us, so Aggie, are you able to confirm that that has been done or?

2662
03:37:57,685 --> 03:38:03,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I can hear you, thank you.

2663
03:38:03,787 --> 03:38:11,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks had a question and that was whether or not a tree inventory has been conducted within the past 10 years at Oak Grove Cemetery?

2664
03:38:11,191 --> 03:38:12,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Oak Grove Cemetery.

2665
03:38:12,091 --> 03:38:19,094
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember a study done and I thought an inventory done, I don't know if it was in the last 10 years, but maybe Aggie would know.

2666
03:38:22,570 --> 03:38:24,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the question, Councilor Mark.

2667
03:38:24,351 --> 03:38:31,613
[SPEAKER_17]: To my knowledge, no inventory of Grove Cemetery has been conducted since I became tree warden in 2009.

2668
03:38:32,813 --> 03:38:33,093
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2669
03:38:33,493 --> 03:38:35,914
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you know who marked the trees?

2670
03:38:37,554 --> 03:38:38,274
[SPEAKER_25]: The type of tree?

2671
03:38:38,334 --> 03:38:41,595
[SPEAKER_25]: There was little markings put on each tree and the type of tree?

2672
03:38:43,256 --> 03:38:44,496
[SPEAKER_25]: Was that done by the cemetery?

2673
03:38:47,257 --> 03:38:50,458
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure what you're referring to, Councilor.

2674
03:38:51,356 --> 03:38:58,460
[SPEAKER_25]: There's small metal tags on the trees telling the type of tree it is, if it's from China or, you know, the type of tree.

2675
03:38:59,160 --> 03:39:04,062
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was done to a number of trees in the cemetery.

2676
03:39:04,082 --> 03:39:14,728
[SPEAKER_17]: To my knowledge, those have been done many years ago, possibly by the cemetery or

2677
03:39:16,094 --> 03:39:18,235
[SPEAKER_17]: volunteers are going to start societies.

2678
03:39:18,555 --> 03:39:26,698
[SPEAKER_17]: I know they're extremely useful tags for identifying species and other important information, data planting and so forth.

2679
03:39:27,359 --> 03:39:31,520
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't specifically have knowledge of who installed those tags.

2680
03:39:31,560 --> 03:39:37,663
[SPEAKER_17]: But we hope to have such tags installed in the future once this tree inventory is established.

2681
03:39:38,403 --> 03:39:38,883
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, right.

2682
03:39:38,943 --> 03:39:42,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, I didn't know if that had anything to do with the previous inventory.

2683
03:39:42,445 --> 03:39:43,225
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why I was asking.

2684
03:39:44,587 --> 03:39:57,115
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been many years since one inventory has been done, and we look forward to this as a huge step to take an inventory so we can proceed to preserve the trees.

2685
03:39:57,255 --> 03:40:12,145
[SPEAKER_17]: It's extremely valuable for Oak Grove Cemetery, and to reinstitute the same varieties and species of trees, and to enhance the landscape for our future trees.

2686
03:40:14,978 --> 03:40:15,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2687
03:40:15,839 --> 03:40:16,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2688
03:40:17,140 --> 03:40:21,004
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Pizza to revert back to the regular order of business.

2689
03:40:21,945 --> 03:40:23,287

[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Fevella.

2705
03:40:37,262 --> 03:40:37,342
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2706
03:40:38,222 --> 03:40:39,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, 70 in favor, zero in the negative.

2707
03:40:39,664 --> 03:40:40,525

2708
03:40:40,545 --> 03:40:52,299
[SPEAKER_16]: 2-0-609 offered by Council and I, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council conduct a committee to hold for the purpose of addressing the complaint filed against the city relative to the contracting of the council zoning consultant.

2709
03:40:52,659 --> 03:40:53,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Council and I.

2710
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:54,622
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2711
03:40:54,682 --> 03:41:03,651
[SPEAKER_26]: Last week we received a correspondence from the administration relative to a complaint that was filed concerning the public bid for our zoning consultant.

2712
03:41:03,832 --> 03:41:13,963
[SPEAKER_26]: And I took an opportunity to read that document and it said that it was a dynamic and ongoing process and that the administration was doing their best to stay ahead of it and to keep the parties informed as to what was going on.

2713
03:41:14,823 --> 03:41:18,144
[SPEAKER_26]: in terms of the nature of the complaint, so on and so forth, and the investigating authority.

2714
03:41:18,664 --> 03:41:34,109
[SPEAKER_26]: With that being said, Mr. President, I think it would make sense for this council to meet to be provided with an update from the administration relative to the nature of the complaint, as well as what steps are being taken to ensure that the council is protected, and what impact this may have on our ability to continue working with Mr. Bobrowski.

2715
03:41:35,033 --> 03:41:36,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2716
03:41:36,716 --> 03:41:41,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight, do you want someone from the administration, I assume, at the meeting?

2717
03:41:41,666 --> 03:41:45,113
[SPEAKER_26]: And- I think that would be helpful, because we need to have the administration give us the update.

2718
03:41:47,743 --> 03:41:48,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoever they see fit.

2719
03:41:48,563 --> 03:41:50,504
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I don't want to, I don't know who's working on it.

2720
03:41:50,564 --> 03:41:52,726
[SPEAKER_26]: We have 27 lawyers from KP Law that represent us now.

2721
03:41:52,746 --> 03:41:54,067
[SPEAKER_26]: They might want to bring somebody in.

2722
03:41:54,107 --> 03:41:55,307
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know who's going to be handling it.

2723
03:41:55,708 --> 03:41:58,790
[SPEAKER_26]: My preference would be the chief of staff and the city solicitor, Mr. President.

2724
03:41:59,190 --> 03:42:04,053
[SPEAKER_26]: However, the administration is the one that's going to be running point on this.

2725
03:42:04,233 --> 03:42:07,915
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would hope that they provide us with the appropriate person that can answer the right questions.

2726
03:42:08,176 --> 03:42:08,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good.

2727
03:42:08,796 --> 03:42:09,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

2728
03:42:09,777 --> 03:42:10,417
[SPEAKER_26]: Second the motion.

2729
03:42:10,577 --> 03:42:12,578
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of council night, seconded by.

2730
03:42:13,039 --> 03:42:13,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

2731

[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Behrs.

2732
03:42:16,144 --> 03:42:17,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Does anybody want to comment on this?

2733
03:42:17,545 --> 03:42:17,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2734
03:42:17,865 --> 03:42:18,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk, please call the roll.

2735
03:42:20,107 --> 03:42:20,708

03:42:21,809 --> 03:42:22,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice-President Kerrio.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2741
03:42:24,932 --> 03:42:26,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Martins.

2742
03:42:26,293 --> 03:42:26,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2743
03:42:27,274 --> 03:42:27,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morrell.

2744
03:42:28,115 --> 03:42:28,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2745
03:42:29,056 --> 03:42:29,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2746
03:42:29,996 --> 03:42:30,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2747
03:42:30,897 --> 03:42:31,518
[SPEAKER_09]: President Fevella.

2748
03:42:31,838 --> 03:42:32,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2749
03:42:32,298 --> 03:42:33,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2750
03:42:33,900 --> 03:42:34,741
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes.

2751
03:42:35,682 --> 03:42:48,750
[SPEAKER_16]: 2-0-6-1-0, offered by Councilor Night, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request the city administration install a flashing pedestrian crossing sign at the crosswalk of Winthrop Street between the community gardens and Memorial Field.

2752
03:42:49,843 --> 03:42:50,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Layton.

2753
03:42:50,664 --> 03:42:51,905
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2754
03:42:51,965 --> 03:42:59,333
[SPEAKER_26]: Last week, we had a paper before us requesting appropriations from ride share revenues that the city has generated.

2755
03:42:59,873 --> 03:43:06,600
[SPEAKER_26]: And these ride share revenues are used to improve markings and signage in the community.

2756
03:43:07,802 --> 03:43:12,647
[SPEAKER_26]: If you look at Winthrop Street at Memorial Park between the hat shell right by the community gardens.

2757
03:43:13,207 --> 03:43:15,790
[SPEAKER_26]: and the field, you'll see that there's a crosswalk there.

2758
03:43:15,810 --> 03:43:25,639
[SPEAKER_26]: And there's been a number of years of discussion concerning the Winthrop Street-South Street intersection and the ability to cross Winthrop Street at that location.

2759
03:43:25,940 --> 03:43:34,428
[SPEAKER_26]: And studies have shown that because of the sight lines and the gradient, that that's not a place where they can put a working crosswalk with a red light, Mr. President.

2760
03:43:35,048 --> 03:43:45,435
[SPEAKER_26]: But I don't think anything would preclude us from being able to put some flashing beacons that would say that there is a crosswalk ahead and for people to be aware of pedestrians crossing the street in the area.

2761
03:43:45,955 --> 03:43:50,878
[SPEAKER_26]: So with that being said, I'd ask for approval of the paper, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.

2762
03:43:51,538 --> 03:43:52,179
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor.

2763
03:43:52,219 --> 03:43:52,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Baez.

2764
03:43:52,879 --> 03:43:53,259
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2765
03:43:53,300 --> 03:43:54,060
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

2766
03:43:54,100 --> 03:43:57,802
[SPEAKER_26]: And the associated cost of something like this, based upon the paper that was before us, is less than $3,000.

2767
03:43:57,982 --> 03:43:59,823
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Baez.

2768
03:44:00,124 --> 03:44:01,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2769
03:44:04,216 --> 03:44:08,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is really both smart and doable.

2770
03:44:08,239 --> 03:44:10,201
[SPEAKER_00]: So I support it and I second the motion.

2771
03:44:11,562 --> 03:44:14,304
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

2778
03:44:24,791 --> 03:44:25,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

03:44:26,252 --> 03:44:26,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morrell.

2780
03:44:27,133 --> 03:44:27,413

[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Kerrio.

2786
03:44:33,821 --> 03:44:34,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2787
03:44:35,068 --> 03:44:36,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Seventh affirmative motion passes.

2788
03:44:38,074 --> 03:44:48,262
[SPEAKER_19]: 20611, offered by President Falco, being resolved that the Memphis City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Regina Reggie Reynolds on her recent passing.

2789
03:44:48,302 --> 03:44:49,103
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

2790
03:44:49,263 --> 03:44:52,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Caviello.

2791
03:44:52,085 --> 03:45:04,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Mrs. Reynolds, long time resident of Fulton Heights, passed away recently, 95 years old, and good friends with a number of her family.

2792
03:45:04,455 --> 03:45:07,618
[SPEAKER_16]: And just thoughts and prayers go to her family, so thank you.

2793
03:45:08,067 --> 03:45:08,587
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2794
03:45:10,188 --> 03:45:10,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

2795
03:45:13,751 --> 03:45:16,873
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2796
03:45:16,893 --> 03:45:19,395
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could please take a moment of silence.

2797
03:45:32,543 --> 03:45:33,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2798
03:45:36,447 --> 03:45:37,027

2802
03:45:40,269 --> 03:45:40,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Martins?

2803
03:45:41,169 --> 03:45:41,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2804
03:45:42,409 --> 03:45:43,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morrell?

2805
03:45:43,270 --> 03:45:43,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2806
03:45:44,710 --> 03:45:45,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2807
03:45:45,571 --> 03:45:45,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2808
03:45:46,511 --> 03:45:47,272
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco?

2809
03:45:47,492 --> 03:45:47,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2810
03:45:48,392 --> 03:45:49,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Ferriero?

2811
03:45:49,512 --> 03:45:54,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, affirmative motion passes.

2812
03:45:54,234 --> 03:46:01,558
[SPEAKER_19]: 2-0-6-1-2 offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the storm drain in front of 48 Duna Street be repaired in the interest of public safety.

2813
03:46:01,598 --> 03:46:02,278
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco?

2814
03:46:02,910 --> 03:46:05,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Caviello.

2815
03:46:05,371 --> 03:46:09,272
[SPEAKER_16]: I was alerted to this by a resident recently up in the Duden Street area.

2816
03:46:09,552 --> 03:46:12,393
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did actually drive by and take a look at this myself.

2817
03:46:12,753 --> 03:46:17,874
[SPEAKER_16]: This is, I guess, a storm drain that's been in disrepair for a number of years.

2818
03:46:18,214 --> 03:46:23,116
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's an orange cone there planted on top of it, but it really needs to be addressed.

2819
03:46:23,176 --> 03:46:27,557
[SPEAKER_16]: So in the interest of public safety, if that could be addressed before the winter.

2820
03:46:28,271 --> 03:46:28,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2821
03:46:28,732 --> 03:46:29,152
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be great.

2822
03:46:29,272 --> 03:46:29,612
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2823
03:46:30,834 --> 03:46:33,476
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2824
03:46:34,096 --> 03:46:35,398
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2825
03:46:37,840 --> 03:46:38,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

2826
03:46:38,661 --> 03:46:38,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2827
03:46:39,701 --> 03:46:40,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

2828
03:46:40,542 --> 03:46:40,782
Yes.

2829
03:46:41,683 --> 03:46:42,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

2830
03:46:42,624 --> 03:46:42,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2831
03:46:43,725 --> 03:46:44,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morrell?

2832
03:46:44,706 --> 03:46:44,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2833
03:46:45,787 --> 03:46:46,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2834
03:46:46,728 --> 03:46:47,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2835
03:46:47,989 --> 03:46:48,790
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco?

2836
03:46:49,230 --> 03:46:49,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2837
03:46:50,211 --> 03:46:50,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caravaglia?

2838
03:46:50,992 --> 03:46:51,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2839
03:46:51,615 --> 03:46:53,537
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

2840
03:46:53,557 --> 03:47:02,504
[SPEAKER_19]: 20613 offered by President Falco, be it reserved that the tree stumps at the following addresses be removed in the interest of public safety.

2841
03:47:02,524 --> 03:47:07,449
[SPEAKER_19]: 3 Dawn Road, 7 Dawn Road, and 53 Doonan Street.

2842
03:47:07,849 --> 03:47:08,590
[SPEAKER_19]: President Falco.

2843
03:47:09,070 --> 03:47:10,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Calvillo.

2844
03:47:11,232 --> 03:47:16,016
[SPEAKER_16]: These here, I was alerted by a resident as well with regard to these three tree stumps.

2845
03:47:16,097 --> 03:47:18,238
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess these have been here for a number of years as well.

2846
03:47:18,999 --> 03:47:21,562
[SPEAKER_16]: And they really need to be removed.

2847
03:47:21,582 --> 03:47:25,085
[SPEAKER_16]: They've been there for at least a few years.

2848
03:47:25,836 --> 03:47:31,701
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we could have those removed by the DPW as soon as possible, greatly appreciate it.

2849
03:47:31,721 --> 03:47:40,928
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could amend the resolution to ask that we get an updated listing from the DPW with regard to just an updated stump removal list.

2850
03:47:41,188 --> 03:47:47,873
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to see how many were removed in the year 2020 and how many are left on that list.

2851
03:47:47,954 --> 03:47:48,834
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you.

2852
03:47:49,134 --> 03:47:52,717
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by President Falco, as amended by President Falco.

2853
03:47:52,777 --> 03:47:53,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President.

2854
03:47:53,870 --> 03:47:59,774
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may, could I also amend it to get a report on the, for lack of a better word, the stump dump, where we put all the stump?

2855
03:48:00,194 --> 03:48:06,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we get an update as well on the stump deposit location, the dump for stumps?

2856
03:48:06,698 --> 03:48:07,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it's called.

2857
03:48:08,780 --> 03:48:09,260
[SPEAKER_00]: The wood chips.

2858
03:48:12,440 --> 03:48:12,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Leif.

2859
03:48:13,480 --> 03:48:14,561
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2860
03:48:14,601 --> 03:48:18,803
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm hoping the councilor wouldn't mind me amending this paper to add a tree stump to it.

2861
03:48:19,523 --> 03:48:23,525
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is a tree stump that is on Lawrence Road, located between Summit and Terrace.

2862
03:48:23,965 --> 03:48:29,368
[SPEAKER_26]: It's directly across from the old entrance to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital's emergency room, Mr. President.

2863
03:48:29,508 --> 03:48:31,749
[SPEAKER_26]: And this tree stump is enormous.

2864
03:48:32,209 --> 03:48:39,393
[SPEAKER_26]: But what's troubling is that the city has removed five sidewalk panels and not replaced them for a period of about four months now.

2865
03:48:40,614 --> 03:48:51,843
[SPEAKER_26]: So while the residents are waiting for the stump grinder or stump dumper or whatever you want to call them to get out there and get rid of the stump, the sidewalk has been torn up and the sidewalk has not been replaced.

2866
03:48:52,644 --> 03:48:57,168
[SPEAKER_26]: So that sidewalk, a stretch of about four sidewalk panels, Mr. President, which would be about.

2867
03:48:58,271 --> 03:48:59,853
[SPEAKER_26]: I think each sidewalk panel is three feet long.

2868
03:49:01,234 --> 03:49:07,040
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're looking at anywhere between 12 feet of sidewalk that's just asphalt.

2869
03:49:07,540 --> 03:49:09,703
[SPEAKER_26]: Not even asphalt, just dirt, all broken up.

2870
03:49:10,283 --> 03:49:15,628
[SPEAKER_26]: So with that being said, I'd just like to amend the paper to include that as a priority stump to be removed and sidewalk replaced.

2871
03:49:16,329 --> 03:49:19,753
[SPEAKER_19]: I did drive by there today and I saw they were putting new sidewalk in on

2872
03:49:20,879 --> 03:49:27,061
[SPEAKER_19]: on Governor's Avenue side, and I saw that there's those four or five panels that are still there.

2873
03:49:27,402 --> 03:49:37,345
[SPEAKER_19]: So, on the motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by President Falco, and then amended by Councilor Behrs, and amended by Councilor Knight.

[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

2894
03:50:05,823 --> 03:50:19,673
[SPEAKER_16]: 20-615 offered by Vice President Caviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council have the DPW replace the safety sign in the island on High Street at the Brooks School in the interest of public safety, Vice President Caviello.

2895
03:50:19,773 --> 03:50:20,593
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2896
03:50:20,613 --> 03:50:29,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, this is something that was done as a traffic calming thing, and they put an island right in front of the, by the Brooks School on Austin Street.

2897
03:50:32,056 --> 03:50:33,456
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was a safety sign right in the middle.

2898
03:50:33,476 --> 03:50:35,557
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm surprised that someone hasn't run it over before.

2899
03:50:36,117 --> 03:50:37,738
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's finally been run over.

2900
03:50:38,418 --> 03:50:44,380
[SPEAKER_19]: And if it can be replaced, then maybe possibly with maybe something blinking so that people know it's there.

2901
03:50:44,400 --> 03:50:46,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they say it's in the middle, it's dark over there.

2902
03:50:46,781 --> 03:50:49,922
[SPEAKER_19]: So if they could do that in the interest of public safety, it would be appreciated, Mr. President.

2903
03:50:49,942 --> 03:50:53,303
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Vice President Carviello, seconded by?

2904
03:50:54,904 --> 03:50:55,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Laurel.

2905
03:50:58,650 --> 03:51:05,333
[SPEAKER_26]: I just like to amend the paper, Mr. President, to add a couple of items.

2906
03:51:05,373 --> 03:51:06,794
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Caviello is absolutely right.

2907
03:51:07,154 --> 03:51:11,716
[SPEAKER_26]: That traffic island that was recently installed has been damaged.

2908
03:51:12,116 --> 03:51:13,557
[SPEAKER_26]: And if we take a ride further down,

2909
03:51:13,900 --> 03:51:25,704
[SPEAKER_26]: the street, and we come to Placelet Road and High Street, we'll see that we have a number of reflector beacons that cross the train tracks and provide warning that the train tracks are there that are damaged, Mr. President.

2910
03:51:25,724 --> 03:51:37,267
[SPEAKER_26]: So the reflector beacons at the railroad crossing between Placelet Road and Harvard, as well as the reflector beacons at the railroad crossing at Prescott and Canal need to be repaired.

2911
03:51:37,287 --> 03:51:40,468
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'd like to add this to that paper, provided my council colleague has no issue.

2912
03:51:41,066 --> 03:51:41,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2913
03:51:41,366 --> 03:51:41,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good.

2914
03:51:41,786 --> 03:51:42,046

[SPEAKER_09]: Can I get a second set of streets from council night, please?

2920
03:51:56,250 --> 03:51:58,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a place that at Harvard, but I didn't get the other one.

2921
03:51:58,551 --> 03:52:05,113
[SPEAKER_26]: High street between place that in Harvard and canal between Prescott and the railroad crossing.

2922
03:52:05,133 --> 03:52:05,613
Okay.

2923
03:52:07,478 --> 03:52:12,841
[SPEAKER_16]: So on that motion offered by Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Morrell, as amended by Councilor Night.

2944
03:52:42,264 --> 03:52:46,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Behrs is the chair of the DPW Public Works.

2945
03:52:47,629 --> 03:52:49,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you tell us a little bit about that meeting?

2946
03:52:49,471 --> 03:52:49,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2947
03:52:50,071 --> 03:52:57,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had a great meeting with Councilor Marks, Councilor, Vice President Carviello, or should I say President-elect Carviello and

2948
03:52:58,440 --> 03:53:01,863
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed snow shoveling, the snow shoveling ordinance and proposed amendments.

2949
03:53:01,903 --> 03:53:12,492
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some members of our DPW in attendance, DPW staff, as well as a lot of citizens, folks from WAC Medford, Mass In Motion coordinator.

2950
03:53:12,512 --> 03:53:21,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've started on a good path to looking at amendments to the snow shoveling ordinance and hopefully making sure that our sidewalks are clear for

2951
03:53:22,832 --> 03:53:32,735
[SPEAKER_00]: All residents during the winter, senior citizens, people with disabilities, so that we can get around during the winter safely without a risk to people's health and safety.

2952
03:53:34,336 --> 03:53:45,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will have future meetings of the subcommittee looking at the issues of enforcement and fines and some of the other questions that we still have outstanding, priority sidewalk list, et cetera.

2953
03:53:46,079 --> 03:53:47,620
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking forward to it.

2954
03:53:48,280 --> 03:53:48,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2955
03:53:48,600 --> 03:53:49,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

2956
03:53:49,460 --> 03:53:50,701
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Peers.

2957
03:53:51,301 --> 03:53:53,742
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to commend Councilor Beers on conducting a great meeting.

2958
03:53:53,782 --> 03:53:57,803
[SPEAKER_26]: I was very impressed at the way he held the meeting, how he handled it.

2959
03:53:57,843 --> 03:54:04,905
[SPEAKER_26]: But I'm also more impressed with the fact that he actually had representatives from the DPW here present in the council chambers to address some of the concerns.

2960
03:54:05,225 --> 03:54:09,006
[SPEAKER_26]: I've always been a firm believer that if we're going to get things done, we have to get in the same room and roll up our sleeves.

2961
03:54:09,466 --> 03:54:17,648
[SPEAKER_26]: And I was very impressed that Councilor Beers took the steps to allow these individuals here in the community to come before the council subcommittee and address some of their concerns and help out.

2962
03:54:18,008 --> 03:54:20,029
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'd like to thank him for that and move approval of the paper.

2963
03:54:20,249 --> 03:54:25,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I may, if you can figure out how they got in the room, I'd be happy if you let me know.

2964
03:54:25,733 --> 03:54:26,274
[SPEAKER_26]: City employees.

2965
03:54:26,474 --> 03:54:27,475
[SPEAKER_26]: City Hall is open to city employees, right?

2966
03:54:28,055 --> 03:54:28,335
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know.

2967
03:54:28,375 --> 03:54:29,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think city staff.

2968
03:54:29,436 --> 03:54:30,637
[SPEAKER_00]: They got keys.

2969
03:54:30,657 --> 03:54:31,277

03:56:31,492 --> 03:56:31,733

3025
03:56:35,416 --> 03:56:35,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

3026
03:56:36,517 --> 03:56:37,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3027
03:56:37,377 --> 03:56:37,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

03:56:38,298 --> 03:56:38,859
[SPEAKER_09]: President Fevella?

3029
03:56:39,339 --> 03:56:39,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

3030
03:56:39,899 --> 03:56:41,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Senate affirmative, is there any negative?

3031
03:56:41,401 --> 03:56:42,161
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes.

3032
03:56:42,181 --> 03:56:54,732
[SPEAKER_16]: 2-0-619 offered by Councilor Night and Vice-President Caviello be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Lucille Tonello on her recent passing.

3033
03:56:55,717 --> 03:56:56,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Defer to the Vice President.

3034
03:56:56,438 --> 03:56:56,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caviello.

3035
03:56:57,159 --> 03:56:57,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3036
03:56:57,899 --> 03:56:58,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Night.

3037
03:57:00,663 --> 03:57:05,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Lucille Tonello was a crossing guide for the city of Medford for many years.

3038
03:57:05,828 --> 03:57:07,730
[SPEAKER_19]: She was supervisor of the crossing guides.

3039
03:57:07,811 --> 03:57:12,416
[SPEAKER_19]: And Lucille goes back to the days when kids actually walked to school.

3040
03:57:13,437 --> 03:57:22,479
[SPEAKER_19]: And you had the same crossing guard for many years, and she knew your parents, and she knew the kids by name, and they wore uniforms, and they were almost like policemen.

3041
03:57:23,219 --> 03:57:30,761
[SPEAKER_19]: And they march in the parade, so that's a generation of a woman that's no longer around anymore.

3042
03:57:31,661 --> 03:57:37,882
[SPEAKER_19]: But let's say, you know, she was there all the time for these kids, you know, watched over them.

3043
03:57:39,103 --> 03:57:40,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Parents would call her.

3044
03:57:40,483 --> 03:57:44,864
[SPEAKER_19]: to make sure, hey, I'm not going to be home, make sure Johnny gets home.

3045
03:57:45,184 --> 03:57:48,024
[SPEAKER_19]: She would do that, and many times, she would drive the kids home.

3046
03:57:48,544 --> 03:57:54,385
[SPEAKER_19]: So like I say, she goes back to that generation of the crossing guards, where I say, why are you in the farms?

3047
03:57:54,425 --> 03:57:57,786
[SPEAKER_19]: And I say, they knew the neighbor, they knew the kids, they knew the parents.

3048
03:57:58,626 --> 03:58:05,027
[SPEAKER_19]: And she's a good woman, and I got to know her over the years, and her presence will be missed in our community.

3049
03:58:05,347 --> 03:58:08,628
[SPEAKER_19]: And condolences to the family.

3050
03:58:09,531 --> 03:58:10,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

3051
03:58:10,912 --> 03:58:11,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Night.

3052
03:58:12,153 --> 03:58:13,554
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

3053
03:58:14,675 --> 03:58:17,858
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'd like to extend my condolences to the Tinello family as well.

3054
03:58:18,158 --> 03:58:22,161
[SPEAKER_26]: Mrs. Tinello, 95 years young at the day of her passing.

3055
03:58:23,266 --> 03:58:26,028
[SPEAKER_26]: a great mother, role model, grandmother.

3056
03:58:26,188 --> 03:58:31,191
[SPEAKER_26]: I've had the good fortune of being friendly with her grandson, Jeffrey, and granddaughter, Alicia, for a number of years.

3057
03:58:32,091 --> 03:58:35,033
[SPEAKER_26]: Over the years, I've also gotten to meet her sons, Mark and Joe.

3058
03:58:35,653 --> 03:58:37,514
[SPEAKER_26]: We all know Ellen Tonello from the library.

3059
03:58:38,315 --> 03:58:40,436
[SPEAKER_26]: The Tonellos are very involved in the city of Medford.

3060
03:58:40,476 --> 03:58:43,638
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe they've lived here since prior to 1930.

3061
03:58:44,258 --> 03:58:47,360
[SPEAKER_26]: The family goes back to prior to 1930 in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

3062
03:58:48,000 --> 03:58:51,026
[SPEAKER_26]: Grew up on Linden Street, lived right down on Linden Street near the old drive-in.

3063
03:58:51,567 --> 03:58:58,621
[SPEAKER_26]: And a little funny family story was that they lived so close to the drive-in movie theater that the drive-in gave them one of the radios.

3064
03:58:59,562 --> 03:59:01,203
[SPEAKER_26]: cause they could see all the movies from their kitchen.

3065
03:59:01,964 --> 03:59:06,627
[SPEAKER_26]: So they had one of the radios, they could actually listen to the movies too in their house.

3066
03:59:07,368 --> 03:59:12,772
[SPEAKER_26]: But, you know, Mrs. Tonello was a aunt to my good friend, Frank and Jack DePaola.

3067
03:59:12,972 --> 03:59:16,815
[SPEAKER_26]: Frankie and Jackie share that story all the time and she's going to be greatly missed.

3068
03:59:17,055 --> 03:59:21,318
[SPEAKER_26]: To Mark and Joe and the rest of the family, my deepest condolences and I hope my council colleagues can join us.

3069
03:59:21,398 --> 03:59:22,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you councilor.

3070
03:59:22,780 --> 03:59:27,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Is present motion that we... If I may, we want to say council Marks.

3071
03:59:28,295 --> 03:59:29,295
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3072
03:59:29,315 --> 03:59:32,216
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on.

3073
03:59:32,936 --> 03:59:40,778
[SPEAKER_25]: The Tonello family is synonymous with community and civic duty in this community for many, many decades.

3074
03:59:41,598 --> 03:59:48,440
[SPEAKER_25]: And from what I hear, I didn't know Lucille, but from what I hear, she was a true family person, loved to be around family and friends.

3075
03:59:49,320 --> 03:59:55,501
[SPEAKER_25]: And I want to thank her for her many years of dedicated service on behalf of the children in our community.

3076
03:59:56,042 --> 03:59:57,722
[SPEAKER_25]: And she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

3077
03:59:57,942 --> 03:59:58,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3078
04:00:01,848 --> 04:00:02,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Carviello.

3079
04:00:02,710 --> 04:00:05,234
[SPEAKER_19]: A motion that we hold this meeting in her honor.

3080
04:00:05,554 --> 04:00:06,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

3081
04:00:06,335 --> 04:00:08,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

3082
04:00:13,076 --> 04:00:17,599
[SPEAKER_16]: My condolences go to the Tonello family, good friends with her son, Mark.

3083
04:00:18,200 --> 04:00:26,266
[SPEAKER_16]: And like all my colleagues said, the Tonello family has always been involved in many, many, many ways in our city.

3084
04:00:26,566 --> 04:00:31,189
[SPEAKER_16]: And they've always given back and thoughts and prayers go out to the Tonello family.

3085
04:00:31,890 --> 04:00:34,732
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I may, before we have a moment of silence,

3086
04:00:36,721 --> 04:00:39,263
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'll do this under suspension if you don't mind from the chair.

3087
04:00:41,065 --> 04:00:51,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I was taking a walk on Saturday and as I was walking, I went into Hickey Park and when I go to the park, sometimes you read the stones in the ground as far as the memorial plaques.

3088
04:00:52,055 --> 04:00:57,180
[SPEAKER_16]: And I couldn't help but notice it, which was really odd that Hickey Park,

3089
04:00:57,892 --> 04:01:03,936
[SPEAKER_16]: is named in honor of George W. Hickey, who was the youngest soldier from the city of Medford to enlist in the U.S.

3090
04:01:04,016 --> 04:01:04,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Army Infantry.

3091
04:01:05,617 --> 04:01:15,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Infantryman Hickey was killed in action in France on October 24, 2018, which was the same day I walked by the plaque, 102 years later.

3092
04:01:16,304 --> 04:01:25,210
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think if we could also have a moment of silence in Infantryman Hickey's

3093
04:01:27,302 --> 04:01:30,973
[SPEAKER_16]: honor on the 102nd anniversary of his passing.

3094
04:01:30,993 --> 04:01:34,804
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point in time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

3095
04:02:00,949 --> 04:02:02,290
[SPEAKER_11]: We have one more thing.

3096
04:02:02,871 --> 04:02:03,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have minutes?

3097
04:02:03,291 --> 04:02:04,452
[SPEAKER_00]: We're supposed to take up records.

3098
04:02:09,316 --> 04:02:09,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Records!

3099
04:02:10,897 --> 04:02:15,701
[SPEAKER_16]: The records of the meeting of October 20th, 2020 were passed to Vice President Caviello.

3100
04:02:16,101 --> 04:02:18,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caviello, how did you find those records?

3101
04:02:18,743 --> 04:02:21,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the records and I found them to be impeccable.

3102
04:02:22,266 --> 04:02:22,647
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

3103
04:02:23,227 --> 04:02:28,391
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Vice President Caviello to pass those impeccable records, seconded by?

3104
04:02:28,812 --> 04:02:29,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.
