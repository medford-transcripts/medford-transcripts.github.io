1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Rick Caraviello.

2
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:15,516
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, I served 12 years as a city councilor and three of those as council president.

3
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:24,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am here before you not only as a candidate, but as someone who holds a strong belief in the strength of community.

4
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:29,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I am running again because we are in danger of losing the Medford we know and love.

5
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:31,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford is a community.

6
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:36,894
[SPEAKER_00]: that has always been distinguished by its rich history and vibrant neighborhoods.

7
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:44,179
[SPEAKER_00]: The most contentious issue in this election is the proposed citywide rezoning and development plan.

8
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,923
[SPEAKER_00]: At its core, the city council's duty is to protect the integrity and stability of our neighborhoods.

9
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:52,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, that duty has been cast aside.

10
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:58,889
[SPEAKER_00]: The current council is pushing a sweeping rezoning proposal that would allow two to six units

11
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:06,011
[SPEAKER_00]: per residential lot, regardless of neighborhood context, infrastructure capacity, or community input.

12
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,592
[SPEAKER_00]: This approach isn't thoughtful growth.

13
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:16,155
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a density policy, one size fits all, that threatens to fundamentally alter the character of Medford.

14
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:21,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, I will vote no to destroying our neighborhoods and vote yes to protecting them.

15
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:33,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford's business districts hold tremendous potential, not for unchecked expansion, but for smart, sustainable growth that respects our community's character.

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:46,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I support enhancing these areas with thoughtful planning that boasts tax revenue, creates good jobs, strengthens our local economy without compromising what makes Medford unique.

17
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:53,317
[SPEAKER_00]: As our city grows, so must our commitment to education for the next generations.

18
00:01:53,797 --> 00:02:01,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Memphis students deserve learning environments that are safe, modern, and built for the challenges of tomorrow, not the limitations of the past.

19
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:05,465
[SPEAKER_00]: A new high school isn't a luxury, it's a necessity.

20
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:09,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's invest in our kids, our community, and our future.

21
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:23,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Police and DPW departments should be fully staffed and deserve the backing of public officials, including the long overdue negotiation of their contracts.

22
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:31,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Fixing our streets and sidewalks is one of the most basic and most powerful things we can do to improve daylight in Medford.

23
00:02:32,212 --> 00:02:32,973
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about safety.

24
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,454
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about accessibility.

25
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,916
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about showing every resident that they matter.

26
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:39,758
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to address this important issues.

27
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:46,328
[SPEAKER_00]: My campaign is about you, the taxpayers, not the politicians.

28
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:55,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I will listen to your concerns, as I always have, and will represent your voice and restore the trust of the people to City Hall.

29
00:02:56,497 --> 00:03:00,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, let's build a fairer, more united Medford than ever before.

30
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:09,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I respectfully ask for one of your seven votes on Tuesday, November 4th for Rick Caravello for Medford City Council.

31
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
