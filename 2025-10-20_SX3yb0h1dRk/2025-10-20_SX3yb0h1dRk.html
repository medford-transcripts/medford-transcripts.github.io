    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=6.19s">Hello,</a>  my name is Rick Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=9.212s">As</a>  many of you know, I served 12 years as a city councilor and three of those as council president. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=16.297s">Today,</a>  I am here before you not only as a candidate, but as someone who holds a strong belief in the strength of community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=24.882s">I</a>  am running again because we are in danger of losing the Medford we know and love. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=30.566s">Medford</a>  is a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=32.451s">that</a>  has always been distinguished by its rich history and vibrant neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=38.415s">The</a>  most contentious issue in this election is the proposed citywide rezoning and development plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=44.719s">At</a>  its core, the city council's duty is to protect the integrity and stability of our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=50.223s">Yet,</a>  that duty has been cast aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=53.725s">The</a>  current council is pushing a sweeping rezoning proposal that would allow two to six units <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=59.768s">per</a>  residential lot, regardless of neighborhood context, infrastructure capacity, or community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=66.631s">This</a>  approach isn't thoughtful growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=69.112s">It's</a>  a density policy, one size fits all, that threatens to fundamentally alter the character of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=76.616s">Instead,</a>  I will vote no to destroying our neighborhoods and vote yes to protecting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=83.73s">Medford's</a>  business districts hold tremendous potential, not for unchecked expansion, but for smart, sustainable growth that respects our community's character. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=94.28s">I</a>  support enhancing these areas with thoughtful planning that boasts tax revenue, creates good jobs, strengthens our local economy without compromising what makes Medford unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=107.973s">As</a>  our city grows, so must our commitment to education for the next generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=113.797s">Medford</a>  students deserve learning environments that are safe, modern, and built for the challenges of tomorrow, not the limitations of the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=122.483s">A</a>  new high school isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=126.306s">Let's</a>  invest in our kids, our community, and our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=133.299s">Police</a>  and DPW departments should be fully staffed and deserve the backing of public officials, including the long overdue negotiation of their contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=145.067s">Fixing</a>  our streets and sidewalks is one of the most basic and most powerful things we can do to improve daylight in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=152.212s">It's</a>  about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=153.453s">It's</a>  about accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=154.934s">It's</a>  about showing every resident that they matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=157.676s">It's</a>  time to address this important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=162.645s">My</a>  campaign is about you, the taxpayers, not the politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=166.949s">I</a>  will listen to your concerns, as I always have, and will represent your voice and restore the trust of the people to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=176.497s">Together,</a>  let's build a fairer, more united Medford than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=183.483s">I</a>  respectfully ask for one of your seven votes on Tuesday, November 4th for Rick Caraviello for Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SX3yb0h1dRk&t=190.229s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
