Hello, my name is Rick Caraviello. As many of you know, I served 12 years as a city councilor and three of those as council president. Today, I am here before you not only as a candidate, but as someone who holds a strong belief in the strength of community. I am running again because we are in danger of losing the Medford we know and love. Medford is a community.

that has always been distinguished by its rich history and vibrant neighborhoods. The most contentious issue in this election is the proposed citywide rezoning and development plan. At its core, the city council's duty is to protect the integrity and stability of our neighborhoods. Yet, that duty has been cast aside. The current council is pushing a sweeping rezoning proposal that would allow two to six units

per residential lot, regardless of neighborhood context, infrastructure capacity, or community input. This approach isn't thoughtful growth. It's a density policy, one size fits all, that threatens to fundamentally alter the character of Medford. Instead, I will vote no to destroying our neighborhoods and vote yes to protecting them.

Medford's business districts hold tremendous potential, not for unchecked expansion, but for smart, sustainable growth that respects our community's character. I support enhancing these areas with thoughtful planning that boasts tax revenue, creates good jobs, strengthens our local economy without compromising what makes Medford unique.

As our city grows, so must our commitment to education for the next generations. Memphis students deserve learning environments that are safe, modern, and built for the challenges of tomorrow, not the limitations of the past. A new high school isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. Let's invest in our kids, our community, and our future.

Police and DPW departments should be fully staffed and deserve the backing of public officials, including the long overdue negotiation of their contracts. Fixing our streets and sidewalks is one of the most basic and most powerful things we can do to improve daylight in Medford. It's about safety. It's about accessibility. It's about showing every resident that they matter. It's time to address this important issues.

My campaign is about you, the taxpayers, not the politicians. I will listen to your concerns, as I always have, and will represent your voice and restore the trust of the people to City Hall. Together, let's build a fairer, more united Medford than ever before. I respectfully ask for one of your seven votes on Tuesday, November 4th for Rick Caravello for Medford City Council. Thank you.
