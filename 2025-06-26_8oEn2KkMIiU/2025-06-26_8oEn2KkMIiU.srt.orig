[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

70
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:44,050

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

72
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:46,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jackie Furtado?

73
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:47,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

74
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, oh, and I'm a yes as well on both of those minutes, by the way.

75
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:53,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

76
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are unanimously approved.

77
00:04:57,292 --> 00:05:04,274
[SPEAKER_04]: The next item on the agenda is a request for extension of time for the Macklin Road subdivision.

78
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:14,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to invite the proponents, John Valdino and Michael Collins, to give a summary of where the project stands and

79
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,262
[SPEAKER_04]: and explain the extension, please.

80
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:24,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, hi, this is Michael Collins.

81
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:39,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the general contractor who was hired by John and Dave Kowalczyk, the owners of Balchak Properties, to build out the subdivision, the three houses and the road, and currently,

82
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:49,171
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lot two 100% completed, just waiting on a certificate of occupancy, which we hope to be issued tomorrow.

83
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:52,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Lot three, number 40 Macklin.

84
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:56,642
[SPEAKER_01]: should be done within two to three weeks.

85
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:00,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Another certificate of occupancy and a sale.

86
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:05,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And lot one is about 50% complete.

87
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,012
[SPEAKER_01]: It's framed and roofed.

88
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,935
[SPEAKER_01]: The windows and doors are going in tomorrow.

89
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:14,670
[SPEAKER_01]: and that should be completed by the end of January.

90
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:31,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Relative to the subdivision improvements, we have installed some of the roadway improvements, but realistically, most of them will occur in the spring after the winter season and relative

91
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:43,310
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate this meeting and relative to our request for an extension, you had graciously given us till October 9th to complete the subdivision.

92
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:55,495
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been hit by the COVID issue relative to some of our labor delays and certainly our material delays.

93
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:58,997
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, we've

94
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:04,686
[SPEAKER_01]: done pretty well and been pretty expeditious on our building.

95
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:09,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'd appreciate the extension through the end of June of next year.

96
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:14,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Valdina.

97
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:15,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to add anything or?

98
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:17,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

99
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:22,441
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I was going to say, I think Andy was saying that we should get the, to the bond.

100
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:25,336
[SPEAKER_00]: extension to that time as well.

101
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:27,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Our barn runs out to the end of January.

102
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:38,379
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked to the lady at USI, Gail, and she said that they won't do six months, so we'll have to extend it for one year when that time comes, runs out in January.

103
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,159
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will definitely do that.

104
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:50,061
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we would like to try to get a reduction on the cost of the barn because we do have a lot more done on the road since the last time we did it.

105
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:51,624
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm putting that together.

106
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:57,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's gonna help me put that together for you guys to go over and look at and see what you can come up with for a reduction for us.

107
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:08,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, now that estimate of work that's been completed needs to be reviewed and approved by the city engineer.

108
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:18,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you could work with him and then at our next meeting, we'd be in, I think, a position to approve

109
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:32,465
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a request based on the engineer's evaluation of that, if that's... Yeah, we have plenty of, I mean, January, the end of January is when it runs out, so we have three or four months right now to get that figured out on the reduction.

110
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:48,577
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one more thing I was gonna say is... Oh, about who would we set up a meeting, this is not for this meeting, but who would we go with the engineer also, the city engineer, as far as the curbing and sidewalks, there's some we were trying to

111
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:56,110
[SPEAKER_00]: talk, want to go over that with him again before, you know, there might be some reduced curbing that we were thinking of.

112
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something we talked to him.

113
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, any that would be the person I would go to.

114
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:03,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that this?

115
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:04,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

116
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be a change to the subdivision plans?

117
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:07,316
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean?

118
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:10,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it could be.

119
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:14,860
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just there's some areas out after we have this road and stuff now looking at it.

120
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:17,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of common sense looking at it.

121
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:18,882
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like we could

122
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,700
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate some areas.

123
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:24,568
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, that would have to be approved by, you know, you have to look at it with us.

124
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that would have to be a request to the board who would

125
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:36,578
[SPEAKER_06]: be able to approve that type of a change, but I believe the board would likely want a recommendation from the city engineer on that as well.

126
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:43,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So for both of those issues, we could come back at the following meeting and have his recommendations and evaluations.

127
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:44,441
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be good.

128
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:49,283
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, definitely follow up with him as soon as you can on both of those.

129
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:57,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can actually coordinate through me in the office of community development and I can refer to him.

130
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:02,782
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have, really, on this.

131
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:04,703
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, great.

132
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:20,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So for right now, the issue before the board for consideration is extension of the permit, so the subdivision permit.

133
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:27,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And would there be any questions or comments or discussion from the board members on that?

134
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:33,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, class.

135
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:45,721
[SPEAKER_02]: You, um, can you just describe a little bit more of the level of, um, completion that has happened on the roadway?

136
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:52,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have, well, uh, we have the binder down, um, you know, all the utilities are in.

137
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,665
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we have a top coat to do.

138
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:58,606
[SPEAKER_00]: We have curb and sidewalks.

139
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:02,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think we have to raise a couple of manhole covers.

140
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:06,729
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very minimal that we have left to build over there.

141
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:14,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind me, it's concrete curbing?

142
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:17,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what was on the plan.

143
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:24,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were just wondering if asphalt could be done over there.

144
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:26,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Curbing?

145
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, for North Dakota, I'm thinking sidewalks, I'm sorry.

146
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, curbing was, yeah.

147
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:35,943
Okay.

148
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:46,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just for the extension that we'll have to get into those issues, I think at the next meeting.

149
00:11:49,690 --> 00:12:03,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll just clarify that now that the road has been built to binder, it is the preference of the engineering division that the top coat wait until after the houses are complete for that to be installed.

150
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's in,

151
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,287
[SPEAKER_06]: compliance with their recommendation on that.

152
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:15,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where this stands, but I do have a recommendation from engineering as well on the sidewalk material.

153
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:16,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

154
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:27,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Has the interface with the adjacent property, I know they had, it's a

155
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a place that services some of the handicapped folks.

156
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that all been resolved and squared away?

157
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:33,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that?

158
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:35,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it really hasn't.

159
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:36,337
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

160
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:39,418
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I talked to Gail Ailes over there.

161
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,658
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd been very nice.

162
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:41,899
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been great with us.

163
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,460
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a little bit worried about how this curb is going to come into effect.

164
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,481
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to affect their access in and out of there.

165
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:56,664
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things I just wanted to be able to sit, you know, bring an engineer over there with somebody that specialized in that kind of,

166
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:04,251
[SPEAKER_00]: have them there too at the same time and have an explanation of what we can do over there to satisfy them and also satisfy the town too, so.

167
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:27,018
[SPEAKER_02]: My recommendation was that when you bring whatever scope of work you wanna do in that altered, changed scope of work, when you bring it to us, just make sure that it's abundantly clear what you're trying to do, whether it's a 3D drawing or something so that we can really understand it rather than just trying to read it.

168
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have our engineer do that up with us, too.

169
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,061
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get him involved with that.

170
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:35,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

171
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, though, the neighbors have been great.

172
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:45,873
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't start out that way, but they've come to realize that it is what it is.

173
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,754
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been super over there.

174
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,616
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been smooth sailing.

175
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions or comments from board members?

176
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:09,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion on the floor to extend the Macklin Road subdivision permit for, and what's the length of time?

177
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:09,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that?

178
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,080
[SPEAKER_04]: June 30th.

179
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:12,761
[SPEAKER_04]: June 30th.

180
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:13,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

181
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:14,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So June 30th, 2021.

182
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

183
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:19,206
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Jackie Furtado.

184
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:20,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jackie.

185
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll just clarify, that'll be the timeline for completion.

186
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:28,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And that includes all the public right-of-way work.

187
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:30,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

188
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second to the motion on the floor?

189
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:38,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll second.

190
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:42,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Deanna.

191
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:46,116
[SPEAKER_04]: We will go to a roll call vote.

192
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:49,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes in favor, no against, and abstain.

193
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Deanna Peabody?

194
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:52,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

195
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:53,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Katie McHugh?

196
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:54,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

197
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Christy Dowd.

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

199
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:00,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Klaus Andreessen.

200
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:00,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

201
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:02,344
[SPEAKER_04]: David Blumberg.

202
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:03,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

203
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:04,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jackie Furtado.

204
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:05,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

205
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:06,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also a yes.

206
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:10,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So that permit extension has been approved.

207
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, gentlemen, for coming in today.

208
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we'll probably see you next month.

209
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:17,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

210
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:18,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

211
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:19,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

212
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:19,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

213
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:20,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

214
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:30,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so the next... How do I leave the meeting?

215
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, bye-bye now.

216
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:47,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so the main item on the agenda that we had for tonight, since we're trying to keep this meeting to an hour, which would be a nice refreshing change for everyone,

217
00:15:48,902 --> 00:16:01,326
[SPEAKER_04]: is a discussion of the Medford zoning review that the city council is undergoing, and then also talk a little bit about our board rules, policies, and regulations.

218
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:05,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a bit of an open-ended discussion.

219
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:12,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just see how many of you were able to listen to the city council meeting before this?

220
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:15,009
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, three.

221
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:16,450
[SPEAKER_04]: About half, all right, okay.

222
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to participate.

223
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:24,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought it was a very good presentation.

224
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:39,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what they covered, for those who didn't hear, were really the roles and responsibilities of the boards and also, I guess, the way Mark Berbrowski, who is the zoning consultant, he calls it like everybody's job description.

225
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:51,975
[SPEAKER_04]: He also went over the non-conforming lots and structures and how that's dealt with in the preamble to the zoning ordinance.

226
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:56,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really happy, actually.

227
00:16:56,619 --> 00:17:06,827
[SPEAKER_04]: My impression was that I think that this language, if it's approved, will be a lot more clear than what we currently have and I think will be really helpful for everyone.

228
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:30,399
[SPEAKER_04]: One item that I'd like to raise, I guess, in terms of structuring our discussion, is raise the issue of whether we should, as a board, provide some feedback to the zoning consultant and or the city council about

229
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:41,477
[SPEAKER_04]: what the work that's been done so far, whether we have any comments or opinion about, you know, the roles and responsibilities for our board that have been laid out.

230
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:46,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it might be good for us to

231
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:55,906
[SPEAKER_04]: put a short letter together to that effect and also raise any questions we might have for the zoning consultant or for the city council.

232
00:17:57,848 --> 00:18:01,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, I know that we want to talk about design guidelines.

233
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:03,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And then thirdly,

234
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:09,377
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some very old procedures.

235
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:13,398
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even really look at them.

236
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:15,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had to ask Annie and myself whether we had them.

237
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said that they're very old.

238
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So we haven't really used these as a board.

239
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,943
[SPEAKER_04]: They date from the 70s, I think.

240
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:25,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were

241
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:38,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should probably put some board rules and regulations together for the Community Development Board.

242
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:42,989
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the ones with sole responsibility and authority to do so.

243
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:56,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the city council was asking whether they can kind of impose some rules and regulations on the boards, but the consultant said he really didn't think that was appropriate at all and legally questionable.

244
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another area where we could

245
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:06,678
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we could figure out like what we want to be, how we want to be operating as a board and codify that.

246
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a lot.

247
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:17,345
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to get into all of it, but really want to give us a chance for the first time as a board to have a kind of an open-ended discussion about these matters.

248
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:22,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start with the zoning consultant and what we've heard.

249
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:27,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of you who participated, was there anything that, that concerned you or that you liked?

250
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:29,413
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your impression?

251
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:39,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start.

252
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:43,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I also liked the piece about roles and responsibilities.

253
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:58,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like having something really clear for board members, but more importantly for the public and people who engage with all the boards, it's so, municipal government is so complicated.

254
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:03,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the easier we can make that part, the better.

255
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:05,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought that was a helpful.

256
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:07,153
[SPEAKER_07]: helpful piece.

257
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:28,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I'll point out that the concerns that the counselors seem to raise about the way boards operate, I don't think apply to us because there was concerns about, you know, meetings in the afternoon or, you know, inadequate, you know, community engagement or participation.

258
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, like, we've been pretty good on all of those things.

259
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,502
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone as long as it needs to.

260
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:32,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.

261
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:32,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

262
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,268
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone to the next day.

263
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,669
[SPEAKER_07]: We've done our job.

264
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel good about that.

265
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:41,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

266
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:45,252
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some question on the city council agenda.

267
00:20:45,272 --> 00:20:56,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't watch it about was open meeting law violated if a public meeting ran into the next day, because then it was no longer posted for the right date.

268
00:20:58,178 --> 00:20:59,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't watch that section.

269
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be curious to see whether they were discussing one of our meetings or something else, but I don't know.

270
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:09,405
[SPEAKER_04]: We only went into about five minutes, five, 10 minutes, I think.

271
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I also thought it was kind of funny.

272
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:12,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

273
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:14,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

274
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:16,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the meeting, the question.

275
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

276
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:25,556
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny that that question came up though, because I have no legal background at all, but I do know that,

277
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:34,810
[SPEAKER_09]: If any time a meeting is legally represented and advertised, no matter what time it ends, it doesn't matter what time it ends, it matters what time it starts.

278
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,871
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm guessing the legality behind that does not exist.

279
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:43,814
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my assumption in dealing with so many different things at the state level.

280
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:46,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And sorry, I didn't mean to distract.

281
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:48,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to apologize.

282
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:52,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been in the office since before eight continuously.

283
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:59,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a little bit fried any with regards to the rules and regulations.

284
00:21:59,747 --> 00:22:05,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very easy for me to refer back to where you have on our share drive the reference resources.

285
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:07,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how easy it is for

286
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:13,780
[SPEAKER_05]: people, the rest of the commission to refer back to that location on the share drive.

287
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:21,607
[SPEAKER_05]: But is there something other than the rules and regulations of the subdivision of land that you're referring to?

288
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a couple of things.

289
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:34,217
[SPEAKER_06]: The rules and regulations of the subdivision of land that you're looking at, the last few pages of that have rules of the Medford Community Development Board governing organization and procedure.

290
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:36,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

291
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:37,177
[SPEAKER_06]: That starts on page 34.

292
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:48,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are also rules and regulations in relation to the site plan review, the board acting as the site plan review granting authority.

293
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I had circulated to everyone to have a discussion about that.

294
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,341
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are some other ones.

295
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:54,921
[SPEAKER_06]: The subdivision ones are much older.

296
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:55,682
[SPEAKER_06]: They're from the 70s.

297
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:55,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And so

298
00:22:58,492 --> 00:23:06,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I can share this if you'd like, share my screen if you want to look at them or I could distribute them after the fact and we could touch base at a later meeting.

299
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:13,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody had access to them if they wanted to review them as well.

300
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:21,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you who weren't at the meeting, they asked to see our rules and regulations and ZBAs.

301
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:34,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually took an opportunity to tell them that ours were very old, that this board had been considering discussing revising them, but that our last several meetings had run

302
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,487
[SPEAKER_05]: over four hours.

303
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:41,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we just hadn't gotten to it yet, but that we were happy to share them as they stood.

304
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:43,690
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted you guys to know that.

305
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,511
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of fair.

306
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:51,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also helped us sort of like, we're not having meetings that are too short.

307
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:53,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

308
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:57,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Andy, I know I have paper, I have paper copies, like older paper copies of that.

309
00:23:58,054 --> 00:24:02,376
[SPEAKER_04]: But is that something that people can access through the shared drive?

310
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:14,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, if you are able to access the full folder of CD board, Medford CD board, there's a folder called reference resources and it's in there.

311
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:22,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that sometimes if you're not linking it to your computer, it can be hard to get back to that main folder.

312
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:25,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I find whenever, like I just did it right now.

313
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:26,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm happy to send it around again.

314
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:37,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you could send it, like when I go in there and I just choose, I click on Medford CD board, the full thing, it only shows the meeting materials, the current meeting materials.

315
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:42,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I can never get into the full folder.

316
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:47,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's just me or if others have that same issue.

317
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:51,703
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be helpful to know.

318
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:56,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if, if it's something that doesn't work consistently for everybody that it's easier.

319
00:24:56,471 --> 00:25:00,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I don't know, we can troubleshoot stuff with our ideas to if that's helpful.

320
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:03,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

321
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:09,950
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole SharePoint using this has been new since March for the city, really.

322
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:14,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think some of us are still figuring out how to work at best.

323
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:18,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was just able to get into it with your link, Annie, that you sent.

324
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:24,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So for whatever reason, it seems like I need the exact link to make it work.

325
00:25:31,187 --> 00:25:35,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think we need to really go over the old rules and regulations.

326
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:39,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can take a look at it at your leisure if you want to.

327
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:49,656
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we should really think about what we want our procedures to be and really just codify what we're doing, which I think, for the most part, is working.

328
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:59,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can also pull, the attorney during that meeting mentioned a couple of examples of neighboring communities who we thought had especially good rules and regulations.

329
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:02,285
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could pull those and distribute to you all.

330
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:07,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got the Lexington one, which is the one he referenced that he said he did.

331
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:10,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he mentioned Winchester at one point.

332
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:14,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he was mixing the two, but he was also going to send those along.

333
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:29,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Lexington ones are basically it's titled planning board procedural rules and it's five pages and it just goes over

334
00:26:33,348 --> 00:27:01,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, board authority, membership, what happens when there's a vacancy, what about an associate member, roles and responsibilities, quorum, remote participation, who can speak on behalf of the board, officers, special study committees, board appointments, liaisons, planning staff, roles, and meetings.

335
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:07,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not that much, like there's only, the last page is the one that just deals with meetings.

336
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really just one page.

337
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:14,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very, you know, it just kind of talks about when is the meeting.

338
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:23,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, typically, and it even says, typically held on the first and third Wednesdays of each month in the town office building at 7 p.m., whenever possible.

339
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:31,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not meant to like write everything in stone, but offer some guidance and flexibility.

340
00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:35,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, we can circulate those and look at them.

341
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe I have a question.

342
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Was he saying that he didn't have a board at all.

343
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:44,767
[SPEAKER_04]: That was what I that's what I got from that.

344
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:55,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it seemed like a real just has instead of a planning board, they have a what's called a development board composed of department had city department heads.

345
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:08,253
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a very strong mayor system and the mayor has been there for like, I don't know, decades, so.

346
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:16,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may have just been for a site plan review, because I believe a planning board would still need to do subdivisions and things like that.

347
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:25,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he seemed to say that they were doing a very good job with their downtown and using them as a good example.

348
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:37,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, that's what I got from his discussion, that part.

349
00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:45,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I think without getting into it much, I think it's a very strong mayor system, very top-down executive.

350
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:47,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure it's the same kind of model we have here at Medford.

351
00:28:47,946 --> 00:28:52,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a little bit more distributed, the authority here.

352
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:58,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only that, I don't know the decision, but Haverhill does have

353
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:05,298
[SPEAKER_09]: a body, a legislative body actually that acts as a planning board.

354
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:07,399
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're actually considered a planning board now.

355
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:10,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure.

356
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:27,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely a planning commission because all city, Massachusetts cities and towns has to have planning commissions and their idea of a planning commission, I think just got changed to a planning board, but you might want to just, I don't know the conversation and I have not had a chance to look into this more, but Haverhill and you're right.

357
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:29,005
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor does have a strong,

358
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:34,942
[SPEAKER_09]: presence there, top-down leadership, but they do have a planning board.

359
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:39,003
[SPEAKER_09]: They cannot not have one.

360
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:39,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

361
00:29:39,843 --> 00:30:02,775
[SPEAKER_04]: But he also said, I think he was, you know, Mark Wrobrowski, who is a recognized zoning expert in Massachusetts law, is, you know, he was very supportive and encouraging of a planning board having the roles and responsibilities that are laid out here and thought that as long as, you know, we're willing to do the work, then that's a good thing.

362
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:08,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a question.

363
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:12,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if, Annie, you can help out with this.

364
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:16,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe even David, I don't know.

365
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:21,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of our time is spent on site plan review.

366
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was proposing that we

367
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:39,153
[SPEAKER_04]: the city not call basically special permit with site plan approval, or whatever we call it, because it's really two different things.

368
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:47,557
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the question is, there is a set of criteria that triggers site plan review for certain projects.

369
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:53,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And is the way it happens in Medford, is that the right

370
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:56,162
[SPEAKER_04]: process, right?

371
00:30:56,222 --> 00:31:04,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally, they kick it, they go to the ZBA, and then they kick it to us, and then it goes back to them for the variances, right?

372
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Annie, how exactly is the process supposed to look?

373
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:12,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

374
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:13,475
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't hear it first.

375
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:20,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it doesn't, it wouldn't go to them first, but we would be, if it requires variances, we make a recommendation to the ZBA.

376
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:23,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It just comes to us first before the ZBA sees it.

377
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:24,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?

378
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:25,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

379
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:37,121
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the same sort of time frame, like they could be submitted at the same time, and it could be under review by both boards.

380
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:45,186
[SPEAKER_06]: But the ZBA is supposed to wait for a recommendation from the CD board on that for the site plan review.

381
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:50,449
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the things that has been questioned a little, and I know that,

382
00:31:52,242 --> 00:32:07,277
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that our city engineer might have some advice on or what he's seen elsewhere is that there's both the need for variances in some of these cases and special permits.

383
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:15,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a number of these cases, one or the other of those has really been in question as to whether they were going to issue.

384
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:26,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And so whether or not that we should have an applicant go all the way through site plan review until we know if they're going to get

385
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:28,736
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that.

386
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:35,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, like a setback variance, they might not get and it might kill a project.

387
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:40,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one that was really project killing was the site was the use variances.

388
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:52,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like the project that we spent a lot of time with the one that was, I apologize, I always forget the street names, but the gas station and the car wash turning into a

389
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,083
[SPEAKER_05]: apartment building this summer, they were denied by the ZBA a use variance.

390
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:02,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just kills the project.

391
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,605
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't redesign that, right?

392
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:11,989
[SPEAKER_05]: If you redesign it, it has to come back to us for site plan because it's a completely different project.

393
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:16,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So whether a project like that should have gone through all this work

394
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:19,376
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way our processes are lined up, they didn't have a choice.

395
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,460
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to go with us first before they could be heard.

396
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they even asked about severing that with the potential of getting the use variants first.

397
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,739
[SPEAKER_05]: then going in front of us for site plan, and then getting the variances.

398
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:48,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the variances, I don't wanna say are negotiable, but right, if they're saying you have to have 12 feet instead of eight feet or whatever, that's a simple change, right, relatively speaking, relatively.

399
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:55,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will, I actually, I didn't realize this, perhaps I'm not as caught up as I should be, but that,

400
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:59,385
[SPEAKER_05]: project has appealed and is in land court now.

401
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:06,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've asked Dennis to please keep us apprised of what happens with that, because they appealed the zoning board decision of denying that.

402
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, that was news to me.

403
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't realized that.

404
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:17,088
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that happens in the future, could you just let us know?

405
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:22,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you, I found out tonight when they said that on the meeting, I was messaging Dennis and getting

406
00:34:23,572 --> 00:34:24,372
[SPEAKER_05]: more information.

407
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean really all he said is they've appealed.

408
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,634
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've asked him to keep me looped in on that.

409
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:41,898
[SPEAKER_05]: But that, so one of the things that won't happen if our, so are you guys all up to speed, up to date on the whole use variance thing?

410
00:34:43,078 --> 00:34:46,039
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big debate, are they allowed, not allowed in Medford, right?

411
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are two places in our zoning code, one set.

412
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:49,881
[SPEAKER_05]: So

413
00:34:50,793 --> 00:35:00,639
[SPEAKER_05]: According to state law, you may issue use variances, your zoning board may, if your local ordinance explicitly allows use variances.

414
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,643
[SPEAKER_05]: If your local law is silent on it, then you may not issue use variances.

415
00:35:07,153 --> 00:35:12,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford's ordinances is explicit about it in two different places.

416
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:19,124
[SPEAKER_05]: One place it says it may issue use variances, and in another place it says it may not issue use variances.

417
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:21,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So it contradicts itself.

418
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:28,412
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a debate at one point whether the one that says not was a typo, a Scribner's error.

419
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people believe it is, some people believe it's not.

420
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:38,830
[SPEAKER_05]: The current ZBA, all use variances have to be approved unanimously because of the numbers on it.

421
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,930
[SPEAKER_05]: There are three members, all three have to vote in favor.

422
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,471
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a member who refuses to vote in favor of them on principle.

423
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:48,012
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why that project was denied.

424
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:53,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And she in fact said during the public hearing, I think this is a great project.

425
00:35:53,674 --> 00:35:59,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see it in Medford, but we are not legally allowed to give use variances and therefore I'm voting against it.

426
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was extraordinarily clear.

427
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:15,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that the applicant was actually encouraged to take it to the courts by what people said at that meeting.

428
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:26,953
[SPEAKER_05]: It came up, so this is something that our city council is debating now, is to with this zoning recodification, do you allow use variances or not?

429
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:37,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason it's very relevant for us is because if use variances are going to be never allowed, then this issue never comes up again, and it's not such a big deal.

430
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:39,640
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they are allowed,

431
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:58,727
[SPEAKER_05]: then we should be cognizant of this and also work to figure out what is a process that doesn't drag a developer through this long process when they may then just get denied out of hand because we don't feel like approving an apartment building at that location.

432
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:00,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

433
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:12,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, use variances should be rarely used, but in communities where the zoning is outdated, then, you know, they get used more often.

434
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,689
[SPEAKER_05]: We could fix the zoning.

435
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,350
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try.

436
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:40,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was also a reference to the consultant was going to look into the historic ordinance and demo delay to see how that relates to the permitting process, which I think would be good to understand more.

437
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:50,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was wondering whether there needs to be any kind of cross reference to the city's solar ordinance in our, in our zoning.

438
00:37:51,633 --> 00:38:03,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and also whether there, you know, are there opportunities to encourage energy efficiency or, uh,

439
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:13,590
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, green building standards in the zoning ordinance or whether that's, you know, just a design guideline thing.

440
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So, those were a couple of questions that I had.

441
00:38:18,491 --> 00:38:27,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And particularly just, I think the most important one though is what I brought up earlier, which is what's the recommended process for lining all of these permits up with the different boards?

442
00:38:28,154 --> 00:38:30,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know what best practice is.

443
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:33,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if David, you have any ideas or,

444
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:44,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any special insight on it, Andre.

445
00:38:47,424 --> 00:39:02,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are communities that incentivize energy efficiency and stuff like that, clean energy, by offering a density bonus for including those things.

446
00:39:04,187 --> 00:39:09,369
[SPEAKER_05]: The MAPC has been working on model examples.

447
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:25,117
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been working with some of our very local communities, because I couldn't tell you right now which communities, but it's from the Metro Mayors Group, which makes it really in here, Dan, close to us, and therefore, like us.

448
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:32,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, something that that applies out in Concord may really not be appropriate in Medford.

449
00:39:33,424 --> 00:39:36,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, you're looking at Somerville, Malden, Everett.

450
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,109
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really rational for us to be considering.

451
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, So,

452
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:58,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where they stand with that, but we could certainly, it won't be hard in the next few months to get recommendations, suggestions about how one can incentivize green building standards.

453
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,792
[SPEAKER_05]: within Massachusetts law.

454
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:08,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, I sometimes am not sure what I know because of my background versus what is more generally known.

455
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:19,149
[SPEAKER_05]: In Massachusetts, building code is it at the state level, and we cannot regulate, change the building code at the local level.

456
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,834
[SPEAKER_05]: That is different from other states in the country.

457
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:30,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So in many places, there are recommendations, oh, you could just adopt a more strict building code.

458
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not allowed to do that.

459
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,552
[SPEAKER_05]: The stretch code was that.

460
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:35,673
[SPEAKER_05]: We adopted it.

461
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:38,576
[SPEAKER_05]: But the building code is actually caught up to the stretch code.

462
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:47,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we adopted in 2010 is the stretch building code is actually now the building code and may have, in fact, gone more conservative.

463
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:54,770
[SPEAKER_05]: conservative, more environmentally conservative, right, more energy efficient than what was on them.

464
00:40:55,871 --> 00:41:05,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way it's done in Massachusetts is rather than building code and regulating it, is offering carrots to be more.

465
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:09,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing that I've been told is expedited permitting.

466
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:18,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I, having worked in the middle of our permitting, cannot, have not been able to make any recommendations about how to expedite our permitting.

467
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:26,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And until this summer, I had been told by developers that we actually have one of the fastest permitting offices.

468
00:41:26,335 --> 00:41:35,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I don't know if that included things like if it goes to the CD board or zoning, but our building department was very fast about issuing building permits.

469
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,862
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no way to speed it up.

470
00:41:39,517 --> 00:41:43,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Not when something was taking two days, three days, get it signed off at the counter.

471
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:55,524
[SPEAKER_05]: When it goes through our longer process, though, I'm not sure how something that's coming through this board and the ZBA could realistically speed things up.

472
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:58,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some, but not a lot.

473
00:42:00,265 --> 00:42:02,526
[SPEAKER_05]: So the others to offer density bonuses.

474
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that politically viable in Medford?

475
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:11,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there other issues?

476
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,090
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have about 15 minutes.

477
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:20,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if there are other issues that you members would like to learn more about or ask questions of the consultant.

478
00:42:21,233 --> 00:42:27,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'd have to maybe do it through the city council since they're the client.

479
00:42:30,747 --> 00:42:39,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And perhaps we don't do it in terms of a formal letter, but just direct the community development staff to inquire about certain things.

480
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:40,512
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be the easiest thing.

481
00:42:42,032 --> 00:42:56,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend that we actually, I'm going to be sending a note to Mark Brodowski anyhow, with some of our files that we attach sort of, here's what we're thinking to that rather than trying to go through the city council.

482
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:11,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, to what extent can we, you know, massage the language of a letter after this meeting?

483
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:20,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have to identify what the letter will say here.

484
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:23,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been taking some notes.

485
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:30,938
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to continue sort of throwing some ideas out there, then I could draft something and it could be subject to Andre's

486
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:33,023
[SPEAKER_06]: review and approval?

487
00:43:40,405 --> 00:43:40,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, David.

488
00:43:42,646 --> 00:43:43,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that sounds good.

489
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:50,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we, at least as a board, very supportive of the modernization of zoning?

490
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:57,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like the city hasn't done much of any of this for 40-something years, and it's long overdue.

491
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we have some of the questions that have already been raised and I'm sure Annie already has on her list.

492
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:04,805
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really great.

493
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:05,646
[SPEAKER_03]: We could pass along.

494
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:14,733
[SPEAKER_03]: But I imagine we also want to have an opportunity to weigh in when Mark comes back with more specific, with his recodification or his proposed recodification.

495
00:44:16,174 --> 00:44:27,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I wonder too, Annie, I think it suggested looking at the actual application, the special permit application and the steps and that sort of stuff, like trying to make that look more like something from this decade.

496
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:31,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have the rules and regs and procedures.

497
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:42,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe we want to hustle those together so we're sort of getting them done while Mark's getting done his draft, or do we want to wait for that draft to be done and respond to it?

498
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,951
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one question I have.

499
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe what I would recommend is could we

500
00:44:50,283 --> 00:45:07,239
[SPEAKER_04]: is authorizing Annie to put together a draft set of rules and regulations for the Community Development Board based on some of the research, looking at some of the other communities, and then circulating that to us for discussion at our next meeting.

501
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?

502
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:13,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a quick enough timeline, you think, David, or are you thinking even faster?

503
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:14,515
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think so.

504
00:45:14,555 --> 00:45:17,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just feeling bad because I know Annie has a lot of things to do.

505
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:20,760
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to be helpful to her.

506
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:33,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, if there is a board member that wants to look at the different rules and regulations for a few different towns and then, you know, put a template together, obviously that would be great too.

507
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to volunteer to do that.

508
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:37,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

509
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:37,507
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

510
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:38,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that work, Annie?

511
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:40,168
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds wonderful.

512
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:43,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to work with you, if you'd like.

513
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:44,050
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

514
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,510
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be a group effort.

515
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:46,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, David.

516
00:45:48,171 --> 00:46:01,897
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that I feel like we should consider is in Mark's specific, in his memo that he gave to the board today, there was actual site plan contents talking about what the applicant should submit.

517
00:46:03,137 --> 00:46:03,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not,

518
00:46:04,918 --> 00:46:13,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to tell you that I don't know how much it's in line or not in line with what we have because I haven't done a comparison.

519
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,681
[SPEAKER_05]: But it feels like we ought to and to see if there's any.

520
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:19,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's an easy fix.

521
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:26,603
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's something that we normally ask for and it's not in his list and we said to him sort of out of band, we'd like this.

522
00:46:26,663 --> 00:46:27,483
[SPEAKER_05]: This is in our list.

523
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:30,724
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like it to be in the list that you have in the thing there.

524
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:36,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, you know, it doesn't mention bike racks, and we want bike racks, right?

525
00:46:36,786 --> 00:46:38,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he would just put it in, right?

526
00:46:39,027 --> 00:46:40,288
[SPEAKER_05]: He would just slip it in there.

527
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:44,669
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was like, we don't like your list, take it out completely.

528
00:46:44,729 --> 00:46:47,030
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, that's a substantial change, I can't do it.

529
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:53,293
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we want it tweaked, I think that he would be very like, open to that.

530
00:46:53,988 --> 00:47:05,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that's a question we should raise in our correspondence to him is just what, uh, you know, to what extent are, does he recommend design guidelines to be incorporated into the zoning?

531
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:11,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I don't, I think generally my, my impression is that it should be separate.

532
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:16,348
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to have to change the zoning every time you change the design guideline.

533
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:29,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, I think, different from what sort of I was suggesting, but that's a question that we can ask him as well.

534
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:29,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

535
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm curious about what he would recommend on that.

536
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:36,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

537
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:45,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, in case you guys don't know, Dennis McDougall, who just joined us, I had invited him to join, is the staff to the ZBA.

538
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So he also works here in our office.

539
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:51,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Thought this could be some good synergy and overlap.

540
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:52,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

541
00:47:52,760 --> 00:48:00,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you want me to ask him about it, should we consider incorporating design guidelines into the ordinance or should we do it some other way?

542
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:01,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

543
00:48:01,388 --> 00:48:01,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

544
00:48:13,613 --> 00:48:24,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and there were a few areas on the memo itself that Bobrowski prepared where he was asking for guidance to go one way or the other.

545
00:48:25,058 --> 00:48:36,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my opinion, I think that, you know, where he said pick one or both, generally my,

546
00:48:39,068 --> 00:48:45,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my take on it was we should do both, because it seemed to provide the greatest clarity and flexibility.

547
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I generally agreed with everything that he was proposing.

548
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:55,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hear anything that I felt I had real concerns with.

549
00:48:56,515 --> 00:49:01,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one area we might want to look at more closely is the criteria.

550
00:49:06,098 --> 00:49:06,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is that?

551
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:07,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

552
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:17,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you referring to page seven of his document?

553
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:18,551
[SPEAKER_05]: 10-4-2 by his numbering?

554
00:49:19,772 --> 00:49:23,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 10-4-2, right around special permits.

555
00:49:23,634 --> 00:49:30,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's suggesting a new set of criteria for special permits.

556
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:37,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And how to basically evaluate proposals subject to special permits.

557
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:47,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be modernizing that and in this set of criteria that he uses in in communities when he was writing zoning are

558
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, the determination shall include consideration of each of the following.

559
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:55,306
[SPEAKER_04]: A, social, economic, or community needs, which are served by the proposal.

560
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,428
[SPEAKER_04]: B, traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading.

561
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:01,671
[SPEAKER_04]: C, adequacy of utilities and other public services.

562
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,554
[SPEAKER_04]: D, neighborhood character and social structures.

563
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:07,376
[SPEAKER_04]: E, impacts on the natural environment.

564
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:12,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And F, potential fiscal impact, including impact on city services, tax base, and employment.

565
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:20,546
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's different than what we currently have around special permits.

566
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:24,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're not like the special permit granting authority.

567
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:31,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So we may not want to weigh in on that, but we do weigh in on projects that are requesting special permits.

568
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew, were there particular ones?

569
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:52,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you think that it conflicted with something in your mind or was troubling to you?

570
00:50:52,176 --> 00:51:01,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was presenting these as, hey, these are categories that seem to have stood up to litigation and challenge and they're probably getting to the gist of what

571
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:04,824
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone wants to evaluate anyway.

572
00:51:05,305 --> 00:51:20,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well what he was, I guess where I flagged it is because he then connected it to the fees and said that often, you know, the

573
00:51:20,957 --> 00:51:29,919
[SPEAKER_04]: the board, the special permit granting authority, can adopt administrative fees and technical review fees for applications.

574
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:45,863
[SPEAKER_04]: So oftentimes, I think he even gave an example, he said, so these A through F, these criteria, oftentimes a community will, a municipality will hire a consultant to look and do a study on each one of these criteria for really major projects.

575
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:53,004
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's something we really haven't talked about as a board because we, for site plan review, can also do that.

576
00:51:53,144 --> 00:52:07,400
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have, you know, we can request fees for studies, third-party studies, that, you know, we can then use to evaluate projects.

577
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:34,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So one concern that has been raised is that the phrasing neighborhood character, social structures, can be very well-meaning, but it also has been used historically to abet discrimination.

578
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:43,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, apparently the word neighborhood character has been identified as code for racial discrimination.

579
00:52:44,348 --> 00:52:47,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I wouldn't know that if somebody didn't bring that to me and tell me that.

580
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:49,871
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not obvious to me.

581
00:52:50,412 --> 00:52:53,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that there is a lot to be said for, well, how is it used?

582
00:52:54,214 --> 00:53:05,340
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, it may behoove us to question this and to question, to really think it through, like, what is it that you actually, because you do want, you know,

583
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:10,494
[SPEAKER_05]: There are things, right, you don't want a gambling parlor in the middle of a residential neighborhood.

584
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:18,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you don't want a Target plopped in the middle of a residential neighborhood, but that's not allowed by your zoning.

585
00:53:18,901 --> 00:53:26,909
[SPEAKER_05]: If your zoning allows businesses, if Walmart wanted to come in where Target was, as much as I hate Walmart, can I discriminate against them?

586
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:34,503
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if they were owned by a Black company, like, would this give us the ability to discriminate?

587
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:39,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Should, like, I just want us to be cognizant of it and aware.

588
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:42,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a recommendation.

589
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:43,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Wish I did.

590
00:53:43,828 --> 00:53:43,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

591
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:47,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the things that did kind of raise a red flag with me when I saw that.

592
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:54,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little surprised just to see that there because it seems like a term that's a little out of date.

593
00:53:56,538 --> 00:53:59,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Alicia, I'm glad you raised that, because I think words matter, right?

594
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Language matters, intent matters.

595
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:05,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it matters.

596
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:13,767
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the language is really outdated and has intent, even if it's not obvious to the reader, I'm really, really glad you raised that.

597
00:54:13,907 --> 00:54:17,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that would be something important for this board to discuss.

598
00:54:19,229 --> 00:54:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

599
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:25,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in the letter, our letter, we should kind of point out that concern and ask him why he uses it.

600
00:54:27,803 --> 00:54:30,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed the context of who said what.

601
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:31,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

602
00:54:32,327 --> 00:54:38,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the memo from Mark Bobrowski, the zoning consultant to the city council, he listed a set of criteria.

603
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:44,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the criteria says for evaluating special permits says neighborhood character.

604
00:54:45,299 --> 00:54:47,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And that term is kind of a red flag.

605
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:48,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

606
00:54:48,962 --> 00:54:51,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more red flagged by and social structures.

607
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that just rubs me wrong.

608
00:54:54,475 --> 00:54:56,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what that means really.

609
00:54:56,897 --> 00:55:09,889
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one that I'm hung up on is social structures because that's like targeting a specific economic state of a neighborhood.

610
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,171
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just race.

611
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:16,195
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many things that when you say neighborhood,

612
00:55:17,504 --> 00:55:19,146
[SPEAKER_09]: character and social structures.

613
00:55:19,186 --> 00:55:24,489
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking, we don't want new families in, we want all rich people that live in Medford.

614
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:35,137
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much, and especially, maybe I can just be a little bit more sensitive to it right now, because I'm studying intensely to pass my exam in a couple of weeks.

615
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:41,842
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm revisiting all of the historic redlining and the history of zoning being racist and things like that.

616
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:45,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that that term is even in something current today,

617
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:53,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I had not known this, but these are terms that were used to keep communities a certain way.

618
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:58,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very glad that you raised it, because it would have went over my head.

619
00:55:59,073 --> 00:56:06,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if in his explanation, what he said was that neighborhood character is more around, you know, aesthetics.

620
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Does something fit in?

621
00:56:08,237 --> 00:56:14,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And then social structures is more about like the community, the relationships in that community.

622
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:20,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think there's, both of that makes sense, but you could have better terms for both of those things.

623
00:56:21,722 --> 00:56:22,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

624
00:56:22,442 --> 00:56:28,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And I get neighborhood character can also, it doesn't have to be implicitly like to keep certain things out.

625
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:33,199
[SPEAKER_09]: The home, what is it, the HOAs of America, they pretty much have neighborhood character.

626
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,499
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they exist for, right?

627
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:41,923
[SPEAKER_09]: To make sure that all the houses look alike, that you're not gonna have a pink house among all these nice white row houses and things like that when you own.

628
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:46,705
[SPEAKER_09]: So I get it, but it questions the intent behind it.

629
00:56:46,765 --> 00:56:50,427
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we're questioning the intent behind it, I can only assume that others would.

630
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:57,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, like if it said like building style, is that what is meant?

631
00:56:59,545 --> 00:57:08,311
[SPEAKER_05]: when neighborhood character is said in a well-meaning way, right, like in a positive way, is that what they mean, right?

632
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the building style, the architectural style?

633
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:26,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you could see if you had a historic neighborhood or if you had a whole modern neighborhood and suddenly you were putting in a building that was very different architecturally, you'd at least want to do that intentionally and have the ability to say,

634
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:31,148
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't really think that that architectural style fits.

635
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:34,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it myself.

636
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:35,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not an architect.

637
00:57:35,893 --> 00:57:38,976
[SPEAKER_05]: But let me tell you, my son does when we drive around town.

638
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:40,237
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, that one doesn't fit.

639
00:57:40,998 --> 00:57:43,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So Clay says architect.

640
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:44,501
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

641
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:48,225
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, I'm not touching this right now.

642
00:57:49,206 --> 00:57:51,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's enough minutes in this day.

643
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of which, it is 8.30.

644
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,263
[SPEAKER_04]: We did want to keep this to an hour, so I want to respect that.

645
00:58:00,943 --> 00:58:09,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Annie, do we need to have a formal motion on sending the letter?

646
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:11,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do that informally?

647
00:58:11,032 --> 00:58:17,118
[SPEAKER_06]: A motion is probably a good thing.

648
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:28,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, before we do that then, anybody who hasn't spoken, are there issues or questions you want to raise around the zoning that we haven't talked about?

649
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:41,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And just so you know, at the next, I think there's four sessions that this consultant has with the city council.

650
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:43,392
[SPEAKER_04]: This, I believe, was the second one.

651
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:54,917
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one, he said he was going to come with his proposal for reformatting the use table of the city and cleaning that up.

652
00:58:55,697 --> 00:58:58,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, these are really good meetings.

653
00:58:58,878 --> 00:59:03,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Annie, if you could just kind of let us know when they're happening so that board members can participate.

654
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:08,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Strongly encourage all of you to follow along with them, because I think they're really helpful.

655
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:11,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, may schedule the next one for the 18th.

656
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:29,855
[SPEAKER_05]: which will be immediately followed by an energy and environment symposium on unusual uses of solar, trees in Medford, and clean energy transportation from seven to nine that night.

657
00:59:31,844 --> 00:59:34,285
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, symposium's long scheduled.

658
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:37,827
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't check the city calendar when they schedule their own meetings.

659
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:39,628
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't care what anybody else's.

660
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:40,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

661
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:44,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the info for both of those to the members, that would be great.

662
00:59:46,511 --> 00:59:48,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And are we still meeting two weeks from today?

663
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:51,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that our next meeting?

664
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:53,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Annie, do you see anything coming up for that meeting?

665
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I think something in mid-November would be better because that will give enough time for

666
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:06,072
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the Macklin road review by the city engineer and recommendation back to our board.

667
01:00:06,192 --> 01:00:06,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um,

668
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:18,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, probably we can also yeah, I don't assuming there's not a you know, some new projects coming up either I think we should set aside an hour of time for the design guideline discussion.

669
01:00:18,779 --> 01:00:21,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we were going to start that we didn't do that tonight.

670
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:26,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So gives everybody a little bit more time to maybe look at some of the material that Jackie sent out or do some of their own research.

671
01:00:27,906 --> 01:00:32,269
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see anything interesting, please circulate it and and then we can

672
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:41,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Annie, we can work on structuring that discussion a little bit more or putting a kind of a straw proposal in front of people that they can respond to.

673
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:47,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to call to your attention that there are no Wednesday nights in November that are good to meet.

674
01:00:48,757 --> 01:00:53,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the next council one is the 18th.

675
01:00:53,379 --> 01:01:00,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And while you're welcome to meet after it, I actually really do have to be at the Energy and Environment Symposium because I staff that.

676
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:05,722
[SPEAKER_05]: The week after that is Veterans Day holiday.

677
01:01:05,783 --> 01:01:08,285
[SPEAKER_05]: The week before is the day after Election Day.

678
01:01:08,506 --> 01:01:11,009
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been trying not to schedule things for that day.

679
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:16,375
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Thursday the 12th, which is the day after Veterans Day?

680
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:29,106
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that is on the calendar is that the Community Preservation Committee public presentations are supposed to be that evening.

681
01:01:29,366 --> 01:01:30,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can't do that.

682
01:01:31,126 --> 01:01:32,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to be at that.

683
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:39,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do Tuesday the 10th, the day before Veterans Day?

684
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:47,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you that week that the housing production plan is going to have a webinar on November 9th, Monday.

685
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:52,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually, sorry, I didn't even, glad we looked at the calendar.

686
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:58,012
[SPEAKER_05]: We are gonna circulate to you all the draft recommendations before that.

687
01:01:58,472 --> 01:02:03,553
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be a good presentation to the public of their draft recommendations.

688
01:02:04,074 --> 01:02:10,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And that time window before, after is when we'd really like to get any substantial changes back.

689
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:14,796
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time the housing production plan is presented to this board,

690
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:18,778
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping that people will have seen the early drafts and will have weighed in.

691
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:25,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be more, I don't want to call it a rubber stamp, but this board needs to approve it.

692
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:30,343
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping that if people have concerns and questions that we can get them addressed beforehand.

693
01:02:30,483 --> 01:02:35,666
[SPEAKER_05]: And November 9th is the public meeting where we're going to present that information.

694
01:02:35,706 --> 01:02:38,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the window where we're really looking for your feedback.

695
01:02:40,148 --> 01:02:43,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because if you may not want to have meetings every single night in a week.

696
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:47,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Although Wednesday's a holiday, I give the day off, hopefully.

697
01:02:47,899 --> 01:02:49,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

698
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:55,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So Annie, in terms of a day, any recommendations for mid-November?

699
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:02,567
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do it a little earlier and do the Thursday the 5th.

700
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:06,989
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also CPC public presentations that night.

701
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:13,213
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Thursday the 19th or Thursday the 17th.

702
01:03:20,554 --> 01:03:24,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Thursday the 19th looks fine.

703
01:03:26,577 --> 01:03:27,758
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine for me.

704
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:33,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love anything after the 16th, for selfish reasons.

705
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm waiting for everyone else.

706
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:35,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be on edge.

707
01:03:35,962 --> 01:03:36,602
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

708
01:03:36,622 --> 01:03:37,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw it out there, Jackie.

709
01:03:37,803 --> 01:03:38,543
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

710
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:45,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the 19th, that's just the 18th is the next city council zoning meeting, and then the symposium that

711
01:03:47,412 --> 01:03:48,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia was talking about.

712
01:03:48,553 --> 01:04:06,047
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 19th, we can do just I guess I'm gonna just flag that that is a month from now and whether so we'll try and circulate materials before that, like significantly Around

713
01:04:08,215 --> 01:04:10,536
[SPEAKER_05]: rules and regulation changes, stuff like that.

714
01:04:10,576 --> 01:04:16,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll plan to meet even if there's nothing on the note cases so that we can move forward.

715
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:29,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these, Allie reminded us that she's also been tasked with doing some research on linkage fees, which were supposed to be reviewed every three years and haven't been changed since they were implemented in the early 90s.

716
01:04:31,946 --> 01:04:33,787
[SPEAKER_05]: But our rules and regulations are from 1974, so.

717
01:04:40,693 --> 01:04:41,654
[SPEAKER_07]: City government's hard.

718
01:04:45,037 --> 01:04:47,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Love that they're dated December 17th, 1974.

719
01:04:47,380 --> 01:05:02,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anyone on the committee who is really interested in design guidelines and would like to do some work in the next month on putting a strop proposal together?

720
01:05:07,147 --> 01:05:08,268
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, that's fine.

721
01:05:08,288 --> 01:05:10,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Annie and I will do the best we can.

722
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:24,020
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I did want to flag for you guys is, are we talking about a separate design review process or looping it in to a planning board process through the site plan review?

723
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:29,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may be a session for an attorney as well about what we can do.

724
01:05:30,524 --> 01:05:33,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think it's just part of the site plan review process.

725
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:43,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I do believe that would require some changes to the zoning to build out what our standards for site plan approval are.

726
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:49,674
[SPEAKER_06]: But that could be a question that we bring up to Attorney Brobrosky.

727
01:05:50,935 --> 01:05:51,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.

728
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:52,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's include that.

729
01:05:59,233 --> 01:06:07,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, would there be any reason for us to have a design review process that's not part of a site plan review process?

730
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:14,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Only that most of the ones I've been able to find are separate.

731
01:06:14,881 --> 01:06:18,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly why that is or what the advantage is.

732
01:06:18,223 --> 01:06:29,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the materials Jackie sent were saying also that design guidelines should be based in the comprehensive plan goals so that they're defensible, so I think

733
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:34,442
[SPEAKER_06]: this may be something that comes out of that planning process.

734
01:06:37,543 --> 01:06:40,124
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really something that I'm happy to look into more.

735
01:06:40,324 --> 01:06:52,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So is your, are you saying any, do you think as a result of that, we should just kind of go slow and wait for, you know, do what we're doing, which has been more of an informal process?

736
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:56,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'd be good to get some feedback from,

737
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:11,185
[SPEAKER_06]: the city solicitor or attorney Wabrowski about sort of what our options are, but I think that it would certainly be helpful to determine what we might want out of the comprehensive planning process.

738
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:23,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think maybe, just from what I've read so far, it seems like there was sort of a need to base, to have some backup for why we're enforcing these design guidelines.

739
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:27,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if any of you are more familiar with other communities where you've worked with design guidelines.

740
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:34,653
[SPEAKER_08]: The design guidelines come from zoning or some master plan.

741
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:50,756
[SPEAKER_08]: But the only other thing I was thinking in the interim is that you develop guidance for proponents of what to come prepared with at the presentations to our board to make it easier for everybody.

742
01:07:51,016 --> 01:07:53,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's sort of where we're always having

743
01:07:54,323 --> 01:07:55,464
[SPEAKER_04]: We ask the same question.

744
01:07:55,524 --> 01:08:00,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So people can have it again, we give out a checklist of saying here's you can expect questions on these things.

745
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, well, and I also get a lot of calls.

746
01:08:02,853 --> 01:08:05,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, from developers in advance of submitting.

747
01:08:05,756 --> 01:08:12,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think like an FAQ document might be a good A good thing to do anyway.

748
01:08:13,906 --> 01:08:32,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I'm used to the city of Boston is very complex and they have built into their zoning, you know, there's specific articles of zoning dedicated to each neighborhood and within that neighborhood zoning, it has very specific design guidelines to be compatible with that neighborhood.

749
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's very complex, but that's, unless you really wanna get into an overhaul like that in the city of Medford and look at different areas and neighborhoods,

750
01:08:44,237 --> 01:08:49,780
[SPEAKER_08]: and talk about neighborhood context and compatibility, that's a lot of work.

751
01:08:50,261 --> 01:09:09,493
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not only it's a lot of work, but not only will it have implications later for inadvertently or maybe purposely segregating communities when you have neighborhood character compiled into different pockets of one community, it doesn't read well or play out well.

752
01:09:10,693 --> 01:09:12,634
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thank Annie for bringing that up.

753
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:24,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran to get my notes because I haven't memorized it, but I do know that a lot of the American planning literature out there have always coupled design review guidelines with comprehensive planning.

754
01:09:25,858 --> 01:09:36,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that looks like at the local level myself, because I don't work with, this is the first comprehensive plan that I've ever even touched, which I haven't even touched.

755
01:09:36,202 --> 01:09:39,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't even provided help or feedback or anything when Alicia has asked for it.

756
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:49,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just guessing that it has to do with the city's master plan and the city's overall vision so that everything is holistically come together.

757
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:01,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that we have a good

758
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:09,424
[SPEAKER_04]: of discussion that can be part of a letter that you know Annie and I can can massage.

759
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:18,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Annie do you want to just hit any of the the notes that you that you took to make sure we're not missing anything?

760
01:10:18,988 --> 01:10:21,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, so what I have here is

761
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:33,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Information on what the recommended process would be for lining all of our different development review items up.

762
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: The best opportunity for the community development board to weigh in or participate in this process.

763
01:10:45,087 --> 01:10:52,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Some more information that he mentioned he was going to look into on demolition delay and the historic process and how that fits in with his proposed changes.

764
01:10:54,006 --> 01:10:57,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Any opportunities for cross-reference to the City's Solar Ordinance?

765
01:10:58,168 --> 01:11:03,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Opportunities to encourage energy efficiency and green building standards in the Zoning Ordinance?

766
01:11:06,172 --> 01:11:11,115
[SPEAKER_06]: To what extent does he recommend design guidelines or a design review process?

767
01:11:11,455 --> 01:11:14,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Should this be incorporated into the Ordinance or should we do it some other way?

768
01:11:14,356 --> 01:11:21,480
[SPEAKER_06]: And the wording of neighborhood character and social structures.

769
01:11:25,038 --> 01:11:28,760
[SPEAKER_06]: and concerns about that and why he uses that.

770
01:11:31,322 --> 01:11:34,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, you mentioned design, like how to handle design guidelines, right?

771
01:11:35,184 --> 01:11:35,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

772
01:11:39,026 --> 01:11:40,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we miss anything, anybody?

773
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:41,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you want to add anything?

774
01:11:44,809 --> 01:11:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, why don't we entertain a motion to send a letter with our feedback

775
01:11:55,278 --> 01:12:01,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't want to cross the city council is the only thing.

776
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:07,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we, why don't we send maybe the letter to Alicia?

777
01:12:07,564 --> 01:12:08,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

778
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:15,668
[SPEAKER_05]: If you send it to me, because theoretically this board is appointed by the mayor and would go to the mayor, to the council.

779
01:12:18,769 --> 01:12:21,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't, why don't we direct the letter to,

780
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:34,754
[SPEAKER_04]: the Director of Community Development, and to ask for her and her staff to get feedback on these questions we've raised.

781
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make that motion, Andre.

782
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:41,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

783
01:12:41,656 --> 01:12:42,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Katie.

784
01:12:42,876 --> 01:12:43,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second?

[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second.

786

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Christy.

787
01:12:48,594 --> 01:12:50,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do a roll call vote now.

788
01:12:51,355 --> 01:12:53,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, no, or abstain.

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also a yes.

802

[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

803
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:10,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, everybody.

804
01:13:12,466 --> 01:13:13,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

805
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved, motion.

806
01:13:16,681 --> 01:13:19,963
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you, Jackie.

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a yes as well.

823
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:37,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

824
01:13:37,632 --> 01:13:38,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everybody.

825
01:13:38,334 --> 01:13:39,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

826
01:13:39,355 --> 01:13:41,478
[SPEAKER_04]: We did go over a little bit, but not too much.

827
01:13:43,141 --> 01:13:43,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, Andrew.

828
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:45,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take 15 minutes every day.

829
01:13:45,745 --> 01:13:48,750
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

830
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,012
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you in mid-November.

831
01:13:50,052 --> 01:13:52,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we agree on November 18th or 19th?

832
01:13:53,477 --> 01:13:53,517
[SPEAKER_04]: 19th.

833
01:13:55,721 --> 01:13:55,941
[SPEAKER_07]: 19th.

834
01:13:56,322 --> 01:13:56,542
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

835
01:13:56,582 --> 01:13:56,882
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go.

836
01:13:56,963 --> 01:13:58,245
