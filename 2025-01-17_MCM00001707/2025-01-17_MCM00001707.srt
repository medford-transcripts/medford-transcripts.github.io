[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Sarah.

26
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the minutes of the December 10, 2024 Traffic Commission meeting have been distributed.

27
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:37,597
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be in order, and the commissioners have reviewed them and have questions.

28
00:01:37,637 --> 00:01:38,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I will entertain questions now.

29
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:41,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, a motion to accept and approve.

30
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:44,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no questions.

31
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean, Commissioner McGiven?

32
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:52,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve.

33
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:54,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

34
00:01:55,374 --> 00:02:04,321
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Commissioner McGibbon to approve the minutes of the December 10, 2024 Traffic Commission meeting, seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski-Alvaroco.

35
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:05,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGibbon?

36
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

37
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

38
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:10,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ma'am.

39
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Buckley?

40
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:13,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

41
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:15,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

42
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

43
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,108
[SPEAKER_04]: On the vote of 4-0, the voting is approved and the minutes are accepted.

44
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,118
[SPEAKER_04]: New business, we start off January of 2025 with our meeting schedule.

45
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:31,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have it all?

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have it in front of me.

47
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:35,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, the only change is in November.

48
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:37,683
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a 3rd Tuesday.

49
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:39,684
[SPEAKER_05]: The 11th is Bedford state.

50
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:43,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the meeting we will post this publicly.

51
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:44,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it already has been posted.

52
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:45,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the commissioners all have it.

53
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:56,270
[SPEAKER_04]: The meetings will take place monthly throughout 20, 25, January 14th, February 11th, March 11th, April 8th, May 13th, June 10th, September 9th.

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: October 14th, November 18th, which is an asterisk because the Tuesday prior would be our normal meeting, but that will be Veterans Day, correct?

55
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And then December 9th, 2025.

56
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:16,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the commissioners approve of that monthly meeting, I will entertain a motion to accept the meeting schedule.

57
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:29,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you remind us chief is the reason that the summer months aren't on there has something to do with our rules and regulations or the ordinance that we haven't edited and not because we're choosing not to meet during the summer.

58
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:31,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, correct.

59
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't met in the summer months, July and August.

60
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:38,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they've ever met the traffic.

61
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:45,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe once we had a special meeting, but in a regular scheduled meeting, July and August have been excluded from this.

62
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is per regulation.

63
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:49,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

64
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:52,248
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very old fashioned to me to skip the summer months.

65
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:57,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to make sure there was a reason we were doing it and not because we always have.

66
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:02,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

67
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:12,340
[SPEAKER_04]: We can look at that as we go, because we are, again, this is longstanding, but we have been reviewing the regulations, just time and effort to get caught up in those.

68
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:19,883
[SPEAKER_04]: But as it's been posted publicly, do we have a motion to accept this schedule?

69
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:23,605
[SPEAKER_13]: So moved.

70
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:27,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion or commission are given, seconded by?

71
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,163
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'll second it.

72
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:34,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like it.

73
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:35,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on mute.

74
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:37,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I couldn't say it.

75
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I second it by Commissioner Hunt.

76
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:42,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a roll call to accept the scheduled meetings for January, for 2025.

77
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:44,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

78
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:45,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

79
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:46,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

80
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:47,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

81
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:49,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

82
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:49,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

83
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley?

84
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:56,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a vote of four to nothing, the schedule has been approved.

85
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:06,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, 2025-02, handicap parking sign for Marie Alana Chalabi, 105 Yeomans Avenue.

86
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the petitioner present?

87
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Sergeant, can you see and unmute her?

88
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:13,271
[SPEAKER_15]: She's not gonna be on?

89
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:13,691
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:14,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

91
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:15,512
[SPEAKER_15]: She doesn't have a computer.

92
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you pull up Dunbar at Yeomans, please?

93
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:24,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so for the record and to the commissioners, Ms.

94
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:34,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Chalabi has been in contact with the Secretary to the Traffic Commission and to with the Sergeant, Sergeant Rogers, and she does not have access to a computer or the ability to call in.

95
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,174
[SPEAKER_04]: but we have spoken with her and we have reviewed her situation.

96
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:45,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Alba, while they're pulling this up and sharing the screen for the residents, all the paperwork in order.

97
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:47,277
[SPEAKER_05]: All the paperwork is in order.

98
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:48,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

99
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief, I went by twice and I was unable to get a hold of her.

100
00:05:54,541 --> 00:06:03,204
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe she does have a medical condition that she's out a couple of times a week, I don't wanna get into it.

101
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,346
[SPEAKER_15]: She's asking for the space on Dunbar Ave.

102
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:12,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though her house faces Yeomans, she goes through the back door.

103
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,010
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to tell me where it is?

104
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,291
[SPEAKER_15]: All the way down to the side of the cell.

105
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,912
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not sharing your screen.

106
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to share the screen.

107
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:22,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

108
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:27,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That white car is her right-hand side, I think.

109
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:29,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

110
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:31,039
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

111
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know when you can see.

112
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Traffic.

113
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:43,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that good?

114
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:43,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Did that come over?

115
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:44,876
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the house.

116
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:46,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, now we can see it.

117
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:49,979
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

118
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you go to Yeoman's house?

119
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,000
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Yeoman's right there.

120
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,641
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the last house on Dunbar.

121
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:56,382
[SPEAKER_15]: So right here?

122
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:57,742
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you just had the house.

123
00:06:57,903 --> 00:06:58,083
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

124
00:06:59,003 --> 00:06:59,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

125
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:00,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn.

126
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:02,785
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the house right there.

127
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:05,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're pointing.

128
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:09,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes it should be a garage then.

129
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:10,435
[SPEAKER_15]: It does.

130
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:11,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Right here, there's a garage.

131
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:11,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

132
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:12,256
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

133
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:14,977
[SPEAKER_15]: So, she's looking for probably where that white car is.

134
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:16,777
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a driveway.

135
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:17,698
[SPEAKER_15]: She cannot use it.

136
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe she rents and she goes through the back door.

137
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,340
[SPEAKER_15]: So, she's requesting it to be right there on Dunbar Ave.

138
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:29,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's her car.

139
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:30,882
[SPEAKER_04]: This white one.

140
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:34,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you go down just a little further and show the driveway?

141
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,496
[SPEAKER_04]: what there is of a driveway that's not really a driveway.

142
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:40,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Be right there.

143
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:48,502
[SPEAKER_04]: So the petitioner is requesting a spot somewhere where those two vehicles are parked right now on your screen.

144
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:56,047
[SPEAKER_01]: So often one of the things we look for is why aren't they using their driveway.

145
00:07:56,067 --> 00:08:02,412
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not look like a handicapped accessible driveway in any sense of that if she's

146
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:08,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, she's got a handicap placard because she would need that to use this space.

147
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:11,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

148
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:14,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia, I believe she went.

149
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:16,264
[SPEAKER_15]: She's not allowed to park on the driveway.

150
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:17,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

151
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:22,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's very, very close to a public district.

152
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:41,296
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for her to have the awareness that if for some reason somebody else with a handicapped placard chose to use that, although honestly why they wouldn't actually go further into the square and use the handicapped spots that are really in Haynes Square, I don't know.

153
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:49,138
[SPEAKER_01]: but she should be aware that this would not be dedicated to her vehicle but would be available to anybody with a handicap placard.

154
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed and understood.

155
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we think that anybody has spoken with her to make sure she knows the rules?

156
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:01,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you speak with her?

157
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:03,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spoken with her, yes.

158
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,224
[SPEAKER_05]: She's been in several times.

159
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:10,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so she's been in here several times and she's aware and we will restate those conditions to her.

160
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:12,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

161
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:18,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And did we look at whether there is appropriate space there?

162
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:25,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we actually, are people using this as two spaces and adding the handicapped would make this to be just one for her?

163
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:28,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see two vehicles.

164
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, there's more space there, isn't there?

165
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's more space there probably even for an additional vehicle.

166
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:35,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Those seem to be crowded and they're just in that picture.

167
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:36,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they're parked with that.

168
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:39,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a high hill?

169
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:42,193
[SPEAKER_05]: By the tree?

170
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,274
[SPEAKER_05]: In front.

171
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go up now.

172
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:47,315
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so.

173
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:47,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't see one.

174
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:52,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking to make sure there's nothing else on that sidewalk.

175
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:55,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief, I didn't observe any other running any gaps.

176
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:55,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

177
00:09:55,858 --> 00:10:01,980
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so it seems still straightforward.

178
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me, if none of the other commissioners have anything, let me ask, anyone in the public wish to speak on behalf of this petition?

179
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:11,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your hand?

180
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks fine to me.

181
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:16,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, screen.

182
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:19,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

183
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, back to the commissioners.

184
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:26,654
[SPEAKER_04]: A motion on this?

185
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:33,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I support a motion.

186
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Alicia's point.

187
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I just always like to confirm with the people that they understand it's not for them specifically.

188
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:46,300
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty standard at this point in time and we're doing this for everyone.

189
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

190
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:52,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd make the motion to approve unless there's any other comments.

191
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Alicia's got her hand up maybe.

192
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:57,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was an accident.

193
00:10:58,088 --> 00:10:58,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

194
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,771
[SPEAKER_04]: have a second to approve petition 2025-02?

195
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:15,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

196
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:15,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

197
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:17,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

198
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:18,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

199
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:20,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley?

200
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:20,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

201
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:30,405
[SPEAKER_04]: On the vote of four to nothing, the motion is approved 2025-03, Hennie Peck, excuse me, HP sign for Miss Marie Ketley-Barron, 5 Cherry Street.

202
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:35,349
[SPEAKER_04]: If the petitioner is present, please raise your hand, make yourself known, and unmute yourself.

203
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,312
[SPEAKER_04]: She's gonna get on, Chief.

204
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,334
[SPEAKER_01]: We set it so that people can't unmute themselves.

205
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:41,755
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to

206
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:45,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'll click on them if they're here, but this petitioner.

207
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:46,323
[SPEAKER_12]: If you just called, she can't.

208
00:11:46,403 --> 00:11:48,883
[SPEAKER_12]: She can't be here as well, but we can speak on behalf of that.

209
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:49,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Ms.

210
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:56,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Barron has just called the station and indicated that she cannot get on also because of lack of access.

211
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:03,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we pull that up and share the screen with the 5 Cherry Street Police Sergeant?

212
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:07,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief, I went down and spoke with Ms.

213
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:08,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Barron today.

214
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:10,768
[SPEAKER_15]: She's elderly.

215
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,068
[SPEAKER_15]: She walked with the cane.

216
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:21,349
[SPEAKER_15]: She's requesting a space in front of her house, one for her car, and also for the ride that picks her up several times a week.

217
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,913
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no driveway at this house on either side.

218
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:31,978
[SPEAKER_15]: She's requesting one spot?

219
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:32,759
[SPEAKER_15]: One spot.

220
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:33,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

221
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Further up, right?

222
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,644
[SPEAKER_15]: So what if I'm sharing her door is on the right side?

223
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,446
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not sharing.

224
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:43,427
[SPEAKER_15]: coming your way?

225
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,874
[SPEAKER_15]: The other way.

226
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:05,099
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the one to the left, and that's her door right there.

227
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:06,299
[SPEAKER_15]: No, go back.

228
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:09,901
[SPEAKER_15]: This door?

229
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, that's her door right there.

230
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:15,808
[SPEAKER_15]: So we should be looking for the space right where that car is.

231
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:17,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Jump up a little.

232
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:19,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

233
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,870
[SPEAKER_04]: That driveway is to the house next door, correct?

234
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the apartment?

235
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, house next door.

236
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:37,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So no driveway, limited frontage, curb frontage, but there is enough for an HP sign or a parking spot.

237
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:41,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Now all the paperwork has been submitted and is in order?

238
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:42,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Chief.

239
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Paperwork has been submitted and is in order?

240
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:53,998
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems it makes sense.

241
00:13:54,118 --> 00:14:06,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be clear that she has a vehicle that's going to use it, which we've discussed in the past, that pickup and drop-offs for the ride would be like a drop-off zone, not a handicapped parking spot.

242
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:11,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And if she's parked in it, then where's the ride going to park?

243
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:15,027
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's neither here nor there.

244
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fine with it.

245
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the other side.

246
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other commissioners' comments?

247
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:28,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to open it up for public comment, or if anyone has anything.

248
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:29,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just see.

249
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone in the public wish to comment on this petition?

250
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:40,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, I go back to the commissioners.

251
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:53,786
[SPEAKER_02]: This same as before, just educating our citizens about what they can be used for and then that they're not exclusive.

252
00:14:54,326 --> 00:15:03,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just encourage us to make sure that she understands completely, particularly as Alicia pointed out with the ride, that technically the ride can't use that spot.

253
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:07,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you've had a little bit of a conceding with her about yes.

254
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's correct.

255
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:09,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

256
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

257
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:18,431
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will, I will make sure that both advisements are made to the petitioner from the traffic department here of the traffic offices.

258
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:22,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a motion to approve 2025 03?

259
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

260
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion of Commissioner Hunt, seconded by?

261
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:38,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

262
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Brzezinski, I'll have a roll call, please.

263
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:43,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

264
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:44,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

265
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:46,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

266
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:47,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

267
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

268
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:49,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

269
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:51,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley?

270
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:56,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, on the vote of 4-0, the petition is approved.

271
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:02,861
[SPEAKER_04]: 2025-04 HP sign for Miscondolo 88 Circuit Road.

272
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:04,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the petitioner is present.

273
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:04,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we...

274
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:21,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we're doing that, Albert, is the petition in order and paperwork received?

275
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is in order.

276
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:26,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

277
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:27,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Paperwork is in order.

278
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

279
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

280
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:33,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

281
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:34,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Ms.

282
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Cadilby.

283
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:37,424
[SPEAKER_04]: We've received your petition.

284
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:41,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to speak about it and tell us a little bit about your need?

285
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:43,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

286
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:52,712
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do have a driveway, but my driveway is extremely narrow.

287
00:16:53,332 --> 00:17:05,339
[SPEAKER_07]: It's concrete with walls on each side, and I'm only four foot eight.

288
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:14,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I have sarcoma cancer, and it makes it difficult for me to walk.

289
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:28,935
[SPEAKER_07]: But because of the incline in the driveway, my feet don't hit the ground when I go to get out and it's extremely narrow.

290
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:32,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, there it is.

291
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:37,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking for a spot right in front of the house there?

292
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:38,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Right in front of the house, yeah.

293
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:49,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially like in the winter when it's icy or snowy in the driveway there.

294
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:54,061
[SPEAKER_07]: When I put my foot down and it's ice, then I'm sliding.

295
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have, you know.

296
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:58,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Understood, yeah.

297
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:02,228
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an interesting driveway, to say the least.

298
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:04,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for the presentation.

299
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hold on one second.

300
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,152
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to the commissioners.

301
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:10,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have questions of the petitioner of the situation?

302
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:29,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly it's sort of what we've just been saying to make sure she understands that what's installed is a legal handicap parking location, which means anybody with a handicap parking permit can park there.

303
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:32,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a personal reserve spot.

304
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:34,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just useful for people to understand that.

305
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:37,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

306
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I appreciate that.

307
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:44,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And same thing, it's not also like in a snow emergency.

308
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,051
[SPEAKER_07]: people automatically assume that you can still park there.

309
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:48,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot.

310
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:50,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

311
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:54,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It's subject to the other side restriction.

312
00:18:54,494 --> 00:18:56,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I would abide by whatever side of the street.

313
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:57,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

314
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:04,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the other commissioners have any questions?

315
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone in the public have any?

316
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to comment on this petition.

317
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:17,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, we will revert back to the commissioners.

318
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Further comment or a motion?

319
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:22,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no comment.

320
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:24,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd make a motion, if possible.

321
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,328

[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

325
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:40,695
[SPEAKER_04]: second.

326
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:43,057

327
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,159

00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:46,760

[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all set for the meeting.

344
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:14,812

345
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:16,573
[SPEAKER_04]: You may, yes.

346
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:17,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

347
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:18,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

348
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:19,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

349
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:20,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

350
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:28,902
[SPEAKER_04]: 2025-05 Handicap Parking Sign, San Francisco Oliveira 132 Sharon Street, apartment number 1.

351
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,829
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get that up on the screen.

352
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:46,273
[SPEAKER_04]: If the petitioner is available.

353
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:47,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief, I'm by there today.

354
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:49,515
[SPEAKER_15]: I had no one through the door.

355
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,156
[SPEAKER_15]: It appears to be a multi-family house.

356
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:58,539
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a driveway to the right, it goes all the way back.

357
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was unable to speak to the petitioner.

358
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the petitioner present here or someone here wishing to speak for the petitioner?

359
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:08,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Raise your hand.

360
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I just joined it.

361
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:15,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if that was my petition, Megan.

362
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:21,632
[SPEAKER_03]: As it would be what you're at 18 alternate street.

363
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:22,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

364
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

365
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:24,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

366
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:24,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on a second.

367
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not your petition yet, sir.

368
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:28,846
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is Robin.

369
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:30,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Robin.

370
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:31,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm sorry.

371
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

372
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,031
[SPEAKER_00]: My thing said unmute or something out.

373
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,113
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my 1st time using zoom.

374
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:37,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're doing a great job.

375
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, welcome to the Metro Traffic Commission meeting.

376
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:47,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are looking at your petition right now for the HP sign at 132 Sharon Street.

377
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:50,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you just tell us a little bit about your situation?

378
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,742
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not have to get into your medical situation or any specific details.

379
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:57,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really the details about the property.

380
00:21:57,423 --> 00:22:01,545
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, myself and my husband, we're just moving into that unit.

381
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:04,306
[SPEAKER_00]: We are moving from 322 Pearl Street, Malden.

382
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:16,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a handicapped plaque assigned by the city in front of 322 Pearl for my health condition, for COPD and asthma.

383
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:26,790
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that unit, it's a three family and it will be musical cards.

384
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:30,632
[SPEAKER_00]: If I pull all the way into that driveway,

385
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:37,898
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get in there first, the next person comes in, I'm going to have to have them move out so I can get out, and vice versa.

386
00:22:38,378 --> 00:22:44,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And the back door, the girl on the third floor, she usually parks her car at the back staircase.

387
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:51,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I know it's a two-car garage, but the landlord uses one.

388
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:54,371
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know who uses the other one.

389
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:58,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just new there, so I don't know what that

390
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,182
[SPEAKER_00]: assignment of those garages are for.

391
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:19,632
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, he does say we can park in the driveway, but like I said, it would be to come out, go in the driveway, have someone's parked in front of me or behind me, like I'd have to, we have to play musical cards with three families.

392
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:26,837
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just hoping that we could get a sign out the front,

393
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:30,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was two parking spaces in front of the house.

394
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:38,111
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could get the one closest to that staircase would be great.

395
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:43,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Because under that snowbank, that ground is no good.

396
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,117
[SPEAKER_00]: That really needs to be re-cemented.

397
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:46,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

398
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:53,489
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, thank you for the presentation.

399
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:56,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Standby, I wanna talk to the commission here a little bit.

400
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner, any questions or comments related to the petition?

401
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:05,973
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I understand that anyone with a handicapped sign could park there, that's understandable.

402
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:07,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

403
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:08,594
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you for the time.

404
00:24:08,634 --> 00:24:09,835
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been listening, very good.

405
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:10,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I have.

406
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:12,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That is one of our advisement.

407
00:24:13,156 --> 00:24:15,477
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let me see what the commissioners have to say.

408
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question, are you entering through the front door?

409
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:25,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Robin?

410
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she got muted.

411
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:29,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's to unmute her.

412
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:31,154
[SPEAKER_13]: She just got unmuted.

413
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:33,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's what she said, right?

414
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:36,319
[SPEAKER_13]: She wants to park in the front and then go up the stairs.

415
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,802
[SPEAKER_13]: She did indicate that she wanted closest to that front stairs, yes.

416
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:42,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I use the front entrance.

417
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,402
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't look like there's a lot of competition for parking on this street.

418
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:57,385
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like even though there's three families and two families, it looks like there's driveways.

419
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Almost on the street in this picture.

420
00:25:01,908 --> 00:25:05,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at least that's represented by that map picture, yeah.

421
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:09,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Sam, when I went by, there was plenty of parking and stuff.

422
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:10,313
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like it.

423
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:11,374
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm familiar with it.

424
00:25:12,154 --> 00:25:12,955
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm okay with this.

425
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Other commissioners' questions, comments?

426
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:18,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll open it up to the public.

427
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:22,416
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone else in the public has any questions or would like to comment on the petition?

428
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:26,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I see no comment.

429
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Entertain a motion.

430
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:31,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner McGiven, was there a motion somewhere in there?

431
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:35,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm motioning to approve for sure, unless the folks that want one more discussion.

432
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:41,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, the motion of Commissioner McGiven.

433
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:42,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

434
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:45,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

435
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:47,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

436
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:49,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Alba, can you give us a roll call, please?

437
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

438
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:51,840

454
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:36,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Alba, has that issue been resolved?

455
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:38,646
[SPEAKER_05]: That issue has been resolved.

456
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:41,487

[SPEAKER_04]: Megan, can you just unmute yourself?

462
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:13,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

463
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the traffic commission.

464
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:17,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your participation.

465
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:20,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just give us a brief explanation of your petition and what you are requesting?

466
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:31,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm a small business owner, and I have a transportation service.

467
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:45,721
[SPEAKER_09]: My vehicle is mainly, I have a garage in Everett, the service vehicle, but I have one particular vehicle that I use, and it has, under the company's name, commercial plate.

468
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:51,124
[SPEAKER_09]: However, it's just a white vehicle, sedan, Ford Fusion.

469
00:27:51,964 --> 00:28:00,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And I haven't had any problem parking, but I realized the other day I get a ticket.

470
00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:04,985
[SPEAKER_09]: and on Boston Ave.

471
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:11,607
[SPEAKER_09]: My house is on Halton Street, but I have, there's a driveway on Boston Ave.

472
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:19,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually I park on Boston Ave and Halton Street, wherever, and there's no issue of parking.

473
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:29,953
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was told that the ordinance is gonna be enforced, and I said that my vehicle has, this is one I use

474
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:32,635
[SPEAKER_09]: or private, but it's under the company's name.

475
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:40,163
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just need to have a permission to have my car parked into my house, my street.

476
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:42,746
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the driveway that I have.

477
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:43,526
[SPEAKER_09]: But I

478
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:56,715
[SPEAKER_09]: but I have a couple of cars already in my driveway.

479
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,478
[SPEAKER_09]: And I usually park in right there on Boston Ave.

480
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry to interrupt.

481
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:04,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask a question?

482
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:06,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So you live your own apartment?

483
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:06,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

484
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

485
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,957
[SPEAKER_09]: right behind that building in the back of Boston Ave.

486
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:17,641
[SPEAKER_09]: But my address is 18 Halton Street.

487
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:21,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm tucked into the middle of a bunch of other houses there.

488
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:36,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know, this is my private car, but under the company's name, company's registration, and I was just wondering if I can be allowed to use.

489
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:41,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had any property for 20 years, which I had the service.

490
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:42,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple of questions.

491
00:29:42,774 --> 00:29:46,094
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the vehicle make and model that you're requesting?

492
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:49,495
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a 2014 Ford Fusion sedan.

493
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:54,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, with commercial plates, obviously.

494
00:29:58,943 --> 00:30:01,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thanks.

495
00:30:01,624 --> 00:30:04,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

496
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:08,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your driveway there.

497
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:10,206
[SPEAKER_04]: How many vehicles park in that driveway?

498
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:17,808
[SPEAKER_09]: That driveway is access driveway for me, but it belongs to 8098 Boston Ave.

499
00:30:17,828 --> 00:30:18,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I have, there is a,

500
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:30,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And 90, what's it called, 94 Boston Ave.

501
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,933
[SPEAKER_09]: They have those driveway.

502
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:36,376
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the access to go in.

503
00:30:36,977 --> 00:30:39,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the bink house, I live behind them.

504
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:54,583
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have a other, there's another, the gentleman on 98, Mr. Tranzioni has a construction company, has a couple of cars there.

505
00:30:56,504 --> 00:31:02,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, and I have a van, and I have a one van parked there.

506
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

507
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:10,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioners, questions, concerns of the petitioner?

508
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:19,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a problem that we've been needing to solve for a while.

509
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:27,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have extreme sympathy for somebody who has a sedan with commercial plates that they take home with them.

510
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:31,100
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've been saying for a long time this is an issue.

511
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:41,067
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also talked about the fact that commercial businesses need to have storage for their vehicles and shouldn't be using the public ways for storage.

512
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:55,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there is a difference though between that and somebody who works at their home and has commercial plates and is trying to park their car at their home, but they have commercial plates because they run a business from their home.

513
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:57,900
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a way to address that.

514
00:31:58,505 --> 00:32:04,689
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think this is a longstanding problem that it's been a few years on us since we've had somebody come with this problem.

515
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:14,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was somebody last year wasn't there and he actually had a van, like a work van that he was allowed to bring home with tools and ladders.

516
00:32:16,256 --> 00:32:16,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

517
00:32:16,857 --> 00:32:26,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we ran into a problem even with that one and I don't want to put Sarah on the spot, but I don't know that we have an avenue of giving a residential parking permit

518
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:35,585
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial vehicle because we do not have a commercial vehicle there's no way to

519
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:44,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you're welcome to chime in or not chime in on this situation.

520
00:32:44,592 --> 00:32:49,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I understand and I think the video shows that my car was parked there.

521
00:32:50,195 --> 00:32:51,336
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a white sedan.

522
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have any commercial logins or any lettering or anything.

523
00:32:56,139 --> 00:33:01,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It's completely not being used for commercial except that, you know, for

524
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:10,529
[SPEAKER_09]: for the for for Kimberly purposes that it has the registration as a commercial.

525
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:17,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I have a business to provide for eight vehicles that I park on.

526
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:25,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a garage that I lease at the 23 Beecham Street in Everett, so it's not a commercial per se.

527
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:28,023
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my car that I'm trying to.

528
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:35,146
[SPEAKER_09]: to just come at home and go back to it, except having the plate.

529
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't have logos.

530
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:38,248
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have any lettering.

531
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:43,670
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have anything to discern as a commercial except the plate number.

532
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a personal use.

533
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Understood.

534
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:48,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

535
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So to the Director of Parking, is there an avenue to even do this?

536
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:58,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is a commercial plate and we have his registration here.

537
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:02,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It is definitely commercial registration type.

538
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:11,955
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I could see us granting is a variance to a resident permit parking, right, that you have available.

539
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:12,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean,

540
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:20,350
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something, that's how we would probably enter it if he's getting a variance for Holton Street because it's residential.

541
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:42,640
[SPEAKER_10]: We could put it in there so that the parking control specialist would not fight it for the permit parking, but to communicate that that is an exception as far as the commercial regulations, there's not a good way for us to communicate that in the field unless I just send them with a list of if this is one of many.

542
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:58,050
[SPEAKER_10]: to come of, you know, maybe not many, but an occasional exception for commercial vehicles, there's not a way for us to enter that in the system right now so that there is a way to alert them not to cite it for parking overnight.

543
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:06,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, everything is possible, but I am weary of making exceptions like this.

544
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:28,861
[SPEAKER_10]: And in this case, specifically because from what I've heard, and maybe correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like this vehicle is generally not used for commercial purposes, but rather personal purposes, which makes me question why it has to have a commercial plate to begin with and isn't registered under the vehicle owner as opposed to commercial vehicle.

545
00:35:29,382 --> 00:35:33,343
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's that.

546
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:36,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will point out to the commissioners,

547
00:35:37,796 --> 00:36:04,350
[SPEAKER_04]: that we have other table items related to residents looking for commercial parking variances, and we've never found a means of providing this to them that is satisfactory to the city without, I think, maybe opening a tidal wave of requests for commercial parking.

548
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:10,714
[SPEAKER_04]: residents, commercial vehicle owners, and wishing to park them on the street.

549
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:23,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I just point that out that every single one that we've received in the last few years has been tabled, and or I think we did try to deal with one last year, and we had considerable trouble with it.

550
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the name, which street that was, Walcott maybe?

551
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, memory.

552
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:36,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just add that for discussion to the commissioners, how they would like to proceed on this one.

553
00:36:40,785 --> 00:36:43,306
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't seem like we have the option to grant an exception.

554
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:50,952
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like we could table it for some future date that we have a solution.

555
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:59,458
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, it seems like the solution is if you want to park your car on the street and you have to have residential plates,

556
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:09,061
[SPEAKER_04]: or personal politicians.

557
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:13,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we speak to the petitioner again, is there anyone else?

558
00:37:13,604 --> 00:37:16,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else in the public wishing to speak to this, raise your hand.

559
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:16,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Indicate.

560
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:31,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have another question for the petitioner, Mr. Bangan.

561
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:43,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you own a transport business and you use this as one of your business vehicles, and what you're telling us, you're using it to go back and forth to your residence, but is there a reason you can't park into your driveway with that vehicle?

562
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... Am I muted?

563
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:47,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?

564
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:48,516
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you, yes.

565
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:49,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

566
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:51,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a driveway, actually.

567
00:37:51,638 --> 00:38:01,366
[SPEAKER_09]: The driveway belongs to... It's an access driveway, but it belongs to the two other buildings that... My address is on Halston Street, actually.

568
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:10,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have been able to have asked Mr. Tranzioni to give me one spot from him.

569
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:20,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And, but I've been trying, this is, I'm trying, as the director says that, the residence permit, that's fine.

570
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on Halton Street.

571
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:30,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm willing to take the residence permit, but I don't have a spot to park on my car.

572
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:32,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is, it's not a business.

573
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:33,950
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be the plate.

574
00:38:35,598 --> 00:38:37,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you have commercial plates on that vehicle.

575
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,261
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's right.

576
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:48,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not as it comes, you know, you just indicate to us again where you reside, because we had 18 Holton, but then I thought you indicated that residence was on Boston Ave.

577
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:52,214
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, the driveway to enter into the access driveway.

578
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:53,816
[SPEAKER_09]: is on.

579
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:58,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a drive, you know, I have a path to get in.

580
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:08,029
[SPEAKER_09]: The building is stacked between 14, behind 14 Halton Street and 94 and 98 Boston Ave behind it.

581
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:10,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that another building back there?

582
00:39:11,572 --> 00:39:13,474
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only building.

583
00:39:14,415 --> 00:39:13,474
94, 98.

584
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:15,476
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, it's the,

585
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:23,315
[SPEAKER_09]: 16 Holton Street and 18 Holton Street is in the behind building.

586
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:24,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a kind of a rear building.

587
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:32,818
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the overhead map, you can see in the middle of the block a building situated in the middle of the block.

588
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:35,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is kind of an isolated building.

589
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,140
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I am.

590
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:53,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm, you know, the reason that is that I cannot put on my name in terms of the cars already under company name, which I kind of many benefits that comes with it.

591
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:59,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, you know, it's a more of a company vehicle, not a private vehicle.

592
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:00,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I could have done that.

593
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:11,497
[SPEAKER_09]: But I tried to do that, and it's a company vehicle that I was given, and I'm trying to, it's not a business vehicle per se.

594
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:28,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been long residents here, this is the first time that I have an issue, and I'm hoping that I will be given that exception.

595
00:40:40,196 --> 00:40:41,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, any further comments, questions?

596
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my question is, is there any way to do it?

597
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:48,739
[SPEAKER_01]: What I heard from Sarah is there isn't a technical way for us.

598
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:56,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if we voted tonight and said, yes, he should be able to park that sedan on a municipal street, it makes sense.

599
00:40:56,462 --> 00:41:07,907
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a way for us to technically implement that with the parking department, at least not a way that scales, because we can't have them driving around with paper lists of who's allowed to actually park places.

600
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:09,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

601
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:19,675
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we'd be, is we would have to start a list or a text chain or an email chain of do not cite this, just this one.

602
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:30,060
[SPEAKER_10]: The other ones get, and then I'd have to explain to my staff, because they'd be curious, why this one in particular is not being cited.

603
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:36,684
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the interest of fairness and consistency, I wouldn't really have a good answer for them.

604
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:45,237
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have to wait until there's some infrastructure set up to do it.

605
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:46,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

606
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:56,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if we're working on this because I would really like us to have a way for us to allow commercial vehicles in appropriate situations to park on our streets.

607
00:41:57,002 --> 00:42:08,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need big vans and stuff like that, but this has been this way for a very long time and it just seemed a very nimby thing in the beginning.

608
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:32,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we can, I'm open to discussing that and figuring out a way with our software providers to add that in if that's something that the commission thinks is worthwhile and would be beneficial to people who have to, who can have the option to drive the commercial vehicle home, don't have a driveway, et cetera.

609
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:33,313
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be case by case.

610
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:36,895
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if there were some criteria to

611
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:46,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Train with, you know, like, if if somebody, let's just say this fella got cited and our staff, he got to talk to them.

612
00:42:46,923 --> 00:42:52,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like for them to be able to refer them to this commission with the proper.

613
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Documentation or anything they might need.

614
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:59,716
[SPEAKER_10]: to get an exception, if that is something we want to look at.

615
00:42:59,856 --> 00:43:00,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm open to it.

616
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:05,722
[SPEAKER_10]: But at this time, we're not set up to do that.

617
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:13,650
[SPEAKER_10]: We can make a workaround, but it's not going to be built in as things are right now.

618
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:17,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know other communities do allow it.

619
00:43:19,952 --> 00:43:24,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's something we base a lot of our policy on is, is it allowed elsewhere?

620
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,636
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the exceptions elsewhere?

621
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:40,625
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, it's not something that has come up in my month in this position, but happy to take a peek, take a look around, especially if you have some tables that could use revisiting.

622
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:48,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I just worry about, from the policing perspective, we get vast amounts of commercial motor vehicle

623
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:56,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I am always overly worried that we just do not have enough parking spots for all the vehicles that are registered here.

624
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:58,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a bigger issue.

625
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:02,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you open up, you know, I'm not looking at this as Mr. Megan's request.

626
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at this as a request of the entire city.

627
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:07,519
[SPEAKER_04]: He has proved it's not getting an influx of all of these.

628
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not personal on his side.

629
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:18,164
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that what can city, you know, maintain for a while, how many parking and parking spots

630
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:28,099
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing would be if we do, Sarah, then we'd have to confirm that they can.

631
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I understand that the vehicle is garaged in Medford.

632
00:44:33,644 --> 00:44:34,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that it's just a commercial plate.

633
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,188
[SPEAKER_12]: We would need to be able to make sure that they have the technology.

634
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:42,794
[SPEAKER_12]: To know that right and that would fall under the commercial vehicle that could come from outside of the state of the city.

635
00:44:43,054 --> 00:44:43,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

636
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:46,534
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sure that they can or they can't, I'm not sure.

637
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:49,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a lot of work that would have to go into allowing any ordinance like this.

638
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:52,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why, as I pointed out, we've tabled so many of them in the past.

639
00:44:53,378 --> 00:45:02,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly not going to be resolved this evening in my mind, but that's up to the commissioners, if any other commission has a comment or question.

640
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:10,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've got to table it with the others and maybe give

641
00:45:12,558 --> 00:45:20,122
[SPEAKER_13]: give some more time to this and see if we can get a new permit procedure or a new category or whatever we need.

642
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:25,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we should try to rig this to work.

643
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:28,727
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're just asking for trouble if you do that for one person.

644
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:37,412
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm OK with tabling until we have an opportunity to actually grant these types of permits.

645
00:45:39,694 --> 00:45:41,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Brzezinski.

646
00:45:42,814 --> 00:45:47,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to allow for your comments, but with the request to table, I do believe we have to take a vote on that.

647
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:48,960
[SPEAKER_04]: But go ahead with your comments.

648
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

649
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:55,265
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the, I'm trying to think, because we've been dealing with this, like you mentioned, for a while.

650
00:45:55,565 --> 00:45:56,987
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the reasoning?

651
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:00,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it statutory that we don't allow for it?

652
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:03,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just because we don't have a procedure in place?

653
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,493
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason I'm thinking,

654
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:13,043
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago, we talked about the fact that there was actually like, it wasn't in the code or the code prohibited commercial vehicle parking ordinance.

655
00:46:13,564 --> 00:46:16,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's an ordinance on commercial vehicles parked.

656
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:19,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so isn't that our starting point?

657
00:46:19,787 --> 00:46:21,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, isn't that the city hall?

658
00:46:21,147 --> 00:46:23,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, there's multiple static place, but 100%.

659
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:24,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's the ordinance.

660
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:30,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be great if we had a city hall representative on the call with us who could comment on that.

661
00:46:31,384 --> 00:46:32,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that would be the council.

662
00:46:33,785 --> 00:46:42,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim is here if he's willing to do it, but the reality is I would not advocate for changing the ordinance without having a process ready to implement.

663
00:46:42,689 --> 00:46:48,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the day you pass that ordinance, you will have people lined up asking for the permit.

664
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:49,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

665
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:55,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I always support the idea of being prepared, but coming up with a program,

666
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:03,463
[SPEAKER_02]: is great, but everybody should understand, citizens importantly, that this is a city hall issue.

667
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:18,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm happy to help formulate a program and present it to city hall with what we suggest they do, but if it's ordinance preventative, then everybody should understand that that's what needs to be fixed in the end.

668
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Commissioner Pizzitti.

669
00:47:25,348 --> 00:47:26,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Silva, did you have a comment?

670
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:32,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I just see you unmuted yourself, but if you're good with what was said, then you're good with what was said.

671
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have a motion by commission to be given to table.

672
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe we have to take a vote on that.

673
00:47:40,506 --> 00:47:41,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody seconded me.

674
00:47:42,232 --> 00:47:48,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I heard a suggestion, not a motion, but if it's a motion, I'll second.

675
00:47:49,096 --> 00:47:58,000
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have to have something spearheaded elsewhere to resolve this, and then we can do business with what's tabled.

676
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:07,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so if I read this, we have a motion from Commissioner McGiven to table, seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

677
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have a roll call, please.

678
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:12,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

679
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:13,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

680
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

681
00:48:14,689 --> 00:48:15,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

682
00:48:16,551 --> 00:48:17,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

683
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:18,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

684
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:20,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley?

685
00:48:20,373 --> 00:48:20,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

686
00:48:20,653 --> 00:48:22,855
[SPEAKER_04]: On the vote of four to nothing, the motion passes.

687
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:26,097
[SPEAKER_04]: 2025-06 has been tabled.

688
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:27,478
[SPEAKER_04]: To the petitioner.

689
00:48:28,058 --> 00:48:28,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Commissioner Hunt.

690
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:30,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, do we have a plan, though?

691
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want to just sit there on the table list forever.

692
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:36,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it sounds like a special project.

693
00:48:40,925 --> 00:48:43,766
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one person on this call with that title.

694
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:46,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.

695
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:50,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And that did not go unnoticed by myself making the comment.

696
00:48:51,668 --> 00:48:52,468
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to take us.

697
00:48:52,908 --> 00:48:56,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I say this to the commissioners and to the public and to the petitioner.

698
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:05,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, you can tell by our discussion, this is a longstanding issue for the city that we have to do some considerable work on.

699
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:08,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anything, while you haven't,

700
00:49:10,732 --> 00:49:14,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Been successful tonight and been able to grant and been given a variance.

701
00:49:14,834 --> 00:49:21,436
[SPEAKER_04]: You have spurred the conversation and we are going to kind of push forward a review of the commercial parking.

702
00:49:21,536 --> 00:49:27,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I cannot grant you a variance tonight because of the table item, but we are going to move forward and look at this and.

703
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:35,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Is still on the agenda on the table business and at some point in time that we're prepared to deal with the commercial parking situation.

704
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:40,469
[SPEAKER_04]: We will notify you of your options that so thank you for participating.

705
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:45,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate your understanding and listening.

706
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:46,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

707
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:48,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you.

708
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:49,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you 2025-08.

709
00:49:53,688 --> 00:50:18,187
[SPEAKER_04]: uh village place base 64 Salem street to discuss parking problems this is an interesting is the petitioner um i'm here this is me tiffany huffman hi how are you very good welcome uh to the traffic commission um so it's a very vague um petition but could you just discuss with us your situation and the reason for your petition

710
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:19,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.

711
00:50:19,665 --> 00:50:26,268
[SPEAKER_08]: My business is 64 Salem Street right across like diagonally across from City Hall next to the hockey store.

712
00:50:26,288 --> 00:50:34,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are like next to that parking lot that now is business permit only.

713
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:38,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It used to be like paid parking where my customers can park.

714
00:50:39,252 --> 00:50:45,274
[SPEAKER_08]: My business is an indoor playground for kids from 0 to 6, with a focus on 0 to 3.

715
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:48,775
[SPEAKER_08]: So babies are coming to our play space every single day.

716
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:56,397
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you can imagine, that parking lot being no longer available to the public has been very detrimental to my business.

717
00:50:57,697 --> 00:51:03,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And then so the parking on our side of the street, so if you're driving on Salem Street, it's on the right-hand side.

718
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:07,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only 30 minutes, like the metered spots.

719
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:20,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So I understand that guests can obviously cross the street, they can use the crosswalks, but again with the children that they're bringing, people make poor decisions and they don't always use the crosswalks.

720
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:32,007
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can do some things to make the parking on our side of the street, not short-term parking, but like two hours, that would be helpful.

721
00:51:32,027 --> 00:51:35,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's any other, like, you know, there's really no other solution.

722
00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:47,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing is that, again, people are whatever, you know, I always see someone driving the wrong way, the one way, at least once a day, if we could just have some more one-way signs for them.

723
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second part is easy.

724
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:52,362
[SPEAKER_04]: We will take a look at that.

725
00:51:52,422 --> 00:51:58,648
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been dealing with that for about... It gives me a heart attack because I know those people have kids in their car.

726
00:51:59,108 --> 00:52:00,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

727
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:01,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Understood.

728
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll deal with that one for you separately.

729
00:52:04,353 --> 00:52:08,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Two quick questions which may or may not be relevant to the conversation with the commissioners tonight.

730
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:10,938
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the hours of your operation for the business?

731
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:14,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many customers do you seem to have in your business at a time?

732
00:52:14,642 --> 00:52:16,063
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your sort of...

733
00:52:16,283 --> 00:52:18,945
[SPEAKER_08]: We're 9.30 to 5 for the most part.

734
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:21,867
[SPEAKER_08]: On the weekends we operate a little bit later for birthday parties.

735
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:27,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So like around 9 to 6.30 is roughly the times we have customers in.

736
00:52:28,691 --> 00:52:32,573
[SPEAKER_08]: We have about 30 kids, maximum 30 kids at once.

737
00:52:32,693 --> 00:52:35,495
[SPEAKER_08]: So probably 30 cars is maximum.

738
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:40,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if there's 30 kids, they might, more than one kid can come in a car.

739
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:42,740
[SPEAKER_08]: So more realistically, the max,

740
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,541
[SPEAKER_08]: we have is probably around like 15 cars in our space.

741
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:49,081
[SPEAKER_08]: So our space itself has four spots.

742
00:52:49,802 --> 00:52:58,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself and my employees, or at least I have, my employees don't really drive to work, but I have business parking, so I never use our spots in there.

743
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:01,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So we only have four spots available.

744
00:53:01,404 --> 00:53:03,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So that, you know, helps take care of that.

745
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:07,066
[SPEAKER_08]: The spot in front of the hockey store, I think there's one or two spots, I can't remember.

746
00:53:07,106 --> 00:53:08,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are all 30 minute parking.

747
00:53:10,006 --> 00:53:13,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other one in front of the business lot, I believe is also

748
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:14,348
[SPEAKER_08]: 30-minute parking.

749
00:53:14,748 --> 00:53:20,411
[SPEAKER_08]: So if even those three could be, that's just three more cars that could be on our side of the road versus the other side.

750
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:23,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

751
00:53:23,192 --> 00:53:25,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Elise, for presenting so far.

752
00:53:25,714 --> 00:53:28,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, any questions of the petitioner or just in general?

753
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:33,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a question.

754
00:53:33,078 --> 00:53:36,320
[SPEAKER_13]: She said that the parking lot next door was business parking?

755
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:38,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Did we change that?

756
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:39,252
[SPEAKER_13]: We did.

757
00:53:39,513 --> 00:53:40,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

758
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:47,319
[SPEAKER_08]: What I heard from the Chamber of Commerce is that Verizon owns it and they don't want public parking there anymore.

759
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:50,441
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's not a lot that we can do there.

760
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:55,925
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously, one of the reasons why we chose that location is that parking can be so easy.

761
00:53:56,506 --> 00:53:58,687
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, it is what it is.

762
00:53:58,848 --> 00:54:01,510
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that's what I'm hearing, that it's a dead end on that route.

763
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:03,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Silva, comments on that?

764
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:12,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we understand that it has been changed to business parking, but... It has just changed to business parking only, and exactly for that reason, because it's owned by Verizon.

765
00:54:12,864 --> 00:54:14,506
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not owned by the city of Medford.

766
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:28,135
[SPEAKER_14]: And we cannot derive income from parking, municipal parking, for public, whereas a program parking was allowed, and it was changed to business for that reason.

767
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:30,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

768
00:54:31,278 --> 00:54:31,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And understood.

769
00:54:41,518 --> 00:54:51,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say that I hope I didn't come off as dismissive about this issue because she did email me.

770
00:54:51,222 --> 00:54:56,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I think my first or second week here and I wasn't really sure how to handle it.

771
00:54:56,184 --> 00:55:00,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't yet familiar with, you know, even why that law was businessful, things like that.

772
00:55:00,646 --> 00:55:03,527
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might be why she ended up here.

773
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:04,888
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be something that I could handle.

774
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:15,032
[SPEAKER_10]: solo in the future, so I hope that Tiffany, you didn't feel like I was trying to just shut you up.

775
00:55:15,072 --> 00:55:17,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, not at all.

776
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:26,638
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is whether you've spoken to the adjacent business or businesses, I don't know if somebody is next to you in that commercial building, regarding the parking.

777
00:55:26,718 --> 00:55:31,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that Hockey Town has parking behind their building,

778
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,903
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not sure if they are in agreement about those spaces.

779
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:42,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just hesitant to take away spaces or change spaces if other adjacent businesses use them for pickup.

780
00:55:42,207 --> 00:55:51,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I can talk to them, but I will say that their customers just don't like parking in their lot because they don't like that they have to drive around.

781
00:55:52,094 --> 00:55:55,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this because their customers are always trying to park in our lot.

782
00:55:57,498 --> 00:55:59,659
[SPEAKER_08]: and a lot of them just don't know.

783
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:03,920
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of their customers don't know, but they have 10 parking spots back there.

784
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,901
[SPEAKER_08]: There's plenty of parking for their customers.

785
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:21,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I agree your reasonings are noble, not wanting people to cross the street with small children, but I'd hate to take away those spaces, put your customers there, and then have hockey town parents crossing the street with their children, thus creating the same problem because they didn't want to park behind.

786
00:56:22,086 --> 00:56:24,567
[SPEAKER_10]: But they can park behind, so it's a little bit different.

787
00:56:24,707 --> 00:56:28,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, I don't have another option for my customers like that.

788
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:31,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if I did, like, I wouldn't be here.

789
00:56:32,031 --> 00:56:42,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the meters beyond the 1, I can't speak for the 1 solo meter out there by the business lot, but all of the meters in on that side of the street into the square.

790
00:56:43,912 --> 00:56:45,034
[SPEAKER_10]: are all two hours.

791
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:57,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So if anybody has a real aversion in the meantime, with crossing the street with their children, that side of the street beyond that business lot and the bus area there is two hour parking at the meters.

792
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,523
[SPEAKER_08]: So further north, right?

793
00:57:01,143 --> 00:57:11,266
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue is that those spots are mostly taken, whereas directly across the street from me, because there's not as much foot traffic, those are the ones that are open.

794
00:57:11,286 --> 00:57:18,669
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if my customers are more concerned or I'm more concerned for them, because honestly, they come with nannies.

795
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I love nannies.

796
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:20,950
[SPEAKER_08]: They're great, but they're nannies.

797
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:26,033
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think they make the best decisions.

798
00:57:26,513 --> 00:57:29,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I've stopped a child from running into a street that wasn't mine.

799
00:57:31,296 --> 00:57:31,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

800
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:37,860
[SPEAKER_10]: My only concern is impacting the other businesses and catering only to one business in that general area.

801
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:42,605
[SPEAKER_08]: So the only other business is the hockey store.

802
00:57:42,765 --> 00:57:45,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to go work with them to see if they care.

803
00:57:45,948 --> 00:57:52,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I've needed to talk to them anyways because I'm the one educating their customers that they should be parking not in my lot.

804
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:57,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that is unfortunate.

805
00:57:57,415 --> 00:57:58,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry that's happened.

806
00:57:58,416 --> 00:57:59,436
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not your fault.

807
00:58:00,097 --> 00:58:02,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I just go to tell them.

808
00:58:04,059 --> 00:58:14,766
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was also wondering if the area in front of your business that houses that one single space meter, it could be turned into two single space meter spaces if there's enough room there.

809
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:16,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was recently work done on the curb.

810
00:58:16,947 --> 00:58:17,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct, Jim?

811
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:29,251
[SPEAKER_08]: It's correct, but I think it would be very dangerous from a visibility standpoint for at least when I leave the business law, or actually, maybe it doesn't affect it.

812
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:30,112
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're right.

813
00:58:30,152 --> 00:58:31,494
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be one more meter spot.

814
00:58:32,935 --> 00:58:33,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't guarantee there.

815
00:58:33,856 --> 00:58:34,717
[SPEAKER_10]: There might be enough room.

816
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:39,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the exact measurements, the requirements there.

817
00:58:41,998 --> 00:58:47,801
[SPEAKER_10]: just without, just off the top of my head, but that's something we can consider perhaps as well.

818
00:58:47,821 --> 00:58:48,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

819
00:58:48,561 --> 00:58:49,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt, comments?

820
00:58:50,002 --> 00:59:00,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple of, I would actually, if we have any record of how long these have been 30 minutes and therefore why they're 30 minutes, because I realized the street that Hockey Town is on is a two-way street.

821
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:06,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy for customers to turn up that street if they don't bloat right past it.

822
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,731
[SPEAKER_01]: If their customers know they have parking back there,

823
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,092
[SPEAKER_01]: and why these are 30 minute spots.

824
00:59:14,473 --> 00:59:20,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if it actually goes back to the mean chicken and rice guys in there, which was a fast takeout business.

825
00:59:21,635 --> 00:59:35,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that the business that, so chicken and rice is gone, that is the location of this village play space now, that maybe actually these spots should go to longer meters.

826
00:59:36,761 --> 00:59:38,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that looks like a two-way street.

827
00:59:39,483 --> 00:59:41,544
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering, this is the other thing, is it R?

828
00:59:42,184 --> 00:59:47,468
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will bicycle down that street that you're looking at right now to come to City Hall.

829
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:53,371
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not really clear to lots of people that that is, in fact, a two-way street.

830
00:59:54,432 --> 00:59:56,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Every once in a while, somebody will come up it.

831
00:59:57,054 --> 01:00:02,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering if it would be in the city's best interest to make it more clear that that's a two-way street?

832
01:00:07,088 --> 01:00:07,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you do that.

833
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:09,469
[SPEAKER_13]: You painted double yellow.

834
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, at the intersection.

835
01:00:14,232 --> 01:00:21,216
[SPEAKER_01]: I get concerned that people coming down it to Medford Square don't realize that somebody could come up at them.

836
01:00:23,978 --> 01:00:24,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

837
01:00:26,005 --> 01:00:30,348
[SPEAKER_13]: You mean to access the Hockey Town parking lot, that's what you're talking about, right?

838
01:00:30,508 --> 01:00:30,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

839
01:00:30,788 --> 01:00:32,929
[SPEAKER_01]: They could access the Hockey Town parking lot.

840
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:36,812
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no other really great reason to go up that street that are to the church.

841
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:44,337
[SPEAKER_01]: One assumes that if you are a regular member of the church that you would know, find out over time.

842
01:00:44,697 --> 01:00:44,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

843
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I would imagine that pure hockey tells their folks to park in the back, I would think anyway.

844
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, but at least I have the same question as you.

845
01:00:57,631 --> 01:01:00,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are those two spots or two, three spots 30 minutes?

846
01:01:00,653 --> 01:01:02,733
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the burning question in my mind.

847
01:01:03,074 --> 01:01:09,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we could do some research, but I probably willing to bet you that it either relates to, uh, the sporting goods store.

848
01:01:09,456 --> 01:01:18,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, pure hockey or Tony luchas as it was in the past, the animal or the chicken and rice have, it's, it has to be one or the other, but we can go through and look at the, uh,

849
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:24,065
[SPEAKER_04]: The history of the traffic commission when they presented those just kind of, it's not at our fingertips right now.

850
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:28,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some other things I think, environmentally, or at least urban design.

851
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:34,835
[SPEAKER_04]: We can look at the crosswalk, the double lines in Oakland, making people understand looking at the 30 minutes.

852
01:01:34,936 --> 01:01:37,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I mean, unless another commission has a.

853
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:56,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Proposal for allowing this, maybe we can just kind of get together and do some research into what we can provide to the petitioner here that the traffic commission can do to alleviate some of the problems, which is timed parking and roadway markings and parking signs, et cetera.

854
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:59,632
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Verizon is interested in selling their lot.

855
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:00,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the city should buy it.

856
01:02:00,813 --> 01:02:03,556
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like a great spot for a public parking lot, but anyway.

857
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:08,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure hockey does not on their website say anything about parking.

858
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:14,702
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a whole bunch of photos, but none of those photos show the parking lot or an overhead showing that you could get there.

859
01:02:16,863 --> 01:02:22,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no indication on their website that there is a parking.

860
01:02:26,169 --> 01:02:28,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Tiffany, the other question I asked, is there another business in there with you?

861
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:36,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you park other cars in your lot facing the other direction and create some more spots that way?

862
01:02:38,894 --> 01:02:48,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are no other business, like, we only have four spots in our spot, like, it was kind of, it was taking vehicles in this way.

863
01:02:49,473 --> 01:02:55,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do fit one we can fit one to two more in there and we do do that sometimes.

864
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:05,548
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there are there tenants upstairs because above you is apartments and there were supposed to be spots for the apartments up there.

865
01:03:06,068 --> 01:03:06,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

866
01:03:06,609 --> 01:03:08,751
[SPEAKER_08]: So they do have they park overnight.

867
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:10,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are promised parking at night.

868
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Also the tenants don't have cars up there.

869
01:03:16,024 --> 01:03:21,367
[SPEAKER_08]: It just worked out for me that they don't have cars.

870
01:03:21,387 --> 01:03:25,150
[SPEAKER_01]: It was permitted that there was one spot per unit for the apartment?

871
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:26,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

872
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:28,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, we're sharing.

873
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,452
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only one right now.

874
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I am lucky that right now, only one tenant has a car.

875
01:03:39,163 --> 01:04:03,989
[SPEAKER_08]: though and most of them leave during the day like basically since we're they're usually gone by the time we're in business and they're not back like we you know we're just nine to five really so they're usually out before and like after so the tenants haven't been a major issue it could change obviously if the tenants start getting cars but i think um

876
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:06,190
[SPEAKER_08]: So that hasn't been an issue.

877
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:11,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, this building used to have the green space were parking spots, too, that were taken away for the tenants.

878
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:13,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously, it's not my problem.

879
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:17,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it is, but that was another thing that has happened.

880
01:04:17,998 --> 01:04:20,040
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, overall, it's fine.

881
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I just worry about, like, my customers aren't really too bothered.

882
01:04:23,462 --> 01:04:27,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I just worry about, because when are people going to make poor decisions, right?

883
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:30,147
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be when it's raining, when visibility is bad, right?

884
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,569
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to jet across the street and the cars can't see.

885
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:35,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want a tragedy to happen.

886
01:04:36,191 --> 01:04:40,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just know that people don't make the best decisions.

887
01:04:48,277 --> 01:04:54,681
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the smallest thing we could do is if we could change back the 30 minutes, at least that just helps me like that's two more spots, right?

888
01:04:56,862 --> 01:04:57,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

889
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:09,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be in favor of changing the meters to longer, but I do think that it's only fair for us to just find out why for somebody to have a conversation with pure hockey.

890
01:05:09,797 --> 01:05:14,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, part of me says pure hockey is a lot.

891
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:15,320
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to use it.

892
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,941
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it's going to need to be.

893
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:22,084
[SPEAKER_01]: But they should be spoken to.

894
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:23,004
[SPEAKER_01]: They should know.

895
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:26,386
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't find out from the meters in front of them just changing.

896
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:30,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can add another meter, that would be great.

897
01:05:30,437 --> 01:05:35,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we ask whoever would be appropriate perhaps Todd to review that.

898
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, could lay one out if it's doable.

899
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:47,811
[SPEAKER_04]: we could do some research on why it's 30 minutes and get that information, obtain that information.

900
01:05:47,871 --> 01:05:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We can speak with traffic engineering.

901
01:05:50,252 --> 01:06:04,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Blake isn't available this evening, but I'm sure we could come up with some ideas, including the markings of Oakland Street and make sure people understand that they can get up there and out easily enough and that Peel Hockey could use that parking lot more for themselves.

902
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,742
[SPEAKER_04]: The bigger question is that's what we could do.

903
01:06:06,802 --> 01:06:09,044
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we want to handle the petition this evening?

904
01:06:10,998 --> 01:06:13,659
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it actually say?

905
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just to discuss parking problems.

906
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:19,041
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I said it's a unique item on the agenda.

907
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:27,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We did abide by the parameters of the petition, but I don't see a motion that needs to be taken on something that's a discussion.

908
01:06:29,466 --> 01:06:33,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I want us to follow through on this.

909
01:06:34,048 --> 01:06:36,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we could resolve this off our

910
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:45,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Our agenda know if we know that somebody else is gonna it doesn't need to come back on our agenda to change the length of time of those meters.

911
01:06:47,513 --> 01:06:47,713
[SPEAKER_01]: yep.

912
01:06:48,853 --> 01:07:02,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Just just to throw it in there i'm happy to take this back over after this meeting i'm happy i'm very glad to have your all feedback and we'll you know figure out why we'll kind of dive in and figure out why they're 30 minutes.

913
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:08,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also curious about that single space one by the business lot, because I could have swore that one was two hours.

914
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:10,536
[SPEAKER_10]: But if that one's not two hours, same thing.

915
01:07:10,556 --> 01:07:12,117
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see why it's 30.

916
01:07:13,478 --> 01:07:15,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Then also look into adding another meter there.

917
01:07:16,419 --> 01:07:20,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe worry about the 30-minute issue first.

918
01:07:20,342 --> 01:07:29,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Having to take this off of the commission's hands now that I'm a little bit more established in this office and I have a better idea of what to do and I've gotten some feedback from this commission.

919
01:07:32,728 --> 01:07:40,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so, uh, if you want to, if you want to resolve this issue, it will not be forgotten after today.

920
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:42,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will maintain contact with the business owner.

921
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:54,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Director McDermott, thank you for those comments, and I will offer you my traffic sergeants to assist with Director Blake and the traffic engineering, as Commissioner McGiven has already indicated would be part of that.

922
01:07:56,753 --> 01:07:57,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

923
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So to the petitioner, Ms.

924
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:01,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Hubschman, are you okay with this?

925
01:08:01,937 --> 01:08:04,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the petitions for discussion.

926
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:05,060
[SPEAKER_04]: We've discussed it.

927
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:10,644
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand that there has to be some kind of changes here, but we have to take a deeper look at that.

928
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:15,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So net net, I will follow up with Sarah, right?

929
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:16,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

930
01:08:17,032 --> 01:08:17,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

931
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sarah will have access to all of our teams.

932
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:20,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

933
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:21,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

934
01:08:21,676 --> 01:08:22,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

935
01:08:22,197 --> 01:08:23,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for listening.

936
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:27,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, again, just don't want those poor little kids.

937
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:30,292
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I understand it.

938
01:08:31,934 --> 01:08:36,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we also have some concerns that we're all looking at independently here.

939
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:41,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think hopefully we arrive at a really quick and easy solution to the situation there.

940
01:08:42,207 --> 01:08:44,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for your participation in bringing this forward.

941
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:45,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having your business here.

942
01:08:46,512 --> 01:08:47,652
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you, guys.

943
01:08:48,113 --> 01:08:48,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, thanks very much.

944
01:08:49,673 --> 01:09:00,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the Commissioner, we will mark 2025-08 as resolved, because it has been discussed and we have some sort of resolution.

945
01:09:00,317 --> 01:09:03,798
[SPEAKER_04]: 2025-09, City Hall parking lot, new parking restrictions.

946
01:09:04,918 --> 01:09:09,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Jim Silva, Special Projects Coordinator, the floor is yours.

947
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, this impacts the 71 spaces on the

948
01:09:14,532 --> 01:09:17,494
[SPEAKER_14]: south side of City Hall facing City Hall Mall.

949
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:23,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, the sign has two-hour municipal business.

950
01:09:23,717 --> 01:09:30,100
[SPEAKER_14]: We would like to remove that and have it only for municipal employees.

951
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:36,543
[SPEAKER_14]: There are 76 spaces in total, but this only impacts 71 of them.

952
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:43,467
[SPEAKER_14]: One of them is a veteran spot which we'll maintain and four are HP spaces which are open to anyone.

953
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:57,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently what is occurring is folks are parking there and potentially going on a commuter bus, or they're going to Atrius Health, et cetera, or they're going to the dentist office.

954
01:09:57,293 --> 01:10:00,456
[SPEAKER_14]: We have very little ways of enforcing this.

955
01:10:00,757 --> 01:10:07,704
[SPEAKER_14]: So where the charging station is to the left and from the charging station towards City Hall, that area there.

956
01:10:08,902 --> 01:10:20,072
[SPEAKER_14]: So those 2 lanes currently the sign again says municipal employees by permit with additional 2 hours for city business.

957
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:22,794
[SPEAKER_14]: We just like to remove the city business.

958
01:10:23,235 --> 01:10:30,982
[SPEAKER_14]: There are 19 spaces out in front on the north part of City Hall available for folks to manage city business.

959
01:10:34,446 --> 01:10:46,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimately, our goal is to encourage our employees to seek alternate transportation modes, be it blue bikes, bikes themselves, or public transportation.

960
01:10:47,598 --> 01:10:56,066
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're exploring some options, but this is a good opportunity before there are some major developments potentially taking place in the area.

961
01:10:56,726 --> 01:11:03,971
[SPEAKER_14]: to kind of straighten out a situation, so be it, and head that way in the future.

962
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:13,918
[SPEAKER_14]: If you zoom in on the parking lot itself and look at the sign at the charging station, go to street level.

963
01:11:20,883 --> 01:11:25,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything to the right, it will tell you there are some signs that need to be adjusted.

964
01:11:30,373 --> 01:11:37,958
[SPEAKER_14]: So you'll notice this is parking permit for municipal employees, and then a two-hour for municipal business.

965
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:43,421
[SPEAKER_14]: That will be removed, the secondary statement that exists there.

966
01:11:43,461 --> 01:11:49,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there are three signs along there that need to be changed.

967
01:11:51,747 --> 01:11:55,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know where the veterans parking spot, what are the other spots that will not be impacted, Jim?

968
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:56,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it just the veterans?

969
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,932
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you head back towards the other way,

970
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:07,494
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's the east side of City Hall, which is where you're going, yep.

971
01:12:08,414 --> 01:12:11,256
[SPEAKER_14]: So you'll see that there are four HP spots there.

972
01:12:11,276 --> 01:12:12,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it, makes sense.

973
01:12:13,117 --> 01:12:26,825
[SPEAKER_14]: And then if you go over to, it's not listed in this particular version because this is from 2018, but the silver, the gold Honda, that's where the veteran space is located.

974
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:33,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, correct.

975
01:12:33,502 --> 01:12:34,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

976
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:40,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything else will be municipal employee parking and we're going to open up out front to visitor parking.

977
01:12:40,464 --> 01:12:41,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

978
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:44,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is already signed out front accordingly.

979
01:12:45,746 --> 01:12:51,768
[SPEAKER_14]: There are two HP spots there as well as a veteran and the remaining 16 are for people doing municipal business.

980
01:12:56,793 --> 01:13:04,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Majority of folks that do come to City Hall are generally there to pay a bill or drop into the city clerks, etc.

981
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:10,801
[SPEAKER_14]: So their business is generally less than 30 minutes from observation.

982
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:19,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the other aspects are that there are some other additional parking spaces if people are coming in, specifically a vendor, etc.

983
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:22,268
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some places for them to pay to park.

984
01:13:23,976 --> 01:13:28,002
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is an opportunity again with the development potential in the location.

985
01:13:28,022 --> 01:13:31,447
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just trying to tighten it up a bit.

986
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:34,652
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, put a little enforcement teeth.

987
01:13:35,302 --> 01:13:55,332
[SPEAKER_14]: If people are abusing the system by not paying a commuter pass but actually parking there all day and jumping on the bus or heading over to atrius for an appointment or going to the dentist office at zero city hall mall without having to pay in the parking lot, pay for parking.

988
01:13:55,933 --> 01:14:01,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So this gives us a little bit more of an opportunity to kind of tighten it up a bit.

989
01:14:03,376 --> 01:14:04,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, comments, questions?

990
01:14:10,903 --> 01:14:13,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, my staff would be thrilled about this.

991
01:14:13,747 --> 01:14:17,754
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very frustrating for them to see people getting on the bus.

992
01:14:18,896 --> 01:14:25,881
[SPEAKER_01]: and to be walking across the street to the health center, and then they can't find parking.

993
01:14:26,402 --> 01:14:32,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to go park in the commuter lot across the way when this is supposed to be employee parking.

994
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:35,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And it feels that people are cheating the system.

995
01:14:35,709 --> 01:14:37,290
[SPEAKER_01]: We have commuter parking.

996
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:42,494
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to buy the commuter permit, and then you can hop on the bus and go all day.

997
01:14:43,495 --> 01:14:45,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have short term paid parking.

998
01:14:46,338 --> 01:14:49,302
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally on the other side of that green grass strip.

999
01:14:49,682 --> 01:14:58,253
[SPEAKER_01]: People can if they don't want to park in the free parking for the health care center, they can literally park right there and pay the meter.

1000
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:01,017
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair that they park in the city hall lot.

1001
01:15:03,449 --> 01:15:15,895
[SPEAKER_01]: when this other parking is right around, our staff cannot park in this particular lot because it's not covered by their special permits and we have to do special arrangements.

1002
01:15:15,935 --> 01:15:19,937
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to jump through hoops for people to be able to park over there in the commuter lot.

1003
01:15:21,318 --> 01:15:29,863
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think it's the right thing to do and it's the only way to enforce employee parking and make sure that we have parking for employees.

1004
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:34,286
[SPEAKER_01]: I have mild concern about special events at City Hall.

1005
01:15:35,026 --> 01:15:44,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And that if we're doing, we should have in mind, there occasionally will be a luncheon with 60, 100 people during business hours.

1006
01:15:45,214 --> 01:15:46,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't make it easy for us.

1007
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:51,139
[SPEAKER_01]: But people shouldn't, but we should have some answer for that.

1008
01:15:52,837 --> 01:15:58,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're looking at waiving for special events, voting, for instance, that type of thing that would require.

1009
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:11,462
[SPEAKER_14]: We have in the past just recently directed people to a voting location out in front of the building during the early voting period, but there is an opportunity to review what the event size will be, et cetera.

1010
01:16:11,882 --> 01:16:17,143
[SPEAKER_14]: At least we're prepared, but it would be something that is not a common day-to-day process.

1011
01:16:31,237 --> 01:16:38,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just see if there's anyone in the public who has questions and comments on this petition.

1012
01:16:41,339 --> 01:16:47,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, quick question.

1013
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:50,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, first a comment.

1014
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:57,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should consider additional signage in that lot and outlining clearly where Republican Park and Pater Park is and where

1015
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: employee parking is, sometimes these little signs just don't go enough.

1016
01:17:04,197 --> 01:17:09,878
[SPEAKER_04]: The second question I have is, what about the charging stations?

1017
01:17:10,118 --> 01:17:12,499
[SPEAKER_04]: We have EV charging stations.

1018
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:16,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those going to be municipal employee parking spots?

1019
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we said that this would be during business hall hours only?

1020
01:17:21,302 --> 01:17:22,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Business hours only.

1021
01:17:22,907 --> 01:17:29,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we do find that there are hotel people, people who use the hotel who use those charging stations overnight.

1022
01:17:30,505 --> 01:17:31,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that.

1023
01:17:32,303 --> 01:17:34,363
[SPEAKER_04]: There's someone in those spots all day long.

1024
01:17:34,403 --> 01:17:36,764
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be municipal vehicles.

1025
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:38,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible, I just thought.

1026
01:17:38,504 --> 01:17:41,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have been in municipal vehicles.

1027
01:17:41,945 --> 01:17:45,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I, on occasion, have spoken to people using those charging stations.

1028
01:17:46,525 --> 01:17:49,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they've been people who work at the health center across the street.

1029
01:17:49,806 --> 01:17:59,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also talked to somebody who charges her car there every few weeks when she's visiting a relative who lives about two blocks from City Hall.

1030
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:06,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see the need to restrict them to employees only during business hours.

1031
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:11,723
[SPEAKER_01]: That is possible through a technical setup, but I don't know that we really want to go there.

1032
01:18:19,188 --> 01:18:20,790
[SPEAKER_01]: What do other people think?

1033
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:22,591
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do know that employees use them.

1034
01:18:23,272 --> 01:18:34,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that they're not always available when employees use them, but it's good to provide, I mean, part of our goal is providing this service of charging stations.

1035
01:18:35,363 --> 01:18:36,724
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have the ability

1036
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:43,969
[SPEAKER_01]: right now to add a charging station to the other lot here because of the electrical services location.

1037
01:18:44,009 --> 01:18:50,012
[SPEAKER_01]: We literally can't put another charging station right next to that one because of the electrical service to the lot at this time.

1038
01:18:50,973 --> 01:19:02,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention that these parcels are out to RFP for redevelopment, so I wouldn't put any charging stations in there when we don't know the long-term future of these lots.

1039
01:19:05,772 --> 01:19:15,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked a quick question, Alicia, as far as, for instance, Yale Street Law, how do you handle the charging on those on municipal law currently?

1040
01:19:15,241 --> 01:19:17,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you limit the time or are they open?

1041
01:19:17,744 --> 01:19:20,607
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll use that as an example.

1042
01:19:20,747 --> 01:19:23,770
[SPEAKER_14]: So on Yale Street Law, there are two charging stations.

1043
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:29,333
[SPEAKER_01]: We passed and we passed something in this committee and I don't remember what it is that we passed.

1044
01:19:29,613 --> 01:19:33,055
[SPEAKER_14]: So we need to reference that particular item to see if we.

1045
01:19:33,876 --> 01:19:34,857
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you handle that?

1046
01:19:35,057 --> 01:19:36,678
[SPEAKER_14]: How we handled it at that point?

1047
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:42,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the charging is a lot longer than the 3 hour limitation with a 2 hour limitation depending.

1048
01:19:43,443 --> 01:19:45,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we did say.

1049
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:50,592
[SPEAKER_01]: that you were allowed to park there as long as you were actively charging.

1050
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:56,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we gave some buffer because we didn't feel that people should have to come out in the middle of the night and move their car.

1051
01:20:01,258 --> 01:20:08,963
[SPEAKER_01]: But we may want to visit what we had there to make it more rational, like during business hours,

1052
01:20:10,313 --> 01:20:20,816
[SPEAKER_01]: three hours or while charging their business hours, because all of this is also used by the Chevalier at night, which is fine when City Hall is closed.

1053
01:20:25,217 --> 01:20:33,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that is how the regulations want to occur, extremely office hours or business hours, and so obviously a late night on Wednesday, early on Friday.

1054
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:57,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the commissioners are willing, they could allow the motion and just grant permission to deal with the EV charging stations as we have with the Eel Street lot in the past.

1055
01:20:57,729 --> 01:21:04,632
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to come back here with a petition.

1056
01:21:05,252 --> 01:21:06,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to

1057
01:21:08,174 --> 01:21:10,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to hear what the other commissioners have to say.

1058
01:21:10,455 --> 01:21:11,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot to say.

1059
01:21:12,036 --> 01:21:12,577
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1060
01:21:12,597 --> 01:21:15,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have.

1061
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:16,919
[SPEAKER_13]: You made a lot of good points.

1062
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm okay with this change.

1063
01:21:21,842 --> 01:21:23,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with Tim.

1064
01:21:23,964 --> 01:21:24,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1065
01:21:24,244 --> 01:21:24,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Charging.

1066
01:21:26,285 --> 01:21:26,925
[SPEAKER_13]: That's good.

1067
01:21:27,046 --> 01:21:33,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And Chief's idea of dealing with the charging separately, I think makes sense too, because we're not really changing that condition.

1068
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:37,392
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just saying, if you want to do City Hall business, go to the front.

1069
01:21:40,078 --> 01:21:40,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1070
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:40,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1071
01:21:40,799 --> 01:21:41,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1072
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:41,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1073
01:21:41,619 --> 01:21:41,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1074
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:42,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1075
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:42,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1076
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1077
01:21:43,401 --> 01:21:43,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1078
01:21:43,741 --> 01:21:44,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1079
01:21:44,221 --> 01:21:44,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1080
01:21:44,842 --> 01:21:45,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1081
01:21:45,562 --> 01:21:46,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1083

[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1084
01:21:47,344 --> 01:21:47,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1085
01:21:47,804 --> 01:21:48,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1086
01:21:48,524 --> 01:21:49,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1087
01:21:49,705 --> 01:21:50,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1088
01:21:50,186 --> 01:21:50,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1093
01:21:52,748 --> 01:21:53,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1094
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:53,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1095
01:21:53,548 --> 01:21:53,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1096
01:21:53,989 --> 01:21:54,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1097
01:21:54,589 --> 01:21:55,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1098
01:21:55,069 --> 01:21:55,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1099
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:57,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1100
01:21:57,691 --> 01:21:57,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1101
01:21:57,972 --> 01:21:58,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1102
01:21:58,992 --> 01:21:59,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1103
01:21:59,473 --> 01:22:00,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1104
01:22:00,233 --> 01:22:00,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1105
01:22:00,694 --> 01:22:01,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1106
01:22:01,294 --> 01:22:01,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1107
01:22:01,654 --> 01:22:01,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1108
01:22:01,955 --> 01:22:02,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1109
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:02,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1110
01:22:03,456 --> 01:22:03,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1111
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:04,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1112
01:22:04,196 --> 01:22:05,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1113
01:22:05,237 --> 01:22:05,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know

1114
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:12,433
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great if somebody who's not me could dig up what it was that we passed previously.

1115
01:22:12,453 --> 01:22:25,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to make sure we share that with Director McDermott, that we should review that and think about whether it's, now that we have experienced, the other person actually, Jim, you raised your hand if you're gonna share it.

1116
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:29,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you also share it with Brenda Pike in my office?

1117
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:34,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we had her on staff when we originally passed this.

1118
01:22:35,929 --> 01:23:00,016
[SPEAKER_01]: She's our climate planner, and so I would love to have, now that we've experienced with the station, how it's actually being used, Brenda is able to pull any data if we want to know how often is it used during business hours, overnight, is it being, you know, when are charging sessions starting, what time of day, she can get all of that data for us, because my goal is to balance, like,

1119
01:23:01,336 --> 01:23:03,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make it impossible for people to use it.

1120
01:23:03,498 --> 01:23:10,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get people using it, but let's not tie up spots that should be used.

1121
01:23:10,424 --> 01:23:13,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you city staff are definitely using it.

1122
01:23:13,887 --> 01:23:22,134
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few staff that have electric vehicles that when all the other spots are full, they'll decide to charge because they can get a spot there.

1123
01:23:22,154 --> 01:23:28,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'd love to review that and we can review that as a different item.

1124
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:35,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, do I have a motion on dealing with this petition?

1125
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:37,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve.

1126
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:38,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1127
01:23:39,113 --> 01:23:42,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Hunt, seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski to approve 2025-09.

1128
01:23:43,056 --> 01:23:46,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have a roll call vote, please.

1129
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1130
01:23:48,381 --> 01:23:48,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1131
01:23:49,842 --> 01:23:50,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

1132
01:23:52,745 --> 01:23:52,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1133
01:23:53,866 --> 01:23:55,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1134
01:23:55,703 --> 01:23:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1135
01:23:56,884 --> 01:23:57,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley?

1136
01:23:57,745 --> 01:23:59,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I vote 4-0.

1137
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:00,929
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion is approved.

1138
01:24:00,949 --> 01:24:09,079
[SPEAKER_04]: 2025-10 Sprague House Honeywell Avenue resident parking only sign removal from the public street.

1139
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Silva, the floor is yours.

1140
01:24:12,658 --> 01:24:18,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Honeywell Avenue residents brought this to our attention in the mayor's office.

1141
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:29,104
[SPEAKER_14]: There are signs along the Sprague House that say that limit parking on a public street to Sprague House residents only.

1142
01:24:30,044 --> 01:24:36,626
[SPEAKER_14]: But it requires them, the eight residents first come first serve, to participate in the resident parking program.

1143
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:42,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Sprague House folks can park anywhere on Honeywell, according to the sign.

1144
01:24:43,266 --> 01:24:47,330
[SPEAKER_14]: but the folks on Honeywell, even though they're resident parking, can't park in those spots.

1145
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:59,100
[SPEAKER_14]: We had an opportunity, Alicia reached out to her department and actually we went through the materials in 1984 when the proposal for the development happened.

1146
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:05,205
[SPEAKER_14]: In 1986, the resident parking limitations were included.

1147
01:25:05,845 --> 01:25:08,548
[SPEAKER_14]: in the variance list that we currently use.

1148
01:25:09,649 --> 01:25:13,713
[SPEAKER_14]: There is nothing in there that says specifically they own it.

1149
01:25:14,614 --> 01:25:16,196
[SPEAKER_14]: This is public property.

1150
01:25:18,558 --> 01:25:27,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Interestingly enough, those signs have been up since Honeywell Ave became a resident parking entity.

1151
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:39,679
[SPEAKER_04]: My water on this and just the parking, the traffic commission did approve this special permit in January of 86 stickers only no visitor passes.

1152
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,241
[SPEAKER_04]: How many did you say?

1153
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:45,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Just just for me for my was it 8 1st come 1st serve?

1154
01:25:45,745 --> 01:25:46,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1155
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:51,189
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there's an, it isn't by household, it is by who comes 1st.

1156
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:55,491
[SPEAKER_14]: et cetera, and that's how it's sort of doled out.

1157
01:25:55,591 --> 01:25:58,391
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this development is key.

1158
01:25:58,851 --> 01:26:02,032
[SPEAKER_14]: The size, for instance, is large.

1159
01:26:02,172 --> 01:26:04,233
[SPEAKER_14]: There's parking provided on site.

1160
01:26:05,113 --> 01:26:15,495
[SPEAKER_14]: This was, I believe, something that when Honeywell Lab went on board with resident parking, it was a way of helping the development sort of thrive at that point.

1161
01:26:16,275 --> 01:26:34,268
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is a key example of the future and how we work with larger developments in residential areas, even though they are residential development, whether or not they can effectively participate in a resident parking program and how it looks like in the future.

1162
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:37,250
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's for another time.

1163
01:26:37,631 --> 01:26:43,895
[SPEAKER_14]: These signs need to come down potentially and resident parking put up so that everybody can park there.

1164
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Folks on Honeywell can park there.

1165
01:26:46,612 --> 01:26:51,796
[SPEAKER_14]: The eight people in Sprague can park anywhere at Honeywell as they come.

1166
01:26:51,816 --> 01:26:55,560
[SPEAKER_04]: There still will be eight variances granted to residents of that Sprague house.

1167
01:26:57,101 --> 01:27:07,209
[SPEAKER_04]: No additional passes and the street is their parking, whatever's available as opposed to limited restrictions along with the rest of the names.

1168
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,931
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

1169
01:27:11,813 --> 01:27:12,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners.

1170
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:25,842
[SPEAKER_13]: agree entirely that shouldn't be uh dedicated for the are you saying sprog sprog buildings how do you say that sprague right yeah

1171
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:31,211
[SPEAKER_14]: You were unable to find anything in the detail of the development.

1172
01:27:32,271 --> 01:27:37,152
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, it was 40 years ago, so I'm not quite sure how things were handled then.

1173
01:27:37,332 --> 01:27:45,113
[SPEAKER_14]: But as the chief alluded to, in 1986, they came up and asked for the variance, and they were granted.

1174
01:27:45,374 --> 01:27:51,575
[SPEAKER_14]: And subsequently, people have participated over that time period, and so they haven't lost an interest.

1175
01:27:53,798 --> 01:27:58,380
[SPEAKER_14]: The neighbors would like to be able to park there if they need to.

1176
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,141
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that is the variable here.

1177
01:28:01,781 --> 01:28:03,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's a public parking lane.

1178
01:28:05,442 --> 01:28:10,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim, Alvin, I had a conversation earlier tonight and to the best of her recollection.

1179
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:16,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is 30 something, 30 to 40 years ago.

1180
01:28:18,102 --> 01:28:21,143
[SPEAKER_04]: But Alva, there's a business around the front of this on Riverside Ave.

1181
01:28:21,223 --> 01:28:29,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And she believes that that business occupied more of that parking lot than it does today.

1182
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:35,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was probably one of the reasons they made an exception to allow some additional parking out limiting.

1183
01:28:36,309 --> 01:28:38,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that helps by way of history.

1184
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:41,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the business is still there, but I don't think it is doing the same.

1185
01:28:43,388 --> 01:28:45,949
[SPEAKER_04]: the volume as it was back then, they were serving food, et cetera.

1186
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:48,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sort of back at that date.

1187
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:51,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So may not be accurate, but it's the best of our recollection.

1188
01:28:51,892 --> 01:29:00,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And said, Alba, she doesn't forget a thing, but if that helps.

1189
01:29:01,016 --> 01:29:03,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So commissioners comments or questions.

1190
01:29:06,198 --> 01:29:10,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we had any conversation with the management company or anything there?

1191
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do they know we're even talking about this?

1192
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:18,361
[SPEAKER_14]: It really won't impact them, per se, because there's still eight folks.

1193
01:29:18,761 --> 01:29:20,241
[SPEAKER_14]: That number isn't going to change.

1194
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:21,862
[SPEAKER_14]: They currently can park anywhere.

1195
01:29:21,882 --> 01:29:24,602
[SPEAKER_14]: So who does it impact?

1196
01:29:24,822 --> 01:29:26,603
[SPEAKER_14]: It only impacts the other folks who can't.

1197
01:29:27,643 --> 01:29:27,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1198
01:29:28,123 --> 01:29:36,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Are all the residents going to be allowed to get parking permits on Honeywell Ave, or we're just saying there won't be dedicated spots, people can still get permits?

1199
01:29:37,525 --> 01:29:40,386
[SPEAKER_14]: So the variance will maintain.

1200
01:29:40,726 --> 01:29:41,906
[SPEAKER_14]: The signs will come down.

1201
01:29:41,986 --> 01:29:44,207
[SPEAKER_14]: And the variance said that these folks, these eight

1202
01:29:44,947 --> 01:29:50,490
[SPEAKER_14]: folks in the Sprague House can participate on resident parking on Honeywell.

1203
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:52,631
[SPEAKER_14]: So none of that has changed.

1204
01:29:52,831 --> 01:30:04,597
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing that will change with the signs coming down and resident parking only there, anyone else who lives on Honeywell Ave is able to do that due to our street by street.

1205
01:30:07,018 --> 01:30:08,459
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't really impact them.

1206
01:30:09,099 --> 01:30:09,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1207
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:14,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than there's less likely that one of those spots will be available.

1208
01:30:15,512 --> 01:30:19,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim, do we know, I'm sorry, do we know how many permits are requested each year?

1209
01:30:19,658 --> 01:30:20,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they requesting the eight?

1210
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they getting them every year?

1211
01:30:24,765 --> 01:30:28,891
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think, I think they did the renewal this year, so yes.

1212
01:30:28,911 --> 01:30:29,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1213
01:30:35,616 --> 01:30:36,557
[SPEAKER_14]: And they are active.

1214
01:30:36,877 --> 01:30:40,839
[SPEAKER_14]: As you know, we've sort of reverted back to the 4 or 5 years.

1215
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:46,563
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't participate all the time in your variance, we sort of rescind that and have you come back to traffic commission.

1216
01:30:47,123 --> 01:30:49,684
[SPEAKER_14]: So it looks like they have participated over the years.

1217
01:30:51,786 --> 01:30:54,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 1 thing we should do is clarify that it is for 8.

1218
01:31:01,202 --> 01:31:09,093
[SPEAKER_04]: eight residents to receive variances and only because the original traffic commission petition says

1219
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:15,444
[SPEAKER_04]: What they did was grant that area that's approximately eight spaces.

1220
01:31:15,545 --> 01:31:21,610
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're saying by traffic commission, the rule is you have this amount of sidewalk space to park cars.

1221
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now going to take it away.

1222
01:31:23,652 --> 01:31:29,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to be specific about how many variances we're granting as opposed to an approximate area where they can park.

1223
01:31:30,938 --> 01:31:33,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I just stole that suggestion.

1224
01:31:37,605 --> 01:31:42,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone in the public wish to comment or ask a question on this petition?

1225
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:47,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, back to the commissioners.

1226
01:31:48,092 --> 01:31:50,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Thoughts, comments, and or motions?

1227
01:31:56,978 --> 01:31:57,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fine.

1228
01:31:57,759 --> 01:32:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I will reiterate because it's a point I continue to make when these things happen, I wish we do a better job of notifying the affected people.

1229
01:32:06,917 --> 01:32:08,618
[SPEAKER_02]: But even with that said, I'd vote for this.

1230
01:32:09,979 --> 01:32:13,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that some of them are going to be like, what happened to our signs?

1231
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:14,121
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?

1232
01:32:14,181 --> 01:32:17,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody should be prepared with an answer and a response.

1233
01:32:19,184 --> 01:32:20,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And how this impacts them.

1234
01:32:22,146 --> 01:32:22,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm understood.

1235
01:32:22,646 --> 01:32:28,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Depending on how this goes, we're probably just going to have to do some outreach right away with them.

1236
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:32,032
[SPEAKER_04]: There's signs that are not going to be long before they come down if it passes.

1237
01:32:33,392 --> 01:32:40,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's inappropriate that we're using spots on a public way signed for a particular apartment building.

1238
01:32:41,074 --> 01:32:50,435
[SPEAKER_01]: If there had been something in the earlier agreements with the construction of it and there was some situation, then at least we would understand that and we could decide whether to amend it.

1239
01:32:51,296 --> 01:32:57,237
[SPEAKER_01]: But as Jim said, I went back to the site plan reviews and stuff and there was stuff about that.

1240
01:32:58,577 --> 01:33:11,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as a fun fact, the little store that's in the side of that building, it was a standalone store there at that location that was a well-loved corner store type business, and people were very concerned about it leaving.

1241
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:16,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the agreement to build the apartment building was that they would put a space for the store there.

1242
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:25,382
[SPEAKER_01]: They built the building and the store moved in, and then the store was on the side of the parking lot and they tore down the store.

1243
01:33:25,922 --> 01:33:27,543
[SPEAKER_01]: to make room for the parking lot.

1244
01:33:27,923 --> 01:33:30,845
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there is a little store set into that building there.

1245
01:33:31,286 --> 01:33:35,148
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was nothing about street parking in any of that documentation.

1246
01:33:35,428 --> 01:33:35,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1247
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:37,810
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it matches.

1248
01:33:39,571 --> 01:33:48,196
[SPEAKER_04]: To Director McDermott, for the eight residents who have parking passes now, do you collect contact information, an email address, phone number?

1249
01:33:48,216 --> 01:33:52,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if we specifically wanted to reach out to those eight individuals, do we have that available?

1250
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:54,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Are that option available in the

1251
01:33:56,945 --> 01:33:58,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we can't hear you, Sarah, sorry.

1252
01:34:03,508 --> 01:34:04,128
[SPEAKER_12]: She's unmuted.

1253
01:34:04,508 --> 01:34:05,329
[SPEAKER_12]: She has to go home soon.

1254
01:34:05,749 --> 01:34:07,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Sarah, you're unmuted, but we can't hear you.

1255
01:34:09,751 --> 01:34:10,591
[SPEAKER_01]: You're unmuted.

1256
01:34:10,951 --> 01:34:13,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, your sound was making weird noises.

1257
01:34:13,952 --> 01:34:15,013
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very screechy.

1258
01:34:15,953 --> 01:34:17,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's making no noise.

1259
01:34:18,074 --> 01:34:19,495
[SPEAKER_04]: We could follow up with that later on.

1260
01:34:19,515 --> 01:34:24,177
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a question as to whether that might help us with the outreach part to this.

1261
01:34:24,197 --> 01:34:25,958
[SPEAKER_05]: When that first was passed,

1262
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:41,223
[SPEAKER_05]: The Condo Association gave out the permits to the first eight, and that continued for a couple of years, and then it reverted to the parking authority, not us, the Hyatt one.

1263
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:50,785
[SPEAKER_05]: But they originally gave out, and if you got it one year, you couldn't be one of the eight to get it the next year.

1264
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:53,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how that is going.

1265
01:34:53,642 --> 01:34:54,743
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have a history in our records.

1266
01:35:18,772 --> 01:35:20,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Director McDermott.

1267
01:35:20,095 --> 01:35:20,677
[SPEAKER_04]: We see your chat.

1268
01:35:21,158 --> 01:35:22,781
[SPEAKER_04]: A motion on this petition.

1269
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:32,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make the motion, again, I'll just reiterate, doing some outreach to the people affected by this in a proactive manner.

1270
01:35:33,476 --> 01:35:34,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Understood.

1271
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:47,779
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Commissioner Baszynski to approve 2025-10, and that comes with the declaration that we should do outreach on those impacted, which will happen.

1272
01:35:47,799 --> 01:35:48,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

1273
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:50,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1274
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Commissioner McGibbon.

1275
01:35:53,301 --> 01:35:54,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Alva, could you give us a roll call, please?

1276
01:35:55,523 --> 01:35:56,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

1277
01:35:57,064 --> 01:35:57,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1278
01:35:58,064 --> 01:35:58,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

1279
01:35:59,545 --> 01:35:59,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1280
01:36:00,486 --> 01:36:01,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1281
01:36:01,666 --> 01:36:02,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1282
01:36:03,467 --> 01:36:04,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley?

1283
01:36:04,327 --> 01:36:04,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1284
01:36:04,628 --> 01:36:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: On the vote of four to nothing, 2025-10 has been approved.

1285
01:36:09,971 --> 01:36:12,812
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it for new business.

1286
01:36:13,652 --> 01:36:22,955
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have two items that have been tabled for this evening, and I think it's still early enough if the commission would like to deal with them.

1287
01:36:22,995 --> 01:36:34,359
[SPEAKER_04]: They would be 2024-55, that's the Washington Street parking lot that was originally petitioned by Commissioner McGibbon, and then 2024-70, that's the Dexter Street Sunday Adventist Church.

1288
01:36:39,421 --> 01:36:43,144
[SPEAKER_04]: which was tabled and then we did a little bit of research on that.

1289
01:36:43,605 --> 01:36:55,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the commissioners have the time and ability and willingness, I'd accept a motion to take 2024-55, 2024-70 out of tabled items for discussion.

1290
01:36:56,356 --> 01:36:56,917
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

1291
01:36:58,598 --> 01:37:00,841
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of commission we're given, second?

1292
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:02,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

1293
01:37:04,122 --> 01:37:05,303
[SPEAKER_04]: seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

1294
01:37:05,323 --> 01:37:08,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a quick roll call for this motion.

1295
01:37:08,826 --> 01:37:09,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1296
01:37:10,447 --> 01:37:10,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1297
01:37:11,207 --> 01:37:11,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

1298
01:37:12,628 --> 01:37:12,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1299
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:14,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1300
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:15,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1301
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley?

1302
01:37:17,272 --> 01:37:18,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1303
01:37:18,112 --> 01:37:18,893
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion for nothing.

1304
01:37:18,913 --> 01:37:21,415
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion is approved.

1305
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:22,856
[SPEAKER_04]: 2024-55 Washington Street parking lot.

1306
01:37:23,236 --> 01:37:27,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally petitioned by Commissioner McGibbon,

1307
01:37:29,897 --> 01:37:31,298
[SPEAKER_04]: it's required that we bring it up.

1308
01:37:31,618 --> 01:37:32,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner McGibbon, I'll start with you.

1309
01:37:32,918 --> 01:37:37,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any updates on the original petition and where we stand today?

1310
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:38,860
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not really.

1311
01:37:40,061 --> 01:37:45,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that there's a development or a request on the table for it.

1312
01:37:46,383 --> 01:37:47,483
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe that's what tonight's about.

1313
01:37:47,603 --> 01:37:50,144
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, I don't think there's been any progress unless Alicia has any.

1314
01:37:50,164 --> 01:37:54,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know anything.

1315
01:37:57,407 --> 01:37:57,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1316
01:37:58,322 --> 01:38:00,484
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, do you want to?

1317
01:38:00,524 --> 01:38:13,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I'm just pulling up the Sergeant Rogers and myself went over to the church and no, this is Washington Street, Washington, Washington.

1318
01:38:13,617 --> 01:38:16,579
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've gone by several times.

1319
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:17,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Just residents.

1320
01:38:19,369 --> 01:38:20,550
[SPEAKER_15]: a parking in there.

1321
01:38:21,711 --> 01:38:26,194
[SPEAKER_15]: No one registered or dump cars or anything else.

1322
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:28,716
[SPEAKER_15]: It's residents within the area.

1323
01:38:28,856 --> 01:38:39,403
[SPEAKER_12]: We were able to talk to the vehicle that was doing mechanical stuff, Sam, so we got him, you know, kind of put that in his driveway.

1324
01:38:39,423 --> 01:38:44,407
[SPEAKER_12]: So other than that, we just, nothing that we, out of the ordinary, nothing like, or Mel.

1325
01:38:45,567 --> 01:38:45,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

1326
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:46,948
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good to know.

1327
01:38:48,495 --> 01:38:49,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think that's what it was.

1328
01:38:49,896 --> 01:39:01,946
[SPEAKER_13]: If you look back on the development documents, the parcel was given to the city, and then it says in the site plan approval documents that it should be used by the residents in the neighborhood or something like that.

1329
01:39:03,027 --> 01:39:15,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, but it's a public lot, so again, strange thing, but we were gonna, I was gonna work with someone in planning, I think it was Amanda, just to see what made sense for that lot, if we're gonna do anything with it.

1330
01:39:16,538 --> 01:39:22,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I missed that you had switched from the Seventh Day Adventist Church, which I thought you were talking about, to the Washington Street lot.

1331
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:41,220
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's occurred is that a resident, not a resident, somebody who has redeveloped, so the house next door is for sale, and one of the potential buyers has inquired with the city if they could buy that lot, and then do a larger housing project there, like build more units.

1332
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,822
[SPEAKER_01]: then would be allowed on the one lot.

1333
01:39:48,685 --> 01:39:53,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be allowed under the current zoning what they want to do, so they would need other kinds of relief as well.

1334
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:59,073
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was an intriguing idea that rather than making it a parking lot, it become housing.

1335
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:06,931
[SPEAKER_04]: That can be dealt with as it comes up, I guess.

1336
01:40:06,991 --> 01:40:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner McGibbon, the original petition, I'm just trying to wrack my brains, was just to make sure that this is used by residents.

1337
01:40:12,251 --> 01:40:16,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think my traffic division is showing at least that that's what's happening over there.

1338
01:40:18,073 --> 01:40:19,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there further concerns?

1339
01:40:19,133 --> 01:40:20,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we need to keep something?

1340
01:40:20,433 --> 01:40:22,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, again, it's on for discussion.

1341
01:40:23,193 --> 01:40:31,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything further you would like or should we deal with this petition for discussion as resolved or would you like to keep it tabled?

1342
01:40:31,736 --> 01:40:33,618
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't, I don't think it needs to stay on here.

1343
01:40:33,638 --> 01:40:36,562
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we found out the information we wanted from my initial inquiry.

1344
01:40:37,943 --> 01:40:45,092
[SPEAKER_13]: And now, basically, if something needs to happen by this commission and actually needs to be taken on the lot, we'll deal with it later.

1345
01:40:45,512 --> 01:40:49,056
[SPEAKER_13]: We just don't know if or what we're going to do with it or what the fate of the lot is.

1346
01:40:49,276 --> 01:40:49,376
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

1347
01:40:51,557 --> 01:41:01,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay so as 2024-55 is and has been placed for discussion and we have discussed it and we've come to some of these resolutions from the police side that is in fact being used.

1348
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:08,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless a commissioner objects we will mark 2024-55 as resolved as discussed.

1349
01:41:09,102 --> 01:41:09,662
[SPEAKER_04]: No objection.

1350
01:41:09,682 --> 01:41:15,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll move to 2024-70 which is the Seventh-day Adventist Church, 62 Dexter Street.

1351
01:41:15,663 --> 01:41:17,104
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had in church parking.

1352
01:41:19,221 --> 01:41:19,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Sgt.

1353
01:41:19,501 --> 01:41:23,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Kalawach, you were going to speak on this too.

1354
01:41:23,904 --> 01:41:38,495
[SPEAKER_12]: So other than the signs we went up there, we were able to kind of see that they have three parking spots as the, I don't know if it was the pastor had explained to us, but the solution that myself, Jim Silva, Todd and Sgt.

1355
01:41:38,555 --> 01:41:42,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Larry Rogers came up with is, you know, we can add two more spots across

1356
01:41:43,858 --> 01:41:48,220
[SPEAKER_12]: 7th day Advent Church, which would include 5 parking spots for them.

1357
01:41:49,180 --> 01:42:02,025
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I know he was asking for 10, but we feel that with it being so close to Main Street that 5 adding 2 more would be suffice for the numbers that they are dealing with.

1358
01:42:02,285 --> 01:42:09,347
[SPEAKER_12]: And the distance from Main Street to this Dexter Street location is a very short walk if need be.

1359
01:42:11,328 --> 01:42:14,952
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing that we kind of came up with is the signage is different.

1360
01:42:17,234 --> 01:42:21,459
[SPEAKER_12]: That's in front of there is is Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

1361
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:31,769
[SPEAKER_12]: But we looked at the website and the 7th day church only has Wednesday, Sunday, Saturday, but the signs we have posted up there just needs to be changed.

1362
01:42:34,086 --> 01:42:36,709
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess we can kind of look into that.

1363
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:46,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Tim, I can send you an email with with what they have on their website and just kind of the 2 signs that are out there just have an added day on there for times.

1364
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:46,800
[SPEAKER_12]: But.

1365
01:42:48,783 --> 01:42:50,965
[SPEAKER_04]: If I recall the petitioner actually said that the.

1366
01:42:53,867 --> 01:43:00,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I think we just have the Friday is the only day that we need that.

1367
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:04,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why Friday was on there, but they must they must have had Friday for something.

1368
01:43:04,592 --> 01:43:07,074
[SPEAKER_12]: They have Friday on the signs Friday 730 to 9 PM.

1369
01:43:08,534 --> 01:43:10,115
[SPEAKER_12]: We spoke to them and they don't have any.

1370
01:43:11,456 --> 01:43:12,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Reason for that.

1371
01:43:14,217 --> 01:43:15,558
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that was the only difference.

1372
01:43:16,783 --> 01:43:25,466
[SPEAKER_12]: We allow the 2 added spots going in front of the cross right right diagonal across I have the number here alone.

1373
01:43:25,967 --> 01:43:29,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the question is, where would the 2 added spots be?

1374
01:43:29,668 --> 01:43:31,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just pull them up now.

1375
01:43:32,869 --> 01:43:33,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you pull them up?

1376
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:35,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll pull them on screen share and show you guys.

1377
01:43:35,931 --> 01:43:36,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1378
01:43:37,111 --> 01:43:42,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And while he's pulling it up to the commissioners have any questions concerns if you remember this 1 was, you know.

1379
01:43:43,433 --> 01:43:48,516
[SPEAKER_04]: We had, there was already dedicated spots there that we're looking for additional, but it was very difficult for us to find.

1380
01:43:48,536 --> 01:43:57,020
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we've come up with a working solution that involved a petitioner and the traffic engineer, et cetera.

1381
01:43:57,060 --> 01:44:03,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have questions while he's pulling this up, we could just show you where the two additional spots are.

1382
01:44:06,425 --> 01:44:08,326
[SPEAKER_12]: So would we add similar signs?

1383
01:44:09,407 --> 01:44:10,647
[SPEAKER_12]: The sign is right here.

1384
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:11,508
[SPEAKER_12]: It would just be,

1385
01:44:12,947 --> 01:44:17,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know if it's either change it or black out the Friday.

1386
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:19,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure what what's easier for you, Tim.

1387
01:44:19,571 --> 01:44:23,774
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, even a blacked out Friday, the sign is good.

1388
01:44:23,794 --> 01:44:27,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, the times are so that marks the three spots.

1389
01:44:27,576 --> 01:44:30,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Where would the two additional go side to additional would come over here.

1390
01:44:33,234 --> 01:44:38,018
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've notified these residents, we asked them if they wanted to come on the petition tonight.

1391
01:44:38,758 --> 01:44:42,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Should be in front of 61 and we also notified other neighbors that were here.

1392
01:44:42,821 --> 01:44:45,243
[SPEAKER_12]: And there were no objections.

1393
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:47,245
[SPEAKER_12]: They had objections.

1394
01:44:48,739 --> 01:44:57,068
[SPEAKER_12]: While they were there, their objections were that the amount of vehicles that are parked there during church hours floods the streets.

1395
01:44:58,689 --> 01:45:06,417
[SPEAKER_12]: But there weren't objections to us adding more parking, directed parking for them, but we notified them of the Zoom.

1396
01:45:06,437 --> 01:45:09,861
[SPEAKER_12]: We told them that they can show up here for this.

1397
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:23,995
[SPEAKER_12]: It was more the residents that we had were in this blue house because this is, I believe, like multifamily correct townhouse usage and they don't have much parking.

1398
01:45:24,055 --> 01:45:24,235
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

1399
01:45:25,015 --> 01:45:29,737
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying when the church is in session that the issues where the parking not so much.

1400
01:45:31,304 --> 01:45:34,306
[SPEAKER_12]: that they had any issues, so that's adding more parking for them over here.

1401
01:45:34,586 --> 01:45:37,969
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so let me just, well, since you mentioned it anyway, we can do this.

1402
01:45:38,089 --> 01:45:46,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anyone here in the public wishing to speak on this petition, just to make sure, because I can't see every, there's not many left, but I want to make sure that, yeah.

1403
01:45:47,075 --> 01:45:48,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, seeing none.

1404
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:54,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioners, questions or comments on what the sergeants have presented to you?

1405
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Dexter a permanent parking street?

1406
01:45:57,442 --> 01:45:57,582
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1407
01:45:59,386 --> 01:46:00,307
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an open street.

1408
01:46:00,627 --> 01:46:03,649
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only from Bow to Broadway that it's resident parking.

1409
01:46:04,329 --> 01:46:09,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Edwards, though, that runs parallel or across, is resident parking.

1410
01:46:09,152 --> 01:46:15,815
[SPEAKER_14]: So those folks on Dexter are limited, as well as the folks who are attending service.

1411
01:46:15,835 --> 01:46:19,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Because generally they're legacy streets, and that means they're 24-7.

1412
01:46:22,030 --> 01:46:25,931
[SPEAKER_14]: versus having one day of a reprieve, Sundays and holidays.

1413
01:46:26,051 --> 01:46:33,274
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know the seven-day advent, their service day is actually Saturday and not Sunday, so it's a little bit different.

1414
01:46:34,394 --> 01:46:41,417
[SPEAKER_14]: So the resident parking process generally goes out the window with Sunday and holiday at that point.

1415
01:46:43,954 --> 01:46:44,914
[SPEAKER_14]: and the street is open.

1416
01:46:45,475 --> 01:46:49,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have other churches who have public parking lane dedications?

1417
01:46:50,077 --> 01:46:51,177
[SPEAKER_13]: We try to mirror them.

1418
01:46:51,658 --> 01:46:51,858
[SPEAKER_14]: St.

1419
01:46:51,898 --> 01:46:52,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Clements on St.

1420
01:46:52,658 --> 01:46:53,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Clements Road has it.

1421
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,520
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go to St.

1422
01:46:56,540 --> 01:47:00,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Clements Road, you can see the signage, and it just says during service.

1423
01:47:00,762 --> 01:47:10,907
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't say specifically Sunday if I'm familiar with it, like specific service hours like they do.

1424
01:47:10,967 --> 01:47:11,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1425
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:32,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Question would be related to 2024-70 would be to approve the petition based on the recommendations of the traffic sergeants to add two additional parking spots across the street.

1426
01:47:33,408 --> 01:47:46,313
[SPEAKER_04]: The petitioner and the church have already been advised that the brother's member's congregation would have to park out on Main Street and on appropriate parking spots

1427
01:47:47,212 --> 01:47:56,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they've been advised when they were here that they should look into transportation or transporting their, uh, congregation to the church in other means.

1428
01:47:57,256 --> 01:48:09,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And the neighbors have been, uh, spoken to regarding this or to deny the petition outright, but place it into your hands.

1429
01:48:11,597 --> 01:48:14,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say you had advised them of what we found?

1430
01:48:15,138 --> 01:48:17,599
[SPEAKER_12]: We advised them.

1431
01:48:18,519 --> 01:48:25,541
[SPEAKER_12]: They were advised of the meeting here tonight as well.

1432
01:48:27,221 --> 01:48:31,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we tell the church what we had decided to do?

1433
01:48:33,163 --> 01:48:34,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I left the voicemail with him.

1434
01:48:34,503 --> 01:48:35,884
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't been able to get a hold of him.

1435
01:48:36,724 --> 01:48:36,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1436
01:48:40,548 --> 01:48:42,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no problem going down there.

1437
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:47,114
[SPEAKER_12]: I should be able to get into this week, so I will notify him.

1438
01:48:48,195 --> 01:48:58,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's any benefit to notifying them what we've decided to do before we vote on it, or just go ahead and approve it.

1439
01:49:00,404 --> 01:49:02,306
[SPEAKER_12]: He wanted 10, we're allowing five.

1440
01:49:02,346 --> 01:49:09,172
[SPEAKER_12]: We think that was a similar number that we've awarded with other churches in the area of Medford.

1441
01:49:13,153 --> 01:49:14,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would vote to approve it.

1442
01:49:14,493 --> 01:49:21,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just be curious as to whether we should advise petitioners of these situations before we go ahead and vote on them.

1443
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:33,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a good point, but I would just remind us that the petitioner was present and was told we would review in 30 days.

1444
01:49:35,794 --> 01:49:39,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the original date, he was told we would be taking this up again.

1445
01:49:39,236 --> 01:49:40,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is what we are doing.

1446
01:49:40,618 --> 01:49:44,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did make attempts to get him present here this evening.

1447
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:45,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't know that that meeting.

1448
01:49:45,922 --> 01:49:46,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1449
01:49:47,143 --> 01:49:47,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1450
01:49:47,463 --> 01:49:51,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Barring any further questions or comments from my colleagues, I'd submit a motion to pass it.

1451
01:49:53,551 --> 01:49:53,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1452
01:49:54,091 --> 01:50:07,721
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Commissioner Brzezinski to approve 2024-70 with two additional parking spots as recommended by the Medford Police Traffic Sergeants.

1453
01:50:09,782 --> 01:50:10,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Preferably in the number 61.

1454
01:50:11,783 --> 01:50:21,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Preferably by 61 with a change to the signage to reflect the actual church hours of Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday on all sides.

1455
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:22,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

1456
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:24,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

1457
01:50:25,441 --> 01:50:26,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

1458
01:50:29,683 --> 01:50:31,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Alba, can I get a roll call, please?

1459
01:50:32,204 --> 01:50:33,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

1460
01:50:33,625 --> 01:50:33,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1461
01:50:33,945 --> 01:50:35,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

1462
01:50:36,346 --> 01:50:36,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1463
01:50:37,227 --> 01:50:38,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1464
01:50:38,928 --> 01:50:39,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1465
01:50:40,068 --> 01:50:40,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley?

1466
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:41,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1467
01:50:41,469 --> 01:50:47,032
[SPEAKER_04]: On a vote of four to nothing, the petition is approved as recommended.

1468
01:50:47,052 --> 01:50:52,334
[SPEAKER_04]: That's two more tabled items taken off.

1469
01:50:54,308 --> 01:50:57,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't say we're burning down the table.

1470
01:50:57,909 --> 01:50:58,589
[SPEAKER_13]: We added one.

1471
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Took two off, added one.

1472
01:51:02,471 --> 01:51:06,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Took two off, but we added one.

1473
01:51:07,912 --> 01:51:08,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Still positive.

1474
01:51:09,373 --> 01:51:10,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

1475
01:51:11,693 --> 01:51:17,815
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so that concludes all new business and table business that we are prepared to deal with.

1476
01:51:19,116 --> 01:51:20,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief, can I make a point?

1477
01:51:20,896 --> 01:51:21,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

1478
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:21,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1479
01:51:22,017 --> 01:51:22,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't worry.

1480
01:51:23,366 --> 01:51:30,470
[SPEAKER_02]: 2024-37 was a 6-month review of the G-Zone, which should have been this month's meeting.

1481
01:51:31,130 --> 01:51:34,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to make just an acknowledgment?

1482
01:51:34,752 --> 01:51:37,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Presuming no one is ready to talk about that, can we push that a month?

1483
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:46,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ask Jim Silva, would you be prepared to deal, is that that next month?

1484
01:51:47,224 --> 01:51:48,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Or would you like to discuss tonight?

1485
01:51:49,266 --> 01:51:52,047
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably should have given you a little bit more advanced notice, but.

1486
01:51:52,407 --> 01:51:54,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know.

1487
01:51:55,169 --> 01:51:56,630
[SPEAKER_14]: You can start the conversation.

1488
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:58,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would be fine.

1489
01:52:00,432 --> 01:52:01,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Questions, review?

1490
01:52:03,108 --> 01:52:09,318
[SPEAKER_14]: specifically, we have had a great deal of community, a positive response.

1491
01:52:09,398 --> 01:52:11,521
[SPEAKER_14]: People are participating in it.

1492
01:52:11,561 --> 01:52:13,604
[SPEAKER_14]: We've worked out some of the variance issues.

1493
01:52:13,684 --> 01:52:16,328
[SPEAKER_14]: We still have to do that for our main streets.

1494
01:52:16,969 --> 01:52:18,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Specifically, I think we

1495
01:52:19,665 --> 01:52:27,554
[SPEAKER_14]: We've looked at some of them on Stanley and Main as well as Bow and Harvard Street.

1496
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:39,488
[SPEAKER_14]: So we still have some work that we need to do to accomplish, but at least now those folks are able to get variances where we've had two complaints in community.

1497
01:52:40,368 --> 01:52:48,650
[SPEAKER_14]: We have done an informal review going up and down streets during certain times of the day to see if they have been inundated with cars.

1498
01:52:49,410 --> 01:52:53,852
[SPEAKER_14]: I think from a traffic group here can probably attest to this.

1499
01:52:54,252 --> 01:53:05,495
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't seen a great deal of influx or one location that folks might be moving from one part of the G zone to be closer to the public transportation, for instance, even in the colder weather.

1500
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:17,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I think from a resource from enforcement, it's a much easier process where you're not looking to see what street you're on to check a car for what street.

1501
01:53:18,694 --> 01:53:21,675
[SPEAKER_14]: I think our LPR is working a little bit better this way.

1502
01:53:22,236 --> 01:53:24,897
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, we are a bit resource challenged.

1503
01:53:25,177 --> 01:53:27,278
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the response has been good.

1504
01:53:27,558 --> 01:53:32,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Specifically, I know from interaction in my community, my neighborhood,

1505
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:38,406
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's important that people are happy that on the smallest streets, they can find parking when they need to.

1506
01:53:46,647 --> 01:53:57,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to entertain questions from the commissioners related to the G zone, but I do recognize that we're probably going to have to take this up at next meeting for approval, because this is a pilot program.

1507
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:06,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume, Jim, that we want to move on from the pilot program and make this G zone a permanent parking system within the city of Medford.

1508
01:54:09,853 --> 01:54:15,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll let the commissioners comment, but I would like to put this on the agenda for next month for more discussion.

1509
01:54:15,216 --> 01:54:16,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Early on.

1510
01:54:16,256 --> 01:54:16,737
[SPEAKER_04]: For next month?

1511
01:54:17,237 --> 01:54:18,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's table of business.

1512
01:54:18,638 --> 01:54:24,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's table for tonight, but I don't know if we're prepared to address making it permanent.

1513
01:54:24,341 --> 01:54:28,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we probably should have given Jim Silver a little bit more heads up if he was prepared.

1514
01:54:28,883 --> 01:54:32,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those are great comments, but commissioners, do we have any questions or concerns?

1515
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:42,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess just from a procedural standpoint, do we need to just amend the reference to the January 2025 meeting?

1516
01:54:44,477 --> 01:54:50,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Jim want to submit a petition to approve it for approval next month or in March?

1517
01:54:51,402 --> 01:54:59,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can this be some sort of transition to actually a discussion to make it or take it out of a pilot program status?

1518
01:55:04,744 --> 01:55:14,168
[SPEAKER_14]: specifically what do you need to identify what information would you be comfortable, what data would I be able to provide you that you might request?

1519
01:55:14,288 --> 01:55:16,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what you provided tonight was enough.

1520
01:55:16,108 --> 01:55:23,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that if I can remember correctly, what we were looking for is just to try to appease people that thought this would be a disaster.

1521
01:55:23,511 --> 01:55:26,352
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's not a disaster.

1522
01:55:27,092 --> 01:55:34,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't necessarily know that it mean, maybe it kind of transitions on its own from being a pilot program to being like a full fledged program.

1523
01:55:34,721 --> 01:55:38,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I think what you've provided tonight is suffices for me.

1524
01:55:38,205 --> 01:55:41,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to see data or anything along those lines.

1525
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:44,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very fair to suggest that we could just.

1526
01:55:47,546 --> 01:55:50,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we want to allow people who are in that

1527
01:56:09,757 --> 01:56:15,622
[SPEAKER_02]: do we push the petition to take it out of a pilot program status to the next meeting?

1528
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:24,229
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would not necessarily be looking for a full-fledged presentation by Jim unless my colleagues decide otherwise.

1529
01:56:24,949 --> 01:56:29,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think if I remember correctly, I just wanted to know that this thing wasn't falling apart.

1530
01:56:32,035 --> 01:56:34,177
[SPEAKER_12]: The traffic division hasn't filled it.

1531
01:56:34,886 --> 01:56:37,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Any calls about the G zone.

1532
01:56:37,507 --> 01:56:43,608
[SPEAKER_13]: So to Steve's to Steve's point, we did say in our public meeting that it was a pilot.

1533
01:56:43,628 --> 01:56:44,868
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to revisit in 6 months.

1534
01:56:45,228 --> 01:56:48,669
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think we owe the public an agenda item.

1535
01:56:49,249 --> 01:56:52,510
[SPEAKER_13]: The next meeting, just so we can say that we did that.

1536
01:56:53,710 --> 01:56:55,291
[SPEAKER_13]: And then anybody who wants to speak.

1537
01:56:56,231 --> 01:57:00,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe there's issues that new issues that maybe we could solve now.

1538
01:57:02,473 --> 01:57:06,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what those would be, but we can get, you know, a similar report that we just heard from Jim.

1539
01:57:07,417 --> 01:57:13,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if there's anybody else that attends from the neighborhood or would like to say something, then I would like to hear that.

1540
01:57:13,562 --> 01:57:16,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much, Commissioner Hunt.

1541
01:57:16,625 --> 01:57:27,974
[SPEAKER_04]: As any major objections, I would be looking for a motion to defer the six-month G-Zone review until February 2025, the 2025th meeting, with appropriate notifications.

1542
01:57:28,634 --> 01:57:28,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

1543
01:57:30,482 --> 01:57:33,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of commission to be given.

1544
01:57:34,063 --> 01:57:35,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask a question real fast?

1545
01:57:35,704 --> 01:57:46,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do we alert people to know that this is like next month we are voting to take this out of being a pilot program?

1546
01:57:46,488 --> 01:57:50,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Are people notified of that like they would a new petition?

1547
01:57:50,969 --> 01:57:59,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I think anybody who's interested knows because they were here and then we said six months and then they should be right around now looking at our agenda.

1548
01:58:00,302 --> 01:58:03,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, to come here, that's fine.

1549
01:58:03,504 --> 01:58:04,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine enough for me.

1550
01:58:04,464 --> 01:58:10,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't know if we needed to actually have, like, a, a separate petition that says, like, conversion of pilot program to final.

1551
01:58:10,868 --> 01:58:16,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And that triggers some sort of additional notice, but if we're comfortable that it's been on there, you had a right for 6 months.

1552
01:58:16,991 --> 01:58:19,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about caveat.

1553
01:58:19,192 --> 01:58:22,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we can just leave it as is and vote on it next month.

1554
01:58:26,116 --> 01:58:34,960
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a motion of Commissioner McGiven to take 2024-37 and defer the six-month review until February 2025.

1555
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:37,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

1556
01:58:39,302 --> 01:58:40,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd second that.

1557
01:58:41,423 --> 01:58:43,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

1558
01:58:44,264 --> 01:58:45,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Alva, roll call, please.

1559
01:58:45,865 --> 01:58:46,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

1560
01:58:47,486 --> 01:58:48,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, siree.

1561
01:58:48,926 --> 01:58:49,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

1562
01:58:50,407 --> 01:58:50,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1563
01:58:51,467 --> 01:58:52,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1564
01:58:53,356 --> 01:58:53,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1565
01:58:54,077 --> 01:58:54,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Buckley?

1566
01:58:54,817 --> 01:58:57,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, on a vote of four to nothing, the motion is approved.

1567
01:58:57,499 --> 01:59:01,602
[SPEAKER_04]: We will take up 2024-37 next month.

1568
01:59:03,224 --> 01:59:10,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, Chief, one last item, and then I promise, because I want to go home, I'm still in Boston.

1569
01:59:10,389 --> 01:59:13,812
[SPEAKER_02]: 2023-47, looks like we were supposed to review that February of 2024.

1570
01:59:15,773 --> 01:59:17,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no left turn in.

1571
01:59:17,815 --> 01:59:17,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1572
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:21,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's actually a good one.

1573
01:59:21,121 --> 01:59:28,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take this, well, I'll wait for the motion, this 2023-47 to take up next month because I do want to gather the data on that.

1574
01:59:28,444 --> 01:59:34,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe we've had a single issue up there on this from the police perspective.

1575
01:59:34,427 --> 01:59:41,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably may want to have also put that out publicly as an agenda item to allow people who live in that neighborhood to come forward.

1576
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:46,232
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually just took down a speed radar sign there on Emerson Street that we've had up there.

1577
01:59:47,026 --> 01:59:53,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Prior to the no left turn and now where it is, and we've dropped.

1578
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:59,154
[SPEAKER_12]: 57% of vehicle traffic on Emerson street, so.

1579
01:59:59,174 --> 02:00:05,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome, I would assume the ways and GPS has have corrected themselves.

1580
02:00:08,043 --> 02:00:12,267
[SPEAKER_12]: I, I feel it 1 of the safest decisions we made.

1581
02:00:12,287 --> 02:00:13,848
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't had a collision in that intersection.

1582
02:00:14,649 --> 02:00:25,439
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that was some of the concerns that they had in the beginning with this, but we haven't had 1 collision there since since this has been an active other than the 1st and cracking into the numbers, but that doesn't count.

1583
02:00:26,728 --> 02:00:38,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So Commissioner Brzezinski, if you would like to make a motion to bring that to the forefront with an agenda item for the next meeting and allow any of the neighbors impacted, we can do that also.

1584
02:00:39,095 --> 02:00:45,499
[SPEAKER_02]: A motion to bring 2023-47 to be discussed and voted on at the February 2025 meeting.

1585
02:00:45,519 --> 02:00:49,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Commissioner Brzezinski, do I have a second?

1586
02:00:49,782 --> 02:00:50,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1587
02:00:50,922 --> 02:00:53,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And by Commissioner McGiven, I'll have a roll call vote, please.

1588
02:00:53,724 --> 02:00:54,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

1589
02:00:54,584 --> 02:00:54,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1590
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:56,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

1591
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:57,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1592
02:00:58,421 --> 02:00:59,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1593
02:01:00,081 --> 02:01:00,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1594
02:01:01,121 --> 02:01:01,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Gossage?

1595
02:01:02,262 --> 02:01:02,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1596
02:01:02,542 --> 02:01:06,623
[SPEAKER_04]: On the vote of four to nothing, the motion is approved 2023-47.

1597
02:01:06,963 --> 02:01:09,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring forward to the traffic commission.

1598
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:11,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And I promised one last one, 2021-59.

1599
02:01:11,504 --> 02:01:14,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like we were supposed to review that in six months in September of 22.

1600
02:01:14,945 --> 02:01:15,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's pulling up.

1601
02:01:24,966 --> 02:01:26,366
[SPEAKER_02]: the West Metro Community Center.

1602
02:01:26,647 --> 02:01:36,930
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the request he made for he just wanted to have some help to park in front of the center and I think you know we agreed to provide for one sign and then revisit it.

1603
02:01:37,010 --> 02:01:38,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we've heard from him since.

1604
02:01:40,831 --> 02:01:45,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah so you know that's actually very interesting and timely.

1605
02:01:45,632 --> 02:01:50,434
[SPEAKER_04]: We have reviewed it ourselves and we felt initially as this was going along that one side was

1606
02:01:51,323 --> 02:01:54,926
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortable, but the West Medford Community Center has requested that second sign again.

1607
02:01:55,466 --> 02:02:07,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will, if we follow suit and bring this up again for next month, I think we should reach out to the community center and just have a conversation with them about their needs for that second handicap sign.

1608
02:02:09,097 --> 02:02:13,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they had asked for two originally, we agreed to one with a review to see if they still needed the two.

1609
02:02:14,258 --> 02:02:21,000
[SPEAKER_04]: We felt it was sufficient, at least going up through those six months, but we recently received a request from them to add that second sign.

1610
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:38,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So something we could, if we want to follow suit and have the motion to make sure that we take up 2021-59 in the February meeting, we can notify, or at least in the meantime, have the conversations with West Medford Community Center and get their input into whether or not they feel it's still needed.

1611
02:02:40,457 --> 02:02:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: The only point of order, I would just, I'd much rather either bring it up for vote next month or can we correct the fact, correct the date on which we're gonna review it?

1612
02:02:51,461 --> 02:02:57,063
[SPEAKER_02]: To give you and your team some more time to take a look at it.

1613
02:02:58,144 --> 02:03:00,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're comfortable with the next month.

1614
02:03:01,065 --> 02:03:02,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I would handle this one.

1615
02:03:02,385 --> 02:03:03,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not gonna be heavy lifted.

1616
02:03:03,506 --> 02:03:07,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we follow suit and do the same thing to take up 2021-59,

1617
02:03:10,531 --> 02:03:18,677
[SPEAKER_04]: which has already called for a review in six months on the February 2025 meeting, it would be sufficient for us to be able to provide all the information we need to this commission.

1618
02:03:19,637 --> 02:03:24,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to bring 2021-59 for a vote at the February 2025 meeting.

1619
02:03:25,241 --> 02:03:29,064
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion of commission of Brzezinski to bring 2021-59 forward at the February 2025 meeting.

1620
02:03:29,084 --> 02:03:29,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

1621
02:03:29,604 --> 02:03:29,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1622
02:03:35,678 --> 02:03:39,239
[SPEAKER_04]: seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

1623
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:40,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

1624
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:41,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1625
02:03:42,741 --> 02:03:43,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

1626
02:03:44,021 --> 02:03:44,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1627
02:03:45,002 --> 02:03:46,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1628
02:03:46,182 --> 02:03:46,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1629
02:03:46,802 --> 02:03:51,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve Buckley?

1630
02:03:51,484 --> 02:03:52,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1631
02:03:52,265 --> 02:03:58,707
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of those will be placed on the agenda for formal review with notifications from the other parties.

1632
02:03:59,848 --> 02:04:02,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we're actually starting to clean up some of this business.

1633
02:04:02,208 --> 02:04:02,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels good.

1634
02:04:04,491 --> 02:04:07,741
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a positive emotion.

1635
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:10,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anything else from the commissioners?

1636
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:15,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim, I appreciate your presence as usual.

1637
02:04:15,541 --> 02:04:16,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Sergeant Talbot, thank you.

1638
02:04:17,122 --> 02:04:20,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Sarah, welcome aboard, and thank you for coming.

1639
02:04:21,184 --> 02:04:30,269
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, I mean, we make reference all the time to having additional parties who are impacted by our decisions present at these meetings, and your presence is gonna go a long way.

1640
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:41,074
[SPEAKER_04]: You already cleared up some of the stuff that we can and can't do with Barking the Bombing, so kudos to you for taking the time to do this, and thank you very, very much from the Traffic Commission, and welcome aboard.

1641
02:04:42,894 --> 02:04:49,943
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I'll take a motion to adjourn and happy 2025 to all of you.

1642
02:04:51,986 --> 02:04:52,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion?

1643
02:04:52,987 --> 02:04:53,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

1644
02:04:54,609 --> 02:04:55,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1645
02:04:56,332 --> 02:04:57,073
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1646
02:04:57,654 --> 02:04:57,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1647
02:04:58,675 --> 02:04:58,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

1648
02:04:59,957 --> 02:05:00,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion is approved.

1649
02:05:00,798 --> 02:05:03,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's so few of us, we don't have to take another roll call.

1650
02:05:03,421 --> 02:05:04,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Alderman's roll called out.

1651
02:05:04,964 --> 02:05:06,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a roll called out.

1652
02:05:06,626 --> 02:05:06,906
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1653
02:05:06,926 --> 02:05:07,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1654
02:05:07,747 --> 02:05:08,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

1655
02:05:08,849 --> 02:05:09,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for your time.

1656
02:05:09,349 --> 02:05:10,231
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.

1657
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:10,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, everybody.
