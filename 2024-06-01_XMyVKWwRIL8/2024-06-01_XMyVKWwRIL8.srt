123
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:32,448
[SPEAKER_47]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body establishes a general stabilization fund as authorized by Chapter 40 section five B of the general laws.

124
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:37,568
[SPEAKER_47]: Once free cash has been certified, I plan to return with a request for this honorable body to fund the stabilization fund.

125
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:42,793
[SPEAKER_47]: As you probably know, the vast majority of cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have a general stabilization fund.

126
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:49,979
[SPEAKER_47]: In order to provide for emergencies and unforeseen expenses, a two-thirds majority of the city council is required to establish a stabilization fund.

127
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:53,022
[SPEAKER_47]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

128
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:58,123
[SPEAKER_47]: So we have a stabilization fund proposal from the mayor.

129
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:02,865
[SPEAKER_47]: I will recognize Councilor Collins and then I will recognize member of the administration, Councilor Collins.

130
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:08,828
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to defer to a presentation by a member of the administration, President Beresford.

131
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,208
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

132
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,209
[SPEAKER_47]: Madam Chief of Staff.

133
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, President Bears and members of the City Council.

134
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:36,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, happily here to discuss the stabilization fund the creation of one as the council, the majority of the council knows, uh, creation of a stabilization fund requires a two thirds majority of the City Council and therefore what we would call super majority.

135
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:41,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, five members of the City Council would have to prove the formation of such a fund.

136
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:47,819
[SPEAKER_09]: The City of Medford does not currently have a stabilization fund, but it is very common throughout the Commonwealth.

137
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:59,405
[SPEAKER_09]: It's known as the rainy day fund for communities, so that if we're in any type of situation where we need to draw upon reserves for any reason throughout the year,

138
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:08,245
[SPEAKER_09]: The city has the ability to do so with the proposal of the mayor and the approval of the city council to draw upon those funds.

139
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:16,255
[SPEAKER_09]: drawn upon it would be a another two thirds majority and five members of the council would have to approve it.

140
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:24,261
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not even at that stage at the we're at the place where we're proposing a stabilization fund be established.

141
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:36,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we would come back at a time once free cash was certified to propose and discuss and present on an amount to be funded for further or future use.

142
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:39,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's not use it carries over and it's

143
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:56,919
[SPEAKER_09]: an option that's available to cities and towns to ensure that they have access to, you know, funds throughout the year, whereas the only time we presently have access to any rainy day or large cost options outside of

144
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:57,979
[SPEAKER_09]: we're going to be able to do that.

145
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,841
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why the essentially the ARPA funding that we presently have, which is.

146
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:13,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming to a close at the end of this calendar year is once free cash is certified and historically, you know, free cash can get certified and be available for about half of the fiscal year, give or take.

147
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:16,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to answer any questions or if there's anything I didn't cover.

148
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:17,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to touch on that.

149
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:18,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

150
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:19,769
[SPEAKER_47]: Madam Chief of staff

151
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:36,227
[SPEAKER_40]: We've had some trouble even getting the updates from our actuals from this administration.

152
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:42,689
[SPEAKER_40]: I believe we were doing pretty well up until right before the election.

153
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:51,971
[SPEAKER_40]: I believe June, July, August, we were getting redacted information for our city's budget, but we haven't seen anything.

154
00:09:52,631 --> 00:10:03,045
[SPEAKER_40]: and to establish another fund or give this administration control of more money without the checks and balances that I think we're surely lacking here in this community.

155
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,608
[SPEAKER_40]: I wouldn't support this.

156
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,291
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that, you know, the...

157
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:32,061
[SPEAKER_40]: I think what frightens me, Mr. President, is the Chief of Staff said herself, she mentioned with the ARPA funding, if we're gonna use this type of funding, the way we manage the ARPA monies or the ESSA monies, we're gonna be in serious trouble.

158
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,482
[SPEAKER_40]: It's like, until we know.

159
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,628
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm sorry, I think until we know

160
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:52,328
[SPEAKER_40]: that we have a legitimate, transparent financial department that's going to keep this city abreast on all of our financial doings.

161
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:59,831
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it would be a huge error for this council to support it for the fact that

162
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,772
[SPEAKER_40]: We've seen what happened during the budget season.

163
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:12,376
[SPEAKER_40]: We had a financial director that can't tell us what's going on with an actual budget that they gave us last year, saying the numbers weren't correct.

164
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:21,579
[SPEAKER_40]: We have different organizations that are still waiting for their retro funding, saying the software is antiquated, so they can't get that.

165
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,861
[SPEAKER_40]: And to think that we want to give more money somehow to this administration, I think it would be

166
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,966
[SPEAKER_40]: it be responsible for this, this, this, this committee do that.

167
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:48,950
[SPEAKER_40]: So I would recommend that we table this until we get a further understanding of where we are when it comes to updating this council on our fiscal day to day or our fiscal needs and responsibilities.

168
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,971
[SPEAKER_40]: This is another pool of money that if we approve,

169
00:11:52,984 --> 00:12:00,866
[SPEAKER_40]: We're going to, you know, it's going to come back to us and we're going to be made the scapegoats for the lack of true transparency in that office.

170
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:04,867
[SPEAKER_40]: So I would move that we table this, Mr. President, that be form of a motion.

171
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:05,247
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

172
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:13,989
[SPEAKER_54]: Motion to table is undebatable.

173
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:18,410
[SPEAKER_47]: I did not recognize Councilor Collins, but a motion to table is undebatable.

174
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,390
[SPEAKER_47]: Does the motion have a second?

175
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:26,656
[SPEAKER_48]: There are no second the motion fails Councilor Collins.

176
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:33,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Bears.

177
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:36,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you to my fellow Councilors for their comments on this.

178
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to note that this is the second time that a Stabilization Fund paper has come before us.

179
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:46,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Last year, the administration submitted a similar but different paper.

180
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:54,512
[SPEAKER_14]: At that time, we decided that creating that structure and making a large appropriation all in one fell swoop was not the right timing for the city.

181
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:55,874
[SPEAKER_14]: This time, the paper comes to us

182
00:12:56,514 --> 00:13:02,719
[SPEAKER_14]: After months of ongoing discussions about this city's financial future, those discussions must and will continue.

183
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:12,406
[SPEAKER_14]: I do believe that it is the best practice for cities like Medford to have a rainy day fund, in the same way that many households have a rainy day fund for unforeseen emergencies.

184
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:26,032
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that this is an appropriate time to create the structure and then subsequently have those conversations about how much is appropriate to put into the fund and when, because this paper does not call for an appropriation, simply the creation of the structure.

185
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:33,516
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to note this, to just reemphasize, there's no money changing accounts in this paper.

186
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:39,138
[SPEAKER_14]: If there were to be, it would be a reappropriation of money already in the city's coffers and the community's coffers.

187
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:47,743
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that this is the right time to set up the structure and then again have those community conversations about how much it makes sense to put into that rainy day fund.

188
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:54,127
[SPEAKER_14]: And when the next time we have these community wide emergencies come up, we are better prepared to take care of Medford residents.

189
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,588
[SPEAKER_14]: I would motion for approval.

190
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,531
[SPEAKER_47]: If you want to have conversations, please take them outside.

191
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,881
[SPEAKER_47]: Any comments from members of the council?

192
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:04,681
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Tseng.

193
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,161
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, President Bears.

194
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:12,623
[SPEAKER_43]: I think it's really important for us to recognize what question exactly is on our desk today.

195
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:22,426
[SPEAKER_43]: When we last looked at the stabilization fund idea, as Councilor Collins referred to, it was both to create a fund and to put money in it.

196
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:24,827
[SPEAKER_43]: Today's item is different.

197
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:31,189
[SPEAKER_43]: Today's item is just to create the fund and not to put money in it, which is traditionally where the sticking point with the city council has been.

198
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:37,852
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, when it comes to creating the fund, I am in support of it because of the rainy day aspect.

199
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:59,062
[SPEAKER_43]: The way that our finances work right now, if, God forbid, an emergency happened in the city where a roof fell in on a school or a major repair was needed to a public facility, we would not be able to access the funds needed to fix those problems until free cash is certified by the state, which can often take many, many, many months.

200
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:10,307
[SPEAKER_43]: oftentimes closer to a year, and creating the stabilization fund gives us the opportunity to have that money ready to fix emergencies when needed.

201
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:11,988
[SPEAKER_43]: So I support this idea.

202
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:14,409
[SPEAKER_43]: I will second Councilor Collins' motion.

203
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,850
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

204
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,512
[SPEAKER_47]: There's a motion on the floor to approve, seconded by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

205
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,453
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comment by members of the Council?

206
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,476
[SPEAKER_47]: Seeing none, if anyone would like to speak about it, members of the public.

207
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:36,133
[SPEAKER_47]: There's no, this is not, this does not appropriate money.

208
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:37,614
[SPEAKER_47]: This paper does not appropriate a dime.

209
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,816
[SPEAKER_47]: It doesn't though.

210
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:43,598
[SPEAKER_50]: Correct, that's what we're doing.

211
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:51,762
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, Mr. President, Mr. President, if I can.

212
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:52,863
[SPEAKER_40]: Do what you want.

213
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:54,744
[SPEAKER_40]: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

214
00:15:54,824 --> 00:15:55,424
[SPEAKER_40]: Excuse me.

215
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:55,745
[SPEAKER_40]: Hey, hey.

216
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:05,734
[SPEAKER_40]: Hey, listen, listen, this isn't the way, this isn't the way to behave.

217
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:07,395
[SPEAKER_40]: We have a forum.

218
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:08,737
[SPEAKER_40]: We have a forum.

219
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:14,843
[SPEAKER_40]: You have every right to come to this podium, but please give us the respect that this office deserves.

220
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:18,807
[SPEAKER_40]: We want to get to resolutions, but yelling out like that, that's not going to get anything done.

221
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:20,969
[SPEAKER_40]: If you want to speak, this forum's here for you.

222
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,050
[SPEAKER_40]: Come up and speak.

223
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,091
[SPEAKER_40]: I listened, come up and speak.

224
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,512
[SPEAKER_40]: Yelling out doesn't help.

225
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:26,592
[SPEAKER_40]: It really doesn't.

226
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:31,053
[SPEAKER_40]: So please, it's only going to make this a longer, more miserable, disrespectful process.

227
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:32,773
[SPEAKER_40]: We're all here for a reason.

228
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,633
[SPEAKER_40]: We want Medford to be as best as it can.

229
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:36,134
[SPEAKER_40]: So this forum's there.

230
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:37,514
[SPEAKER_40]: So just take advantage of it.

231
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:39,454
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

232
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:40,475
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

233
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:44,895
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. O'Leary, name and address for the record, please.

234
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,156
[SPEAKER_47]: Tap the bottom once you're up.

235
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:48,816
[SPEAKER_47]: The red light will come on when you tap it.

236
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,077
[SPEAKER_54]: I got green.

237
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:52,477
[SPEAKER_47]: There you go.

238
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,950
[SPEAKER_47]: Larry, can you help?

239
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,216
[SPEAKER_47]: You should only have to press it once, Larry.

240
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:03,098
[SPEAKER_47]: Shane's coming.

241
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,501
[SPEAKER_40]: Did Ellie take the batteries?

242
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:11,168
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

243
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:18,336
[SPEAKER_21]: James O'Leary, 30 Norwood Circle, lifelong resident of Medford.

244
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:23,819
[SPEAKER_21]: First thing is, there's no explanation as to what this money is for.

245
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,581
[SPEAKER_47]: There's no money being appropriated.

246
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:28,262
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, but there's no number given out to anybody.

247
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:33,546
[SPEAKER_21]: The second thing, this councilor here, when you asked somebody to second table, raised their hand.

248
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:34,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you?

249
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:36,508
[SPEAKER_47]: I didn't hear you say it, so.

250
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:37,949
[SPEAKER_21]: She did, and you didn't see it.

251
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:39,310
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, we'll have a vote on it.

252
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:43,609
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion to table by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

253
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,570
[SPEAKER_47]: You need to shout it out or I can't see you.

254
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,192
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

255
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:50,013
[SPEAKER_52]: Right to table.

256
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:52,835
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Callahan.

257
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:53,435
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

258
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:55,636
[SPEAKER_52]: Vice President Collins.

259
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:56,597
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

260
00:17:58,158 --> 00:17:58,978
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Lazzaro.

261
00:17:59,278 --> 00:17:59,479
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

262
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,080
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Lemmick.

263
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:01,780
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

264
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:03,641
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Scarpelli.

265
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:04,181
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

266
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:06,295
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Tseng?

267
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:06,655
[SPEAKER_52]: No.

268
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:07,896
[SPEAKER_52]: President Bears?

269
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:08,417
[SPEAKER_47]: No.

270
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:10,018
[SPEAKER_47]: Five in the negative, two in the affirmative.

271
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:11,179
[SPEAKER_47]: The motion fails.

272
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:13,541
[SPEAKER_21]: So now can I continue on with this?

273
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:14,863
[SPEAKER_47]: You may continue, thank you.

274
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:17,825
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Tseng made a comment I'm gonna go about.

275
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,344
[SPEAKER_21]: things that need to be done in this city.

276
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:29,309
[SPEAKER_21]: What happened to the capital improvement fund that started about six years ago, which started being talked about and hasn't gone any place in this city?

277
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Scarpelli made a great point.

278
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,372
[SPEAKER_21]: You have weekly meetings.

279
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:41,096
[SPEAKER_21]: I have not seen any time I've watched anybody from the financial division of this city come up here and explain where we're at.

280
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,999
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of rumors that go around in this city that we're probably about 20 million in the hole.

281
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay?

282
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,943
[SPEAKER_21]: But we've never seen anybody come and say where we are.

283
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:54,964
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to start budget hearings again.

284
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:56,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Why?

285
00:18:57,726 --> 00:19:03,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, when I spoke the two previous times I was here, I talked about bringing the city together.

286
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,573
[SPEAKER_21]: All we're doing is widening it, making more and more people upset.

287
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:08,994
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's got to end.

288
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:10,950
[SPEAKER_21]: because you know what?

289
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,873
[SPEAKER_21]: People aren't gonna wanna come to Medford.

290
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:18,164
[SPEAKER_21]: They used to, but they're not gonna wanna come to Medford with everything that's going on here.

291
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:18,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

292
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,201
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

293
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:29,561
[SPEAKER_47]: Good evening.

294
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:30,682
[SPEAKER_64]: My name is Rose Damascus.

295
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:34,943
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm a longtime citizen since 1990 here.

296
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:41,304
[SPEAKER_64]: I am so aghast of how the city is running right now.

297
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,064
[SPEAKER_64]: It is deplorable.

298
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:44,545
[SPEAKER_64]: The streets are horrible.

299
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:49,586
[SPEAKER_64]: Where is the infrastructure that's supposed to be paying lots of money?

300
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:53,367
[SPEAKER_64]: I now have another tax increase to my taxes, a $900 fee.

301
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,310
[SPEAKER_64]: Where is this money coming?

302
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,111
[SPEAKER_64]: You know what?

303
00:19:57,412 --> 00:20:00,257
[SPEAKER_64]: I think people that don't own houses need to be taxed as well.

304
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:00,958
[SPEAKER_64]: So that's it.

305
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:01,319
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

306
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:12,619
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm going to push for that.

307
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:21,745
[SPEAKER_64]: Because you know what, you don't know what it is the cost for the house and what instructions and you have no idea because you don't understand.

308
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:27,789
[SPEAKER_64]: You just all you do is write a policy but don't know what the impact it has on people's lives.

309
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,530
[SPEAKER_64]: All right.

310
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,671
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you very much.

311
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,521
[SPEAKER_47]: Rose, if you could just leave your name and address with Larry, please.

312
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:45,801
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address the record, please.

313
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:47,802
[SPEAKER_59]: Hi, Eleanor O'Leary, 30 Norwich Circle.

314
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:52,182
[SPEAKER_59]: One quick question, which I don't seem to be getting any answers, I keep hearing it.

315
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:54,243
[SPEAKER_59]: Where is this money coming from?

316
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:55,883
[SPEAKER_47]: There's no money being appropriated.

317
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:59,944
[SPEAKER_59]: Well, excuse me, where is the rainy day item line?

318
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:01,404
[SPEAKER_59]: Where is that money?

319
00:21:01,464 --> 00:21:03,204
[SPEAKER_59]: There has to be money from somewhere.

320
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,965
[SPEAKER_47]: This is just establishing the account.

321
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,305
[SPEAKER_47]: It's not actually putting any money in there.

322
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,506
[SPEAKER_59]: But with that money has to go into it.

323
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:11,047
[SPEAKER_47]: That would happen in the future.

324
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:16,009
[SPEAKER_59]: So I know but in the future, where is that money coming from?

325
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,831
[SPEAKER_47]: So is it from taxes currently how the city works?

326
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:20,771
[SPEAKER_47]: We have free cash.

327
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,872
[SPEAKER_47]: You've heard the first free cash before we have free cash reserves.

328
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,774
[SPEAKER_47]: Basically, that's the aggregated money is left over from all the previous budget.

329
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:30,737
[SPEAKER_47]: Those reserves need to be certified by the state every year.

330
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,920
[SPEAKER_47]: It generally takes the state nine months to certify that money.

331
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,904
[SPEAKER_47]: During those nine months, we can't use that money for any purpose and it can't be appropriated.

332
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:50,077
[SPEAKER_47]: By establishing a stabilization fund, which is all that's happening right now, and if money were to be put in it in the future, during those nine months when free cash is not certified, the reserves would still be able to be appropriated for an emergency fund.

333
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:58,564
[SPEAKER_59]: So then why make another fund if these are already because you can't make you can't use it for the nine months when it's not being certified.

334
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:00,465
[SPEAKER_59]: Okay, that's one my last question.

335
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:10,774
[SPEAKER_59]: The other question on this is what give me an example other people here example, what would it be used for, for example, a roof collapse, major infrastructure issue.

336
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:16,208
[SPEAKER_59]: We don't have anything budgeted for any buildings or anything like that in the city already.

337
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:20,211
[SPEAKER_47]: Currently when free cash is not certified, our reserves are not available for those purposes.

338
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:21,432
[SPEAKER_59]: So it's free cash.

339
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:27,697
[SPEAKER_59]: So I'm just really confused because my concern is we give them free reign again.

340
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:30,579
[SPEAKER_59]: There's no money because that's what's happening.

341
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,242
[SPEAKER_59]: I'm in the school system, a teacher 33 years.

342
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:34,623
[SPEAKER_59]: And let me tell you.

343
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:49,688
[SPEAKER_59]: We were all just told the budget is frozen, we're 2.5 million in the hole, there's no water, there's no paper, sorry, you have three or four months left in school, it's up to you.

344
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:53,330
[SPEAKER_59]: So is this what's gonna happen every time with this city?

345
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:55,512
[SPEAKER_59]: It is disgusting.

346
00:22:55,852 --> 00:23:02,295
[SPEAKER_59]: And I'm telling you, I'm retiring in June, thank the Lord, I don't have to deal with it anymore.

347
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:03,376
[SPEAKER_59]: It's unbelievable.

348
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:04,657
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

349
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:10,077
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Castagnetti, if you could just let her first.

350
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:10,878
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

351
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,161
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

352
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:16,383
[SPEAKER_66]: Angela Murphy, 16 Codding Street.

353
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:23,289
[SPEAKER_66]: I have been up here about many issues for a long time this past three years.

354
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:32,431
[SPEAKER_66]: And I am so disappointed I've been a method, since I was 568 years, I have not seen any improvements.

355
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,952
[SPEAKER_66]: In fact, this city has gone downhill.

356
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:41,854
[SPEAKER_66]: I talked to people in other cities, and they say where you from I say, I'm almost ashamed to say I'm from method.

357
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:47,530
[SPEAKER_66]: improvements for the residents.

358
00:23:48,191 --> 00:23:52,816
[SPEAKER_66]: My street was done, not even three years ago or something that's falling apart again.

359
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:54,758
[SPEAKER_66]: There's potholes everywhere.

360
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:56,539
[SPEAKER_66]: You want a rainy day fun.

361
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:03,106
[SPEAKER_66]: You don't even know what you have in the budget according to Councilor Scott.

362
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:14,429
[SPEAKER_66]: thing on the taxpayers here and the residents to say we're going to create a rainy day fun.

363
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,031
[SPEAKER_66]: Well, it's raining now use what you have.

364
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:32,228
[SPEAKER_65]: That's what you're doing to this city.

365
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:40,350
[SPEAKER_66]: And you know, like I said, I'm almost ashamed to tell people, because people outside of Reuben, they hear what's going on in Method.

366
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,632
[SPEAKER_66]: And I tell people, and they're like surprised and shocked, and they're glad they don't live here.

367
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:51,074
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

368
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:58,576
[SPEAKER_47]: Since you've already spoken once, if there's anyone who wants to speak, you've already spoken once, so if there's anyone who'd like, if there's anyone who'd like to speak for the first time,

369
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:00,364
[SPEAKER_54]: I do.

370
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:01,625
[SPEAKER_47]: You'll defer, okay.

371
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:06,589
[SPEAKER_47]: Come to the podium, thank you.

372
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:09,071
[SPEAKER_64]: I went to Bentley, so I know what I'm doing here.

373
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,191
[SPEAKER_64]: Can you just provide, can you just name it?

374
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:12,653
[SPEAKER_64]: Oh, Rose, Damascus, Six Flags Down the Road, Method, Massachusetts.

375
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:14,014
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

376
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:16,476
[SPEAKER_64]: Okay, so I know what budgets are.

377
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:23,381
[SPEAKER_64]: You're telling me that they don't have the budget completely up there and what we're standing at if we were to fill a lot.

378
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,942
[SPEAKER_47]: The city budget is on the city website.

379
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:27,737
[SPEAKER_64]: I thought he just said there wasn't.

380
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:29,038
[SPEAKER_64]: He said it's not updated.

381
00:25:29,218 --> 00:25:33,120
[SPEAKER_64]: Why are we having an updated budget on?

382
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:51,192
[SPEAKER_47]: You would have to ask the mayor's mayor, we have asked the mayor we've had several meetings on the budget ordinance, we have an entire budget process set up so it's not accurate to say the meeting to explain why we cannot compel the mayor to come to anything.

383
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:51,612
[SPEAKER_64]: Why?

384
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:53,293
[SPEAKER_47]: We don't have the legal authority.

385
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,271
[SPEAKER_47]: I said, we do not have the legal authority to compel attendance at these meetings.

386
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,334
[SPEAKER_64]: I can't hear a word you're saying.

387
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,814
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm not going to do it.

388
00:26:05,335 --> 00:26:08,376
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, if everyone would be quiet, you could hear me.

389
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:13,039
[SPEAKER_47]: I said, we do not have the legal authority to compel people to attend these meetings.

390
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:17,073
[SPEAKER_64]: We're not just talking people, we're talking to citizens here, number one.

391
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:17,453
[SPEAKER_64]: And number two.

392
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:19,754
[SPEAKER_47]: I do not have the authority to compel the mayor to attend these meetings.

393
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:20,614
[SPEAKER_47]: We can't tell the mayor to come.

394
00:26:20,654 --> 00:26:21,395
[SPEAKER_47]: Why not?

395
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,595
[SPEAKER_47]: I don't have the legal authority.

396
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,815
[SPEAKER_65]: Well, we should all have the mayor.

397
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:28,177
[SPEAKER_65]: It's all right for me to tell the mayor to come, or a bunch of people to come.

398
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:30,898
[SPEAKER_53]: Because you guys do not help us.

399
00:26:31,178 --> 00:26:35,840
[SPEAKER_64]: We want to know from her why the budget's not working, and the way it's not finalized.

400
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,840
[SPEAKER_64]: That is all crapola.

401
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:39,981
[SPEAKER_29]: She doesn't have the stamina.

402
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,982
[SPEAKER_64]: All right, we can't.

403
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:44,354
[SPEAKER_64]: So why don't we have her on there?

404
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:48,537
[SPEAKER_64]: So who do we have to say that we want the mayor here?

405
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:56,822
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, we'll make a motion and we'll do that tonight, but at the end of the evening, but again, we can recommend that the mayor come.

406
00:26:57,262 --> 00:27:01,725
[SPEAKER_40]: I know that the chief of staff is here in her stead if we have questions for her.

407
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:16,558
[SPEAKER_40]: That was the business area and the person who presented this on the budget that the issues are right now is, we don't know like most communities have a working budget, you, you understand where the money is being spent.

408
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,300
[SPEAKER_64]: I know I'm an accountant so I understand.

409
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,587
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm just saying it's everybody else isn't it something to you know I'm just letting everybody know the issue is this council doesn't see that we don't know either.

410
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:39,895
[SPEAKER_40]: So I actually put the school, I put the superintendent on the, on the docket tonight as a resolution because we're hearing rumors because right now they're just rumors to us that the school budget is in the whole 2.5 million for this year so we don't know.

411
00:27:40,296 --> 00:27:45,419
[SPEAKER_40]: So these are the issues why I wouldn't vote for this because I think that without understanding

412
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:46,660
[SPEAKER_40]: we can't move forward.

413
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,663
[SPEAKER_40]: I also think that we have we have a few new Councilors that weren't here when this process started.

414
00:27:51,943 --> 00:28:01,709
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think it would be it would be beneficial for them to sit in a meeting to start this whole process over and understanding what a rainy day account is and what it's used for and how they're

415
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:08,094
[SPEAKER_40]: There are other ways if there are emergencies to help with different scenarios, but I'm not going to get into that tonight.

416
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:15,099
[SPEAKER_40]: What I'm saying is I don't support this because we don't know what our fiscal future looks like.

417
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:18,862
[SPEAKER_40]: There is no last year we didn't get we we didn't even know.

418
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:22,985
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't even think we got a written budget after it was passed.

419
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:23,345
[SPEAKER_40]: Correct.

420
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:24,346
[SPEAKER_40]: We got a budget.

421
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:24,767
[SPEAKER_40]: So right.

422
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:26,668
[SPEAKER_40]: So we got it right after we passed the budget.

423
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:27,669
[SPEAKER_40]: We had nothing to work from.

424
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:37,264
[SPEAKER_64]: We had ourselves two years ago we had two years ago you know what the city sorry to interrupt you, the city of the members of the city would like to know what that budget is.

425
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:40,145
[SPEAKER_64]: So how can we get the mayor to come.

426
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:54,009
[SPEAKER_47]: What's that there is a call the mayor, there is a copy of the city budget on the city website and there is a look at the, you can look at the budget is not updated as a copy of the approved budget that we approved in the council records on the city website as well.

427
00:28:54,471 --> 00:29:05,236
[SPEAKER_47]: When, when did it happen he's saying it's not it was it's on but it's nothing we're not updating where, what, what, what I'm probably saying is, I think that we haven't received a budget to actual report budget.

428
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:18,122
[SPEAKER_47]: Budget to actual because a budget without the actual is we, I do know that departments have been meeting with the mayor about the budget budget actuals do exist and it is part of our budget ordinance that we'll see those which is on the agenda tonight.

429
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,870
[SPEAKER_64]: Okay, so I'd like to have the mayor come here at the next meeting.

430
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,950
[SPEAKER_47]: I can't control that.

431
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,291
[SPEAKER_64]: Well, then I will do that.

432
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:26,473
[SPEAKER_64]: I will do that because you can't do it, I will.

433
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:27,213
[SPEAKER_64]: Because you know what?

434
00:29:27,713 --> 00:29:30,395
[SPEAKER_64]: These citizens here are paying your salaries.

435
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:32,276
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you so much.

436
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:38,120
[SPEAKER_64]: And if you are staying, you have to do your job.

437
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,781
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

438
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:42,702
[SPEAKER_64]: And if you don't own a home, you don't know what it actually means.

439
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,146
[SPEAKER_64]: Mr. President,

440
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:54,284
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Castagnetti, would you like to speak on the Stabilization Fund?

441
00:29:55,045 --> 00:30:01,048
[SPEAKER_47]: No, I don't, however- Well, if you don't want to speak on the Stabilization Fund, we're going to have to wait until- It is, okay.

442
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:01,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

443
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:04,350
[SPEAKER_13]: The name is Castagnetti, you got that right.

444
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:04,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Andrew.

445
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,311
[SPEAKER_54]: Name and address for the record, please.

446
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:08,112
[SPEAKER_13]: The other side of East Medford.

447
00:30:08,192 --> 00:30:08,853
[SPEAKER_54]: Cushing Street.

448
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,073
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.

449
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:10,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

450
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:11,474
[SPEAKER_13]: To protect the innocent.

451
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:17,157
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been a resident too long in this one horse town, since 1955.

452
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:25,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really want to come speak for this because we have a bigger fish to fry.

453
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why most of us are here.

454
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:32,858
[SPEAKER_13]: However, when I started hearing about this stabilization fund, I started to get concerned.

455
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:44,526
[SPEAKER_13]: If any of you own homes, if... Thanks for the interruption.

456
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:48,489
[SPEAKER_13]: I got my HO3 bill yesterday.

457
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:49,310
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what that is?

458
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:52,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Council President, do you know what that is?

459
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:53,779
[SPEAKER_13]: A HO3 bill.

460
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,640
[SPEAKER_47]: Enlighten me, Mr. President.

461
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:56,501
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't, okay.

462
00:30:57,882 --> 00:31:00,403
[SPEAKER_13]: It's simply a homeowner's insurance policy.

463
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:00,983
[SPEAKER_54]: Yes.

464
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:03,024
[SPEAKER_13]: In layman's terms.

465
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:12,790
[SPEAKER_13]: And the bill went from, it was $1,000 five years ago, it was $2,500 last year.

466
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,750
[SPEAKER_13]: It went to 3,000, three large.

467
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:24,818
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how you people pay your bills because I'm struggling with a fixed income.

468
00:31:25,138 --> 00:31:27,259
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is about stabilization, all right?

469
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:35,886
[SPEAKER_13]: The point is no further taxation without proper, proper, proper representation, period.

470
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:37,647
Thank you.

471
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:46,093
[SPEAKER_54]: Any further discussion?

472
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:59,147
[SPEAKER_47]: So I name an address to the record, you're fine, you don't have to touch Diane Harrigan 65 Ripley road.

473
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:07,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to come up from a common sense, I think, from what I'm hearing about the stabilization.

474
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:09,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't agree more with George.

475
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,723
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that I think people are against another fund, but how do you.

476
00:32:16,983 --> 00:32:20,705
[SPEAKER_02]: vote for another fund when we have other funds and we don't know what's in it?

477
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:21,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we in debt?

478
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:28,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a surplus of money in any of those funds that you know that can maybe be shared with other funds?

479
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:29,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.

480
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:33,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to move forward with something brand new where we don't even know what's in the existing

481
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:40,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if we had a better idea of what's in the existing and how that money is being managed, and is it enough?

482
00:32:40,712 --> 00:32:41,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it running out?

483
00:32:41,612 --> 00:32:42,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a surplus?

484
00:32:42,692 --> 00:32:47,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people could maybe wrap their heads around another fund.

485
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:52,295
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, that just sounds like common sense.

486
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:54,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowledge is power.

487
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,617
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had more knowledge, we could have a better

488
00:32:58,317 --> 00:32:59,378
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, feeling about it.

489
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:02,680
[SPEAKER_47]: That's the last time that free cash certifies about twenty five million.

490
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,801
[SPEAKER_47]: That was last fiscal year.

491
00:33:05,382 --> 00:33:09,605
[SPEAKER_47]: No appropriations have been made from free cash because it hasn't been certified yet this fiscal year.

492
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:11,306
[SPEAKER_47]: So it's likely higher than that.

493
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:14,668
[SPEAKER_47]: But again, this paper doesn't move any money into anywhere.

494
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:15,789
[SPEAKER_47]: It just establishes the fund.

495
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:16,069
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

496
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like why open up another fund?

497
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:27,937
[SPEAKER_02]: We have other funds and we don't know what those funds are doing, you know, because we don't have there's no transparency or not enough transparency.

498
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:31,979
[SPEAKER_02]: for at least, I think, the average person to make them feel comfortable about it.

499
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:32,859
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel.

500
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:33,760
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

501
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:42,144
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

502
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:43,785
[SPEAKER_47]: Is anyone else like to speak for their first time?

503
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:45,866
[SPEAKER_47]: And we do have a limit of three times.

504
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:47,327
[SPEAKER_64]: Ma'am, I'm number three.

505
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,269
[SPEAKER_64]: So I have a suggestion.

506
00:33:51,684 --> 00:33:53,405
[SPEAKER_64]: All homeowners pay taxes here.

507
00:33:54,306 --> 00:34:01,810
[SPEAKER_64]: I think what would be helpful is that people that rent should stop paying a portion of the taxes because they're using our services in our city.

508
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:07,634
[SPEAKER_64]: So I think we're gonna have to have something that's gonna be put on the docket to make that happen.

509
00:34:08,054 --> 00:34:09,675
[SPEAKER_64]: And I feel that, you know what?

510
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:10,956
[SPEAKER_64]: Then you'll feel the pain.

511
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:15,219
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

512
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,600
[SPEAKER_53]: Name and address for the record, please.

513
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:24,990
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, could you speak up?

514
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,331
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

515
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,074
[SPEAKER_31]: You guys decide where the money goes, right?

516
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,455
[SPEAKER_53]: There's no money.

517
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:35,478
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm just saying, the money that you have now, you guys decide where it gets spent, right?

518
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:37,640
[SPEAKER_53]: The mayor decides that we can only approve it.

519
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,542
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, so she controls everything.

520
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:40,382
Yes.

521
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:41,763
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you guys efficient now?

522
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:43,225
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you running the place efficiently?

523
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:45,046
[SPEAKER_31]: Accountability, do you have that?

524
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:48,129
[SPEAKER_31]: As far as I know, he doesn't know what's going on.

525
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:50,507
[SPEAKER_31]: The problem is they don't even know what's going on.

526
00:34:51,028 --> 00:34:53,089
[SPEAKER_31]: They have no money coming back saying, what are we doing here?

527
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,890
[SPEAKER_31]: Where's this money going?

528
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:54,851
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know.

529
00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:56,973
[SPEAKER_31]: Right there, he just said it.

530
00:34:57,714 --> 00:34:58,614
[SPEAKER_31]: He wants to stop this.

531
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:01,157
[SPEAKER_31]: Take care of the holes you have in there now.

532
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:02,898
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't create another big hole.

533
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:04,940
[SPEAKER_31]: Because we don't know where the money's going.

534
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,841
[SPEAKER_31]: It's very simple.

535
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:07,322
[SPEAKER_31]: It's like running a home.

536
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:09,884
[SPEAKER_31]: The money's coming in, you don't know where it's going.

537
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:11,686
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not going to put more money out there.

538
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:12,427
[SPEAKER_31]: There's no way.

539
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:14,469
[SPEAKER_31]: It's very simple.

540
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:18,306
[SPEAKER_31]: If you got holes, fix them first.

541
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:19,987
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't make more.

542
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:21,687
[SPEAKER_31]: That's it.

543
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:24,789
[SPEAKER_31]: You want money to spend, and then you tell me you're gonna spend it for this?

544
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,269
[SPEAKER_31]: Right now you say this.

545
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,330
[SPEAKER_31]: Three years from now, you're not gonna be here.

546
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:29,791
[SPEAKER_31]: Somebody else gonna take it over?

547
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,292
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just like Social Security.

548
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:32,512
[SPEAKER_31]: We're gonna do for that?

549
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:32,912
[SPEAKER_31]: No, no.

550
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:34,953
[SPEAKER_31]: We're gonna change it, the laws.

551
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:36,314
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's going someplace else.

552
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:40,196
[SPEAKER_31]: The problem is it's gonna cause the city, people don't wanna come over here.

553
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:42,717
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't sell, you can't buy.

554
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:45,338
[SPEAKER_31]: City's dying.

555
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:47,118
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

556
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:54,582
[SPEAKER_54]: Any further comment on the stabilization fund?

557
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:58,465
[SPEAKER_54]: Name and address for the record, please.

558
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:03,788
[SPEAKER_63]: Deanne Andresano, 23 Emerald Street.

559
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:10,011
[SPEAKER_63]: I just, of all this, I'm sitting over there watching and I find, your name?

560
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:13,333
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Lazzaro.

561
00:36:13,612 --> 00:36:23,314
[SPEAKER_63]: was our your looks, extremely condescending, ma'am, please direct your comments at the chair.

562
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:29,075
[SPEAKER_63]: People say something are extremely condescending.

563
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:35,556
[SPEAKER_63]: And she's here are supposed to be representing the citizens of Medford.

564
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:37,517
[SPEAKER_63]: And she's smirking.

565
00:36:39,275 --> 00:36:44,507
[SPEAKER_63]: giving you eyes, giving this gentleman eyes, that's uncalled for.

566
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:53,918
[SPEAKER_63]: No, I know you said the money's not coming.

567
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:54,879
[SPEAKER_63]: The money's not there.

568
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,301
[SPEAKER_63]: You're setting up a fund.

569
00:36:56,621 --> 00:37:00,947
[SPEAKER_63]: You're taking baby steps to go where you want to go.

570
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,410
[SPEAKER_63]: We're in she's texting.

571
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,391
[SPEAKER_63]: Okay.

572
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:06,113
[SPEAKER_63]: Ma'am, please.

573
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:07,995
[SPEAKER_47]: If you just have comments.

574
00:37:08,035 --> 00:37:08,316
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

575
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:19,926
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, thank you, Mr. Kastner.

576
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:23,307
[SPEAKER_53]: I'll have one too.

577
00:37:24,348 --> 00:37:25,668
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

578
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:28,510
[SPEAKER_49]: Anne Haggerty, 11 Sagamore Park in West Medford.

579
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,890
[SPEAKER_49]: Hi.

580
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:39,275
[SPEAKER_49]: I think I don't completely understand how setting up a fund without any money is helpful at this time.

581
00:37:40,115 --> 00:37:41,876
[SPEAKER_49]: Is that a bank thing?

582
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:45,518
[SPEAKER_49]: Is there costs associated with holding a fund with no cash or in it?

583
00:37:46,755 --> 00:37:56,537
[SPEAKER_49]: perhaps the wisest thing now would be to combine the setup of the fund with discussions on how to fill it at a later date.

584
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:57,838
[SPEAKER_49]: That's just a proposal.

585
00:37:57,918 --> 00:38:02,419
[SPEAKER_47]: So we had those discussions last year and they were tabled in June around the budget.

586
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:11,381
[SPEAKER_47]: My understanding of one of the reasons this is up is that establishing a stabilization fund would help the city's bond rating and that there are meetings upcoming on that item.

587
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:15,676
[SPEAKER_47]: even if it's unfunded, just having the stabilization fund is helpful.

588
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:17,356
[SPEAKER_49]: Are there costs associated with the unfunded fund?

589
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:18,896
[SPEAKER_47]: There are no costs associated with having the fund.

590
00:38:19,036 --> 00:38:20,897
[SPEAKER_47]: It's just, it's a city-established fund.

591
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:23,517
[SPEAKER_47]: It's literally a line in an accounting software.

592
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:24,337
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

593
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:25,418
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

594
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:29,599
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

595
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:33,459
[SPEAKER_62]: Phyllis Morrison, 32 Andrew Street, Medford.

596
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,281
[SPEAKER_62]: You know, I came to tonight's meeting because I am a concerned Medford citizen and resident.

597
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,853
[SPEAKER_62]: I have to say with all honesty, I think that the majority of this meeting has been counterproductive.

598
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:56,957
[SPEAKER_62]: I think making personal attacks, yelling and screaming will not aid in anything we're trying to accomplish.

599
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:05,460
[SPEAKER_62]: I think that we should at least have the decency among us to be able to speak and to hear one another speak.

600
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:10,543
[SPEAKER_62]: I came for certain reasons this evening, just as everyone in this room did.

601
00:39:11,644 --> 00:39:21,509
[SPEAKER_62]: I can no longer sit in this room while people are ridiculed and there's hollering and screaming and talking over one another.

602
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,050
[SPEAKER_62]: I've only lived in Medford since 1997.

603
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:28,133
[SPEAKER_62]: I happen to think there's great value in the city of Method.

604
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:29,793
[SPEAKER_62]: Do I think I'm overtaxed?

605
00:39:30,274 --> 00:39:31,854
[SPEAKER_62]: I don't think I'd be normal if I didn't.

606
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,897
[SPEAKER_62]: Am I here for the reason to speak up for my rights as a citizen?

607
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:36,377
[SPEAKER_62]: Yes.

608
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:45,881
[SPEAKER_62]: But I'm sadly gonna leave this meeting because I cannot stand the rudeness and the incivility of what's taking place.

609
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:48,083
[SPEAKER_62]: I hope you all have a wonderful evening.

610
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:48,824
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you.

611
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,135
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Phyllis.

612
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,016
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

613
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:02,717
[SPEAKER_67]: Hello, Nicole Branley, 54 North Circle in Medford.

614
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:05,698
[SPEAKER_67]: And just for the record, I am a Medford School Committee member.

615
00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:07,259
[SPEAKER_47]: Congratulations.

616
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:08,259
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, thanks.

617
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:11,140
[SPEAKER_47]: Is this your first time talking to us as a school committee member?

618
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,901
[SPEAKER_67]: I don't believe it is the first time speaking as a school committee member.

619
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:14,241
[SPEAKER_67]: I don't know.

620
00:40:14,282 --> 00:40:16,382
[SPEAKER_67]: I'm up here so often, I've lost track of the dates.

621
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:17,303
[SPEAKER_54]: Definitely on your left.

622
00:40:17,363 --> 00:40:18,603
[SPEAKER_67]: This side or that side.

623
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:23,545
[SPEAKER_67]: So I just wanted to ask if the superintendent was going to be here tonight.

624
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:24,806
[SPEAKER_67]: I know that she is on the docket.

625
00:40:25,613 --> 00:40:27,333
[SPEAKER_47]: I do not believe we're going to be tonight.

626
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:32,374
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, so we haven't, I mean there's an item on the agenda, requesting a report back.

627
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:32,935
[SPEAKER_67]: Correct.

628
00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:39,136
[SPEAKER_67]: So I just wanted to confirm that in the Medford school committee meeting, I don't think it was this one or maybe the last one.

629
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:45,657
[SPEAKER_67]: Gerry McCue did come to the podium and did discuss that we did have a 2.5 million deficit that is not a secret.

630
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:49,218
[SPEAKER_67]: He stood here, I actually confirm that because I thought maybe.

631
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:56,077
[SPEAKER_67]: I was incorrect but I was correct he did stand here he did discuss the 2.5 million deficit in the school budget.

632
00:40:57,758 --> 00:41:06,100
[SPEAKER_67]: We did pass a motion and I'd like to thank Mrs. O'Leary for bringing up the fact that we did pass a motion that we will not run out of paper.

633
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,221
[SPEAKER_67]: So this is what we've come to in this city that we're passing motions that we don't run out of paper in our school.

634
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:13,962
[SPEAKER_67]: That breaks my heart.

635
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:17,773
[SPEAKER_67]: We do have a budget freeze.

636
00:41:19,593 --> 00:41:22,074
[SPEAKER_67]: And of course, if I'm incorrect in any of this, someone can correct me.

637
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:38,537
[SPEAKER_67]: But we have stopped purchasing water for our teachers, just simple bubbler water for our teachers in their in their lunchroom, which I know they have a faucet, I know that they can bring their Stanley cup also.

638
00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:40,518
[SPEAKER_67]: But I think that we've really

639
00:41:43,396 --> 00:41:48,783
[SPEAKER_67]: gone over the line here of what of what's happening so I know people are very upset.

640
00:41:49,064 --> 00:42:00,098
[SPEAKER_67]: I just want to encourage people to always come to meetings, where we're here I'm here just like you guys at a meeting regularly so I know you're upset now but there's stuff that happens in this chamber.

641
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,040
[SPEAKER_67]: multiple times a week.

642
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:05,463
[SPEAKER_67]: So be present, you know, know what's going on.

643
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,004
[SPEAKER_67]: So yes, that's happening in our school.

644
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:12,148
[SPEAKER_67]: And I just want to thank Councilor Scarpelli and all of you for your hard work.

645
00:42:12,648 --> 00:42:14,870
[SPEAKER_67]: But know that that is a true number.

646
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,733
[SPEAKER_67]: We are $2.5 million in the whole for the school budget.

647
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:25,018
[SPEAKER_67]: And that is devastating as someone who's worked in the Medford public school system and who has children in the Medford public school system.

648
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,282
[SPEAKER_67]: And as a school committee member, here we are.

649
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:36,004
[SPEAKER_67]: So I think we really need to hold ourselves accountable because this is this is who voted us in.

650
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:38,829
[SPEAKER_67]: This is who voted us in and we need to listen to that.

651
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:39,671
[SPEAKER_67]: So thank you.

652
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:40,151
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

653
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,780
[SPEAKER_31]: any further discussion on the stabilization?

654
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:46,522
[SPEAKER_31]: If I can, Mr. President, just one thing.

655
00:42:47,602 --> 00:42:48,063
[SPEAKER_47]: One second.

656
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:50,004
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, Councilor Schapiro.

657
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:59,010
[SPEAKER_40]: If I can, I think that that's probably one of the questions that people are fearing, is what's going to constitute an emergency?

658
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:12,019
[SPEAKER_40]: Is the fact that there is a shortfall in the budget, that that would constitute an emergency, something that should have been handled through our general funds, that now can come to us to say we can build

659
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,380
[SPEAKER_40]: to bail the city administration out.

660
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:21,006
[SPEAKER_40]: We say it's a roof, but what is going to constitute an emergency that this fund can be used for?

661
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:24,669
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think that that could be a little enlightening for everybody, too.

662
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:37,059
[SPEAKER_47]: And just to be clear, even if a fund is established, it would require a two-thirds vote of the council to place money into the fund, and then require a vote of the council to appropriate any money from the fund so the mayor would not be able to unilaterally use those funds.

663
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:44,887
[SPEAKER_40]: So again, this is where this council, we fell in this gap with being put on the spot by the firefighters piece, the civil service.

664
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:46,609
[SPEAKER_40]: She's making us to be the scapegoat.

665
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:49,172
[SPEAKER_40]: So we're gonna say, let's do this.

666
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:53,316
[SPEAKER_40]: And then there's gonna be a huge shortfall because they're gonna cut teachers.

667
00:43:53,656 --> 00:43:54,257
[SPEAKER_40]: Now think about it.

668
00:43:54,577 --> 00:43:58,602
[SPEAKER_40]: Then they're gonna come to the podium, look at us and say, now you voted down.

669
00:44:00,143 --> 00:44:11,487
[SPEAKER_40]: or something that's an emergency in the city because they didn't fund it correctly, they're gonna come to this council and say, okay, you voted for the stabilization fund, now you're gonna have to vote on this.

670
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:13,907
[SPEAKER_40]: Don't let it get to that point, that's what I'm telling you.

671
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:18,549
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know if you see this, but we're being made to be the scapegoat for her mistakes.

672
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:19,929
[SPEAKER_40]: So just be careful.

673
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:21,830
[SPEAKER_47]: She can do it with free cash anyway.

674
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,930
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, let her do it, but not from this council.

675
00:44:24,631 --> 00:44:26,051
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, she would have to come to us anyway.

676
00:44:30,831 --> 00:44:31,511
[SPEAKER_47]: How slow those are?

677
00:44:32,692 --> 00:44:34,072
[SPEAKER_30]: I do have a question about free cash.

678
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:34,973
[SPEAKER_30]: Can you explain to us?

679
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:46,357
[SPEAKER_30]: Because my understanding is from when I worked for the superintendent, we would occasionally get free cash allotments to the schools, but it would be at times that we couldn't anticipate.

680
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:47,298
[SPEAKER_30]: This was with

681
00:44:48,118 --> 00:45:10,365
[SPEAKER_30]: the current mayor and the prior mayor as well it would be like oh you're getting free cash you know uh ask for ask for what you need but it wouldn't have been budgeted by the school so sometimes free cash would just appear so if this fund is established and then funds that would have previously been in free cash would be part of this now part of this fund

682
00:45:10,885 --> 00:45:15,126
[SPEAKER_47]: if those were the funds that were appropriated, but we have appropriated free cash.

683
00:45:15,206 --> 00:45:17,147
[SPEAKER_47]: But this council would be able to say.

684
00:45:17,307 --> 00:45:20,528
[SPEAKER_47]: The council would approve any allocations to the fund and any approvals.

685
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:25,589
[SPEAKER_30]: As is my understanding, the way it is right now, this council has nothing to say about how free cash is allocated.

686
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:25,769
[SPEAKER_30]: No, we do.

687
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:26,629
[SPEAKER_47]: We approve free cash as well.

688
00:45:26,649 --> 00:45:27,129
[SPEAKER_30]: We do approve free cash.

689
00:45:27,149 --> 00:45:32,191
[SPEAKER_47]: But we also have spent free cash on fire trucks, DPW vehicles, a variety of things.

690
00:45:32,531 --> 00:45:32,771
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

691
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:39,233
[SPEAKER_30]: What is the difference between the way free cash is allocated and how a rainy day fund would be allocated?

692
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:46,415
[SPEAKER_47]: Free cash is only available when it's certified by the state, which is generally only end of March, beginning of April, so it's not available for nine months.

693
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:49,676
[SPEAKER_47]: Any funds in a stabilization fund would be available 12 months.

694
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:51,617
[SPEAKER_47]: So we would have quicker access.

695
00:45:51,637 --> 00:45:55,358
[SPEAKER_47]: Right now, if we need a fire truck in September, we can't actually buy it until April.

696
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:55,798
[SPEAKER_30]: Got it.

697
00:45:56,966 --> 00:46:03,332
[SPEAKER_30]: I can just say that from the perspective of the city council my understanding is like our priorities, since we were.

698
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:11,177
[SPEAKER_30]: running for office have been, I've been very upfront about funding the schools as being one of my top priorities.

699
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:22,025
[SPEAKER_30]: It's always been really important, you know, being, having a really transparent budget and making sure that we're prioritizing those things in the way that we are allocating funds.

700
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:28,130
[SPEAKER_30]: So if there's a mechanism for us to have more transparent access to funds and being able to authorize

701
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:31,907
[SPEAKER_30]: be able to allocate funds in a quicker manner than the way the free cash is authorized.

702
00:46:31,947 --> 00:46:33,108
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that's a benefit.

703
00:46:33,149 --> 00:46:36,171
[SPEAKER_30]: But again, what we're what we would be approving here wouldn't be.

704
00:46:36,892 --> 00:46:46,400
[SPEAKER_30]: Any allocation of any funds would only be the opportunity to maybe one day have quicker access to, uh, funds that would be able to be allocated to various city services.

705
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,060
[SPEAKER_30]: Correct Okay.

706
00:46:48,662 --> 00:46:49,062
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further

707
00:46:59,198 --> 00:47:05,101
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the question of getting proper budgetary information out of the administration.

708
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:13,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that's an entirely separate discussion, I agree that that's a big problem, and we as a city council have been working.

709
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:20,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I even before I got on the city council to make sure that that's a more transparent process that the mayor is asked

710
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:29,134
[SPEAKER_08]: and has been asked repeatedly and now has to follow a schedule to provide information this is something that this city council and the city council before me has worked very hard on.

711
00:47:29,494 --> 00:47:37,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is not something that we are ignoring this is something we are working very hard to make sure happens, but it is a totally separate issue from whether

712
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:47,147
[SPEAKER_08]: we have 12 month availability of free cash, essentially, or if we only have free cash after it has been certified, which can take six to nine months.

713
00:47:47,527 --> 00:48:01,697
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is what this question is, is a question of whether we have, as a city, have availability of that free cash for 12 months, or whether we have availability for that free cash only after it has been certified six to nine months later.

714
00:48:02,878 --> 00:48:07,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely agree with many of the people who spoke here that the city

715
00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:10,763
[SPEAKER_08]: The roads are in terrible condition.

716
00:48:11,144 --> 00:48:13,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Our school buildings are in terrible condition.

717
00:48:13,606 --> 00:48:19,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Our school budget is not anywhere near large enough for the amount of teachers that we need.

718
00:48:20,852 --> 00:48:24,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely agree with those sentiments and that reality.

719
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:35,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that it's because of decades of underfunding of this city, because that is why the roads have come to the point where they have come, and why the school buildings have come to the point where they have come.

720
00:48:36,345 --> 00:48:48,710
[SPEAKER_08]: That is also a separate issue from the question of whether we have year round access to essentially free cash, or whether we can cannot access that free cash for the first six to nine months.

721
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:59,735
[SPEAKER_08]: So, to me, this really is a question simply of whether, and I appreciate cancer Scarpelli for your consideration for the newer city Councilors of which I am one.

722
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:05,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not mind a little bit more time to understand this.

723
00:49:05,662 --> 00:49:15,386
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say that it seems quite clear to me that, first of all, we're not taxing anybody.

724
00:49:15,926 --> 00:49:18,047
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not increasing the funds.

725
00:49:18,227 --> 00:49:19,007
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no.

726
00:49:19,087 --> 00:49:23,689
[SPEAKER_08]: This literally does not have to do anything with that.

727
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:29,091
[SPEAKER_08]: It converts free cash from something that we cannot access to something that we can access.

728
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:30,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And that free cash is literally

729
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:43,955
[SPEAKER_08]: what happens when the income that comes into the city and the budget that goes out of the city, the actual spent budget that goes out of the city differ, which they have to do, or else you don't have a bond rating.

730
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:53,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So understanding the budget of the city and how it functions, I do believe that creating this fund is the smart thing to do.

731
00:49:55,437 --> 00:49:57,578
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm willing to vote on this tonight.

732
00:49:58,322 --> 00:49:59,464
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

733
00:50:00,226 --> 00:50:01,989
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comments by members of the public?

734
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:03,872
[SPEAKER_47]: Former Councilor Michael Marks.

735
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:06,036
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

736
00:50:06,076 --> 00:50:09,823
[SPEAKER_32]: Michael Marks, 37 Wellington Road, the great city of Method.

737
00:50:12,697 --> 00:50:25,009
[SPEAKER_32]: My initial thought is, just standing out in the audience, when many people hear about free cash, I think it's important in layman's terms to spell out exactly what free cash is.

738
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:29,032
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's an overabundance of taxpayer money.

739
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:31,102
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what free cash is.

740
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:33,783
[SPEAKER_32]: So free cash is not pulled from a cherry tree.

741
00:50:34,283 --> 00:50:36,684
[SPEAKER_32]: It is the overabundance of taxpayer money.

742
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:42,827
[SPEAKER_32]: And the reason why I bring that up, Mr. President, is being a former member of the council for 20 years.

743
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:51,112
[SPEAKER_32]: One thing I do regret, and many residents probably feel the same pain, is the water and sewer bills.

744
00:50:52,052 --> 00:51:01,440
[SPEAKER_32]: And the reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, is because so many years ago, we created a rainy day fund in the water and sewer.

745
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:04,603
[SPEAKER_32]: It's called the Water and Sewer Enterprise Account.

746
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:06,924
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not called the rainy day fund.

747
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:15,391
[SPEAKER_32]: And that fund was supposed to be, the intended purpose was supposed to be for infrastructure improvements or offset the rates.

748
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:20,003
[SPEAKER_32]: And the fund started out some many years ago with three, $400,000.

749
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:27,346
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's not a lot for a city this size, with an infrastructure that's a hundred years old, you know.

750
00:51:27,886 --> 00:51:34,169
[SPEAKER_32]: But what happened over the years, unchecked, it turned from 300,000 to 6 million.

751
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:40,091
[SPEAKER_32]: So all of a sudden now, the bills that are going out now have a little bit of padding.

752
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:40,691
[SPEAKER_32]: Why?

753
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:43,873
[SPEAKER_32]: Because it goes back into the free cash.

754
00:51:44,773 --> 00:51:49,597
[SPEAKER_32]: And before you know it, it's an end around about proposition two and a half.

755
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:53,880
[SPEAKER_32]: So you're bringing in additional revenue has nothing to do with proposition two and a half.

756
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:58,563
[SPEAKER_32]: And you're using that for purposes other than which it has been used over the years.

757
00:51:58,924 --> 00:52:08,431
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not sure if you were on the council, Mr. President at the time, maybe Mr. Scarpelli can remember for purposes non related to water and sewer, because there was that buffer.

758
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:14,555
[SPEAKER_32]: My concern about creating an additional account now is that that's also going to be unchecked.

759
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:20,478
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's going to mushroom into this large, large account of taxpayers money.

760
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:27,003
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's going to sit there until someone decides to use it on whatever project they want to use in the community.

761
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:30,006
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that's a real concern right now.

762
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:38,814
[SPEAKER_32]: And if anyone behind this railing can tell me exactly how much we have in the water and sewer enterprise surplus account now.

763
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:43,219
[SPEAKER_47]: I think last year was about 1.5 million 1.5 million.

764
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:44,800
[SPEAKER_47]: So that's just off the top of my head.

765
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,163
[SPEAKER_32]: Does the city administration know what's in the account?

766
00:52:47,994 --> 00:52:49,075
[SPEAKER_47]: I do have the chief of staff.

767
00:52:49,115 --> 00:53:00,720
[SPEAKER_47]: I do want to say that unlike Water and Sewer Enterprise, the council would be approving any allocations to the Stabilization Fund and any expenditures from the fund, whereas Water Sewer Enterprise is only through the Water Sewer Commission and not through the budget.

768
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,941
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, thank you.

769
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:07,324
[SPEAKER_47]: Madam Chief of Staff, I see your hand raised.

770
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:12,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

771
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:15,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to correct one thing that was stated.

772
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:26,233
[SPEAKER_09]: An enterprise fund is intended to essentially cover all costs that are associated with the enterprise.

773
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:43,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't disagree with some of the comments that former Councilor Marks made with regard to how the enterprise fund works, but I do want to clarify that an enterprise fund is established to be fully self-sustaining.

774
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:51,362
[SPEAKER_09]: And so any costs and any revenues that are associated with water or sewer come out of the same fund.

775
00:53:52,282 --> 00:53:52,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

776
00:53:53,823 --> 00:53:54,703
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

777
00:53:56,277 --> 00:53:56,437
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

778
00:53:56,457 --> 00:53:57,798
[SPEAKER_32]: Do we know how much is in there currently?

779
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,501
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

780
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:01,462
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comments?

781
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:03,844
[SPEAKER_32]: Do we know how much is in there currently?

782
00:54:04,985 --> 00:54:08,769
[SPEAKER_47]: Madam Chief of Staff, do you have the water sewer retained earnings off the top of your head?

783
00:54:13,413 --> 00:54:14,234
[SPEAKER_54]: Oh, sorry about that.

784
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:19,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, but I could find it in about less than a minute.

785
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:22,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So if someone would like me to find that information, I can.

786
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:22,721
[SPEAKER_32]: I am all done.

787
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:23,581
[SPEAKER_32]: Stick a fork in me, I'm all done.

788
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:35,774
[SPEAKER_32]: The one thing I do want to caution the members of the council, in particular, I hate to say new members, because we all start somewhere, right?

789
00:54:36,154 --> 00:54:38,455
[SPEAKER_32]: But the creation of a fund sounds good.

790
00:54:39,096 --> 00:54:41,337
[SPEAKER_32]: But an unchecked fund is not a good thing.

791
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:51,104
[SPEAKER_32]: And unfortunately, that's what exists in this community, whether it's water and sewer, and doesn't require council approval, or rainy day fund that does require council approval.

792
00:54:51,545 --> 00:54:52,846
[SPEAKER_32]: It's an unchecked account.

793
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:54,647
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's a problem, in my opinion.

794
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:55,728
[SPEAKER_32]: And you know,

795
00:54:57,048 --> 00:55:02,092
[SPEAKER_32]: We at the beginning was mentioned that, you know, we all have rainy day funds.

796
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:09,178
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not sure what the chief of staff makes, but let me tell you, that's not true for most people in today's society.

797
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:13,101
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't have rainy day funds that we can count on.

798
00:55:15,206 --> 00:55:23,734
[SPEAKER_32]: Most people are living paycheck to paycheck, putting their kids through school, helping family members out, whatever it might be, housing, which we're going to talk about later.

799
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:30,681
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just don't want to be too cavalier when it comes to having rainy day funds sitting around with surplus money.

800
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:31,001
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

801
00:55:37,474 --> 00:55:39,215
[SPEAKER_40]: I just, thank you, Mr. President.

802
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:41,936
[SPEAKER_40]: I just want to come full circle, just to understand.

803
00:55:41,956 --> 00:55:46,598
[SPEAKER_40]: The comments that I made earlier, I think that it's out of frustration and understanding.

804
00:55:47,058 --> 00:56:02,564
[SPEAKER_40]: As we're moving forward with initiatives that are coming forward through this council, and there are people that are questioning those initiatives, I think the biggest issue why this has blown up so much is the understanding that the questions that we all have,

805
00:56:03,948 --> 00:56:05,709
[SPEAKER_40]: Is it that we don't have enough money?

806
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:07,150
[SPEAKER_40]: Is that we're not funding it?

807
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,431
[SPEAKER_40]: Or is it that it's just being mismanaged?

808
00:56:10,271 --> 00:56:12,292
[SPEAKER_40]: Because that that is the ultimate question.

809
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:14,113
[SPEAKER_40]: I've been part of this council.

810
00:56:14,713 --> 00:56:16,294
[SPEAKER_40]: I've been part of this council for years now.

811
00:56:17,114 --> 00:56:25,078
[SPEAKER_40]: With the former mayor and the former financial director, we saw everything we watched things happen live right in front of us.

812
00:56:25,158 --> 00:56:27,219
[SPEAKER_40]: So we knew to prepare as we went forward.

813
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:31,160
[SPEAKER_40]: with, with this administration, we haven't had that luxury.

814
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:40,584
[SPEAKER_40]: So these are the issues that I feel to go full circle, like I said, this isn't to attack anybody, this isn't to say that this, this fund wouldn't be good, it wouldn't be good.

815
00:56:41,304 --> 00:56:50,328
[SPEAKER_40]: The fact that it's not transparent, and we don't truly know what the fiscal climate is, and where we stand, we just heard a school committee member

816
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:54,591
[SPEAKER_40]: Has anyone talked to you about a $2.5 million deficit in the schools?

817
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,272
[SPEAKER_40]: Because no one has.

818
00:56:55,652 --> 00:56:56,393
[SPEAKER_40]: No one's told me.

819
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:57,974
[SPEAKER_40]: But where does it have to come from?

820
00:56:58,074 --> 00:56:59,155
[SPEAKER_40]: It has to come back to us.

821
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:03,739
[SPEAKER_40]: So the mayor is going to come back to us and ask us, where are we going to approve this money, everyone?

822
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:10,485
[SPEAKER_40]: Where last year at the budget, we warned her, we begged her, please do not use these funds this way.

823
00:57:11,286 --> 00:57:14,510
[SPEAKER_40]: The ARPA funding, we looked about why is our infrastructure so bad?

824
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:19,375
[SPEAKER_40]: Do you realize that neighbor communities use millions and millions of dollars for what that was intended for?

825
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,537
[SPEAKER_40]: And that was for infrastructure needs.

826
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:26,643
[SPEAKER_40]: What we're seeing in our community, it's need to fill the gap in the ordinary budget.

827
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,586
[SPEAKER_40]: And now it's left us in big trouble.

828
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:31,748
[SPEAKER_40]: So all I'm saying is, as we're moving forward,

829
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:37,652
[SPEAKER_40]: Whether this is good or whether it's bad, whether we're voting for one thing, whether we're voting for another thing, understand something.

830
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:43,335
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't have an accurate picture to make a sound decision.

831
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:44,236
[SPEAKER_40]: It's common sense.

832
00:57:44,556 --> 00:57:46,277
[SPEAKER_40]: That's all the full circle I wanted to make.

833
00:57:46,737 --> 00:57:47,618
[SPEAKER_40]: Nothing against anybody.

834
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:50,459
[SPEAKER_40]: This isn't personal, but this is very simple.

835
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,681
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know what's going on in the budget.

836
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:53,621
[SPEAKER_40]: No one's seen anything.

837
00:57:54,102 --> 00:57:54,582
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know.

838
00:57:54,682 --> 00:57:55,462
[SPEAKER_40]: No one's talked to us.

839
00:57:55,762 --> 00:57:56,163
[SPEAKER_40]: What was the last?

840
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:57,744
[SPEAKER_40]: Have you met the financial director?

841
00:57:58,104 --> 00:57:59,485
[SPEAKER_40]: Have they come up to give us a report?

842
00:57:59,765 --> 00:58:00,725
[SPEAKER_40]: Has anybody said anything?

843
00:58:00,765 --> 00:58:01,586
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know anything.

844
00:58:02,776 --> 00:58:05,757
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know, but we know we're gonna be meeting and we know what's gonna be said.

845
00:58:06,257 --> 00:58:08,958
[SPEAKER_40]: We're gonna be in fiscal crisis in a few months.

846
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:27,902
[SPEAKER_40]: And if someone says to me, it's because we don't tax enough or we don't give enough money, we don't know that because our administration isn't transparent enough for educate us in the community to say, this is why we have a shortfall and this is why we need a tax or this is why we need that.

847
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,963
[SPEAKER_47]: So- Be careful opening that window, it might come down on you.

848
00:58:30,003 --> 00:58:30,743
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, careful with that window.

849
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:32,948
[SPEAKER_47]: Windows are from the 40s.

850
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:40,293
[SPEAKER_40]: So I don't wanna beat a dead horse, but I'm just saying, these are just common sense issues that I'm bringing up to understand.

851
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:48,938
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't truly know if this is a structural issue, if this is a mismanagement issue, or this is a lack of collecting issue.

852
00:58:48,978 --> 00:58:53,221
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't know because we're not educated and we're not given the tools to succeed.

853
00:58:53,841 --> 00:59:00,906
[SPEAKER_40]: So that's why I think it's a slippery slope for this council to keep moving forward initiatives and truly not understanding our fiscal picture.

854
00:59:01,286 --> 00:59:01,786
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you.

855
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:04,768
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli name and address for the record.

856
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:14,552
[SPEAKER_65]: Lynn Fried is 26 turns out I just have one question.

[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's a way to table this and move on, but personally, as just since we're talking about an economic issue, I've paid a babysitter so that I can be here tonight.

[SPEAKER_47]: 23-369, 96-104 Winchester Street, Planned Development District 1, Planned Development Special Permit and Site Plan Review.

910
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:10,553
[SPEAKER_47]: The subject property known as 100 Winchester Street is comprised of an assemblage of parcels located at 96-104 Winchester Street on the Medford-Somerville Line near the Ball Square MBTA Green Line Station.

911
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:14,994
[SPEAKER_47]: The site contains commercial light industrial buildings along with historically significant structure.

912
01:04:15,494 --> 01:04:18,495
[SPEAKER_47]: The applicant has proposed to redevelop the site in accordance with plan development.

913
01:04:18,575 --> 01:04:25,578
[SPEAKER_47]: Winchester Street Plan Development District 1, approved by the City Council August 15, 2023, for mixed-use development consisting of two structures.

914
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:41,440
[SPEAKER_47]: After considering the submitted materials, presentations from the applicant team, recommendations from city staff, and public comment received at and in advance of the public hearing, the board found that, as conditioned, the proposal met the required criteria and voted five to zero to recommend approval of the site plan and plan development special permit.

915
01:04:42,902 --> 01:04:48,267
[SPEAKER_47]: Whereas this is a public hearing, we will hear from the applicant, and then I will open the public hearing for public comment.

916
01:04:49,048 --> 01:04:50,449
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

917
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:51,150
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

918
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,132
[SPEAKER_37]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

919
01:04:53,432 --> 01:05:02,762
[SPEAKER_37]: My name is Adam Barnosky, 255 State Street in Boston, an attorney on behalf of the applicant 96-102 Winchester Street.

920
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:08,347
[SPEAKER_37]: With me tonight are the developers, Steve and Gerald Nardone, project architect Peter Quinn,

921
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:14,570
[SPEAKER_37]: engineer and traffic consultant, Steve Sawyer, and on Zoom is landscape architect Kata Pizzolo.

922
01:05:15,491 --> 01:05:29,137
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a project for a new 65-unit residential building with below-grade parking to include an accessory 4,000-square-foot commercial building with a community pocket park with easement rights granted to the city.

923
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:36,420
[SPEAKER_37]: As you'll recall, this project was before the City Council last year as part of a planned development district for the site.

924
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,902
[SPEAKER_37]: which was created pursuant to Section 9.2 of the Zoning Ordinance.

925
01:05:40,742 --> 01:05:51,128
[SPEAKER_37]: The PDD was approved by the City Council and codified as Section 94-9.2A of the Zoning Ordinance, which is now known as the Winchester Street Plan Development District.

926
01:05:51,689 --> 01:05:56,171
[SPEAKER_37]: I will try to make my remarks brief in light of your full agenda this evening.

927
01:05:57,512 --> 01:06:03,597
[SPEAKER_37]: The project as will be presented before you this evening is a by right project in terms of use and dimensional requirements.

928
01:06:03,637 --> 01:06:07,019
[SPEAKER_37]: It does require a PDD special permit from this board.

929
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:18,689
[SPEAKER_37]: The application materials provide to the board do include in significant detail, the reason why we believe this project meets all the requirements under the PDD special permit, so we can

930
01:06:19,629 --> 01:06:21,391
[SPEAKER_37]: incorporate those by reference here tonight.

931
01:06:22,252 --> 01:06:24,014
[SPEAKER_37]: We are very excited about the project.

932
01:06:24,455 --> 01:06:35,366
[SPEAKER_37]: We've been meeting with folks from the city for the last two years, the planning department and seeking public input, and we're very excited for the project that is before the city council this evening.

933
01:06:36,257 --> 01:06:46,269
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'll provide a brief overview of the project and then Peter Quinn can go through the renderings and then engineering and landscaping is available for any questions that the council might have.

934
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:52,836
[SPEAKER_37]: So first about the property it's located on the southern portion of Winchester Street do we from ball square T stop.

935
01:06:53,417 --> 01:06:55,660
[SPEAKER_37]: It consists of three lots measuring just under 50,000 square feet.

936
01:06:58,171 --> 01:07:05,137
[SPEAKER_37]: The two lots located at 96-102 Winchester Street are contiguous through lots with frontage on Winchester and Alfred Street.

937
01:07:05,637 --> 01:07:11,162
[SPEAKER_37]: They've been used for many years as a commercial space for offices, garaging, and outdoor vehicle storage.

938
01:07:11,963 --> 01:07:16,487
[SPEAKER_37]: The lot located at 104 Winchester is a corner lot with frontage on Winchester and Albion Streets.

939
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:23,312
[SPEAKER_37]: It's improved with a two-story residence that's been deemed preferably preserved by the Medford Historical Commission.

940
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:30,615
[SPEAKER_37]: The site is mostly located in the G1, but also a small portion is located in the C1 zoning district.

941
01:07:31,636 --> 01:07:41,379
[SPEAKER_37]: The development is going to consist of four stories, 65 units of residential with below grade parking, a two story 4,000 square foot commercial building, as I mentioned, a community pocket park.

942
01:07:43,635 --> 01:07:59,668
[SPEAKER_37]: The proposed developer would raise the existing structures, and there will be 46 one bedroom units 19 two bedroom units with 15% affordable 51 parking spaces below grade 56 long term bicycle parking spaces rooftop solar arrays.

943
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:06,231
[SPEAKER_37]: The project originally included a roof deck that was included in the original materials before the council.

944
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:17,815
[SPEAKER_37]: After the Community Development Board hearing, there was one member in an abutting parcel that did not like the idea of this roof deck, and the developers responded by removing it altogether.

945
01:08:18,336 --> 01:08:24,278
[SPEAKER_37]: We have provided the updated plans to the board through Daniel Evans, the Community Development Board.

946
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:32,579
[SPEAKER_37]: The existing historic structure at 104 Winchester will be fully restored, and a new addition will be added to the rear to form an L-shaped building.

947
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,200
[SPEAKER_37]: This will be the one commercial portion of the project.

948
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:41,021
[SPEAKER_37]: It's going to be intended to be used as a daycare, office, or gym.

949
01:08:41,581 --> 01:08:53,203
[SPEAKER_37]: Input during the community process indicated that daycare seems to be the preferred use, and so we're having discussions both with the city and others about developing that use if it's approved.

950
01:08:54,614 --> 01:08:58,920
[SPEAKER_37]: So we do believe that this meets the requirements for the special for the special permit.

951
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:11,797
[SPEAKER_37]: One thing that's one thing I think the council will find that's easy in in approving this versus another PDD is that the development that's before you today is identical or nearly identical to the one that was before the council when the PDD was approved.

952
01:09:12,117 --> 01:09:13,778
[SPEAKER_37]: So there is some familiarity with that.

953
01:09:14,678 --> 01:09:24,302
[SPEAKER_37]: And just on the conversation of dollars and cents, the proposal we anticipate will increase the tax revenues to the town 10 times versus what's there now.

954
01:09:24,362 --> 01:09:25,723
[SPEAKER_37]: It's $18,000 a year now.

955
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:34,847
[SPEAKER_37]: We would anticipate based on other developments in the community that there'd probably be around approximately $175,000 of additional tax revenue as part of this development.

956
01:09:35,327 --> 01:09:42,869
[SPEAKER_37]: With that, we're happy to answer any questions that this council might have, and I would ask that Mr. Quinn provide an overview of the renderings.

957
01:09:42,989 --> 01:09:43,309
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

958
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:56,013
[SPEAKER_47]: As you noted, the council did approve the plan development district one zone unanimously last summer, and the Community Development Board has unanimously recommended approval of the site plan and a special permit with conditions.

959
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:00,421
[SPEAKER_47]: At this point, we do have a meeting ahead of us.

960
01:10:01,182 --> 01:10:07,867
[SPEAKER_47]: I would ask councilors if they would like to see the presentation of Mr. Quinn, or if they have any questions for the proponents at this time.

961
01:10:09,709 --> 01:10:10,630
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Lazzaro.

962
01:10:12,912 --> 01:10:15,714
[SPEAKER_30]: Forgive me, I'm a new councilor, so I didn't see the previous.

963
01:10:15,734 --> 01:10:19,897
[SPEAKER_47]: If we could just please keep the chatter down, it's hard for us to conduct business with the chatter.

964
01:10:21,299 --> 01:10:22,800
[SPEAKER_47]: You can take conversations into the hall.

965
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:35,767
[SPEAKER_30]: I wasn't part of the previous conversations about this, so forgive me if you've already answered some of these questions, but what is the mechanism for making sure that it's a specific business on the first floor?

966
01:10:35,867 --> 01:10:37,728
[SPEAKER_30]: Are you able to verify that?

967
01:10:37,848 --> 01:10:40,710
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm sorry, but if you're going to have conversations, please take them into the hall.

968
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:43,872
[SPEAKER_47]: It's a public meeting.

969
01:10:45,493 --> 01:10:47,895
[SPEAKER_47]: And if you could shut off the alarm, whoever's alarm that is.

970
01:10:50,687 --> 01:10:54,371
[SPEAKER_30]: How are you able to verify who, what businesses come in?

971
01:10:54,831 --> 01:11:01,136
[SPEAKER_30]: Is it definitely a daycare or is it preference for a daycare or is it daycare office gem exclusively?

972
01:11:01,176 --> 01:11:02,257
[SPEAKER_30]: If you can speak to that a little bit.

973
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:02,477
[SPEAKER_37]: Sure.

974
01:11:02,678 --> 01:11:04,359
[SPEAKER_37]: There seems to be a preference for a daycare.

975
01:11:04,379 --> 01:11:07,742
[SPEAKER_37]: Of course, this project would probably be two years out, so they'd have to secure a tenant.

976
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:16,910
[SPEAKER_37]: As part of the PDD approval process, there was a list of approved uses that are allowed by right in the zoning district, so those will control what is allowed there.

977
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:21,732
[SPEAKER_37]: And so certainly one of the businesses would be in conformity with those uses.

978
01:11:21,812 --> 01:11:25,693
[SPEAKER_37]: Otherwise we would need to go before the zoning board for a use variance.

979
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:26,454
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

980
01:11:26,594 --> 01:11:34,057
[SPEAKER_30]: My only thought would be like a distinct preference for a business versus no business.

981
01:11:34,717 --> 01:11:35,417
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you know what I mean?

982
01:11:35,477 --> 01:11:35,677
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

983
01:11:36,618 --> 01:11:38,698
[SPEAKER_30]: Otherwise I think this looks great.

984
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:41,079
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

985
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:42,700
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comments by members of the council?

986
01:11:44,141 --> 01:11:44,901
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Tseng.

987
01:11:45,461 --> 01:11:45,842
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

988
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:49,583
[SPEAKER_43]: On the former council, I've heard this project before.

989
01:11:49,623 --> 01:11:51,283
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm particularly excited about it.

990
01:11:51,363 --> 01:11:55,705
[SPEAKER_43]: I think it'll bring a lot of life, business, housing to an area where we really need it.

991
01:11:57,465 --> 01:12:04,007
[SPEAKER_43]: I just have two small notes about it after talking to some city staff who've been working with you all about it.

992
01:12:04,307 --> 01:12:10,249
[SPEAKER_43]: There's a duplicate in the document and the small condition that I'd like to put in.

993
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:12,250
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'd like, Mr. President, I'd like to

994
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:33,846
[SPEAKER_43]: motion to approve the special permit and site plan as revised with the conditions recommended by this community development board, and add in two amendments, one to strike point 12, which is a duplicate of point nine in the plan.

995
01:12:35,493 --> 01:12:39,599
[SPEAKER_47]: And the second condition is... Condition nine of the community development board recommendations.

996
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:40,741
[SPEAKER_43]: Either nine or 12.

997
01:12:40,781 --> 01:12:42,183
[SPEAKER_43]: Condition 12, okay.

998
01:12:43,204 --> 01:12:51,135
[SPEAKER_43]: And then the second condition is to add this following wording, which I can get to the city clerk if that works.

999
01:12:52,137 --> 01:13:08,212
[SPEAKER_43]: residents of the new building will be restricted from obtaining city of Method residential street parking permits ensure that on street parking capacity is not impacted by the development which is intended to attract residents with lower rates of car ownership, as it is approximately one block from Paul square MBTA Green Line station.

1000
01:13:08,392 --> 01:13:14,017
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng before we entertain that motion I do have to open the public hearing so do we have any further questions for the proponent Council

1001
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:16,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1002
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:29,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I know that on that lot right now, there are a lot of wonderful tall trees that block the busy Broadway street from those other streets that are a little bit further in.

1003
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:38,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you talk a little bit about the proposed green space and whether there will continue to be trees there or be new trees planted, aside from the pocket park?

1004
01:13:39,476 --> 01:13:40,037
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, thank you.

1005
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:43,239
[SPEAKER_37]: And is Katya available on Zoom to discuss that question?

1006
01:13:44,565 --> 01:13:45,786
[SPEAKER_47]: Is that verdant landscape?

1007
01:13:45,886 --> 01:13:46,566
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, yes.

1008
01:13:49,788 --> 01:13:50,728
[SPEAKER_71]: Hi, thank you very much.

1009
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:54,831
[SPEAKER_71]: My name is Katia Pistadlo, principal at Verdant Landscape Architecture.

1010
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:02,595
[SPEAKER_71]: And I believe you're speaking about the Alfred Street side of the project where there are a group of trees along the back of sidewalk.

1011
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:03,275
[SPEAKER_71]: Is that correct?

1012
01:14:04,676 --> 01:14:07,057
[SPEAKER_71]: Yes, that's a good sign to go to.

1013
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,218
[SPEAKER_08]: They're quite lovely and tall.

1014
01:14:09,161 --> 01:14:14,204
[SPEAKER_71]: Yeah, so there are a few there that are invasive and a little bit maybe top heavy.

1015
01:14:15,225 --> 01:14:19,367
[SPEAKER_71]: And due to the construction activities, there will need to be some removal of the trees.

1016
01:14:19,908 --> 01:14:23,790
[SPEAKER_71]: But you see the light green circles here along the back of sidewalk that are shown.

1017
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:30,795
[SPEAKER_71]: We are proposing to protect and preserve several of those larger trees along that edge.

1018
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,597
[SPEAKER_71]: So some of that greenery will remain.

1019
01:14:34,857 --> 01:14:46,623
[SPEAKER_71]: and we're planting additional, you know, more shade trees and smaller understory trees and shrubs along that edge as well to reestablish additional, you know, canopy and growth.

1020
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:51,205
Thank you.

1021
01:14:51,965 --> 01:14:52,466
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1022
01:14:52,586 --> 01:14:56,408
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further questions by members of the Council for the proponent before I open the public hearing?

1023
01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:01,150
[SPEAKER_47]: Seeing none, I'm going to open the public hearing.

1024
01:15:03,117 --> 01:15:08,440
[SPEAKER_47]: public hearing is open to anyone in favor, opposed, or otherwise wanting to comment on the project.

1025
01:15:09,441 --> 01:15:10,961
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1026
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,743
[SPEAKER_01]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1027
01:15:13,763 --> 01:15:18,205
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about fairly large housing development near a trade station.

1028
01:15:19,186 --> 01:15:25,149
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good idea, and it's consistent with the spirit of the Bipartisan MBTA Communities Act passed under Governor Baker.

1029
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly support the project and hope you will pass it.

1030
01:15:27,971 --> 01:15:28,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1031
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:29,252
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1032
01:15:30,032 --> 01:15:31,233
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1033
01:15:32,664 --> 01:15:37,028
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm at 92 Winchester Street, Medford.

1034
01:15:37,268 --> 01:15:39,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are 52 people going to park?

1035
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:46,336
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's only parking for 50 cars, 65 units plus commercial businesses.

1036
01:15:47,437 --> 01:15:53,502
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been next door to Nardone since 1990, and he hasn't been a very good neighbor.

1037
01:15:54,212 --> 01:15:54,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Period.

1038
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:58,655
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been running a muck over there for 30 plus years.

1039
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:03,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody's going to check on him, like the Councilman says.

1040
01:16:03,777 --> 01:16:04,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody checks.

1041
01:16:05,278 --> 01:16:11,922
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's people been living in there, in the commercial units, leaving their debris out the street that I pick up.

1042
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:18,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I get a call from the building department in Medford saying that Steve Nardone said it was my stuff.

1043
01:16:18,746 --> 01:16:20,307
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would go ahead and pick it up.

1044
01:16:20,987 --> 01:16:23,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Because whatever he says must be true.

1045
01:16:23,928 --> 01:16:26,850
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm concerned about what goes on over there.

1046
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:35,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Four story building going to block all the sunlight out from my house, my property, I'm the largest provider over there.

1047
01:16:36,774 --> 01:16:38,835
[SPEAKER_15]: So I am very concerned what's going on.

1048
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,756
[SPEAKER_15]: He doesn't tell the truth any whatsoever.

1049
01:16:42,136 --> 01:16:45,478
[SPEAKER_15]: So if they say to commercial businesses, there'll be five in there.

1050
01:16:47,494 --> 01:16:54,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody checks on him, so he does what he pleases, especially in that area of Medford on the Somerville line.

1051
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:56,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody goes over there, so nobody checks.

1052
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:06,500
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would be against having that building built next to me, 65 units with parking for 50 cars.

1053
01:17:09,474 --> 01:17:14,497
[SPEAKER_15]: with 50 cars gonna park plus a daycare people how many how many people are going to be in the daycare?

1054
01:17:14,517 --> 01:17:16,098
[SPEAKER_15]: How many children are going to be in there?

1055
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:19,260
[SPEAKER_15]: How many parents are going to drop their cars off every morning?

1056
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are they going to park if there's inadequate parking there already?

1057
01:17:24,283 --> 01:17:24,763
[SPEAKER_15]: We're a fit?

1058
01:17:24,824 --> 01:17:26,304
[SPEAKER_15]: We're 25 parents?

1059
01:17:26,344 --> 01:17:33,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are they going to park every morning, and then pick them up every night, five, six o'clock, four, four to six?

1060
01:17:33,489 --> 01:17:34,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are they going to pick the people up?

1061
01:17:37,148 --> 01:17:38,209
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you for your comment.

1062
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:41,291
[SPEAKER_47]: We can ask the proponent if they'd like to answer any of your questions.

1063
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:42,291
[SPEAKER_15]: I would be against it 100%.

1064
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:44,152
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1065
01:17:44,392 --> 01:17:44,873
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

1066
01:17:46,554 --> 01:17:51,177
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comment by members of the public or would the proponent like to respond to any of those comments?

1067
01:17:51,197 --> 01:17:51,737
[SPEAKER_47]: It's up to you.

1068
01:17:59,797 --> 01:18:05,061
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just briefly that the parking is consistent with the PDD overlay.

1069
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:16,027
[SPEAKER_37]: The 51 is for the 65, but we also anticipate, and as part of this development, the close proximity to mass transit.

1070
01:18:16,548 --> 01:18:17,468
[SPEAKER_37]: It's 0.1 miles from the

1071
01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:23,311
[SPEAKER_37]: the T stop there, and we anticipate that not all people who live there will have cars.

1072
01:18:23,551 --> 01:18:26,232
[SPEAKER_37]: We also have sufficient amounts of bike parking as well.

1073
01:18:26,572 --> 01:18:29,393
[SPEAKER_37]: So that was all anticipated in the development of the project.

1074
01:18:29,553 --> 01:18:29,793
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1075
01:18:30,013 --> 01:18:36,855
[SPEAKER_47]: And the condition that Councilor Tseng mentioned regarding no off street parking permits, is that, do you have any, is that amenable to you?

1076
01:18:37,695 --> 01:18:39,476
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I believe that that's amenable.

1077
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:40,236
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, great.

1078
01:18:41,197 --> 01:18:42,537
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comment on the project?

1079
01:18:44,758 --> 01:18:46,718
[SPEAKER_47]: Just one quick question, don't run away.

1080
01:18:46,758 --> 01:18:47,279
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address.

1081
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:53,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Castagnetti Cushman Street.

1082
01:18:55,666 --> 01:19:10,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Normally, if I recollect from 10-20 years ago, the condo ordinance or laws to develop condominium complexes requirement was 2.5 parking spaces per condominium.

1083
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:14,550
[SPEAKER_13]: However, that's changed, especially when you have transportation nearby.

1084
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:16,671
[SPEAKER_13]: My question would be simply,

1085
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:24,041
[SPEAKER_13]: How many parking spots or partial parking spots would you have per condominium?

1086
01:19:25,622 --> 01:19:27,243
[SPEAKER_47]: Would the proponent like to answer the question?

1087
01:19:28,804 --> 01:19:29,325
[SPEAKER_47]: It's up to you.

1088
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:34,468
[SPEAKER_47]: It's an apartment building, right?

1089
01:19:34,568 --> 01:19:38,911
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know that they've determined whether it's apartments or condos, but the ratio is 0.8.

1090
01:19:39,612 --> 01:19:40,752
[SPEAKER_37]: It's 0.8 per unit.

1091
01:19:40,973 --> 01:19:41,173
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1092
01:19:41,733 --> 01:19:42,073
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1093
01:19:43,554 --> 01:19:44,495
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comment?

1094
01:19:44,535 --> 01:19:44,715
[SPEAKER_47]: Right.

1095
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:50,631
[SPEAKER_53]: Any further comment?

1096
01:19:50,671 --> 01:19:52,133
[SPEAKER_53]: Oh, I can't see.

1097
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,200
[SPEAKER_54]: Go ahead.

1098
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,003
[SPEAKER_19]: John Lodato 9 Wareham Street, this development is right around the block from me it's the first I'm actually getting to see it.

1099
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:13,866
[SPEAKER_19]: From what I understand they don't know if it's a condo development or a rental.

1100
01:20:13,886 --> 01:20:21,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that correct, is that, is that going to affect what can go where the commercial location is, where if someone purchases it.

1101
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,431
[SPEAKER_19]: versus renting it?

1102
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:29,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Will they be able to put a restaurant there, bringing in more traffic on the side streets and stuff like that?

1103
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:32,056
[SPEAKER_19]: Because this is not on Broadway.

1104
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:36,078
[SPEAKER_19]: It's on Winchester Street and Albion Street.

1105
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:42,442
[SPEAKER_19]: So my concern is, I'm cool with a daycare, but what if they don't sell it to a daycare?

1106
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:43,743
[SPEAKER_19]: What if they sell it to somebody else?

1107
01:20:44,503 --> 01:20:47,265
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, what are the restrictions on that?

1108
01:20:47,445 --> 01:20:50,907
[SPEAKER_47]: The proponent can correct me, but I do not believe restaurant isn't allowed to use in the planned development.

1109
01:20:50,927 --> 01:20:52,367
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one of the things that is not allowed?

1110
01:20:52,387 --> 01:20:52,968
[SPEAKER_47]: It's not allowed.

1111
01:20:53,028 --> 01:20:56,089
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, and does any of this sit on Somerville's property or is it 100%?

1112
01:20:56,169 --> 01:20:57,770
[SPEAKER_47]: It's all in Medford, I believe.

1113
01:20:57,970 --> 01:20:58,751
[SPEAKER_19]: It is, okay.

1114
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,613
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to know if it's a condo development or a rental property.

1115
01:21:02,653 --> 01:21:05,114
[SPEAKER_47]: The proponent just answered that they haven't made that choice yet.

1116
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,656
[SPEAKER_19]: Shouldn't that choice be made prior to approval?

1117
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,377
[SPEAKER_47]: It's not required.

1118
01:21:10,637 --> 01:21:11,037
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not?

1119
01:21:11,277 --> 01:21:11,458
[SPEAKER_47]: No.

1120
01:21:11,778 --> 01:21:12,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1121
01:21:17,728 --> 01:21:21,709
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, I'm going to go to Greg Farber on Zoom.

1122
01:21:21,749 --> 01:21:22,429
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to alternate.

1123
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:23,649
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to go to Zoom first.

1124
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:27,810
[SPEAKER_47]: Greg, name and address for the record, please.

1125
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,591
[SPEAKER_72]: It's actually my name is Tracy Clements.

1126
01:21:30,671 --> 01:21:32,251
[SPEAKER_72]: I live at 28 Alfred Street.

1127
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:37,752
[SPEAKER_72]: So this is the first I'm really seeing of the plans and they do look nice.

1128
01:21:37,912 --> 01:21:40,673
[SPEAKER_72]: And I want one thing clarified.

1129
01:21:40,733 --> 01:21:41,733
[SPEAKER_72]: Actually, I read through the

1130
01:21:42,918 --> 01:21:49,903
[SPEAKER_72]: project proposal this afternoon, and it did not have a prohibition on the parking that Justin just brought up.

1131
01:21:49,983 --> 01:21:52,345
[SPEAKER_72]: So was that something that was recently added?

1132
01:21:52,425 --> 01:21:59,390
[SPEAKER_72]: Because I did have a conversation with Danielle Evans and Todd Blake about it, and I don't know if that was something that was added, but it was not in those 12 points.

1133
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:01,471
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, that's being added tonight.

1134
01:22:01,912 --> 01:22:02,352
[SPEAKER_72]: Okay, great.

1135
01:22:02,492 --> 01:22:04,353
[SPEAKER_72]: And then about the parking,

1136
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:09,852
[SPEAKER_72]: So there's 51 spaces below 65 stories.

1137
01:22:09,872 --> 01:22:15,834
[SPEAKER_72]: I know your people in your administration have said they hope that the people that buy these will not have cars.

1138
01:22:15,975 --> 01:22:17,175
[SPEAKER_72]: That's not the reality.

1139
01:22:17,195 --> 01:22:22,077
[SPEAKER_72]: A lot of people are concerned about the fact that there's going to be no parking for the people who already live here.

1140
01:22:22,257 --> 01:22:26,299
[SPEAKER_72]: And now you're going to add maybe 30 more cars to our street.

1141
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:34,723
[SPEAKER_72]: So take that into consideration when you're finalizing all of this, as well as traffic calming, which no one's really brought up.

1142
01:22:35,379 --> 01:22:46,087
[SPEAKER_72]: There's one speed hump proposed that is down by Morton and Granville which is going to make no difference if any city councilor wants to come and sit on the street or the lawyer or the developer.

1143
01:22:46,308 --> 01:22:49,410
[SPEAKER_72]: People drive down Winchester Street at 65 miles an hour.

1144
01:22:50,071 --> 01:22:52,292
[SPEAKER_72]: One speed hump is not going to calm the traffic.

1145
01:22:52,452 --> 01:22:57,877
[SPEAKER_72]: I think you need to please reconsider and putting one Morton and Granville, Newbern and Morton, Marion,

1146
01:22:59,028 --> 01:23:22,158
[SPEAKER_72]: but please be smart about the traffic calming because people have been nearly hit by cars around here and now you're adding a ton more people who may or may not have cars you're going to get people really upset with the fact if there is a daycare there's pick up and drop off there's the traffic bump out that's on broadway that's on winchester that it's already a cluster when you're trying to get out in the morning so i just i want to bring those points up there was

1147
01:23:22,881 --> 01:23:33,688
[SPEAKER_72]: consideration for visibility concerns, which I appreciate just lines though, that are painted on the ground are not going to prohibit people from, from parking there because there's going to be a lack of parking.

1148
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:44,515
[SPEAKER_72]: Um, so if there's something physical that you could put in there or get an exception for insert at those visibility spots, I mean, that's something that I would hope that you could take into consideration.

1149
01:23:44,535 --> 01:23:47,977
[SPEAKER_72]: Um, and I think that's all I really had.

1150
01:23:48,655 --> 01:23:50,235
[SPEAKER_72]: So anyway, the project looks nice.

1151
01:23:50,295 --> 01:24:00,798
[SPEAKER_72]: I think it'll like make the area look nicer There is concern for like taking away the trees in the daylight But just you're and also by the way people that drive the t they come and park here on our streets.

1152
01:24:00,838 --> 01:24:13,222
[SPEAKER_72]: There's no parking enforcement There's like probably 25 people that come in the mornings that I see park their cars On these side streets and walk to the t so I know that there's the zoning thing coming up for that but

1153
01:24:13,979 --> 01:24:17,705
[SPEAKER_72]: I feel like that really needs to be policed because you're gonna, that's a real problem around here.

1154
01:24:18,105 --> 01:24:23,033
[SPEAKER_72]: And in two years when this is built an extra 50 or 60 cars, that's it.

1155
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:24,435
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1156
01:24:24,455 --> 01:24:27,320
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1157
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:32,020
[SPEAKER_66]: Angela Murphy 16 Carding Street, I just want to bring up an issue.

1158
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:40,485
[SPEAKER_66]: I've been here before talking about the proposed project for walking court, and we discussed the lack of parking for them sufficient parking.

1159
01:24:41,026 --> 01:24:53,594
[SPEAKER_66]: Well recently, it has been told to me by my son who have noticed cars parked on residence street, but walking court packing stickers on them, but yet we cannot pack there.

1160
01:24:54,054 --> 01:24:57,557
[SPEAKER_66]: So, the proposal that made for that project would increase

1161
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:00,900
[SPEAKER_66]: residents and probably cars.

1162
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:08,506
[SPEAKER_66]: So this proposal is going to have lack of parking for those vehicles, no matter what they say, it's not going to be feasible.

1163
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:09,888
[SPEAKER_66]: Thank you.

1164
01:25:10,628 --> 01:25:11,149
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1165
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:18,495
[SPEAKER_47]: make mark Martha and Fran please just give me your full name in the chat and I'll unmute you on zoom.

1166
01:25:18,916 --> 01:25:20,477
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to Alex lesson hop on zoom.

1167
01:25:31,846 --> 01:25:32,907
[SPEAKER_47]: Alex, I'm unmuting you.

1168
01:25:34,667 --> 01:25:35,988
[SPEAKER_73]: Sorry, sorry, sorry about that.

1169
01:25:36,248 --> 01:25:38,069
[SPEAKER_73]: Sorry, my child muted me.

1170
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:40,370
[SPEAKER_73]: Alex Losanoff, 30 Wright Ave.

1171
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:43,832
[SPEAKER_73]: I just want to say that this looks like a great project.

1172
01:25:44,292 --> 01:25:47,394
[SPEAKER_73]: Echoing William's comments from earlier, it's a fantastic location.

1173
01:25:48,074 --> 01:25:55,018
[SPEAKER_73]: It's near the train station, and I'm strongly in support of it, and I encourage you to approve it.

1174
01:25:55,138 --> 01:25:55,378
[SPEAKER_73]: Thank you.

1175
01:25:57,108 --> 01:25:57,828
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Alex.

1176
01:25:58,769 --> 01:26:01,230
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comment from people in the chamber?

1177
01:26:04,052 --> 01:26:06,433
[SPEAKER_47]: Fran, I see you've come on video, so I'll unmute you.

1178
01:26:07,714 --> 01:26:09,715
[SPEAKER_47]: Fran, name and address for the record, please.

1179
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:16,258
[SPEAKER_47]: We can't hear you.

1180
01:26:16,278 --> 01:26:17,479
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm asking you to unmute.

1181
01:26:18,266 --> 01:26:20,168
[SPEAKER_46]: Sorry, my name is Francis Obola.

1182
01:26:20,829 --> 01:26:21,369
[SPEAKER_46]: Can you hear me now?

1183
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:22,671
[SPEAKER_47]: We can hear you.

1184
01:26:23,491 --> 01:26:25,033
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm sorry, Francis Obola.

1185
01:26:25,073 --> 01:26:28,036
[SPEAKER_46]: I live at 9 Alfred Street, Method Mass, my whole life.

1186
01:26:28,336 --> 01:26:30,959
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm abutted right next to the property.

1187
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:37,505
[SPEAKER_46]: I just had a couple questions regarding the storm drains for that large building.

1188
01:26:38,545 --> 01:26:47,993
[SPEAKER_46]: It was my understanding, and I was told that they're not using a storm drain for that whole building, they're gonna build like a drywall system.

1189
01:26:49,894 --> 01:26:52,256
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm all for the environment, I'm not opposing it.

1190
01:26:53,277 --> 01:27:00,883
[SPEAKER_46]: I just like to let you know, I've had experience in drains for 12 years, working for Drain Doctor, I've worked at MIT, Harvard.

1191
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:06,947
[SPEAKER_46]: Those systems work great that they wanna put in, but it's all based on,

1192
01:27:08,048 --> 01:27:09,549
[SPEAKER_46]: the water table of the area.

1193
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:25,482
[SPEAKER_46]: And all I'm concerned about is, as I've seen it happen in a lot of cases, is it gets oversaturated, and it doesn't have, when it's totally full, it has nowhere to go, and it just ends up going into the ground.

1194
01:27:26,062 --> 01:27:33,508
[SPEAKER_46]: And since I'm the lowest house directly next to it, I'm just concerned of me having rainwater coming in

1195
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:39,438
[SPEAKER_46]: in my home with the oversaturation of water since it's not yielding a storm drain.

1196
01:27:39,999 --> 01:27:45,289
[SPEAKER_46]: And one more question is, is there an overflow system in what they're proposing to put in?

1197
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:48,570
[SPEAKER_46]: It's a great system.

1198
01:27:49,351 --> 01:27:52,273
[SPEAKER_46]: I've seen it work, and I've seen the biggest nightmares.

1199
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:56,777
[SPEAKER_46]: I've seen four feet of water and concrete buildings from the system being installed.

1200
01:27:56,817 --> 01:28:00,801
[SPEAKER_46]: So I'm just concerned that my home may be affected.

1201
01:28:01,461 --> 01:28:08,707
[SPEAKER_46]: And I just wanted to be noted for the record that I would like more information on this so I feel a little more comfortable.

1202
01:28:10,068 --> 01:28:20,692
[SPEAKER_46]: understanding exactly how the system works when it's overwhelmed and the water table's high and it does not work when the water table's high, because it's all based on the water table.

1203
01:28:21,232 --> 01:28:23,132
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, everybody, for your time.

1204
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,633
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Mr. Avola.

1205
01:28:24,653 --> 01:28:26,853
[SPEAKER_47]: Do you have some information on the drainage and water?

1206
01:28:27,194 --> 01:28:31,175
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Steve Soria with GM2, I'm the PE design engineer.

1207
01:28:32,103 --> 01:28:50,508
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, so this system, I've designed many of these, and we are infiltrating into the, using large concrete chambers, and they're actually located between the building and Winchester Street, so they're far away, actually quite a distance away from Albion and the abutter.

1208
01:28:51,028 --> 01:28:56,670
[SPEAKER_23]: And we also, we do have an overflow, so what we use these tanks for is to

1209
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:04,045
[SPEAKER_23]: infiltrate for water quality as required by the city for phosphorus removal and such.

1210
01:29:04,546 --> 01:29:12,472
[SPEAKER_23]: And then that's just the bottom, probably third of the chambers, the top, bottom third is where the overflow is located.

1211
01:29:12,912 --> 01:29:20,017
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the remainder of the chamber is just used to mitigate the rate that we put into the city system.

1212
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:23,220
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's sort of a twofold approach where

1213
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:32,324
[SPEAKER_23]: We hold an infiltrate for water quality, and then we reduce the rate to the city system to help alleviate the demand on the municipal system.

1214
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:48,012
[SPEAKER_23]: And we did provide drainage calculations, and as part of the conditions, we'll be updating the drainage calcs and the design with prior to the building permit, the city engineer will be reviewing the design.

1215
01:29:48,493 --> 01:29:48,913
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1216
01:29:49,073 --> 01:29:50,274
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, thank you.

1217
01:29:50,834 --> 01:29:52,675
[SPEAKER_46]: Can I just ask one more thing?

1218
01:29:54,261 --> 01:29:56,082
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, Mr. Vola, if you have one more follow up.

1219
01:29:56,263 --> 01:29:56,543
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

1220
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:00,386
[SPEAKER_46]: So it was my so I live on Alfred Street.

1221
01:30:01,006 --> 01:30:06,070
[SPEAKER_46]: I thought that that was going to be placed on Alfred Street side.

1222
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,212
[SPEAKER_46]: So maybe I was misinformed.

1223
01:30:08,652 --> 01:30:14,777
[SPEAKER_46]: But so you're saying to me that all that water filtration system is going to be on the Winchester side, correct?

1224
01:30:14,817 --> 01:30:18,980
[SPEAKER_46]: And going out to the storm drain to the Winchester side?

1225
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:19,501
[SPEAKER_46]: Is that correct?

1226
01:30:21,024 --> 01:30:30,068
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so probably 90% of the entire building roof and the access drive into the garage will all be directed to Winchester Street.

1227
01:30:30,448 --> 01:30:37,311
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a very small, small area, a very small area on the Alfred Street side.

1228
01:30:37,491 --> 01:30:42,173
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see there's a, actually, it's a very small plastic, one of those smaller plastic chambers.

1229
01:30:43,793 --> 01:30:44,974
[SPEAKER_23]: But, yeah.

1230
01:30:45,854 --> 01:30:52,944
[SPEAKER_23]: we're actually directing more water away from Alfred and then tying into the city system.

1231
01:30:52,984 --> 01:31:02,577
[SPEAKER_23]: So as far as if you divided the site up, we're actually diverting more water away from the Alfred Street side.

1232
01:31:03,689 --> 01:31:12,096
[SPEAKER_46]: Is that system also gonna pump back into the Alfred Street storm when it's, has too much water in it?

1233
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:19,902
[SPEAKER_46]: Is it gonna have the same concept as putting the drain out of the storm drain?

1234
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:26,867
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no designated drain line in Alfred Street, so we cannot connect, do any direct connections to the city sewer.

1235
01:31:28,109 --> 01:31:32,471
[SPEAKER_23]: As I said, probably 90% of the site is being directed to Winchester Street.

1236
01:31:33,012 --> 01:31:36,254
[SPEAKER_23]: So the flow onto Alfred Street is greatly diminished.

1237
01:31:37,334 --> 01:31:42,397
[SPEAKER_46]: So is there any type of wording that I'm not gonna have any water in my basement from this?

1238
01:31:42,937 --> 01:31:44,658
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm all on board with this.

1239
01:31:44,678 --> 01:31:47,780
[SPEAKER_46]: The biggest nightmare is having this come in my basement.

1240
01:31:48,684 --> 01:31:51,507
[SPEAKER_47]: I think they're trying pretty hard here, Mr. I don't, I don't know.

1241
01:31:52,067 --> 01:31:56,011
[SPEAKER_47]: It's up to the proponent to say what commitment they're willing to make here.

1242
01:31:56,031 --> 01:31:56,371
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah.

1243
01:31:57,112 --> 01:32:05,519
[SPEAKER_23]: So, as of today everything sheets off, you know, basically, it naturally grades down to your, your down to Alfred Street.

1244
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:06,861
[SPEAKER_23]: So all I can tell you.

1245
01:32:07,461 --> 01:32:13,509
[SPEAKER_23]: is that we're reducing the amount of water that's flowing from this property to Alfred Street or in your direction.

1246
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:18,675
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't guarantee anything that might be extraneous to our project.

1247
01:32:18,715 --> 01:32:24,622
[SPEAKER_23]: All I can tell you is we're reducing the flow off our site towards Alfred Street.

1248
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:34,149
[SPEAKER_46]: So what would happen in the case that this caused water to come into my basement from that unit out front because I'm right next to it.

1249
01:32:34,489 --> 01:32:37,493
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's my only concern is having that.

1250
01:32:37,913 --> 01:32:38,654
[SPEAKER_46]: I hope you understand.

1251
01:32:38,694 --> 01:32:44,180
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not trying to sound like, you know, it's a big concern because I've been in the business and I've seen what happened.

1252
01:32:44,943 --> 01:33:01,643
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so as part of the development, any development we do in the city and all communities, we're required to do detailed stormwater calculations to document that we're not impacting any abutting properties, that we're reducing stormwater flow off the property.

1253
01:33:02,424 --> 01:33:10,109
[SPEAKER_23]: And my calculations are also reviewed, peer reviewed by other engineers to confirm that they're correct and accurate.

1254
01:33:10,389 --> 01:33:21,356
[SPEAKER_23]: So as part of the surety, if you look at our, as reviewed, the calculations reviewed, we're not only reducing the rate of water off the property, also the volume.

1255
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:27,180
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what we're required to do as part of the stormwater regulations in the city.

1256
01:33:28,381 --> 01:33:30,382
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're meeting those regulations.

1257
01:33:32,264 --> 01:33:32,764
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1258
01:33:34,705 --> 01:33:35,705
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Mr. Avola.

1259
01:33:36,966 --> 01:33:37,346
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1260
01:33:37,406 --> 01:33:42,988
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Martha on Zoom.

1261
01:33:43,088 --> 01:33:45,569
[SPEAKER_47]: Martha, please give your name and address for the record, please.

1262
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:53,011
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep, Martha McPartland, 8 Alfred Street in Medford.

1263
01:33:53,931 --> 01:33:59,033
[SPEAKER_28]: I couldn't, the chat's disabled, so I couldn't put my name in the chat, just so you know.

1264
01:34:00,254 --> 01:34:00,894
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I guess,

1265
01:34:02,406 --> 01:34:12,308
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I'm the person that the attorney referenced about wanting the roof deck removed or moved, which they did.

1266
01:34:12,648 --> 01:34:14,668
[SPEAKER_28]: And I appreciate that.

1267
01:34:14,728 --> 01:34:24,750
[SPEAKER_28]: I met personally with Steve Nardone and expressed that I appreciated that acquisition to the neighborhood.

1268
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:30,671
[SPEAKER_28]: But I guess I just want to say, yeah, I mean, it's going to destroy the neighborhood.

1269
01:34:32,463 --> 01:34:36,344
[SPEAKER_28]: I know people probably think over here is like, we're just, you know, half black from Somerville.

1270
01:34:36,384 --> 01:34:39,966
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's really just like living in the city and we're all on top of each other.

1271
01:34:40,226 --> 01:34:42,267
[SPEAKER_28]: But that's not accurate for our little street here.

1272
01:34:42,287 --> 01:34:46,628
[SPEAKER_28]: We have in the middle of the summer, it's absolutely dead quiet.

1273
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:47,769
[SPEAKER_28]: It's birds chirping.

1274
01:34:47,929 --> 01:34:56,232
[SPEAKER_28]: It's basically like a little haven in the middle of, you know, very dense buildings and a very urban-ish area.

1275
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:00,734
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, a couple people hopped on here to say how much they're in favor of it.

1276
01:35:00,835 --> 01:35:16,086
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if those people are the one, you know, are living directly across from this, getting a four-story apartment building put up directly in front of their front windows, adding 120 people to a neighborhood of like 20 or less.

1277
01:35:17,407 --> 01:35:21,310
[SPEAKER_28]: So I kind of, unless you do live straight across from it, I kind of don't appreciate

1278
01:35:22,881 --> 01:35:29,002
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I mean, what is that opinion worth that they're in favor of it, if it doesn't impact their lives at all.

1279
01:35:30,103 --> 01:35:35,184
[SPEAKER_28]: So I told Steve that I wouldn't, you know, fight it tonight and I'm not particularly fighting it.

1280
01:35:35,224 --> 01:35:41,565
[SPEAKER_28]: I get that it's a fait accompli, it's a done deal, but I'm just going on record saying I'm mourning the neighborhood.

1281
01:35:41,605 --> 01:35:42,965
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not going to be what it was.

1282
01:35:42,985 --> 01:35:45,986
[SPEAKER_28]: And yeah, I'm bummed.

1283
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:49,547
[SPEAKER_28]: I understand that the property is underutilized, but

1284
01:35:51,343 --> 01:35:55,947
[SPEAKER_28]: going to suck, two years of construction and then living in a completely different neighborhood.

1285
01:35:55,967 --> 01:36:07,357
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just would like that, you know, acknowledged by those making this decision that picture someone putting it in front of your house and then think about that, you know, as you vote with some empathy for us.

1286
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:07,878
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1287
01:36:08,899 --> 01:36:09,419
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1288
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:12,162
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Roberta Cameron on Zoom.

1289
01:36:12,582 --> 01:36:14,184
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1290
01:36:18,257 --> 01:36:31,775
[SPEAKER_56]: Roberta Cameron 12 North Street, and with respect to Martha who just spoke, I wanted to also iterate support I think it's really important that we're adding more.

1291
01:36:33,937 --> 01:36:36,519
[SPEAKER_56]: places for people to live in the community.

1292
01:36:36,539 --> 01:36:50,108
[SPEAKER_56]: I think that it's important for us to be able to welcome neighbors, new neighbors into Medford and make space for our children to be able to live in the community.

1293
01:36:50,468 --> 01:36:55,011
[SPEAKER_56]: And so I think this housing development is going to have

1294
01:36:57,472 --> 01:37:08,300
[SPEAKER_56]: and overall positive impact, and I really hope that a more residential flavor of the community is going to be an asset to the neighborhood.

1295
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:10,221
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

1296
01:37:11,262 --> 01:37:11,702
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1297
01:37:11,722 --> 01:37:15,985
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to Erika DeRoche on Zoom before I unmute you.

1298
01:37:16,806 --> 01:37:23,210
[SPEAKER_47]: MIK, if you could just add your last name, or if you could come on video, I'll unmute you.

1299
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:25,312
[SPEAKER_47]: Erika, name and address for the record, please.

1300
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:31,626
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, my name is Erica DeRoche 260 Willis Ave.

1301
01:37:31,906 --> 01:37:34,867
[SPEAKER_26]: I also want to lend my support to this project.

1302
01:37:35,868 --> 01:37:42,390
[SPEAKER_26]: It's clearly had a lot of efforts put into it a lot of thought response to neighbor.

1303
01:37:43,334 --> 01:37:50,564
[SPEAKER_26]: feedback, and it, it's really this type of housing is really needed close to the ball square.

1304
01:37:50,584 --> 01:37:54,309
[SPEAKER_26]: I am not in a budding neighbor.

1305
01:37:54,329 --> 01:37:59,917
[SPEAKER_26]: I just passed this on my commute to the T station.

1306
01:38:01,288 --> 01:38:07,151
[SPEAKER_26]: But I do have empathy for how disruptive construction can be.

1307
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:09,412
[SPEAKER_26]: I really do.

1308
01:38:10,793 --> 01:38:16,056
[SPEAKER_26]: But I still think that it's a good development for the community.

1309
01:38:16,076 --> 01:38:22,679
[SPEAKER_26]: It provides a lot of opportunity for residents who need housing.

1310
01:38:22,819 --> 01:38:24,320
[SPEAKER_26]: We just need housing, period.

1311
01:38:26,661 --> 01:38:28,662
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just have a couple

1312
01:38:29,951 --> 01:38:33,634
[SPEAKER_26]: I apologize, I'm not as familiar with the development as I should be.

1313
01:38:33,654 --> 01:38:40,139
[SPEAKER_26]: I just have a couple wishes that I would like to express for the development.

1314
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:57,472
[SPEAKER_26]: I hope that the developer can strongly consider making this a rental property as opposed to a condominium property and reducing the amount of parking that is available.

1315
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:20,204
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand it's only land for 0.8% parking spaces per unit, but I believe that based on its location, I do think traffic and the increased cars on the streets in this neighborhood is a real problem.

1316
01:39:20,344 --> 01:39:26,470
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's obviously a biased opinion coming from a pedestrian who uses the neighborhood often.

1317
01:39:29,495 --> 01:39:39,061
[SPEAKER_26]: But I do think it's possible to park it at a lower percentage than what you're proposing, and I would urge you to look into that in the next phase of design.

1318
01:39:39,421 --> 01:39:39,881
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1319
01:39:41,322 --> 01:39:41,842
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1320
01:39:41,862 --> 01:39:45,204
[SPEAKER_47]: Let me go to Sharon Diesso on Zoom.

1321
01:39:45,564 --> 01:39:51,587
[SPEAKER_47]: Sharon, I'm unable to unmute you, Sharon.

1322
01:39:51,607 --> 01:39:52,628
[SPEAKER_47]: You have to join audio.

1323
01:40:04,813 --> 01:40:07,834
[SPEAKER_47]: Sharon, you have to turn on your microphone, otherwise I can't unmute you.

1324
01:40:17,477 --> 01:40:21,159
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there any further comment from people in the chamber on this project?

1325
01:40:21,919 --> 01:40:25,800
[SPEAKER_47]: Sure, if I could just give the proponent.

1326
01:40:26,781 --> 01:40:27,641
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, we have an agenda.

1327
01:40:29,462 --> 01:40:31,582
[SPEAKER_47]: Do you have anything you'd like to add?

1328
01:40:31,642 --> 01:40:32,082
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1329
01:40:33,925 --> 01:40:35,826
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. McGilvey, name and address for the record, please.

1330
01:40:36,067 --> 01:40:37,368
[SPEAKER_47]: Take as much time as you want.

1331
01:40:37,488 --> 01:40:39,409
[SPEAKER_27]: Harry McGilvey, 4 Piedmont Road, Medford.

1332
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:43,092
[SPEAKER_27]: I grew up down in that neighborhood, and I know this is an important issue.

1333
01:40:44,153 --> 01:40:47,455
[SPEAKER_27]: But folks out here are here for another issue.

1334
01:40:47,495 --> 01:40:49,116
[SPEAKER_27]: We waited till midnight the last time.

1335
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:56,202
[SPEAKER_27]: I feel like this is almost unintentionally trying to wait us out so we'll go home again.

1336
01:40:56,802 --> 01:40:57,903
[SPEAKER_27]: So let's go.

1337
01:40:59,364 --> 01:41:00,245
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you very much.

1338
01:41:01,528 --> 01:41:06,111
[SPEAKER_53]: They were promised.

1339
01:41:06,231 --> 01:41:11,574
[SPEAKER_47]: One more item before the transfer fee.

1340
01:41:12,715 --> 01:41:17,118
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there any other comment on 96 to 102 Winchester Street?

1341
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:21,921
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, then I'm declaring this public hearing closed.

1342
01:41:22,061 --> 01:41:23,462
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1343
01:41:25,503 --> 01:41:26,384
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to move the question.

1344
01:41:28,089 --> 01:41:32,174
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion to move the motion by Councilor Tseng, which didn't receive a second.

1345
01:41:35,397 --> 01:41:35,577
[SPEAKER_47]: Huh?

1346
01:41:36,899 --> 01:41:38,541
[SPEAKER_47]: They waited until midnight last time too.

1347
01:41:42,785 --> 01:41:43,686
[SPEAKER_47]: We tabled both of them.

1348
01:41:47,731 --> 01:41:48,352
[SPEAKER_43]: Councilor Tseng.

1349
01:41:50,457 --> 01:41:52,499
[SPEAKER_43]: What's the motion on the floor?

1350
01:41:53,760 --> 01:42:08,149
[SPEAKER_43]: The motion on the floor is to approve the special permit and site plan as revised with the conditions recommended by the Community Development Board and to strike condition 12.

1351
01:42:10,832 --> 01:42:36,888
[SPEAKER_43]: from the conditions as it's a duplicate of condition nine, and to add in the wording, which I've already emailed to the city clerk, residents of the new building will be restricted from obtaining City of Medford residential street parking permits to ensure that on-street parking capacity is, that on-street parking capacity is not impacted by the development, which is intended to attract residents with lower rates of car ownership as it is approximately one block from Ball Street and BTA Green Line Station.

1352
01:42:37,168 --> 01:42:37,488
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1353
01:42:37,508 --> 01:42:37,769

1390
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,941
[SPEAKER_47]: have a short presentation on improvements to the community.

1391
01:43:07,221 --> 01:43:11,082
[SPEAKER_47]: If we don't take if we don't hear it, they won't make the improvements is my understanding.

1392
01:43:11,282 --> 01:43:12,323
[SPEAKER_47]: But I will.

1393
01:43:13,023 --> 01:43:13,943
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll recognize them.

1394
01:43:14,263 --> 01:43:15,204
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll recognize them.

1395
01:43:17,345 --> 01:43:19,305
[SPEAKER_47]: For a five minute presentation that we can vote on.

1396
01:43:19,906 --> 01:43:20,146
[SPEAKER_47]: Sure.

1397
01:43:20,326 --> 01:43:20,726
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1398
01:43:20,746 --> 01:43:31,490
[SPEAKER_47]: Are they here?

1399
01:43:35,659 --> 01:43:42,682
[SPEAKER_47]: 23-081, MBTA Plan for Accessible Transit Infrastructure, PATI, and City Council, March 28th, 2023, February 20th, 2024.

1400
01:43:43,282 --> 01:43:51,925
[SPEAKER_47]: For the folks from MBTA, we have five minutes, so if you could give a two-minute presentation on what your conclusions are, and then we'll move ahead.

1401
01:43:53,005 --> 01:43:53,445
[SPEAKER_47]: Excuse me?

1402
01:43:53,465 --> 01:43:54,505
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay.

1403
01:43:54,986 --> 01:43:55,306
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1404
01:43:57,492 --> 01:44:05,399
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, I just want to, you know, follow up the last year, we have a city council meetings with us to introduce a petty projects.

1405
01:44:05,519 --> 01:44:16,790
[SPEAKER_36]: We just want to give the city councilor and the feedback about the eight location, six locations, RFP's relocation installations.

1406
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:21,474
[SPEAKER_36]: So I want to give the, our consultant from HDR,

1407
01:44:22,455 --> 01:44:30,059
[SPEAKER_36]: project manager, Debbie Finnegan, to quick introduce our projects and after research.

1408
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:31,079
[SPEAKER_36]: Debbie.

1409
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:32,480
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1410
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:38,403
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have the option to share, so I can either just talk it through or if someone could let me share real quick, that would be great.

1411
01:44:39,303 --> 01:44:39,563
[SPEAKER_47]: Sure.

1412
01:44:39,663 --> 01:44:43,165
[SPEAKER_47]: If you just want to keep it to a slide or two, the clerk will make you a co-host.

1413
01:44:44,586 --> 01:44:44,906
[SPEAKER_22]: Perfect.

1414
01:44:45,406 --> 01:44:45,926
[SPEAKER_22]: I can do that.

1415
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:49,008
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1416
01:44:50,875 --> 01:44:51,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Hopefully you can see this.

1417
01:44:51,856 --> 01:45:03,105
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm literally going to skip through a bunch just so that we get through this very quickly because I know everybody's ready to go home or to talk about other things.

1418
01:45:03,145 --> 01:45:03,406
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1419
01:45:03,586 --> 01:45:04,407
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Debbie Finnegan.

1420
01:45:04,447 --> 01:45:05,367
[SPEAKER_22]: I work for HDR.

1421
01:45:05,427 --> 01:45:07,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me just click through all these.

1422
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:09,231
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1423
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:11,869
[SPEAKER_47]: Just saying thank you, you may continue.

1424
01:45:12,449 --> 01:45:12,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, sorry.

1425
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:16,931
[SPEAKER_22]: So we presented several locations last time.

1426
01:45:16,951 --> 01:45:19,091
[SPEAKER_22]: I know this will be available.

1427
01:45:19,171 --> 01:45:21,132
[SPEAKER_22]: There was several stops for elimination.

1428
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:29,254
[SPEAKER_22]: At the last meeting last March in 2023, we had several locations that were requested for RFBs, and that's part of the reason we're here.

1429
01:45:30,014 --> 01:45:34,015
[SPEAKER_22]: We went through the process to see, did a screening on these locations.

1430
01:45:35,935 --> 01:45:39,077
[SPEAKER_22]: The Winthrop at Robinson Road has been eliminated.

1431
01:45:39,697 --> 01:45:42,218
[SPEAKER_22]: The nearest stop is Winthrop at Robinson Winford.

1432
01:45:42,959 --> 01:45:45,200
[SPEAKER_22]: This stop is not currently in our project design scope.

1433
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:49,161
[SPEAKER_22]: Middlesex Avenue at Dunkin Donuts is not currently part of our scope.

1434
01:45:51,062 --> 01:45:56,905
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, Salem at Hadley will be getting new curb ramps, crosswalks, and pedestrian refuge.

1435
01:45:58,005 --> 01:45:58,906
[SPEAKER_22]: These are the plans.

1436
01:45:59,707 --> 01:46:05,832
[SPEAKER_22]: Boston at high and high at Boston will be getting new curb ramps, crosswalks, and pedestrian refuge island.

1437
01:46:06,492 --> 01:46:13,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Boston Avenue can't get one because under state standards, under stop control, it can't be done.

1438
01:46:14,519 --> 01:46:20,124
[SPEAKER_22]: High Street, we have concerns about meeting ADA standards and appropriate site distance to put an RFB in.

1439
01:46:21,129 --> 01:46:22,010
[SPEAKER_22]: These are the plans.

1440
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:25,352
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a highlight Highland at Waddell and Tucker.

1441
01:46:26,393 --> 01:46:28,234
[SPEAKER_22]: This location is part of our current scope.

1442
01:46:28,334 --> 01:46:30,216
[SPEAKER_22]: It's under VCR jurisdiction.

1443
01:46:31,136 --> 01:46:35,260
[SPEAKER_22]: It will be getting new curb ramps, crosswalks, and bus stop pavement markings.

1444
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:36,200
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the plans.

1445
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:47,529
[SPEAKER_22]: We talked to Todd Blake about citizens' concerns about elimination of stop 503, which is the hillside at High Avenue.

1446
01:46:48,709 --> 01:46:56,593
[SPEAKER_22]: MBTA will not be eliminating that stop, but it is not under our scope to redesign it to meet ADA standards.

1447
01:46:58,253 --> 01:47:02,235
[SPEAKER_22]: And the stop at High at Bradley Road will not be moved.

1448
01:47:02,355 --> 01:47:04,076
[SPEAKER_22]: It will be staying in its current location.

1449
01:47:05,877 --> 01:47:10,939
[SPEAKER_22]: We will still be eliminating Felsway at Central Ave and Medford Street, which you can see on this little sketch here.

1450
01:47:12,539 --> 01:47:13,960
[SPEAKER_22]: And hopefully that was less than two minutes.

1451
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,221
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you have questions, please let me know.

1452
01:47:16,394 --> 01:47:17,034
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much.

1453
01:47:17,054 --> 01:47:18,415
[SPEAKER_47]: I appreciate your speed.

1454
01:47:19,035 --> 01:47:20,856
[SPEAKER_47]: Any questions?

1455
01:47:20,876 --> 01:47:26,899
[SPEAKER_36]: Before our consultant close up, I want to give you guys some more information.

1456
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:33,582
[SPEAKER_36]: So we want to invest almost $2 million in City of Medford.

1457
01:47:33,902 --> 01:47:37,223
[SPEAKER_36]: So all the funding comes from MBTA Bank, state, and FDA.

1458
01:47:37,644 --> 01:47:44,967
[SPEAKER_36]: So right now, we would like to City of Medford approve the 10 locations of accessibility improvement work.

1459
01:47:45,527 --> 01:47:49,292
[SPEAKER_36]: and the bus stop elimination plans we just want to for city reviewing.

1460
01:47:51,355 --> 01:47:51,735
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1461
01:47:51,856 --> 01:47:54,599
[SPEAKER_47]: So that was two million dollars in improvement for the city of Method?

1462
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:55,721
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, correct.

1463
01:47:56,578 --> 01:47:57,138
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much.

1464
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:08,346
[SPEAKER_43]: Any questions for members of the council Councilor Tseng not a question but being very quick for my other for the new Councilors here the history of this is the MBTA is this project where they want to improve pedestrian infrastructure for bus stops.

1465
01:48:09,807 --> 01:48:14,731
[SPEAKER_43]: At the same time, Medford has a higher concentration of bus stops and other cities, a lot of them go pretty much unused.

1466
01:48:15,511 --> 01:48:20,895
[SPEAKER_43]: We don't have any powers of city council to stop bus stops being taken away but the last council leveraged a lot of that.

1467
01:48:21,915 --> 01:48:29,120
[SPEAKER_43]: are the approvals that we need to do for the infrastructure projects to keep bus stops to make improvements to the bus stops that they were talking about.

1468
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,261
[SPEAKER_43]: And so I would move approval.

1469
01:48:32,021 --> 01:48:32,381
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1470
01:48:32,441 --> 01:48:37,184
[SPEAKER_47]: And the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve seconded by second seconded by Councilor Leming.

1471
01:48:37,224 --> 01:48:40,146
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there any comment from members of the public in the chamber or on Zoom?

1472
01:48:43,786 --> 01:48:44,986
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1473
01:48:45,207 --> 01:48:46,647
[SPEAKER_61]: My name is Martha Andres.

1474
01:48:46,707 --> 01:48:48,488
[SPEAKER_61]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue.

1475
01:48:49,848 --> 01:48:54,450
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm dismayed to see elimination of improvements on High Street.

1476
01:48:54,670 --> 01:49:00,112
[SPEAKER_61]: High Street is a very dangerous street for pedestrians and for drivers.

1477
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:08,296
[SPEAKER_61]: And I think the MBTA, instead of saying we can't do it because the conditions aren't right, should be working with MassDOT

1478
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:15,438
[SPEAKER_61]: And in some cases, the DCR to make the improvements that work for the community.

1479
01:49:16,138 --> 01:49:20,079
[SPEAKER_61]: It's, you know, bad things happen there because people have to run across the street.

1480
01:49:20,859 --> 01:49:24,220
[SPEAKER_61]: And that includes the disability and elderly community.

1481
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:24,740
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

1482
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:25,820
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Martha.

1483
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,321
[SPEAKER_47]: Any other comments from the chamber or on Zoom?

1484
01:49:31,781 --> 01:49:33,662
[SPEAKER_47]: Debbie, feel free to respond if you'd like.

1485
01:49:34,682 --> 01:49:40,667
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I just, I was trying to, I just wanted to let her know that Hyatt Hillside Avenue there, there's, it's already improved that location.

1486
01:49:40,747 --> 01:49:46,512
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just a minor width, which can be resolved with how the bus would pull up to the curb at Hyatt Hillside.

1487
01:49:46,832 --> 01:49:49,094
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's not being eliminated, just to be clear.

1488
01:49:49,234 --> 01:49:55,419
[SPEAKER_22]: And I wasn't 100% clear which other ones she might have been talking about, but understand, I understand what she is saying.

1489
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:00,443
[SPEAKER_61]: What are you doing at the Boston Ave High Street intersection?

1490
01:50:02,705 --> 01:50:04,566
[SPEAKER_61]: making any improvements there, that's a nightmare.

1491
01:50:04,826 --> 01:50:07,768
[SPEAKER_47]: It looks like there were some significant bump out improvements at that intersection.

1492
01:50:08,229 --> 01:50:08,489
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah.

1493
01:50:08,529 --> 01:50:09,349
[SPEAKER_47]: Debbie.

1494
01:50:09,369 --> 01:50:12,732
[SPEAKER_36]: Boston Avenue on the high street where planning to improve it.

1495
01:50:13,852 --> 01:50:14,113
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1496
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,515
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, here, just one real quick.

1497
01:50:17,875 --> 01:50:26,000
[SPEAKER_22]: So it may not be easy to see, but we're going to add, revise the island here and the bus stops are going here and we're going to paint this out.

1498
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:28,022
[SPEAKER_48]: Debbie, you're going to have to show it again.

1499
01:50:28,042 --> 01:50:31,284
[SPEAKER_22]: That's okay, you can just verbally describe it, people are in a hurry here.

1500
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:33,905
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, how did I did I mute myself?

1501
01:50:33,925 --> 01:50:34,465
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear me now?

1502
01:50:36,427 --> 01:50:37,187
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

1503
01:50:37,207 --> 01:50:37,948
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I'll do it quick.

1504
01:50:38,028 --> 01:50:40,810
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're adding in a new crosswalk with new curb ramps.

1505
01:50:40,970 --> 01:50:47,135
[SPEAKER_22]: If you can see right here, and right here, we're revising the pavement markings.

1506
01:50:47,175 --> 01:50:51,819
[SPEAKER_22]: We're also adding a cut through this island so people don't have to walk around the front, which will make it a safer condition.

1507
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:56,042
[SPEAKER_22]: And that is right now the gist of those improvements.

1508
01:50:56,603 --> 01:51:00,306
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're also adding some paint here to better define how that road should work.

1509
01:51:01,519 --> 01:51:03,680
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you, those are positive improvements.

1510
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:06,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, glad you asked and asked for clarification.

1511
01:51:06,662 --> 01:51:07,743
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much, I appreciate that.

1512
01:51:07,823 --> 01:51:12,906
[SPEAKER_47]: Martha, there should be a diagram in the agenda packet on the council website.

1513
01:51:14,427 --> 01:51:14,648
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1514
01:51:15,848 --> 01:51:16,969
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, any further comment?

1515
01:51:19,311 --> 01:51:24,274
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve, seconded by Councilor Leming.

1516
01:51:24,694 --> 01:51:25,875

[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1522
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:33,771

01:51:39,674 --> 01:51:39,914
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1531
01:51:39,934 --> 01:51:42,096
[SPEAKER_47]: I have affirmative, non-negative motion passes.

1532
01:51:43,016 --> 01:51:43,336
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1533
01:51:43,376 --> 01:51:44,357
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you all very much.

1534
01:51:44,537 --> 01:51:45,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Have a nice evening.

1535
01:51:45,258 --> 01:51:48,880
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate your time.

1536
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:49,380
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1537
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:52,242
[SPEAKER_47]: 24-041 offered by Councilor Leming and Vice President Collins.

1538
01:51:53,137 --> 01:52:15,975
[SPEAKER_47]: whereas the city of medford requires approval from the commonwealth of massachusetts to impose a real estate transfer fee and whereas 18 other communities in massachusetts have submitted home rule petitions to impose local real estate transfer fees and whereas real estate transfer fees create a sustainable funding stream for needed housing production and affordable housing production in medford by levying a small fee on certain real estate transactions now therefore

1539
01:52:16,448 --> 01:52:24,898
[SPEAKER_47]: be it resolved that the Committee on Planning and Permitting meet to develop a Home Rule petition, quote, an act authorizing the City of Medford to impose a real estate transfer fee.

1540
01:52:25,218 --> 01:52:25,999
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Leming.

1541
01:52:27,241 --> 01:52:31,906
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, and I'd like to thank everybody for waiting so long across two meetings.

1542
01:52:31,986 --> 01:52:33,888
[SPEAKER_42]: It's unfortunate that we did have to.

1543
01:52:33,928 --> 01:52:34,890
[SPEAKER_42]: Can everybody hear me okay?

1544
01:52:36,827 --> 01:52:39,789
[SPEAKER_47]: If everybody could take their conversations outside, it's much easier to hear.

1545
01:52:40,409 --> 01:52:57,040
[SPEAKER_42]: OK, so what I'm going to talk about is what we're actually voting on tonight, why there is a housing need in Medford, Massachusetts, and how this helps that, and why this particular policy is unlikely to affect seniors, average homeowners.

1546
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:02,143
[SPEAKER_42]: It's really more targeted at high-end real estate deals.

1547
01:53:02,163 --> 01:53:03,804
[SPEAKER_42]: Hey, excuse me.

1548
01:53:04,644 --> 01:53:05,425
[SPEAKER_42]: Excuse me.

1549
01:53:06,971 --> 01:53:07,432
[SPEAKER_42]: Excuse me.

1550
01:53:07,612 --> 01:53:11,901
[SPEAKER_47]: I would please just everyone respects like there's been so much disrespect and it's unacceptable.

1551
01:53:18,114 --> 01:53:26,602
[SPEAKER_42]: So at the state level, Governor Healy and many of our neighboring communities have proposed different forms of a real estate transfer fee.

1552
01:53:27,182 --> 01:53:31,306
[SPEAKER_42]: This is because Massachusetts is in a housing crisis right now.

1553
01:53:31,446 --> 01:53:40,794
[SPEAKER_42]: Medford in particular needs to build 671 more units in order to even meet a minimum 10% affordable housing requirement mandated by the state of Massachusetts.

1554
01:53:40,894 --> 01:53:42,475
[SPEAKER_42]: Each of those units cost between $500,000 and $600,000.

1555
01:53:45,718 --> 01:54:01,513
[SPEAKER_42]: to fund and to build and it was only last year that we even instituted an affordable housing trust which would be able to dedicate revenue towards putting towards addressing that problem.

1556
01:54:02,193 --> 01:54:03,775
[SPEAKER_42]: I have right here a letter

1557
01:54:04,315 --> 01:54:27,312
[SPEAKER_42]: from 21 residents of 208 Main Street, in which they say that they are being evicted right now because a major real estate company bought up their apartment complexes and told them they have to get up by next month if Medford had been serious about funding, any form of affordable housing 10 years ago, they, this would not be the case for them.

1558
01:54:27,332 --> 01:54:27,372
[SPEAKER_42]: So,

1559
01:54:29,033 --> 01:54:32,337
[SPEAKER_42]: Currently we have the Community Preservation Act funds.

1560
01:54:32,357 --> 01:54:43,031
[SPEAKER_42]: Before I was elected, I sat on the Community Preservation Act, or sorry, on the Community Preservation Committee, and we were able to dedicate maybe $800,000 a year to fund

1561
01:54:47,877 --> 01:54:50,718
[SPEAKER_42]: to fund affordable housing developments.

1562
01:54:51,418 --> 01:54:59,021
[SPEAKER_42]: We ended up dedicating about $2.4 million to walk link or but we only pay 2% of the price tag for that.

1563
01:54:59,582 --> 01:55:15,548
[SPEAKER_42]: So we need more revenue streams in order to put any sort in order to build up any sort of corpus of money that can be dedicated to affordable housing residents are being priced out of the city, and we need to more actively engage that now.

1564
01:55:15,908 --> 01:55:18,171
[SPEAKER_42]: What is what is being voted on tonight?

1565
01:55:18,812 --> 01:55:19,853
[SPEAKER_42]: What is being voted on tonight?

1566
01:55:20,214 --> 01:55:31,328
[SPEAKER_42]: Many residents, I believe, came here tonight under the belief that we were voting to pass a 2% tax on all real estate transactions in Medford.

1567
01:55:31,608 --> 01:55:33,010
[SPEAKER_42]: That is most definitely not the case.

1568
01:55:34,091 --> 01:55:36,034
[SPEAKER_42]: That is not the case.

1569
01:55:36,975 --> 01:55:44,986
[SPEAKER_42]: Because what this is, is a resolution to discuss the transfer fee to develop it.

1570
01:55:45,387 --> 01:55:45,667
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

1571
01:55:46,148 --> 01:55:51,334
[SPEAKER_42]: And there's different forms that these transfer fees can take at the state level what Governor Healy is pushing for.

1572
01:55:52,256 --> 01:55:57,361
[SPEAKER_42]: is is a transfer fee that wouldn't tax any price below $1 million.

1573
01:55:57,401 --> 01:56:07,791
[SPEAKER_42]: So if you sold $1 million property, you'd pay zero if you sold a $1.2 million property $4,000 split equally between the buyer and the seller.

1574
01:56:08,011 --> 01:56:10,153
[SPEAKER_42]: That is one example of a transfer fee policy.

1575
01:56:10,574 --> 01:56:13,497
[SPEAKER_42]: neighboring communities have submitted transfer fee policies that

1576
01:56:13,797 --> 01:56:19,742
[SPEAKER_42]: exclude seniors transactions between family members and owner occupied residences completely.

1577
01:56:19,842 --> 01:56:29,330
[SPEAKER_42]: So in other words, under these different examples of a transfer fee policy, if you lived in a home and you were selling it to somebody else who also intended to live in that home,

1578
01:56:30,151 --> 01:56:31,873
[SPEAKER_42]: it wouldn't it would not apply to you.

1579
01:56:32,454 --> 01:56:40,163
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, this is really meant to address the situation like the one being experienced by the residents of 208 Main Street.

1580
01:56:40,564 --> 01:56:44,368
[SPEAKER_42]: Now, the trouble that we've gone through with this is the fact that

1581
01:56:45,089 --> 01:56:47,933
[SPEAKER_42]: This was originally on the February 20 agenda.

1582
01:56:48,714 --> 01:56:59,750
[SPEAKER_42]: And it was because there was a lot going on in that meeting it was tabled until today so that allowed three weeks for it to sit on the city council agenda, and a lot of misinformation

1583
01:57:00,211 --> 01:57:02,353
[SPEAKER_42]: was, I believe, spread around the community.

1584
01:57:02,674 --> 01:57:04,115
[SPEAKER_42]: It's an unfortunate timing issue.

1585
01:57:04,776 --> 01:57:08,960
[SPEAKER_42]: Something this important should not be sitting on an agenda without any discussion for this long.

1586
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:18,950
[SPEAKER_42]: And so I know what my personal ideas about what a real estate transfer-free policy should look like, but because of a meeting law, I don't know what my colleagues as of yet think.

1587
01:57:19,130 --> 01:57:21,232
[SPEAKER_42]: We haven't been able to discuss it amongst ourselves.

1588
01:57:22,634 --> 01:57:22,934
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay?

1589
01:57:23,315 --> 01:57:23,415
[SPEAKER_42]: Now,

1590
01:57:28,237 --> 01:57:37,843
[SPEAKER_42]: The point is that even if the vote on this is successful tonight, we're not passing real estate transfer fee policy, we are passing a resolution to discuss and develop it.

1591
01:57:38,344 --> 01:57:42,907
[SPEAKER_42]: And this will then contain a number of exclusions, etc, etc.

1592
01:57:42,947 --> 01:57:46,650
[SPEAKER_42]: Now, even if we were to develop one, we were to pass it,

1593
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:48,191
[SPEAKER_42]: It's and so on.

1594
01:57:48,391 --> 01:57:49,591
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a home rule petition.

1595
01:57:49,671 --> 01:57:53,154
[SPEAKER_42]: It does not mean that Medford would then have a real estate transfer fee.

1596
01:57:53,494 --> 01:57:58,997
[SPEAKER_42]: What it means is that we would ask the state to pass it and the state may or may not choose to do that.

1597
01:57:59,277 --> 01:57:59,938
[SPEAKER_42]: And if the state.

1598
01:58:01,819 --> 01:58:03,400
[SPEAKER_42]: No, listen.

1599
01:58:06,121 --> 01:58:08,623
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, they may or may not choose to pass it.

1600
01:58:08,763 --> 01:58:11,365
[SPEAKER_42]: If they do, we still don't have a real estate transfer fee.

1601
01:58:11,586 --> 01:58:13,927
[SPEAKER_42]: We get the option to then develop our own.

1602
01:58:15,169 --> 01:58:20,933
[SPEAKER_42]: Now 18 other communities have requested a real estate transfer fee from the state.

1603
01:58:21,494 --> 01:58:24,016
[SPEAKER_42]: None of them have even been debated yet.

1604
01:58:24,056 --> 01:58:32,223
[SPEAKER_42]: The version that Governor Healey is trying to push in the Affordable Homes Act may or may not give us the option by default.

1605
01:58:33,624 --> 01:58:37,467
[SPEAKER_42]: So that is what is happening tonight.

1606
01:58:37,727 --> 01:58:43,971
[SPEAKER_42]: We're not discussing anything like rent control or any of the other home rule petitions that people have brought up.

1607
01:58:44,331 --> 01:58:49,194
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a resolution to find out, do we want a real estate transfer fee?

1608
01:58:49,415 --> 01:58:51,256
[SPEAKER_42]: What exclusions would be in it?

1609
01:58:51,576 --> 01:58:58,681
[SPEAKER_42]: Because at the end of the day, Medford really needs to be serious about addressing the affordable housing situation.

1610
01:58:58,761 --> 01:59:00,902
[SPEAKER_42]: People come to us a lot and they talk about the roads.

1611
01:59:01,283 --> 01:59:03,184
[SPEAKER_42]: They talk about improving the schools and

1612
01:59:03,884 --> 01:59:05,405
[SPEAKER_42]: and a lot of other things.

1613
01:59:05,985 --> 01:59:11,868
[SPEAKER_42]: The fact of the matter is that Medford increasingly is pricing out the working class, and those are the people that repair our roads.

1614
01:59:12,208 --> 01:59:14,069
[SPEAKER_42]: Those are people that improve our infrastructure.

1615
01:59:14,349 --> 01:59:15,810
[SPEAKER_42]: They can't afford to live here anymore.

1616
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:17,131
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay?

1617
01:59:17,991 --> 01:59:19,792
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's what this is.

1618
01:59:20,632 --> 01:59:21,653
[SPEAKER_42]: Now, thank you.

1619
01:59:22,753 --> 01:59:23,374
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

1620
01:59:23,854 --> 01:59:31,838
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna go to Vice President Collins as a co-proponent.

1621
01:59:34,226 --> 01:59:35,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Abiris.

1622
01:59:35,287 --> 01:59:39,450
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Councilor Leming for co-sponsoring this proposal with me.

1623
01:59:42,072 --> 01:59:43,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll try to be as brief as I can.

1624
01:59:43,934 --> 01:59:54,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Housing affordability, unaffordability continues to displace Medford residents from where we grew up, went to school, the communities that we worship in, study, have community ties where we go to work.

1625
01:59:55,062 --> 02:00:01,528
[SPEAKER_14]: It is becoming more and more out of the question for working class and middle class people to live here, and no one is going to swoop in and fix that for us.

1626
02:00:02,495 --> 02:00:06,383
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that Medford residents deeply value being a welcoming and diverse community.

1627
02:00:06,964 --> 02:00:11,433
[SPEAKER_14]: The question is, are we willing to have the conversations and utilize the tools that will help us keep it that way?

1628
02:00:12,648 --> 02:00:26,683
[SPEAKER_14]: If we want our Affordable Housing Trust Fund to be more than a talking point, we know that we need to create dedicated funding streams so that it can manifest in housing and programs that will make it possible for us to keep Medford residents in Medford and for us to welcome new neighbors.

1629
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:32,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Real estate transfer fees are one tool that the Governor has indicated provisional support for.

1630
02:00:32,189 --> 02:00:34,051
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we're proposing to consider it.

1631
02:00:35,171 --> 02:00:46,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Our methods for meaningfully funding affordable housing are too few and far between to dismiss this out of hand, and our existing funding streams, including CPA, are unfortunately insufficient on their own.

1632
02:00:46,263 --> 02:00:47,324
[SPEAKER_14]: The scale is too great.

1633
02:00:47,744 --> 02:00:49,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Displacement is already happening.

1634
02:00:50,583 --> 02:01:07,234
[SPEAKER_14]: As Councilwoman said, what's before us tonight is whether we want to have the conversation about how to tailor this tool to dedicate a small percentage of only the highest ticket real estate transactions towards the most underinvested in housing in our community, the housing we desperately need and have a very severe shortage of.

1635
02:01:08,444 --> 02:01:14,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be clear, if we vote this into committee tonight, then we can and we will get into the weeds with the community.

1636
02:01:14,806 --> 02:01:30,231
[SPEAKER_14]: We can discuss how to tailor this to affect the appropriate type of highest value sales so as to capture a small percentage of the huge value increases that have come into this region as living in Medford and places like it has become more expensive and more desirable.

1637
02:01:30,951 --> 02:01:38,420
[SPEAKER_14]: We can consider exceptions, like for elders, for people making transfers to close family, or for people selling at a loss or at minimal profit.

1638
02:01:38,781 --> 02:01:44,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Essentially, we can go through what would need to happen in order for this to be a net positive for this community.

1639
02:01:45,697 --> 02:01:53,303
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I want to remind everybody, this would need approval from the mayor, our state delegation, as well as the governor for this to actually take effect.

1640
02:01:54,004 --> 02:01:57,307
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be really clear, we are not implementing a tax tonight.

1641
02:01:57,867 --> 02:02:04,493
[SPEAKER_14]: We are proposing to send this idea to committee to start a conversation, and I believe it is a very necessary conversation.

1642
02:02:04,513 --> 02:02:08,016
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank my fellow councilors and the public for their time.

1643
02:02:08,436 --> 02:02:09,337
[SPEAKER_14]: I will motion for approval.

1644
02:02:11,189 --> 02:02:12,090
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1645
02:02:12,130 --> 02:02:14,151
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by?

1646
02:02:14,232 --> 02:02:14,552
[SPEAKER_47]: Second.

1647
02:02:14,812 --> 02:02:15,753
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

1648
02:02:15,793 --> 02:02:16,593
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1649
02:02:16,814 --> 02:02:17,234
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1650
02:02:17,754 --> 02:02:31,105
[SPEAKER_40]: I appreciate the dialogue, but I think that what my fellow Councilors have to understand, even though it was a few weeks, I think you have to understand the concerns that homeowners have in Medford.

1651
02:02:32,817 --> 02:02:41,602
[SPEAKER_40]: We've talked about the CPA and the 1.5% of our tax money going to affordable housing.

1652
02:02:42,302 --> 02:02:46,144
[SPEAKER_40]: We've identified that we're really not using that properly.

1653
02:02:47,805 --> 02:02:54,007
[SPEAKER_40]: We've talked about issues that I want you aware of so we can understand that this just isn't about a 2% tax.

1654
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:58,981
[SPEAKER_40]: In the last few weeks, we've heard the CPA tax.

1655
02:02:59,601 --> 02:03:01,302
[SPEAKER_40]: We've talked about this 2% tax.

1656
02:03:01,702 --> 02:03:02,942
[SPEAKER_40]: We've talked about rent control.

1657
02:03:03,682 --> 02:03:06,403
[SPEAKER_40]: There's rumblings about a proposition to an app override.

1658
02:03:07,063 --> 02:03:10,284
[SPEAKER_40]: Talks about a $2.250 million new high school.

1659
02:03:11,185 --> 02:03:15,386
[SPEAKER_40]: These are identified initiatives that my colleagues have brought forward one time or another.

1660
02:03:16,306 --> 02:03:18,087
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's not just one little issue.

1661
02:03:19,292 --> 02:03:22,198
[SPEAKER_40]: You're not talking about one issue that's riling up the city of Method.

1662
02:03:22,899 --> 02:03:27,167
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a combination of a bunch of different issues that are affecting who?

1663
02:03:27,949 --> 02:03:28,450
[SPEAKER_40]: Homeowners.

1664
02:03:34,315 --> 02:03:37,996
[SPEAKER_40]: We mentioned, again, I revert back to the administration.

1665
02:03:38,496 --> 02:03:41,437
[SPEAKER_40]: We talk about not having enough affordable housing.

1666
02:03:42,278 --> 02:03:55,702
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, this administration themselves stopped three 40B projects that would assist us in creating more housing.

1667
02:03:56,082 --> 02:04:00,464
[SPEAKER_40]: We keep mentioning the highest, only the highest earners, only the highest homes

1668
02:04:01,465 --> 02:04:06,276
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, I'm going to give you an example because I don't think anybody else in this council has this perspective.

1669
02:04:06,677 --> 02:04:07,218
[SPEAKER_40]: I own a home.

1670
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:08,701
[SPEAKER_40]: I have a father.

1671
02:04:12,573 --> 02:04:17,918
[SPEAKER_40]: just to put it in perspective, I have I have I have a home that I purchased.

1672
02:04:18,539 --> 02:04:25,525
[SPEAKER_40]: I have my dad who came to this country, worked very hard to purchase his home, a two family home on Paris Street.

1673
02:04:26,206 --> 02:04:27,407
[SPEAKER_40]: He killed himself that home.

1674
02:04:28,047 --> 02:04:30,189
[SPEAKER_40]: He built that home and now that home is worth $1.2 million.

1675
02:04:32,662 --> 02:04:43,351
[SPEAKER_40]: And what's offensive and what's bothering the community is to think that why should a penny of those people's hard-earned money go to any tax?

1676
02:04:56,984 --> 02:05:07,134
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm just putting this all in context because this is being, this is being portrayed as, this isn't, this is just something to just touch base on and go after and just talk about.

1677
02:05:09,212 --> 02:05:12,255
[SPEAKER_40]: This is something that's dividing this community.

1678
02:05:12,315 --> 02:05:13,916
[SPEAKER_40]: Another piece dividing our community.

1679
02:05:14,257 --> 02:05:16,098
[SPEAKER_40]: We keep talking about affordable housing.

1680
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:18,941
[SPEAKER_40]: We talk about a few different issues that I agree with.

1681
02:05:19,362 --> 02:05:21,584
[SPEAKER_40]: I know we need these, these homes need help, right?

1682
02:05:21,984 --> 02:05:26,708
[SPEAKER_40]: These homeowners, excuse me, these renters that live in these condos that are being moved out.

1683
02:05:27,449 --> 02:05:32,132
[SPEAKER_40]: We understand that, but unfortunately, that's what happens when things prosper.

1684
02:05:32,472 --> 02:05:34,253
[SPEAKER_40]: This is what happens when you live near Boston.

1685
02:05:34,853 --> 02:05:39,315
[SPEAKER_40]: And now taking it and throwing away the baby with the baby water, it's just hurting our community.

1686
02:05:39,936 --> 02:05:41,837
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think that there are ways that we can do it.

1687
02:05:42,357 --> 02:05:45,038
[SPEAKER_40]: But again, I'm gonna revert back to this.

1688
02:05:45,559 --> 02:05:48,480
[SPEAKER_40]: We're talking about an affordable trust fund, right?

1689
02:05:49,041 --> 02:05:51,222
[SPEAKER_40]: A trust that we talked about.

1690
02:05:51,582 --> 02:05:52,422
[SPEAKER_40]: Affordable housing trust.

1691
02:05:52,442 --> 02:05:53,063
[SPEAKER_40]: Housing trust, correct.

1692
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:54,160
[SPEAKER_40]: Is it?

1693
02:05:54,941 --> 02:05:56,421
[SPEAKER_40]: Is it even in place yet?

1694
02:05:57,202 --> 02:05:58,583
[SPEAKER_40]: No, we voted for it.

1695
02:05:58,983 --> 02:05:59,823
[SPEAKER_40]: Is it in place yet?

1696
02:06:00,944 --> 02:06:01,624
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not a place.

1697
02:06:01,664 --> 02:06:02,405
[SPEAKER_40]: There's no committee.

1698
02:06:02,665 --> 02:06:04,986
[SPEAKER_40]: They haven't done anything yet.

1699
02:06:05,687 --> 02:06:08,588
[SPEAKER_42]: They're currently interviewing people.

1700
02:06:09,008 --> 02:06:09,929
[SPEAKER_40]: Is it in place yet?

1701
02:06:10,049 --> 02:06:12,570
[SPEAKER_40]: No, to even talk about it again.

1702
02:06:12,590 --> 02:06:15,012
[SPEAKER_40]: It's premature.

1703
02:06:16,607 --> 02:06:21,930
[SPEAKER_40]: And it's disrespectful, this community, to say, okay, this is what they need.

1704
02:06:21,950 --> 02:06:22,890
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's not just 2%.

1705
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:26,732
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a dialogue that's spinning around the community.

1706
02:06:27,112 --> 02:06:30,894
[SPEAKER_40]: And the community, you know, it's funny, I appreciate people coming out.

1707
02:06:31,574 --> 02:06:35,416
[SPEAKER_40]: And I appreciate, I'm gonna say this again, but where were you in November?

1708
02:06:36,316 --> 02:06:37,817
[SPEAKER_40]: Because this didn't just sneak up on you.

1709
02:06:39,284 --> 02:06:43,707
[SPEAKER_40]: So I am gonna tell you, I respect all my colleagues.

1710
02:06:43,867 --> 02:06:45,288
[SPEAKER_40]: I respect everybody behind the reel.

1711
02:06:45,588 --> 02:06:47,289
[SPEAKER_40]: To run for an office is very difficult.

1712
02:06:48,209 --> 02:06:54,313
[SPEAKER_40]: But again, as you can see, our politics don't align with some of my colleagues.

1713
02:06:55,629 --> 02:06:59,973
[SPEAKER_40]: So that's why when it comes to November, you have to understand these are the impacts.

1714
02:06:59,993 --> 02:07:03,436
[SPEAKER_40]: So I understand we have residents that wanna rush things through, I understand that.

1715
02:07:04,117 --> 02:07:06,960
[SPEAKER_40]: But there's more involved in our community, just this one issue.

1716
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:08,741
[SPEAKER_40]: This is just the tip of the iceberg.

1717
02:07:09,502 --> 02:07:20,112
[SPEAKER_40]: So when we talk about a 2% tax, we still haven't defined the 1.5% of tax that goes to the CPA and how it hasn't been used.

1718
02:07:20,552 --> 02:07:27,516
[SPEAKER_40]: We also haven't talked about the 40B projects that the mayor has stalled to help with that affordable housing issue.

1719
02:07:28,017 --> 02:07:32,319
[SPEAKER_40]: So we have a trust that's not actually in play yet.

1720
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:44,046
[SPEAKER_40]: So we've heard comments over and over again talking about how we're pricing out the working class.

1721
02:07:44,707 --> 02:07:45,968
[SPEAKER_40]: Who do you think owns these homes?

1722
02:07:45,988 --> 02:07:49,390
[SPEAKER_40]: It's the working class.

1723
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:59,472
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm lucky, I'm lucky that when I said to my dad, I said, I want to move to Medford.

1724
02:08:00,172 --> 02:08:01,654
[SPEAKER_40]: And I've heard this from some of my colleagues.

1725
02:08:02,355 --> 02:08:04,477
[SPEAKER_40]: And he said, and I said, this isn't fair.

1726
02:08:04,517 --> 02:08:05,258
[SPEAKER_40]: I have a degree.

1727
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:08,921
[SPEAKER_40]: I went to college, I should be able to afford a house, but I can't afford it.

1728
02:08:09,161 --> 02:08:10,042
[SPEAKER_40]: You know what he told me to do?

1729
02:08:10,062 --> 02:08:13,666
[SPEAKER_40]: He looked me straight in the eye and says, well, one job doesn't do it, go get three.

1730
02:08:13,686 --> 02:08:16,208
[SPEAKER_40]: So that's what I did.

1731
02:08:18,052 --> 02:08:23,577
[SPEAKER_40]: So my home, my home that was purchased at 220,000 is probably appraised at 800,000.

1732
02:08:23,617 --> 02:08:25,178
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm not ashamed to say it.

1733
02:08:25,519 --> 02:08:26,479
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm proud to say that.

1734
02:08:27,621 --> 02:08:30,763
[SPEAKER_40]: But everybody has this opportunity to do that.

1735
02:08:31,184 --> 02:08:32,465
[SPEAKER_40]: You just have to go to work and do it.

1736
02:08:39,090 --> 02:08:44,311
[SPEAKER_40]: So the dialogue, the dialogue that's being spun that we can we can mold this to whatever we want.

1737
02:08:44,931 --> 02:08:50,993
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it's it's really, really disingenuous, because it's exactly who you're hurting.

1738
02:08:51,593 --> 02:08:53,733
[SPEAKER_40]: It's the homeowners or hardworking people.

1739
02:08:53,933 --> 02:08:59,435
[SPEAKER_40]: I've heard more from renters that have called me says please, with all these initiatives, don't do this.

1740
02:08:59,895 --> 02:09:00,955
[SPEAKER_40]: I love my landlord.

1741
02:09:01,295 --> 02:09:02,336
[SPEAKER_40]: Most landlords are great.

1742
02:09:02,416 --> 02:09:03,877
[SPEAKER_40]: I know we have bad landlords.

1743
02:09:04,357 --> 02:09:06,379
[SPEAKER_40]: But you're lumping everybody into this issue.

1744
02:09:06,799 --> 02:09:17,186
[SPEAKER_40]: And you're going to destroy this community, whether it's rent control, whether it's taxing, whether it's whether it's an override, whether it's whatever it is, we're killing our homeowners.

1745
02:09:18,286 --> 02:09:18,447
[SPEAKER_40]: So

1746
02:09:21,383 --> 02:09:26,065
[SPEAKER_40]: And I know this is terrible, because now what's going to be spent tomorrow on social media?

1747
02:09:26,825 --> 02:09:28,105
[SPEAKER_40]: Scarpelli hates renters.

1748
02:09:29,566 --> 02:09:31,206
[SPEAKER_40]: I hate, I'll be honest with you.

1749
02:09:31,727 --> 02:09:40,850
[SPEAKER_40]: I've been fortunate enough to have in my father's home on Paris Street, to have five renters since we bought the house back in 1972.

1750
02:09:40,890 --> 02:09:46,712
[SPEAKER_40]: And out of those five renters, because of a good landlord, like my brother and my father,

1751
02:09:47,632 --> 02:09:51,455
[SPEAKER_40]: Four of those people have gone on to purchase homes in Medford because they work with them.

1752
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:05,047
[SPEAKER_40]: The other thing is, I've heard this tonight too, that of course the real estate associations are pushing this all because the real estate has nothing to do with the true homeowners.

1753
02:10:05,528 --> 02:10:13,975
[SPEAKER_40]: But if you look out in the audience and we do have real estate, a bunch of real estate agents, but the common denominator with those real estate agents are, they all live in Medford.

1754
02:10:15,848 --> 02:10:20,652
[SPEAKER_40]: and at least for the most part have lived in Medford and that I've talked to.

1755
02:10:21,013 --> 02:10:27,919
[SPEAKER_40]: So the whole idea is, the whole understanding that they're getting 7% on purchasing, that's why they're doing this.

1756
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:31,602
[SPEAKER_40]: No, really, the homeowners are getting nervous.

1757
02:10:32,343 --> 02:10:40,610
[SPEAKER_40]: They're saying, holy cow, I'm gonna sell my house now, or I'm gonna raise my rent to $5,000, because if it does go to rent control, I wanna be ahead of it.

1758
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:43,339
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the fear that we're causing here.

1759
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:51,134
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know if you guys understand this, because maybe you haven't lived in a home or run a home in Medford and understand the true impact, but it's dangerous.

1760
02:10:52,324 --> 02:10:55,788
[SPEAKER_40]: So like I said, there's a lot of movement.

1761
02:10:56,388 --> 02:11:03,956
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll read some comments from residents that have reached out to me to ask me to read things that couldn't be here.

1762
02:11:04,336 --> 02:11:08,621
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'll do that later, because I know there are a lot of people that wanna talk, but we have to understand something.

1763
02:11:08,681 --> 02:11:11,264
[SPEAKER_40]: This isn't just an issue that's gonna go to subcommittee.

1764
02:11:11,804 --> 02:11:14,506
[SPEAKER_40]: or go to a committee or where we can maneuver.

1765
02:11:14,847 --> 02:11:25,095
[SPEAKER_40]: You have to understand there's a huge fear in this community from renters and homeowners that what we're trying to do, what we're proposing to do is going to change their lives dramatically.

1766
02:11:26,656 --> 02:11:28,097
[SPEAKER_40]: So I just want you aware of that.

1767
02:11:28,137 --> 02:11:28,438
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1768
02:11:38,130 --> 02:11:39,431
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1769
02:11:39,951 --> 02:11:44,195
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think that this matters because you're allowed to run for City Council.

1770
02:11:44,776 --> 02:11:51,422
[SPEAKER_30]: If you live in Medford whether you're a renter or a homeowner but I do own my home, and it keeps being brought up so I feel the need to mention it.

1771
02:11:52,143 --> 02:11:57,668
[SPEAKER_30]: My mother was displaced from Medford a couple of years ago because she couldn't afford to buy a home.

1772
02:11:58,809 --> 02:12:09,201
[SPEAKER_30]: And she couldn't afford her rent anymore in Medford so she moved to the North Shore, she was living in Medford to be close to me and close to my kids, and she was displaced because she couldn't afford it.

1773
02:12:09,281 --> 02:12:11,283
[SPEAKER_30]: She's on a fixed income and she's retired.

1774
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:16,642
[SPEAKER_30]: So I have experience with this.

1775
02:12:16,702 --> 02:12:17,883
[SPEAKER_30]: I know what it's like.

1776
02:12:18,063 --> 02:12:23,407
[SPEAKER_30]: I also help run the Malden Warming Center, which is a seasonal homeless shelter in Malden.

1777
02:12:24,148 --> 02:12:30,473
[SPEAKER_30]: We don't have a warming center in Medford, but we have guests at the Malden Warming Center who are from Medford.

1778
02:12:31,714 --> 02:12:38,560
[SPEAKER_30]: I know at least two people who are from Medford, grew up here, went to high school here, and who have families here.

1779
02:12:39,184 --> 02:12:40,724
[SPEAKER_30]: whose family had homes here.

1780
02:12:42,085 --> 02:12:44,966
[SPEAKER_30]: And for various reasons, they became homeless.

1781
02:12:45,206 --> 02:12:53,188
[SPEAKER_30]: And the executive director and I were talking this year about how there were so many new guests at the warming center this year.

1782
02:12:53,228 --> 02:12:55,669
[SPEAKER_30]: And I was asking him, what do you think is going on this year?

1783
02:12:55,689 --> 02:12:56,709
[SPEAKER_30]: It's different than last year.

1784
02:12:57,269 --> 02:12:58,209
[SPEAKER_30]: The weather's not worse.

1785
02:12:58,309 --> 02:12:59,650
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not, you know,

1786
02:13:00,919 --> 02:13:02,260
[SPEAKER_30]: doesn't seem significantly different.

1787
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:03,721
[SPEAKER_30]: I wonder why there's so many new guests.

1788
02:13:04,021 --> 02:13:10,025
[SPEAKER_30]: And he said, I really think it's the cost of living and the cost of housing in our region.

1789
02:13:10,706 --> 02:13:13,027
[SPEAKER_30]: It's getting really expensive to live.

1790
02:13:13,047 --> 02:13:17,911
[SPEAKER_47]: Please just like show basic decency.

1791
02:13:19,055 --> 02:13:25,501
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just think that the affordable housing issue is incredibly important to our community.

1792
02:13:25,661 --> 02:13:34,888
[SPEAKER_30]: It's incredibly important that we continue to find diverse streams to continue to fund our, um,

1793
02:13:50,643 --> 02:13:51,544
[SPEAKER_47]: We can wait, guys.

1794
02:13:52,225 --> 02:13:53,887
I've been called.

1795
02:13:54,007 --> 02:13:54,948
Is that Johnny?

1796
02:13:54,968 --> 02:13:55,749
Hi, Johnny.

1797
02:13:55,849 --> 02:13:58,972
[SPEAKER_53]: It's nice to see you.

1798
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:05,471
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry.

1799
02:14:05,491 --> 02:14:07,613
[SPEAKER_29]: You've been so horrible tonight.

1800
02:14:07,973 --> 02:14:14,519
[SPEAKER_29]: You've been so I don't understand.

1801
02:14:15,179 --> 02:14:16,220
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't understand.

1802
02:14:22,486 --> 02:14:27,689
[SPEAKER_29]: We have run on a platform of affordable housing.

1803
02:14:27,749 --> 02:14:31,312
[SPEAKER_29]: Matt talked about this at the doors, Anna talked about it at the doors, and I did.

1804
02:14:31,832 --> 02:14:33,213
[SPEAKER_29]: And Justin did and Zach did.

1805
02:14:33,553 --> 02:14:37,336
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not sure if George did, but I know that we all ran on it and we won on it.

1806
02:14:37,496 --> 02:14:40,137
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is important to us and we are going to fight for it.

1807
02:14:40,618 --> 02:14:42,059
[SPEAKER_29]: And we're gonna hear all of you.

1808
02:14:42,079 --> 02:14:44,320
[SPEAKER_29]: And we're gonna respectfully hear you.

1809
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:46,141
[SPEAKER_29]: We always respectfully hear you.

1810
02:14:46,161 --> 02:14:46,862
[SPEAKER_52]: Good luck with that.

1811
02:14:55,129 --> 02:14:55,489
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes.

1812
02:14:56,749 --> 02:14:56,969
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes.

1813
02:14:57,009 --> 02:14:57,250
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes.

1814
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:57,590
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes.

1815
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:27,402
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Tseng?

1816
02:15:27,482 --> 02:15:27,723
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1817
02:15:27,883 --> 02:15:28,485
[SPEAKER_52]: President Bears?

1818
02:15:28,565 --> 02:15:30,551
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none in the negative.

1819
02:15:30,591 --> 02:15:31,534
[SPEAKER_47]: The motion passes.

1820
02:15:31,574 --> 02:15:32,797
[SPEAKER_47]: We're in recess for 15 minutes.

1821
02:35:56,069 --> 02:35:57,110
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, everybody.

1822
02:35:57,230 --> 02:36:02,353
[SPEAKER_48]: If we could end our conversations or take our private conversations out in the hall, we're gonna restart.

1823
02:36:02,874 --> 02:36:11,440
[SPEAKER_47]: I wanna thank my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli, for reminding us about how to have a respectful and open public meeting.

1824
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:13,621
[SPEAKER_47]: We do want to hear from everyone.

1825
02:36:14,882 --> 02:36:19,926
[SPEAKER_47]: Everyone will have five minutes to speak as per the council rules.

1826
02:36:21,476 --> 02:36:24,878
[SPEAKER_47]: We have the line, I think, relatively well-maintained from before our recess.

1827
02:36:24,898 --> 02:36:26,718
[SPEAKER_47]: We also have a number of people on Zoom.

1828
02:36:27,739 --> 02:36:29,580
[SPEAKER_47]: So we're gonna come out of recess now.

1829
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:30,440
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, everyone.

1830
02:36:31,861 --> 02:36:34,242
[SPEAKER_47]: And Councilor Lazzaro had the floor.

1831
02:36:34,262 --> 02:36:36,923
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there anything you'd like to say further, Councilor Lazzaro?

1832
02:36:37,583 --> 02:36:38,164
[SPEAKER_30]: No, thank you.

1833
02:36:38,204 --> 02:36:38,804
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm all set.

1834
02:36:38,924 --> 02:36:40,125
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

1835
02:36:40,245 --> 02:36:42,846
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comments or questions from members of the council?

1836
02:36:44,690 --> 02:36:47,392
[SPEAKER_43]: Councilor Tseng, Thank you, President Bears.

1837
02:36:47,952 --> 02:37:00,781
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, this is especially for the folks watching at home but I wanted to explain a little bit about where I'm where I stand on this issue because I think all voters deserve to know what I'm thinking right now.

1838
02:37:01,841 --> 02:37:04,803
[SPEAKER_43]: I have to be very clear about what's before us tonight.

1839
02:37:04,863 --> 02:37:13,726
[SPEAKER_43]: We're merely debating whether to send this idea to a subcommittee for further study, and we do this with essentially any issue, whether we support it or oppose it as a council.

1840
02:37:15,487 --> 02:37:23,831
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a first step in a multi-month process that, as my colleagues have alluded to, would have to be approved by the mayor, the state house, and the governor.

1841
02:37:24,971 --> 02:37:29,033
[SPEAKER_43]: And even during that process, we will have lots of public meetings.

1842
02:37:30,253 --> 02:37:40,360
[SPEAKER_43]: this committee process is, in my eyes, really crucial to what gets voted on at the end of the day and where I will stand on it at the end of the day.

1843
02:37:41,941 --> 02:37:55,229
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that we need to discuss exemptions for owner-occupants, seniors, family members, and talk about a threshold with which, under that amount, we wouldn't be setting that tax.

1844
02:37:57,489 --> 02:38:13,082
[SPEAKER_43]: When we talk about this real estate transfer fee, I think it's really important to note that we can discuss it as a 2% tax, but that wouldn't be the most honest way of discussing it, especially if there's a threshold.

1845
02:38:13,502 --> 02:38:19,767
[SPEAKER_43]: If there's a threshold, for example, set at $1 million, if the property is $1.2 million, the tax is actually effectively only 0.17%.

1846
02:38:22,359 --> 02:38:40,439
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, the it's also I think important to note that, yes, we do have CPA funding but at our last public open CPA meeting, the staff has been very clear that we need much more money to set up a successful affordable housing trust that that funding is not nearly enough.

1847
02:38:40,959 --> 02:38:54,586
[SPEAKER_43]: to fund affordable housing, and that they broke down how they're spending that money, and there has been very widespread support of how that money is being spent, including a 7-0 vote on City Council.

1848
02:38:56,630 --> 02:39:12,678
[SPEAKER_43]: With regards to going back to this idea of the committee process, I spent the last few days doing a lot of deep diving into long, long economic research papers and policy reports about transfer fee and economic research from

1849
02:39:13,138 --> 02:39:36,577
[SPEAKER_43]: scholars at schools like Columbia, U Michigan, from national government economic research bodies, Institute of Public Studies, the Boston Globe, have all emphasized that the effect on this tax on economic growth and housing affordability hinges on this design process and committee, where we can design the fee to largely affect large developers building luxury housing,

1850
02:39:37,077 --> 02:39:43,143
[SPEAKER_43]: and we can actually use levers to relieve other economic burdens on home ownership.

1851
02:39:43,663 --> 02:39:52,391
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, rather regrettably, I think some folks have misunderstood or mischaracterized this policy issue by making it sound like we're doing something we're not doing.

1852
02:39:52,772 --> 02:39:54,093
[SPEAKER_43]: That's not how we operate.

1853
02:39:54,433 --> 02:40:01,279
[SPEAKER_43]: We have rules that we need to follow, and we follow procedure on big issues like this because we know that oftentimes they can be controversial.

1854
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:02,600
[SPEAKER_43]: in the city.

1855
02:40:02,620 --> 02:40:08,525
[SPEAKER_43]: As a young and lifelong Medford resident as someone who wants to stay in the city, but is worried of being priced out.

1856
02:40:08,705 --> 02:40:09,826
[SPEAKER_43]: I understand that perspective.

1857
02:40:09,886 --> 02:40:12,588
[SPEAKER_43]: I understand that we are in a housing crisis.

1858
02:40:13,088 --> 02:40:19,492
[SPEAKER_43]: I also understand that the economic growth of our city in our state is lacking because people can't afford to stay here.

1859
02:40:19,913 --> 02:40:26,237
[SPEAKER_43]: Think Matt referred to the letter that we received from many residents, longtime residents of Medford, who are now being

1860
02:40:32,602 --> 02:40:37,485
[SPEAKER_43]: who use our services and who contribute to our city as well, who volunteer.

1861
02:40:38,605 --> 02:40:44,149
[SPEAKER_43]: But, you know, as a son of long-time Etrovert homeowners, I also see that side of the discourse intimately as well.

1862
02:40:44,809 --> 02:40:54,935
[SPEAKER_43]: And ultimately, you know, I would probably, my family and I contribute to my parents' fund as well, which they use to pay taxes and property taxes.

1863
02:40:56,516 --> 02:40:56,877
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, I,

1864
02:40:58,626 --> 02:41:06,708
[SPEAKER_43]: This might not be the best policy for me as a person, but ultimately my vote hinges on what is best in a well-rounded sense for a city.

1865
02:41:07,348 --> 02:41:19,032
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, our job as elected officials is to balance interests, to balance not just one constituency's needs or ideas or propositions, but to marry them with all others.

1866
02:41:20,712 --> 02:41:38,379
[SPEAKER_43]: That's why my vote will ultimately hinge on the final product that we produce in committee, which will only come after a months-long process, a public process that takes into account the value perspectives from people in our city, be it angry, happy, supportive, opposing.

1867
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:48,604
[SPEAKER_43]: And I invite everyone to stay engaged with this process over the next few months, but I do ask for that discourse to be respectful,

1868
02:41:49,284 --> 02:41:53,625
[SPEAKER_43]: to be understanding, and we might disagree, but we cannot be disagreeable.

1869
02:41:55,585 --> 02:41:56,526
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1870
02:41:56,546 --> 02:41:58,086
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Callahan.

1871
02:41:58,106 --> 02:41:58,946
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1872
02:41:59,486 --> 02:42:02,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I am going to reiterate what has been already said a number of times.

1873
02:42:03,727 --> 02:42:09,029
[SPEAKER_08]: All we are voting on tonight is whether we are allowed to discuss this topic.

1874
02:42:09,509 --> 02:42:13,950
[SPEAKER_08]: So anything that comes before us has to get a number and go to committee.

1875
02:42:14,980 --> 02:42:16,242
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we start the process.

1876
02:42:17,064 --> 02:42:18,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we have a discussion.

1877
02:42:18,847 --> 02:42:25,179
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we also continue to get public input as we craft any sort of legislation of any kind.

1878
02:42:26,754 --> 02:42:34,700
[SPEAKER_08]: We literally don't have a single word written about what kind of transfer fee we would do because we can't until we get a number and we send it to committee.

1879
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:39,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to take months because we're going to take a lot of input from the committee.

1880
02:42:39,603 --> 02:42:47,389
[SPEAKER_08]: So as far as having a well-functioning democracy and being able to discuss important issues, this is how it starts.

1881
02:42:48,129 --> 02:42:50,890
[SPEAKER_08]: We're only voting on whether we can discuss this issue.

1882
02:42:51,070 --> 02:42:52,351
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is what we're voting on tonight.

1883
02:42:53,771 --> 02:42:58,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I also really want people to have a little bit of understanding.

1884
02:42:58,653 --> 02:43:01,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I know way too much about state politics.

1885
02:43:02,035 --> 02:43:13,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can tell you that of any communities that have passed a real estate transfer fee, as with many other housing related issues, the state does not approve them.

1886
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:15,961
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is going to happen

1887
02:43:17,677 --> 02:43:21,505
[SPEAKER_08]: is if we are lucky enough to pass anything,

1888
02:43:22,557 --> 02:43:24,418
[SPEAKER_08]: that is related to a real estate transfer fee.

1889
02:43:24,978 --> 02:43:27,519
[SPEAKER_08]: It will not be approved by the state.

1890
02:43:28,399 --> 02:43:35,582
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing likely to come out through the state is what is gonna be very similar to Governor Healey's proposition.

1891
02:43:36,102 --> 02:43:42,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Governor Healey's proposition, just so you know, is 1% on either side.

1892
02:43:43,724 --> 02:43:47,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing will affect anyone who sells a house less than a million dollars.

1893
02:43:49,068 --> 02:43:52,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only tax is on what is over a million dollars.

1894
02:43:52,330 --> 02:43:57,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you sell your house for $1.1 million, the total tax for you is $1,000.

1895
02:43:57,312 --> 02:44:01,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I hope I can assuage some people's fears.

1896
02:44:02,835 --> 02:44:13,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really hope that we can have a respectful discussion tonight and that you all can participate in our many months long discussion that we hopefully will be about to begin.

1897
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:19,205
[SPEAKER_08]: that will happen in perfectly open committee meetings, which we invite you all to come to.

1898
02:44:19,586 --> 02:44:19,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1899
02:44:24,670 --> 02:44:27,453
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, I wouldn't say it's impossible that the state would approve it.

1900
02:44:27,473 --> 02:44:41,065
[SPEAKER_42]: But even having having the home rule petitions like this come to the state house from multiple communities does really emphasize to, um, the state government that this is something that communities really need help on.

1901
02:44:41,105 --> 02:44:45,248
[SPEAKER_42]: I just like to touch on to, um, two other points because I was conversing

1902
02:44:50,473 --> 02:44:59,738
[SPEAKER_42]: this is a particular item that I think that I think has received a lot of outsized attention compared to a lot of other things City Council is doing when it comes to affording the to funding the affordable housing to us.

1903
02:44:59,758 --> 02:45:02,360
[SPEAKER_42]: We're not definitely not putting all of our eggs in this basket.

1904
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:10,805
[SPEAKER_42]: Later on in the agenda, I have three resolutions to update linkage fees, which haven't been updated since the 1990s.

1905
02:45:11,285 --> 02:45:17,688
[SPEAKER_42]: There's other things that are going through committee right now related to shortening the

1906
02:45:18,809 --> 02:45:26,053
[SPEAKER_42]: that there is a window that developers have to sit on property, which would therefore shorten the overall development time.

1907
02:45:26,073 --> 02:45:35,399
[SPEAKER_42]: It's just that this particular resolution, I think, just due to some unfortunate, um, timing and obviously poor optics.

1908
02:45:35,459 --> 02:45:39,381
[SPEAKER_42]: What was the three weeks in between meetings has just received, um, a lot of

1909
02:45:45,691 --> 02:45:46,551
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

1910
02:45:46,591 --> 02:45:56,516
[SPEAKER_47]: And he didn't mention that this council in its previous term also passed the first zoning recodification in 60 years, and we are working on a comprehensive zoning reform project for the next 18 months.

1911
02:45:57,716 --> 02:46:00,717
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comments by members of the council before we open up for public participation?

1912
02:46:02,238 --> 02:46:04,439
[SPEAKER_47]: Seeing none, name and address for the record, please.

1913
02:46:05,148 --> 02:46:06,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Councilors.

1914
02:46:06,869 --> 02:46:08,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate the opportunity to be here.

1915
02:46:09,111 --> 02:46:10,392
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rebecca Amami.

1916
02:46:11,132 --> 02:46:13,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 12 ship Avenue number seven.

1917
02:46:13,754 --> 02:46:15,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not only here as a homeowner.

1918
02:46:16,236 --> 02:46:24,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here as a resident, and I'm here as a member of my HOA board, which consists of 20 units, 16 of which are owner occupied.

1919
02:46:28,683 --> 02:46:33,986
[SPEAKER_07]: For perspective, and I apologize, it is late and I'm going to read because it's been a long day.

1920
02:46:35,507 --> 02:46:38,789
[SPEAKER_07]: For perspective, I am a senior vice president at United Way.

1921
02:46:39,289 --> 02:46:47,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior to my role, I was a partner with New Profit, a funding intermediary that specifically funds and studies economic mobility.

1922
02:46:47,114 --> 02:46:56,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a deep understanding of what hinders families and individuals from taking advantage of economic opportunities available to them, and I hold a master's degree in social work.

1923
02:46:58,564 --> 02:47:04,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a few points here of why this shouldn't move forward, and I believe many people in this room would agree.

1924
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:11,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I also have recommendations for moving forward, as I assume you all will still vote in the affirmative for this to be discussed in committee.

1925
02:47:11,559 --> 02:47:15,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I am here, oh, sorry, I read that away.

1926
02:47:16,286 --> 02:47:21,208
[SPEAKER_07]: All of our homes in our HOA are currently valued at over $750,000.

1927
02:47:23,029 --> 02:47:29,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So this could, if indeed a million dollars is not the floor, could impact us all.

1928
02:47:29,631 --> 02:47:34,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if we hold on to our homes for a number of more years, it will most certainly impact us all.

1929
02:47:36,134 --> 02:47:45,740
[SPEAKER_07]: While I understand the immense value this can result in for cities and towns, this bill would also directly impact the economic mobility of residents.

1930
02:47:46,421 --> 02:47:53,986
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, an elderly couple who has lived in their home for over 50 years, it is paid off and valued at over a million dollars.

1931
02:47:54,646 --> 02:47:57,168
[SPEAKER_07]: That money is needed for them to go into assisted living.

1932
02:47:58,174 --> 02:48:00,617
[SPEAKER_07]: For many residents, their home is their nest egg.

1933
02:48:00,917 --> 02:48:09,786
[SPEAKER_07]: A home of a million dollars, or even indeed $750,000, is no longer representative of the top percentiles of wealth in our region.

1934
02:48:10,854 --> 02:48:12,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It is actually a middle class home.

1935
02:48:13,157 --> 02:48:20,124
[SPEAKER_07]: This is damaging to our families who are using the proceeds of sales and a starter home to afford, hopefully, a larger home.

1936
02:48:20,544 --> 02:48:24,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully, they're staying in Medford, unlike myself at the current moment.

1937
02:48:24,569 --> 02:48:25,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm currently moving to Belmont.

1938
02:48:26,391 --> 02:48:28,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And if anybody wants to know why, we can talk about it.

1939
02:48:31,966 --> 02:48:42,355
[SPEAKER_07]: If the council does insist on moving this forward, I recommend tying it to the amounts for conventional loans versus jumbo mortgage loans as dictated by the county by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

1940
02:48:42,935 --> 02:48:48,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently $860,000, that is only the mortgage amount, not the purchase amount of a home.

1941
02:48:50,962 --> 02:48:53,483
[SPEAKER_07]: is the cutoff for a jumbo loan.

1942
02:48:53,703 --> 02:49:03,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, assuming 10% down, reasonable for most buyers, but 20% is required for jumbo loans, that would put homes at well over $1.1 million.

1943
02:49:06,929 --> 02:49:12,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love the information on exactly what percentage of homes in Medford are sold at over $1 million.

1944
02:49:12,811 --> 02:49:20,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And what percentage of those are developer owns at the point of sale versus resident to resident transfer.

1945
02:49:20,374 --> 02:49:35,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that should, if you guys are going to discuss it, there might be something to talk about where you have a developer who's bought a home, flipped it, it was not resident occupied, transferred within 18 months.

1946
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:40,283
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be something to consider of where you could put the tax.

1947
02:49:42,345 --> 02:49:47,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I also think we need a lot more transparency on how Medford intends to manage these funds.

1948
02:49:48,231 --> 02:49:53,355
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest red flag from all the emails that I was sending all of you over the last month

1949
02:49:54,344 --> 02:49:59,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the decision on how and why the funds will be spent is yet to even be discussed or defined.

1950
02:50:00,528 --> 02:50:02,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It can literally be anything you choose.

1951
02:50:03,230 --> 02:50:09,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and it can be redefined on any timeline, based on any undefined process.

1952
02:50:10,222 --> 02:50:20,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Taxes have a tendency of starting for the rich and then somehow always ending up taking the most from the middle class, which this feels like one of those instances to me.

1953
02:50:21,737 --> 02:50:27,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Higher taxes will become normalized and then we as a town will still need more money.

1954
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:35,006
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a short people, and just in general, have a short memory.

1955
02:50:35,326 --> 02:50:37,068
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just basic human condition.

1956
02:50:37,849 --> 02:50:44,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Once past the nuances will be forgotten and soon after the taxes are assumed, just how it is.

1957
02:50:44,696 --> 02:50:48,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no doubt that at some point in the past some other set of folks.

1958
02:50:49,221 --> 02:51:01,821
[SPEAKER_07]: and council members and homeowners have the exact same discussion about the 1.5% taxes, but no one remembers or knows what was spent or how or and it's just accepted as is.

1959
02:51:04,099 --> 02:51:11,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand also, and I empathize, that many of the city councilors are renters, and I believe you have a valid lived experience.

1960
02:51:12,024 --> 02:51:18,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do believe that many of you have a different lived experience than many of the people in this room.

1961
02:51:19,369 --> 02:51:26,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do openly question if you are the best people to be deciding the city's direction on this issue.

1962
02:51:26,394 --> 02:51:27,555
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Rebecca.

1963
02:51:28,536 --> 02:51:29,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for your time.

1964
02:51:34,246 --> 02:51:37,667
[SPEAKER_47]: This is the body that was elected to make decisions like these.

1965
02:51:39,108 --> 02:51:41,568
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Jimeno, I'm gonna go to Zoom and then come back to the podium.

1966
02:51:41,929 --> 02:51:44,009
[SPEAKER_47]: We're gonna go to Susan Gerard on Zoom.

1967
02:51:44,069 --> 02:51:48,911
[SPEAKER_47]: Susan, name and address for the record, please.

1968
02:51:49,231 --> 02:51:51,692
[SPEAKER_69]: 26 Farragut Avenue, Medford.

1969
02:51:52,652 --> 02:51:57,654
[SPEAKER_69]: I'm speaking as a resident of Medford for 43 years.

1970
02:51:59,454 --> 02:52:01,775
[SPEAKER_69]: We bought our first home in Medford for $60,000.

1971
02:52:04,911 --> 02:52:09,775
[SPEAKER_69]: And then at some point we exchanged it for a slightly smaller house for $450,000.

1972
02:52:09,815 --> 02:52:10,636
[SPEAKER_69]: And the home we're in now is worth $860,000.

1973
02:52:10,696 --> 02:52:15,940
[SPEAKER_69]: In other words, we have made an $800,000 profit on our home simply by living here for this length of time.

1974
02:52:30,047 --> 02:52:34,110
[SPEAKER_69]: I want to just emphasize what is being said again and again.

1975
02:52:34,130 --> 02:52:42,916
[SPEAKER_69]: In deference to Mr. Scarpelli, for Councilman Scarpelli, this is not about Proposition 2.5 overrides.

1976
02:52:43,416 --> 02:52:46,478
[SPEAKER_69]: This is not about rent control.

1977
02:52:46,498 --> 02:52:51,262
[SPEAKER_69]: This is simply about a real estate transfer fee of 1%

1978
02:52:53,363 --> 02:52:55,585
[SPEAKER_69]: on any amount over a million dollars.

1979
02:52:56,106 --> 02:52:59,950
[SPEAKER_69]: Somebody asked how many houses in Medford are over a million dollars.

1980
02:53:00,430 --> 02:53:03,754
[SPEAKER_69]: The statistic that I have heard is only four percent.

1981
02:53:05,155 --> 02:53:05,476
[SPEAKER_69]: Okay.

1982
02:53:06,886 --> 02:53:12,670
[SPEAKER_69]: I think that if someone owns a home of 4%, who is not, may I speak?

1983
02:53:12,830 --> 02:53:20,674
[SPEAKER_69]: Okay, who is not low income, because low income people can be exempted, people, elderly people can be exempted.

1984
02:53:21,255 --> 02:53:25,737
[SPEAKER_69]: If you have money, and have a million dollar house that you sell,

1985
02:53:26,858 --> 02:53:34,640
[SPEAKER_69]: you can afford to pay a small fee of that into an affordable housing trust.

1986
02:53:34,680 --> 02:53:38,461
[SPEAKER_69]: This is not a tax that goes into if it were done, okay.

1987
02:53:38,701 --> 02:53:44,963
[SPEAKER_69]: And again, this is a discussion that we can all have about what could be exempted, what could be done.

1988
02:53:45,723 --> 02:53:46,963
[SPEAKER_69]: I will say one more thing.

1989
02:53:47,123 --> 02:53:56,246
[SPEAKER_69]: I am one of many people in this town whose children could not afford to buy a house in this town because of the high cost of housing.

1990
02:53:56,786 --> 02:53:58,546
[SPEAKER_69]: They could not afford to live here.

1991
02:53:59,246 --> 02:54:08,629
[SPEAKER_69]: And people, young people in our church are leaving Medford who would provide wonderful things for our city, but cannot afford to live here.

1992
02:54:09,409 --> 02:54:23,082
[SPEAKER_69]: So for me, even if you taxed me at $860,000, which is what our house is currently valued at, after putting not that much into it, to be honest, we put in a patio, okay?

1993
02:54:24,403 --> 02:54:29,127
[SPEAKER_69]: In our former house, we took our dirt basement and made it a cement basement.

1994
02:54:29,508 --> 02:54:30,488
[SPEAKER_69]: Okay, from $60,000, we now have

1995
02:54:32,791 --> 02:54:41,679
[SPEAKER_69]: $860,000.

1996
02:54:33,531 --> 02:54:41,679
[SPEAKER_69]: And I will speak as an elderly person, because yes, we may pretty soon have to sell our house and go into assisted living.

1997
02:54:42,039 --> 02:54:43,741
[SPEAKER_69]: And that is a cost.

1998
02:54:44,201 --> 02:54:46,303
[SPEAKER_69]: But still, we will have that money.

1999
02:54:46,323 --> 02:54:47,905
[SPEAKER_69]: And I also say,

2000
02:54:48,305 --> 02:54:58,151
[SPEAKER_69]: that I know and have confidence that all the people in the city council will exempt anyone who is low income and has a million dollar house.

2001
02:54:58,491 --> 02:55:00,753
[SPEAKER_69]: So let's just have this discussion.

2002
02:55:01,233 --> 02:55:07,697
[SPEAKER_69]: I feel like I also wanna say something about all the comments about how terrible Medford has become.

2003
02:55:08,297 --> 02:55:14,101
[SPEAKER_69]: I've lived here, again, 43 years and I have found many improvements in Medford.

2004
02:55:14,321 --> 02:55:15,762
[SPEAKER_69]: Yes, I hate the potholes.

2005
02:55:15,962 --> 02:55:17,303
[SPEAKER_69]: We should fix the potholes.

2006
02:55:17,923 --> 02:55:21,946
[SPEAKER_69]: But we have a new police department.

2007
02:55:22,046 --> 02:55:23,607
[SPEAKER_69]: We have a new police station.

2008
02:55:24,108 --> 02:55:26,869
[SPEAKER_69]: We have a beautiful new library.

2009
02:55:27,270 --> 02:55:36,536
[SPEAKER_69]: We have the Chevalier Theater, which, thanks to CPA money, has been restored so that it's bringing money and wonderful theater into Medford.

2010
02:55:38,377 --> 02:55:41,178
[SPEAKER_69]: and helping many of the local restaurants in Medford.

2011
02:55:41,498 --> 02:55:43,159
[SPEAKER_69]: So there has been growth in Medford.

2012
02:55:43,399 --> 02:55:45,040
[SPEAKER_69]: We have a more diverse community.

2013
02:55:45,360 --> 02:55:48,221
[SPEAKER_69]: We have diverse restaurants now that we didn't have before.

2014
02:55:48,902 --> 02:55:51,403
[SPEAKER_69]: I miss the old movie theater, OK?

2015
02:55:51,743 --> 02:55:53,424
[SPEAKER_69]: That's something I miss, our movie theater.

2016
02:55:53,444 --> 02:55:55,244
[SPEAKER_69]: I wish we still had that in Medford Square.

2017
02:55:55,725 --> 02:56:00,687
[SPEAKER_69]: But let's not make this into an old Medford, new Medford.

2018
02:56:00,987 --> 02:56:02,348
[SPEAKER_69]: We need the young people.

2019
02:56:02,648 --> 02:56:03,768
[SPEAKER_69]: We need the old people.

2020
02:56:05,939 --> 02:56:07,941
[SPEAKER_69]: We need to care about everybody.

2021
02:56:08,501 --> 02:56:17,188
[SPEAKER_69]: And I think that, I know that the people in the city council care about everybody and will take into account the needs of everybody.

2022
02:56:17,589 --> 02:56:28,277
[SPEAKER_69]: So the anger, the shouting, the ugliness of this meeting is something that I have never seen before in Medford and I am completely disgusted by.

2023
02:56:28,798 --> 02:56:30,459
[SPEAKER_69]: Thank you very much for listening.

2024
02:56:30,479 --> 02:56:32,280
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Susan.

2025
02:56:34,505 --> 02:56:40,367
[SPEAKER_47]: And I would ask everyone to show, regardless of the content of the speech, the same respect to all speakers.

2026
02:56:40,748 --> 02:56:42,248
[SPEAKER_47]: And we should have showed the same respect to Ms.

2027
02:56:42,268 --> 02:56:43,148
[SPEAKER_47]: Giroir that we showed to Ms.

2028
02:56:43,168 --> 02:56:43,549
[SPEAKER_47]: Zimame.

2029
02:56:43,589 --> 02:56:44,009
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2030
02:56:45,449 --> 02:56:47,670
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Scott, I recognize you for a point of personal privilege.

2031
02:56:58,516 --> 02:56:59,216
[SPEAKER_40]: and how to fund that.

2032
02:56:59,256 --> 02:57:12,160
[SPEAKER_40]: Whether it's taxing homeowners, whether it's a $250 $250 million school and how to fund that, whether it's rent control, whether it's this tax, whether it's whether it's a proposition to an app override.

2033
02:57:12,661 --> 02:57:18,363
[SPEAKER_40]: That was my comments of why this issue has been so electrifying in this community.

2034
02:57:19,023 --> 02:57:20,283
[SPEAKER_40]: So I would appreciate that.

2035
02:57:20,603 --> 02:57:22,264
[SPEAKER_40]: But obviously, I also want to say two things.

2036
02:57:23,164 --> 02:57:26,705
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a this isn't a method is in a town.

2037
02:57:26,785 --> 02:57:27,325
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a city.

2038
02:57:27,705 --> 02:57:28,965
[SPEAKER_40]: I want everybody got to fix that.

2039
02:57:29,386 --> 02:57:30,506
[SPEAKER_40]: Because we hear that too much.

2040
02:57:31,646 --> 02:57:33,487
[SPEAKER_40]: And method is great.

2041
02:57:34,727 --> 02:57:35,687
[SPEAKER_40]: So we appreciate that.

2042
02:57:35,747 --> 02:57:36,107
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2043
02:57:36,747 --> 02:57:38,368
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you to the podium.

2044
02:57:38,948 --> 02:57:41,448
[SPEAKER_47]: And if you look in the top right of the screens, you'll see a timer.

2045
02:57:42,129 --> 02:57:43,889
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm seeing what there'll be a timer.

2046
02:57:44,009 --> 02:57:46,510
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to give you five minutes once you say I want your money.

2047
02:57:46,730 --> 02:57:47,470
[SPEAKER_70]: Thank you, sir.

2048
02:57:47,970 --> 02:57:50,891
[SPEAKER_70]: Five minutes is like the front of the line at Disney World.

2049
02:57:50,911 --> 02:57:52,291
[SPEAKER_70]: All right.

2050
02:57:54,042 --> 02:57:56,616
[SPEAKER_70]: Ron Giovino, 326 East Border Road, Medford.

2051
02:57:57,901 --> 02:58:03,606
[SPEAKER_70]: the value of having a genuine democracy, how to get a better democracy.

2052
02:58:04,227 --> 02:58:14,235
[SPEAKER_70]: When we talk about getting better representation or good representation, a city council or a school committee, it is not about getting people who are dedicated.

2053
02:58:14,916 --> 02:58:23,463
[SPEAKER_70]: It is about getting people who genuinely not only represent, but vote in favor of policies that even the scales,

2054
02:58:24,344 --> 02:58:43,469
[SPEAKER_70]: Our government in America, at all levels, overly supports and overly serves people who are wealthy, people who own property, people who are white collar, people who have white collar jobs, people who are overly educated, and people who are white.

2055
02:58:44,449 --> 02:58:45,929
[SPEAKER_70]: Where did we hear those words?

2056
02:58:46,710 --> 02:58:48,030
[SPEAKER_70]: Right on this side of the rail.

2057
02:58:49,249 --> 02:58:52,833
[SPEAKER_70]: at a Medford City Council Committee of the Whole meeting, January 17, 2024.

2058
02:58:53,594 --> 02:58:58,380
[SPEAKER_70]: The words concerned me at the time.

2059
02:58:59,281 --> 02:59:00,903
[SPEAKER_70]: I didn't really understand what they meant.

2060
02:59:01,564 --> 02:59:07,632
[SPEAKER_70]: It certainly didn't take long for this council to show its true feelings towards the property owners of this city.

2061
02:59:08,715 --> 02:59:24,818
[SPEAKER_70]: The obligation to provide a community wide solution, such as affordable housing is admirable and should be paid for by the entire community that plan should have been implemented decades ago, but it wasn't.

2062
02:59:25,734 --> 02:59:43,065
[SPEAKER_70]: This proposed tax scheme is inequitable and discriminatory as it would single out a small segment of the population, specifically buyers and sellers, to pay for a community-wide need responsibility that has been neglected in Medford.

2063
02:59:44,286 --> 02:59:48,789
[SPEAKER_70]: Now I ask each council member to take a look over my shoulder into the crowd.

2064
02:59:49,975 --> 02:59:52,257
[SPEAKER_70]: see some of the property owners who came here tonight.

2065
02:59:53,057 --> 03:00:18,095
[SPEAKER_70]: They are the firefighters, the police, the teachers, the healthcare workers, the DPW, the government workers, the union workers, the veterans, the senior citizens, the people who volunteered when COVID was still an unknown danger, the people who volunteered for youth sports and other youth activities, the volunteers who run charities for those in need, our neighbors, our friends,

2066
03:00:19,008 --> 03:00:22,585
[SPEAKER_70]: The people who have worked hard just to pay the bills.

2067
03:00:24,688 --> 03:00:31,013
[SPEAKER_70]: They are the people who helped make Medford the great place that everybody wants to live.

2068
03:00:31,533 --> 03:00:49,066
[SPEAKER_70]: Now, to honor these property owners, many of whom lived for decades in Medford, you have determined that when they are ready to cash out of Medford and no longer own property, instead of giving them a standing ovation or a big hug of appreciation,

2069
03:00:49,887 --> 03:00:51,368
[SPEAKER_70]: for what they did for the city.

2070
03:00:52,129 --> 03:01:02,097
[SPEAKER_70]: You are deciding tonight to start conversations about stealing 2% of the equity, up to 2% of the equity they earned to give to Affordable Housing Fund.

2071
03:01:04,279 --> 03:01:07,142
[SPEAKER_70]: When did we stop thinking?

2072
03:01:08,943 --> 03:01:11,986
[SPEAKER_70]: I respectfully submit an alternative solution.

2073
03:01:13,308 --> 03:01:16,689
[SPEAKER_70]: Why wouldn't you all look at an exit tax for those who rent in Medford?

2074
03:01:17,170 --> 03:01:21,071
[SPEAKER_70]: It would be a 2% tax based on the rent they paid and how long they paid it.

2075
03:01:21,771 --> 03:01:26,013
[SPEAKER_70]: That money would go directly to affordable housing for future fellow renters.

2076
03:01:27,094 --> 03:01:38,498
[SPEAKER_70]: Now, if this resolution was sponsored and proposed, you'd probably quickly shoot it down because it asks a specific group of citizens to be the only ones to bear the burden of affordable housing.

2077
03:01:39,218 --> 03:01:42,700
[SPEAKER_70]: And it would also make Medford a less desirable place to move to.

2078
03:01:43,882 --> 03:01:47,703
[SPEAKER_70]: Well, that is exactly my point.

2079
03:01:49,503 --> 03:01:52,504
[SPEAKER_70]: We need to stop tonight.

2080
03:01:53,184 --> 03:01:58,245
[SPEAKER_70]: It's not a rainy, let's establish a rainy day fund account and we'll see what happens down the road.

2081
03:01:58,545 --> 03:02:01,526
[SPEAKER_70]: Well, let's start talking about this and we'll see what happens down the road.

2082
03:02:01,986 --> 03:02:03,446
[SPEAKER_70]: We're not gonna be fooled anymore.

2083
03:02:04,186 --> 03:02:07,627
[SPEAKER_70]: Vote no on this tonight and stop that discussion.

2084
03:02:18,049 --> 03:02:18,449
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

2085
03:02:18,489 --> 03:02:20,870
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm going to go to Roberta Cameron on Zoom.

2086
03:02:26,432 --> 03:02:27,272
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

2087
03:02:27,652 --> 03:02:28,393
[SPEAKER_47]: Five minutes.

2088
03:02:29,053 --> 03:02:31,974
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you, Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

2089
03:02:32,314 --> 03:02:33,735
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you for recognizing me.

2090
03:02:34,375 --> 03:02:45,519
[SPEAKER_56]: So I just want to quickly and emphatically speak in favor of your vote to have a discussion about requesting a home rule petition for a real estate transfer fee.

2091
03:02:46,380 --> 03:02:53,327
[SPEAKER_56]: It is very important for the city to explore more streams of revenue to fund the affordable housing trust.

2092
03:02:53,907 --> 03:03:02,476
[SPEAKER_56]: We have a housing crisis, while we debate about ways to raise revenue for the things we need through property taxes or in this case.

2093
03:03:03,036 --> 03:03:03,997
[SPEAKER_56]: Transfer fees.

2094
03:03:04,558 --> 03:03:17,530
[SPEAKER_56]: We've normalized rent increases in the double digits or mass evictions happening regularly across the city, half of Medford today doesn't enjoy the housing stability that homeowners enjoy.

2095
03:03:18,371 --> 03:03:37,746
[SPEAKER_56]: I would like to further acknowledge that our city Councilors actually reflect the range of housing arrangements that people have across the city in terms of homeowners renters and young adults who are living with their parents because they cannot yet afford to be either a homeowner or renter.

2096
03:03:38,226 --> 03:03:40,789
[SPEAKER_56]: and hope to have a future living in Medford.

2097
03:03:41,370 --> 03:03:45,634
[SPEAKER_56]: I am the parent of children who are in that situation right now.

2098
03:03:46,435 --> 03:03:51,541
[SPEAKER_56]: But mostly I wanted to correct the record with respect to CPA expenditures.

2099
03:03:51,981 --> 03:03:56,746
[SPEAKER_56]: In the last two years alone, the City, the Community Preservation Committee

2100
03:03:57,387 --> 03:04:26,987
[SPEAKER_56]: has dedicated nearly $2 million on affordable housing proposals, and over the past six years that CPA revenue has been collected and distributed across the city, about one third of the funding has gone to affordable housing with the other two thirds going to other incredibly important projects that are very, very well supported strongly supported across the city have had a transformative effect on our parks.

2101
03:04:27,507 --> 03:04:49,030
[SPEAKER_56]: and open spaces and the balance of CPA funding is about right as it is because if we change the balance to put all of it toward affordable housing, we won't have funds to be able to continue these improvements on our parks and historic buildings.

2102
03:04:50,359 --> 03:05:18,446
[SPEAKER_56]: We need to generate more revenue for the Affordable Housing Trust and to have more diverse streams of revenue, not all of it coming on the backs of any one type of contributor, that we need to diversify the streams of revenue so that the balance can be, it can be balanced across all of the residents and businesses that comprise our community.

2103
03:05:18,786 --> 03:05:19,106
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

2104
03:05:22,892 --> 03:05:23,613
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Roberta.

2105
03:05:24,673 --> 03:05:25,234
[SPEAKER_47]: Go to the podium.

2106
03:05:25,254 --> 03:05:27,375
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Cassinetti, name and address for the record, please.

2107
03:05:29,437 --> 03:05:33,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Andrew Paul Cassinetti, Cushing Street, East Medford.

2108
03:05:36,902 --> 03:05:37,542
[SPEAKER_13]: What time is it?

2109
03:05:39,244 --> 03:05:40,685
[SPEAKER_47]: Can I say time for you to get a watch?

2110
03:05:41,685 --> 03:05:41,846
[SPEAKER_47]: It's 10.15.

2111
03:05:41,906 --> 03:05:43,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't be a wise guy.

2112
03:05:43,967 --> 03:05:47,349
[SPEAKER_47]: He's trying to lighten it up a little bit.

2113
03:05:47,710 --> 03:05:48,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I already did that.

2114
03:05:48,450 --> 03:05:49,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Ham and cheese.

2115
03:05:50,805 --> 03:05:51,706
[SPEAKER_47]: It's 10, 15 p.m.

2116
03:05:52,847 --> 03:05:55,509
[SPEAKER_13]: 10, 15, May Eastern Standard, right?

2117
03:05:55,849 --> 03:05:56,970
[SPEAKER_13]: I got five minutes, sir.

2118
03:05:57,170 --> 03:05:58,051
[SPEAKER_47]: You've got 4.35 now.

2119
03:05:58,491 --> 03:06:18,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll agree, affordability is a monumental problem, but it's not my culpa, it's not my fault, and it's not these people's fault behind me either.

2120
03:06:20,745 --> 03:06:35,008
[SPEAKER_13]: To make matters much, much worse, this week, three years ago, rampant inflation started, the worst in 50 years since Carter's presidency.

2121
03:06:36,488 --> 03:06:40,889
[SPEAKER_13]: P.S., inflation is the most regressive tax of all.

2122
03:06:40,909 --> 03:06:43,290
[SPEAKER_13]: It's horrendous.

2123
03:06:43,930 --> 03:06:46,350
[SPEAKER_13]: It applies to everyone, but the rich don't feel it.

2124
03:06:48,331 --> 03:06:49,311
[SPEAKER_13]: It's against us all.

2125
03:06:51,400 --> 03:06:55,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Math does not lie, but people skew the numbers.

2126
03:06:57,405 --> 03:07:01,589
[SPEAKER_13]: In 1955, my father bought a 400, 250-year-old house.

2127
03:07:01,609 --> 03:07:04,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Poirot, Riviera, Asheville didn't buy the house.

2128
03:07:04,711 --> 03:07:11,417
[SPEAKER_13]: It used to be on High Street next to Gaffey's slash this and that, and they moved it to make Governor's Avenue.

2129
03:07:11,497 --> 03:07:14,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how they did it 150 years ago with logs and bulls.

2130
03:07:14,560 --> 03:07:16,201
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why the floors were all sag.

2131
03:07:16,221 --> 03:07:17,943
[SPEAKER_13]: He paid 11.5 for that house.

2132
03:07:20,287 --> 03:07:25,791
[SPEAKER_13]: His salary as an immigrant cook was probably $2.50 an hour.

2133
03:07:26,952 --> 03:07:28,893
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's $5,000 a year.

2134
03:07:28,973 --> 03:07:30,254
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a close guesstimate.

2135
03:07:30,935 --> 03:07:32,456
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not here for me to ask.

2136
03:07:33,056 --> 03:07:34,557
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's call it 15 grand.

2137
03:07:34,577 --> 03:07:36,058
[SPEAKER_13]: He's making five grand, so that's triple.

2138
03:07:37,099 --> 03:07:43,604
[SPEAKER_13]: The yearly salary qualified him to pay three times his annual salary, which is 15,000.

2139
03:07:43,924 --> 03:07:45,005
[SPEAKER_13]: He actually got it for less.

2140
03:07:46,656 --> 03:07:51,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Today, 2024 with $100,000 a year, I wouldn't know what that is.

2141
03:07:51,240 --> 03:07:54,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe some of you people know, maybe my guess is pretty right on, maybe it's not.

2142
03:07:55,704 --> 03:08:08,336
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm taking $100,000 figure today's salary times three years to qualify for the mortgage from the lender would let you allow you to buy a dwelling for 300,000.

2143
03:08:10,250 --> 03:08:11,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you gonna find a house for 300,000?

2144
03:08:12,893 --> 03:08:14,675
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2145
03:08:14,695 --> 03:08:15,376
[SPEAKER_13]: 600,000, probably.

2146
03:08:15,396 --> 03:08:18,120
[SPEAKER_13]: 900,000, that might happen.

2147
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:21,924
[SPEAKER_13]: So the point is, inflation is rampant.

2148
03:08:23,667 --> 03:08:28,593
[SPEAKER_13]: And my mother took care of the two children, and she didn't work.

2149
03:08:29,670 --> 03:08:41,858
[SPEAKER_13]: And he paid it with a rent that says $100 from his brother and $80 a month rent from his brother-in-law who he sponsored to come from Italy, the old fashioned way and get him a job.

2150
03:08:41,878 --> 03:08:45,860
[SPEAKER_13]: And he wanted me to kick in to buy three new heating systems.

2151
03:08:46,320 --> 03:08:48,562
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, sorry, I'm going to Woodstock, I'm done.

2152
03:08:48,582 --> 03:08:50,223
[SPEAKER_13]: He sold the house.

2153
03:08:52,780 --> 03:08:55,342
[SPEAKER_13]: 40 grand you don't want to hear the rest so I'm going to cut that short.

2154
03:08:55,822 --> 03:08:58,684
[SPEAKER_13]: The point is, I gave you people a solution.

2155
03:08:59,025 --> 03:09:04,568
[SPEAKER_13]: The last meeting, two minutes ago I was here, I guess that's a month ago or more.

2156
03:09:05,809 --> 03:09:08,531
[SPEAKER_13]: And I gave I had the city messenger.

2157
03:09:09,112 --> 03:09:16,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. LaPore give an old New York Post I had from January, and gave it to Councilor kick Carson.

2158
03:09:17,117 --> 03:09:19,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe she can hear and she remembers it.

2159
03:09:19,820 --> 03:09:20,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you can recall.

2160
03:09:20,941 --> 03:09:22,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if anyone read it.

2161
03:09:22,722 --> 03:09:24,684
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a solution to the housing problem.

2162
03:09:25,124 --> 03:09:27,426
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called co-op apartment shares.

2163
03:09:29,008 --> 03:09:30,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Co-op ownership.

2164
03:09:31,050 --> 03:09:34,813
[SPEAKER_13]: They do this in New York big time, probably 30 years ago to make it affordable.

2165
03:09:36,214 --> 03:09:39,077
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyways, I don't know if you people have any information on that.

2166
03:09:40,089 --> 03:09:44,331
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's done around Boston, has anyone done any homework to find that answer?

2167
03:09:44,911 --> 03:09:49,373
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have a housing problem, you should have checked that out in my humble opinion.

2168
03:09:50,134 --> 03:09:51,034
[SPEAKER_42]: Any answers?

2169
03:09:51,514 --> 03:09:51,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Answers?

2170
03:09:52,195 --> 03:09:53,936
[SPEAKER_42]: Go ahead.

2171
03:09:54,056 --> 03:09:57,577
[SPEAKER_42]: The basis for a lot of these programs is often money.

2172
03:09:57,637 --> 03:09:59,618
[SPEAKER_42]: So Somerville has a community land trust.

2173
03:09:59,678 --> 03:10:02,500
[SPEAKER_42]: It's just that they've had an affordable housing trust since like the 90s.

2174
03:10:02,520 --> 03:10:06,261
[SPEAKER_42]: So it's been accumulating money for years so that they could actually do that.

2175
03:10:06,321 --> 03:10:07,102
[SPEAKER_42]: I hear a lot of,

2176
03:10:07,822 --> 03:10:22,587
[SPEAKER_42]: programs like that that could address the housing crisis, the basis of it is always money, which we again we literally just instituted an affordable housing trust last year and this is one of the revenue streams we're investigating for it.

2177
03:10:22,868 --> 03:10:23,188
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2178
03:10:23,208 --> 03:10:26,329
[SPEAKER_47]: So let me I'm going to go to Councilor Collins point of personal privilege.

2179
03:10:30,034 --> 03:10:37,899
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, I'll follow up with Mr. Castagnetti after the meeting to thank him for sending along that New York Times Post article.

2180
03:10:37,979 --> 03:10:38,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

2181
03:10:38,880 --> 03:10:45,764
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just think it speaks to the point that we need to be pursuing every tool at our disposal when it comes to affordable housing that can work for everybody.

2182
03:10:47,365 --> 03:10:47,826
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2183
03:10:48,126 --> 03:10:49,967
[SPEAKER_47]: And your time has expired, Mr. Castagnetti.

2184
03:10:49,987 --> 03:10:50,808
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not fair.

2185
03:10:51,228 --> 03:10:52,329
[SPEAKER_13]: He took up some of my time.

2186
03:10:53,329 --> 03:10:54,610
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll give you 30 seconds.

2187
03:10:54,650 --> 03:10:55,671
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll give you 30 seconds.

2188
03:10:56,178 --> 03:11:05,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the point is, if you did it, we also, if it makes it more conducive and doable, we have three parcels of city land.

2189
03:11:05,401 --> 03:11:11,003
[SPEAKER_13]: One here, next to 93, one behind you, and one across from the senior citizens, their parking lot.

2190
03:11:11,423 --> 03:11:14,144
[SPEAKER_13]: So that might solve a big problem.

2191
03:11:15,765 --> 03:11:22,827
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would look into it if you have any things to do that's gonna help.

2192
03:11:25,289 --> 03:11:27,090
[SPEAKER_47]: You got 10 seconds, Mr. Castagnetti.

2193
03:11:27,870 --> 03:11:31,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is important, Councilor Beards.

2194
03:11:31,372 --> 03:11:32,392
[SPEAKER_13]: I never busted him.

2195
03:11:32,432 --> 03:11:33,332
[SPEAKER_13]: I got it.

2196
03:11:33,793 --> 03:11:34,253
[SPEAKER_47]: Can you come?

2197
03:11:34,353 --> 03:11:35,813
[SPEAKER_47]: Can you come back for a second round?

2198
03:11:36,274 --> 03:11:37,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let me finish my first round.

2199
03:11:38,495 --> 03:11:41,436
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, we need to let other people speak, Mr. Castagnetti.

2200
03:11:41,476 --> 03:11:42,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand.

2201
03:11:42,056 --> 03:11:48,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm I'm usually the one is your million dollar Mr. Castagnetti.

2202
03:11:48,419 --> 03:11:50,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but let me finish the point.

2203
03:11:50,700 --> 03:11:52,140
[SPEAKER_13]: The million dollar condo.

2204
03:11:52,800 --> 03:11:53,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Fussy Lansky.

2205
03:11:57,236 --> 03:12:13,860
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Castagnetti, if you could please... Mr. Castagnetti, if you could please step away from the... Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

2206
03:12:13,980 --> 03:12:14,540
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2207
03:12:16,201 --> 03:12:19,241
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to go to Leo on Zoom.

2208
03:12:20,041 --> 03:12:21,702
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2209
03:12:25,390 --> 03:12:28,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi all, thank you for listening and thank you for holding this.

2210
03:12:28,954 --> 03:12:29,775
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Leo.

2211
03:12:29,795 --> 03:12:33,799
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a Medford resident, 65 college up.

2212
03:12:35,121 --> 03:12:42,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to join tonight to show support for the resolution to consider real estate transfer fee.

2213
03:12:43,929 --> 03:13:00,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to Tufts University, I studied community health and can very much acknowledge that the housing crisis is very real, you know, mostly felt by widely, mostly felt by vulnerable populations.

2214
03:13:00,238 --> 03:13:09,303
[SPEAKER_12]: And so recognizing that unaffordable housing is really sort of causing

2215
03:13:10,882 --> 03:13:20,910
[SPEAKER_12]: severe physical and mental well-being for folks, it really is an important issue.

2216
03:13:21,330 --> 03:13:34,041
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that the real estate transfer fee can be a avenue to really combat this situation in an intentional manner.

2217
03:13:37,406 --> 03:13:45,371
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that housing is a human right and we in Medford should really approach this in an effective and efficient manner.

2218
03:13:45,652 --> 03:13:57,800
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I really want to also say, you know, I think we all mentioned this, but we can see the reality that affordable housing is very expensive to construct.

2219
03:13:58,260 --> 03:13:59,741
[SPEAKER_12]: It is also very necessary.

2220
03:14:01,282 --> 03:14:06,946
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the transfer fee would be an effective, efficient and equitable

2221
03:14:08,107 --> 03:14:14,234
[SPEAKER_12]: tool for raising the necessary funds for affordable housing and method.

2222
03:14:17,599 --> 03:14:25,148
[SPEAKER_12]: As mentioned before, this is sort of a widely supported tool for municipalities to use.

2223
03:14:26,235 --> 03:14:37,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Arlington, Boston, Brookline, Concord, Nantucket, Provincetown, Touro, Cambridge, Wellfleet, and Somerville have all passed Home Rule petitions.

2224
03:14:38,121 --> 03:14:42,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I recognize that this is only sort of a resolution to discuss this.

2225
03:14:44,184 --> 03:14:50,727
[SPEAKER_12]: So I really wanna just encourage, you know, for this to move forward.

2226
03:14:50,787 --> 03:14:53,649
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's a step in the right direction.

2227
03:14:53,829 --> 03:14:54,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2228
03:15:07,984 --> 03:15:08,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2229
03:15:08,845 --> 03:15:11,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue.

2230
03:15:12,148 --> 03:15:23,900
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to say that a comment that was made by, I can't think of her name right now, about the CPA funds that Cameron, Roberta Cameron, just to

2231
03:15:25,245 --> 03:15:32,868
[SPEAKER_00]: let people know that those CPA funds are property owners' tax money that they're charged a surcharge.

2232
03:15:33,488 --> 03:15:35,909
[SPEAKER_00]: This came about about five or six years ago.

2233
03:15:36,489 --> 03:15:44,152
[SPEAKER_00]: We were supposed to get rebates, matching funds from the state, but the state has stiffed the city of Method and others for the last several years.

2234
03:15:44,492 --> 03:15:45,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our money.

2235
03:15:46,653 --> 03:15:49,794
[SPEAKER_00]: It appeared that this money was coming out of the sky, you know, just dropping down.

2236
03:15:50,074 --> 03:15:52,435
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's our money, our property owners' money.

2237
03:15:52,995 --> 03:15:54,276
[SPEAKER_00]: So now,

2238
03:15:56,004 --> 03:16:01,669
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, it's not gonna take long to say this, but I've been listening and watching, and I've been in Medford for a long time.

2239
03:16:02,410 --> 03:16:14,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around the world, I've been in different countries, I've lived in different states, and I try to hold my peace, and I see some serious stuff going down here, and it's gotta stop.

2240
03:16:15,041 --> 03:16:19,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna present my little treatise here, and I hope you got your seatbelts on.

2241
03:16:21,547 --> 03:16:41,264
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that I am disappointed and angry, but not surprised in the least by the actions, attitudes, and discriminatory accusations towards our citizens that the current irresponsible and questionable motions being brought by the sitting council this evening is monumentally understated.

2242
03:16:42,465 --> 03:16:43,605
[SPEAKER_00]: The sitting council members

2243
03:16:44,423 --> 03:16:54,006
[SPEAKER_00]: supported, endorsed, and financed by the progressive socialist group Our Revolution, has furtively laid the groundwork to target and punish Medford citizens.

2244
03:16:54,566 --> 03:16:58,868
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, homeowners, business owners, taxpayers, and workers.

2245
03:16:59,248 --> 03:17:02,329
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just about everyone except themselves and their agenda.

2246
03:17:02,589 --> 03:17:02,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

2247
03:17:03,830 --> 03:17:07,551
[SPEAKER_00]: You have drawn that infamous red line in the sand, creating a schism

2248
03:17:08,550 --> 03:17:26,095
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, for all intents and purposes, the systematic and ultimate degradation of a city, along with its people, that stands proud, friendly, productive, prosperous, caring, diverse, in our favorite word, inclusive, for more years than most of you have walked the earth, but many more.

2249
03:17:26,775 --> 03:17:36,719
[SPEAKER_00]: You exercise ambiguous language when you attempt to introduce us to national political agendas under the guise of, it's good for Medford, when in fact it is not.

2250
03:17:37,339 --> 03:17:46,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Your efforts in these matters are not welcome, as are not your attempts to indoctrinate the Medford to a socialist system, not here, not now, not ever.

2251
03:17:47,243 --> 03:17:50,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I am steadfast in declaring that I have very little faith

2252
03:17:51,344 --> 03:18:02,374
[SPEAKER_00]: If any at all in all in your abilities to perform your duties as city Councilors, your lack of experience in life circus is pretty evident verbosity is not a substitute for performance.

2253
03:18:02,894 --> 03:18:06,097
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not fooled, and we are not fools.

2254
03:18:06,878 --> 03:18:07,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand this.

2255
03:18:08,496 --> 03:18:20,022
[SPEAKER_00]: We, the majority of Medford citizens, the hardworking property owners, the business owners, the longtime residents who for many years have contributed to and for the betterment of Medford, are the people who you work for, period.

2256
03:18:20,502 --> 03:18:21,683
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not your property.

2257
03:18:22,363 --> 03:18:30,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I refuse, as I hope we all do, to be treated as fodder for your political ideologies and schemes, none which are beneficial for this city.

2258
03:18:31,267 --> 03:18:36,010
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the place for you to build your curriculum vitae on the backs in the bank accounts

2259
03:18:37,327 --> 03:18:38,328
[SPEAKER_00]: of Medford citizens.

2260
03:18:39,028 --> 03:18:41,210
[SPEAKER_00]: What gives you the audacity to assume such?

2261
03:18:42,050 --> 03:19:04,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Your responsibility as city councilors when you took the oath of office was to ensure that we have a city made safe for its residents, schools, students, visitors, good streets, sidewalks, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, to welcome and support businesses so that they may flourish in also as important, if not most importantly, financial integrity, discipline, and acuity, which we are sorely lacking.

2262
03:19:05,265 --> 03:19:06,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix this first.

2263
03:19:07,047 --> 03:19:16,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burden us financially because we have a weak, ineffective, and irresponsible administration, and you lack the tools and experience needed to mitigate this problem.

2264
03:19:16,635 --> 03:19:17,976
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not your cash cow.

2265
03:19:18,377 --> 03:19:20,979
[SPEAKER_00]: You are paid extraordinarily well to perform your duties.

2266
03:19:21,400 --> 03:19:23,341
[SPEAKER_00]: We're waiting for our return on investment.

2267
03:19:24,162 --> 03:19:25,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anything on the horizon.

2268
03:19:26,224 --> 03:19:29,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do your job, attend to your resignation.

2269
03:19:29,287 --> 03:19:29,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2270
03:19:47,409 --> 03:19:49,152
[SPEAKER_53]: Let me unmute you.

2271
03:19:57,569 --> 03:20:00,112
[SPEAKER_73]: Hi there, Alex Lesnop, 30 Right Ave.

2272
03:20:01,293 --> 03:20:10,181
[SPEAKER_73]: I will first say that I do not think that real estate transfer fees necessarily are perfect policies, or even a policy that I would personally prefer.

2273
03:20:10,201 --> 03:20:19,891
[SPEAKER_73]: However, I can guarantee that most of you in that room would not like my alternative suggestions, which involve building a lot more housing like 100 Winchester Street with a lot less parking.

2274
03:20:21,099 --> 03:20:34,628
[SPEAKER_73]: Real estate transfer fees are not perfect, but there are ways to design them to make them effective, such as levying the fee on a per unit basis rather than the total cost of the property and exempting the first transfer of new construction so as not to discourage new development.

2275
03:20:35,349 --> 03:20:41,393
[SPEAKER_73]: Because of this, I am supportive of the resolution before the council tonight to discuss this proposal and make it as good as it can be.

2276
03:20:42,133 --> 03:20:47,437
[SPEAKER_73]: And I do not think that it matters in the least, but for the information of the large crowd in the room, I am a homeowner in Medford.

2277
03:20:48,195 --> 03:21:01,498
[SPEAKER_73]: If I were in the future to be subject to this tax, I would be proud for some of that money to go to the Affordable Housing Trust or a similar fund rather than solely into my pocket and the other places where the housing money goes.

2278
03:21:02,058 --> 03:21:03,118
[SPEAKER_73]: That was all I would like to say.

2279
03:21:03,138 --> 03:21:03,998
[SPEAKER_73]: Thank you very much.

2280
03:21:04,878 --> 03:21:05,539
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Alex.

2281
03:21:07,419 --> 03:21:07,899
[SPEAKER_40]: Excuse me.

2282
03:21:08,819 --> 03:21:10,400
[SPEAKER_40]: If we can, you're doing a great job.

2283
03:21:10,440 --> 03:21:11,320
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm so proud of you.

2284
03:21:11,740 --> 03:21:12,500
[SPEAKER_40]: Let's get through it.

2285
03:21:12,940 --> 03:21:13,960
[SPEAKER_40]: All right.

2286
03:21:14,981 --> 03:21:17,121
[SPEAKER_40]: Next, name and address the record at the podium.

2287
03:21:18,378 --> 03:21:21,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, my name is my role gas and street Medford.

2288
03:21:21,820 --> 03:21:36,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not prepared to speak tonight, but after I just see how the council's reaction your smug looks at the citizens who vote you in the taxpayers the homeowners.

2289
03:21:37,451 --> 03:21:38,252
[SPEAKER_11]: It is disgusting.

2290
03:21:39,389 --> 03:21:43,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I find that the people that are for this are usually the ones that are.

2291
03:21:43,972 --> 03:22:01,085
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not your pocket it's not your pot to be putting your pocket your hand into the pocket to take out from us homeowners to put in a fund that you feel that is necessary that you want, but you don't ask for the people's opinions or hear them before you discuss it further.

2292
03:22:04,972 --> 03:22:09,293
[SPEAKER_11]: If there are people that think that affordable housing, you know fund is necessary.

2293
03:22:11,053 --> 03:22:15,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting nonprofit, create that create a fund for that.

2294
03:22:15,955 --> 03:22:26,237
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to, but you cannot force us citizens to give you 2% of our money that we are saving for our children.

2295
03:22:27,877 --> 03:22:28,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I was.

2296
03:22:32,987 --> 03:22:37,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I have three children, three boys, older than you, one of them.

2297
03:22:38,268 --> 03:22:41,489
[SPEAKER_11]: And here you are telling us how we should be spending our money.

2298
03:22:42,209 --> 03:22:44,909
[SPEAKER_11]: You have no experience in budgeting.

2299
03:22:45,970 --> 03:22:55,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you bought a piece of property for you to know all the taxes when you sell, all the taxes at the closing costs that we already have to pay?

2300
03:22:58,432 --> 03:23:00,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Capital gains, et cetera.

2301
03:23:03,436 --> 03:23:14,881
[SPEAKER_11]: That being said, when you're talking about resignation, you know, five months ago, there was a town in Michigan that recalled all their council members.

2302
03:23:21,323 --> 03:23:28,726
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do not do the right things for the people that have elected you, it's not just a small group of people.

2303
03:23:29,827 --> 03:23:31,928
[SPEAKER_11]: A petition should be encouraged

2304
03:23:32,950 --> 03:23:37,553
[SPEAKER_11]: to be created to recall your seats and have you removed.

2305
03:23:41,796 --> 03:23:45,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it is not for the minority, it is for the majority.

2306
03:23:45,238 --> 03:23:47,699
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am an immigrant, first generation immigrant.

2307
03:23:47,939 --> 03:23:55,704
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't tell me how you're going to take more of my money when I have worked and saved as a single mother.

2308
03:23:56,305 --> 03:23:58,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that is for the future of my voice.

2309
03:24:02,912 --> 03:24:03,533
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

2310
03:24:03,553 --> 03:24:13,012
[SPEAKER_47]: I will note the city charter does not allow for recall elections.

2311
03:24:13,052 --> 03:24:14,815
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to go to Alex Giller on Zoom.

2312
03:24:17,317 --> 03:24:17,698
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2313
03:24:18,398 --> 03:24:23,343
[SPEAKER_39]: Um, my name is Alex Miller 55 for street Medford.

2314
03:24:24,404 --> 03:24:27,106
[SPEAKER_39]: I sit through a lot of city council meetings.

2315
03:24:28,067 --> 03:24:32,591
[SPEAKER_39]: This is actually my first one for Medford but I sit through some will Cambridge Arlington Melrose.

2316
03:24:33,632 --> 03:24:42,379
[SPEAKER_39]: Well, Melrose a little different but what I'm trying to get at with all that is saying, there's such a huge disconnection between

2317
03:24:43,396 --> 03:24:49,581
[SPEAKER_39]: The people that are in the room and the people that represent them right now at City Council, it's just plain tone deaf.

2318
03:24:49,641 --> 03:24:55,465
[SPEAKER_39]: I mean, you sit in Cambridge, you sit in Somerville, and everyone who's in the crowd is supporting you.

2319
03:24:56,245 --> 03:24:58,787
[SPEAKER_39]: And you have very little support here tonight.

2320
03:24:58,847 --> 03:25:03,491
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't mean that as a discouragement either, but I would like you guys to actually have your ears open.

2321
03:25:03,511 --> 03:25:09,335
[SPEAKER_39]: Because as of right now, I think I can predict how you guys are going to vote at the end of this night already, which is unfortunate.

2322
03:25:10,956 --> 03:25:24,082
[SPEAKER_39]: One thing I'd like to ask, though, so we keep saying, you know, all right, well, we'll give an exemption for this elderly, you know, low income, under a million dollars, maybe if it's two units or less, all these different exemptions.

2323
03:25:24,182 --> 03:25:28,584
[SPEAKER_39]: But then you say you want to have development and you need to have more housing in here.

2324
03:25:28,644 --> 03:25:29,944
[SPEAKER_39]: So then what do you have left?

2325
03:25:30,004 --> 03:25:31,865
[SPEAKER_39]: You have the large developers coming in.

2326
03:25:32,611 --> 03:25:38,317
[SPEAKER_39]: Well, you're now going to start discouraging the large developers by charging additional fees in order to come in here.

2327
03:25:38,357 --> 03:25:44,443
[SPEAKER_39]: I mean, right now we're trying to pass all these MBTA overlay districts and we're trying to revamp Mystic Ave.

2328
03:25:44,463 --> 03:25:47,567
[SPEAKER_39]: We're trying to revamp the Wellington overlay district.

2329
03:25:48,902 --> 03:25:55,648
[SPEAKER_39]: Don't you want everybody to put their best design forward instead of be trying to be building these massive luxury units.

2330
03:25:56,148 --> 03:26:08,018
[SPEAKER_39]: They're only going to serve people that are not here, but people that are going to then move into the area because of these high cost units because the developers now have to maximize how much money they're going to make per unit.

2331
03:26:08,778 --> 03:26:29,542
[SPEAKER_39]: and one side note to everyone who keeps saying we need less and less parking this this project on Winchester Street you don't you have net negative parking when you also are going to have two different commercial shops on the first floor that don't have any access by vehicle and yet you already are saying that you want 25 or so cars coming twice a day.

2332
03:26:29,562 --> 03:26:37,824
[SPEAKER_39]: I think we need to focus more on actually having affordable housing coming in instead of all of this

2333
03:26:39,551 --> 03:26:39,931
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't know.

2334
03:26:39,951 --> 03:26:42,092
[SPEAKER_39]: 2% doesn't solve anything.

2335
03:26:43,393 --> 03:26:45,094
[SPEAKER_39]: Start a fund, as somebody else said.

2336
03:26:45,534 --> 03:26:46,434
[SPEAKER_39]: Let people donate.

2337
03:26:46,454 --> 03:26:51,336
[SPEAKER_39]: All these people that are so eager and virtuistic that want to be able to contribute to this fund, then do it.

2338
03:26:51,836 --> 03:26:55,198
[SPEAKER_39]: Put as much money as you want and need, but don't force people's hands to do it.

2339
03:26:55,618 --> 03:26:58,039
[SPEAKER_39]: And don't change the force of development going forward.

2340
03:26:58,719 --> 03:26:59,520
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you for your time.

2341
03:27:00,520 --> 03:27:01,060
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2342
03:27:01,080 --> 03:27:06,603
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2343
03:27:06,623 --> 03:27:07,223
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

2344
03:27:11,343 --> 03:27:11,803
[SPEAKER_58]: It's not on.

2345
03:27:12,584 --> 03:27:12,885
[SPEAKER_47]: It's on.

2346
03:27:14,747 --> 03:27:17,189
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

2347
03:27:17,229 --> 03:27:21,433
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a former member of this August party, and back then it was an August party.

2348
03:27:21,453 --> 03:27:24,376
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd like to make a suggestion before we even start.

2349
03:27:24,817 --> 03:27:27,600
[SPEAKER_20]: There's many people in this room, and there's a long line behind me.

2350
03:27:28,080 --> 03:27:29,301
[SPEAKER_20]: The people at home can wait.

2351
03:27:29,341 --> 03:27:32,565
[SPEAKER_20]: They're in their own house, sitting in their own chairs, under their own roof.

2352
03:27:33,326 --> 03:27:34,467
[SPEAKER_20]: I would appreciate it if you do that.

2353
03:27:38,206 --> 03:27:38,786
[SPEAKER_20]: That's number one.

2354
03:27:38,806 --> 03:27:40,947
[SPEAKER_20]: Number two, let's get into the whole issue.

2355
03:27:41,348 --> 03:27:44,429
[SPEAKER_20]: You own a house, you pay taxes year in and year out.

2356
03:27:44,709 --> 03:27:46,390
[SPEAKER_20]: You get your water and sewer tax bill.

2357
03:27:46,590 --> 03:27:49,171
[SPEAKER_20]: Then you have an addendum that was picked on the water and sewer tax.

2358
03:27:49,331 --> 03:27:53,353
[SPEAKER_20]: Then you have the CPA tax, which is an end run on proposition two and a half.

2359
03:27:54,014 --> 03:27:58,216
[SPEAKER_20]: And now you're coming in here tonight and you're talking about possibly a transfer of tax.

2360
03:27:59,016 --> 03:28:03,497
[SPEAKER_20]: With all due respect, Councilor, you said it's been three weeks since it came up until now.

2361
03:28:03,777 --> 03:28:05,318
[SPEAKER_20]: But what happened in the last three weeks?

2362
03:28:05,758 --> 03:28:07,998
[SPEAKER_20]: You folks voted to have these meetings every other week.

2363
03:28:08,518 --> 03:28:09,499
[SPEAKER_20]: And now it's three weeks.

2364
03:28:09,519 --> 03:28:10,379
[SPEAKER_20]: So what happened?

2365
03:28:10,439 --> 03:28:11,299
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't understand.

2366
03:28:11,319 --> 03:28:12,759
[SPEAKER_47]: We had an election.

2367
03:28:13,240 --> 03:28:13,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Pardon me?

2368
03:28:13,760 --> 03:28:14,420
[SPEAKER_47]: There was an election.

2369
03:28:15,300 --> 03:28:17,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Just because there was an election, there's four other days in the week.

2370
03:28:18,421 --> 03:28:18,821
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on.

2371
03:28:20,179 --> 03:28:22,540
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, let's be honest about this.

2372
03:28:22,861 --> 03:28:28,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Where is the proposal from the administration that wants what you people want to propose here tonight?

2373
03:28:28,504 --> 03:28:37,169
[SPEAKER_20]: If you really want to be heroes about what you think this tax should be, you should vote tonight to end it, receive it and place it on file.

2374
03:28:37,209 --> 03:28:38,030
[SPEAKER_20]: That's number one.

2375
03:28:41,178 --> 03:28:51,366
[SPEAKER_20]: Number two, if you really think it's that important, you should maybe in a couple of months call for a public hearing on a non election on a non Tuesday night.

2376
03:28:51,727 --> 03:29:04,838
[SPEAKER_20]: And that way they you can listen to the people as to what you're proposing, because what you're proposing right now, it's quite obvious, either the message got out wrong, the information isn't being heard correctly, and you people are going to send it to a committee.

2377
03:29:05,078 --> 03:29:06,279
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's it going to do in the committee?

2378
03:29:06,579 --> 03:29:11,681
[SPEAKER_20]: either you're for it or against it, because if you have it on the agenda to discuss, how much more do you need to discuss it?

2379
03:29:11,941 --> 03:29:13,721
[SPEAKER_20]: You're either for it or you're against it.

2380
03:29:13,961 --> 03:29:16,182
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why it's on the agenda, period.

2381
03:29:16,882 --> 03:29:26,745
[SPEAKER_20]: Now therefore, if you don't want to vote on it, and you want to refer it to a committee, well then kill it tonight, and then have a public forum if you want, and have the entire community come whenever they want.

2382
03:29:27,085 --> 03:29:38,146
[SPEAKER_20]: You have real estate folks out here, the real estate folks out here buy and sell homes, they're buying and selling of homes and the taxes that are paid into this community represent almost 82% of the city's budget.

2383
03:29:39,116 --> 03:29:44,219
[SPEAKER_20]: They more than anybody understand what the real estate tax does for the city of Method.

2384
03:29:44,699 --> 03:29:59,027
[SPEAKER_20]: And for you now want to put a transfer tax on there for no godly reason why I don't know, you could talk about all the affordable housing you want, but you have no plan in front of you, you have no locations, multiply, you have no reason and no dollar amount ready.

2385
03:29:59,807 --> 03:30:03,832
[SPEAKER_20]: But what about the proposal next to the old GE place that was supposed to be affordable housing.

2386
03:30:04,112 --> 03:30:14,385
[SPEAKER_20]: What about where Bertucci's is with the science, public science building was going to go, what about a mystic Avenue 500 mystic Avenue where there's going to be a proposal for 500 units in commercial.

2387
03:30:15,875 --> 03:30:16,916
[SPEAKER_20]: You've got locations here.

2388
03:30:17,077 --> 03:30:19,739
[SPEAKER_20]: You talked about your first time in 30 years, you're doing a rezoning.

2389
03:30:19,939 --> 03:30:20,860
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, where's the rezoning?

2390
03:30:21,121 --> 03:30:26,225
[SPEAKER_20]: Where is the rezoning here tonight that you can present to the people of this community where affordable housing is going to go?

2391
03:30:26,506 --> 03:30:27,206
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't have it.

2392
03:30:27,387 --> 03:30:39,658
[SPEAKER_20]: You haven't brought in the real estate people so they could see so they could work with you as a council so they could understand what your needs might be so they would have an idea of what they can buy and what they can sell for the people that they have to deal with on a daily basis.

2393
03:30:40,814 --> 03:30:41,855
[SPEAKER_20]: have to understand something.

2394
03:30:42,796 --> 03:30:44,397
[SPEAKER_20]: These people are upset out here.

2395
03:30:44,417 --> 03:30:47,320
[SPEAKER_20]: They're upset only because of the way it's come up.

2396
03:30:47,620 --> 03:30:49,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't forget, you had the meeting canceled.

2397
03:30:49,582 --> 03:30:53,546
[SPEAKER_20]: And now it's here in their mind, they're thinking it's a 2% tax, it's going to go out.

2398
03:30:54,247 --> 03:30:56,649
[SPEAKER_20]: So why don't we just forget the tax?

2399
03:30:57,110 --> 03:30:58,951
[SPEAKER_20]: Why don't you just forget this resolution?

2400
03:30:59,272 --> 03:31:01,173
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you guys and girls really think

2401
03:31:01,954 --> 03:31:07,196
[SPEAKER_20]: It's worthy of having a conversation to call for public hearing and see what the input is.

2402
03:31:07,856 --> 03:31:11,718
[SPEAKER_20]: Rather than saying it's going to be 2%, 1%, it's going to be at a million dollars.

2403
03:31:12,138 --> 03:31:14,038
[SPEAKER_20]: The lady that was on there, she hit it right on the head.

2404
03:31:14,378 --> 03:31:17,520
[SPEAKER_20]: She bought a house for $44,000, then she paid 68,000.

2405
03:31:17,880 --> 03:31:20,121
[SPEAKER_20]: She was the American dream.

2406
03:31:20,841 --> 03:31:29,304
[SPEAKER_20]: And why should she be penalized in her senior years of her senior American dream that she would have that money that she would have to give back that's not going to her.

2407
03:31:37,025 --> 03:31:41,731
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, we're talking about a democracy each and every day with this political election that's coming up.

2408
03:31:42,252 --> 03:31:45,496
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, what you folks are talking about, socialism.

2409
03:31:45,556 --> 03:31:49,301
[SPEAKER_20]: You think you should be sharing your people's products.

2410
03:31:56,934 --> 03:31:59,458
[SPEAKER_20]: It's wrong to get in this mode.

2411
03:32:00,599 --> 03:32:04,565
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't really think this council really wants to travel down this road.

2412
03:32:05,146 --> 03:32:10,233
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you really want to be genuine about this issue, rather than refer to committee.

2413
03:32:10,854 --> 03:32:25,364
[SPEAKER_20]: I would strongly suggest that one of you, if not many of you, make a motion to receive it in place and on file tonight, and then call for a public hearing, two or three weeks, when the entire city of Metro would have an opportunity to come and speak, not like this.

2414
03:32:32,796 --> 03:32:34,337
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Mr. Fenton, your time has expired.

2415
03:32:34,377 --> 03:32:36,659
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to go to Erika DeRoche on Zoom.

2416
03:32:37,419 --> 03:32:41,122
[SPEAKER_47]: Erika, name and address for the record, please, Erika.

2417
03:32:41,842 --> 03:32:43,043
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, thank you.

2418
03:32:43,363 --> 03:32:46,305
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Erika DeRoche, 260 Willis Ave.

2419
03:32:47,062 --> 03:33:00,446
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to read a statement I want to express my support for the establishment establishment of Home Rule petition to discuss this real estate transfer fee as a means of supporting affordable housing for the city of Method.

2420
03:33:01,106 --> 03:33:16,711
[SPEAKER_26]: I am in favor of the community moving ahead with implementing the real estate transfer fee, or at least having a discussion about it because I've seen the cost of rent, and the cost of home sale skit sales skyrocket year over year.

2421
03:33:17,985 --> 03:33:20,266
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've seen people have to move out of the community.

2422
03:33:30,569 --> 03:33:31,229
[SPEAKER_25]: May I speak?

2423
03:33:32,830 --> 03:33:33,950
[SPEAKER_25]: Was I muted on purpose?

2424
03:33:47,208 --> 03:33:48,129
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it safe to speak?

2425
03:33:54,775 --> 03:33:55,135
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello?

2426
03:33:58,938 --> 03:34:00,840
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, I think I'm on.

2427
03:34:01,260 --> 03:34:01,861
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that correct?

2428
03:34:05,744 --> 03:34:07,445
[SPEAKER_26]: Should I start again?

2429
03:34:07,465 --> 03:34:10,648
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, I see what's happening.

2430
03:34:12,580 --> 03:34:18,362
[SPEAKER_26]: My position is that passing a measure to begin discussion of the real estate transfer fee is not premature.

2431
03:34:18,382 --> 03:34:29,505
[SPEAKER_26]: This motion is presenting just one more tool, which will help address the crisis in greater Boston and the inner suburbs, including Medford, which is an inner suburb.

2432
03:34:31,246 --> 03:34:38,668
[SPEAKER_26]: Passing a motion to discuss the option is not premature when people are being evicted regularly in the city of Method.

2433
03:34:39,713 --> 03:34:43,135
[SPEAKER_26]: It is not premature when people from Medford are living in their cars.

2434
03:34:43,155 --> 03:34:50,118
[SPEAKER_26]: A number of opponents tonight have asserted that they have worked hard to obtain what they have.

2435
03:34:50,879 --> 03:34:57,622
[SPEAKER_26]: My response to that is, I do not doubt it, and you should be proud of your accomplishments.

2436
03:34:59,023 --> 03:35:00,684
[SPEAKER_26]: However, the implication

2437
03:35:02,256 --> 03:35:09,839
[SPEAKER_26]: By using that statement is that Medford residents who have not had the good fortune to purchase a home here do not work hard.

2438
03:35:10,580 --> 03:35:11,760
[SPEAKER_26]: And I resent that.

2439
03:35:12,641 --> 03:35:22,645
[SPEAKER_26]: What I don't understand is why some people don't want to work with current residents who may be renting in Medford or aspire to rent in Medford, who also work hard.

2440
03:35:23,125 --> 03:35:24,706
[SPEAKER_26]: They aren't looking for a handout.

2441
03:35:24,766 --> 03:35:27,107
[SPEAKER_26]: They're just looking for reasonably priced home.

2442
03:35:28,260 --> 03:35:40,723
[SPEAKER_26]: I think what's really dividing the community is the misguided notion that old Medford is for the working class and that new Medford wants to take away from those who have built something here.

2443
03:35:41,443 --> 03:35:46,404
[SPEAKER_26]: But the truth is that what we have in common is that we are all for working Medford.

2444
03:35:47,284 --> 03:35:54,245
[SPEAKER_26]: What we have in common is that we want Medford to be affordable, but market conditions are against us.

2445
03:35:55,566 --> 03:35:57,866
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's just this overwhelming problem

2446
03:35:58,676 --> 03:36:01,558
[SPEAKER_26]: and one which turns neighbor against neighbor.

2447
03:36:02,559 --> 03:36:04,261
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very disheartening.

2448
03:36:06,382 --> 03:36:09,825
[SPEAKER_26]: This motion simply opens the possibility of a dialogue about a fee.

2449
03:36:10,366 --> 03:36:12,848
[SPEAKER_26]: It in no way discriminates against homeowners.

2450
03:36:13,608 --> 03:36:17,872
[SPEAKER_26]: The real estate transfer fee is a one-time fee, not a tax.

2451
03:36:18,412 --> 03:36:23,236
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not ongoing and it has a great potential to help residents in Medford.

2452
03:36:24,921 --> 03:36:32,265
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, with also, I just wanted to say that with the price prices, the houses, uh, house sales are commanding in the city.

2453
03:36:32,285 --> 03:36:50,836
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, it is impossible for me to accept the argument that either home sellers or buyers in Medford, um, with a $1 million home in the 2020s will experience a hardship by paying a real estate transfer fee on the order of one or 2%.

2454
03:36:52,697 --> 03:36:54,538
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm gonna lay it out there for you.

2455
03:36:54,899 --> 03:36:58,781
[SPEAKER_26]: The buyers of homes in Medford are wealthy people.

2456
03:36:59,342 --> 03:37:01,483
[SPEAKER_26]: They are, they're wealthy people.

2457
03:37:02,084 --> 03:37:16,915
[SPEAKER_26]: The sellers of homes in Medford are well off enough to account for a one or 2% fee, which will go to promote affordability in their community that they've had the privilege to live in when they consider selling their home.

2458
03:37:17,649 --> 03:37:33,577
[SPEAKER_26]: I know because I am a homeowner and I've experienced all the things that people have complained about this evening, increased real estate tax, and it has been a financial challenge, especially with unpredictable utility costs these days.

2459
03:37:35,418 --> 03:37:45,804
[SPEAKER_26]: As a homeowner, my lived experience is everyone I know in this area who was trying to buy a home has either given up or purchased on the North Shore

2460
03:37:46,776 --> 03:37:50,840
[SPEAKER_26]: or in Rhode Island, or in New Hampshire, or in Texas.

2461
03:37:51,620 --> 03:37:59,627
[SPEAKER_26]: And my mechanic who used to live in my neighborhood, his rent jumped $800 in one month, so he moved to Woburn.

2462
03:38:00,748 --> 03:38:02,690
[SPEAKER_26]: But we all have those stories.

2463
03:38:04,631 --> 03:38:08,054
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just wanted to say that I love my South Medford neighborhood.

2464
03:38:08,254 --> 03:38:11,117
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm very grateful for my home and for my neighborhood.

2465
03:38:11,676 --> 03:38:14,277
[SPEAKER_26]: All my neighbors are friendly, warm people.

2466
03:38:14,637 --> 03:38:16,357
[SPEAKER_26]: One or two are homeowners.

2467
03:38:16,837 --> 03:38:18,477
[SPEAKER_26]: The vast majority are renters.

2468
03:38:19,238 --> 03:38:20,138
[SPEAKER_26]: We're very lucky.

2469
03:38:20,818 --> 03:38:22,098
[SPEAKER_26]: We're very lucky to be here.

2470
03:38:23,278 --> 03:38:40,062
[SPEAKER_26]: As a homeowner who admittedly does not own property worth close to a million dollars, I would be happy to pay a fee when I go to sell my home in the future to benefit the community, especially if it means some of my neighbors are more able to stay in that community.

2471
03:38:40,834 --> 03:38:45,467
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilors, thank you for recognizing me and thank you for your public service.

2472
03:39:21,553 --> 03:39:23,954
[SPEAKER_10]: a property in the city I have always called home.

2473
03:39:24,975 --> 03:39:35,339
[SPEAKER_10]: If the council votes yes, it would ask the state for permission to simply consider taxing certain high-value real estate transactions and earmark those funds specifically for creating more housing.

2474
03:39:35,679 --> 03:39:37,820
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something I am in full support of.

2475
03:39:38,661 --> 03:39:43,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Home ownership was sold as part of the American dream and as a marker of a successful life.

2476
03:39:43,683 --> 03:39:47,045
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a guarantee for many people, many of the people sitting in this room.

2477
03:39:47,805 --> 03:39:51,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Decades later, in the present moment, this could not be further from the truth.

2478
03:39:51,746 --> 03:40:01,509
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do not currently own property, chances are it is nearly impossible to break into the market due to inflation, cost of living, lack of rainy day funds, and lack of affordable options.

2479
03:40:02,149 --> 03:40:09,332
[SPEAKER_10]: My generation's inability to afford to live on our own is not a reflection of how hard we work, but rather an economy in decay.

2480
03:40:09,752 --> 03:40:13,133
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't believe me, I have multiple jobs, and I'm happy to send you my resume.

2481
03:40:14,233 --> 03:40:19,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Evening out the playing field when it comes to access to housing and economic mobility is not a handout.

2482
03:40:19,616 --> 03:40:21,537
[SPEAKER_10]: It does not be little anyone's hard work.

2483
03:40:21,897 --> 03:40:27,919
[SPEAKER_10]: It is just another stream of revenue that we so desperately need that will benefit more people in the long term.

2484
03:40:28,420 --> 03:40:37,304
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not quote anti homeowner or quote anti middle class, but if, if enacted would provide more economic mobility and monthly rent

2485
03:40:37,964 --> 03:40:45,691
[SPEAKER_10]: more economic mobility, less money spent on down payments mortgage and monthly rent means more money in our pockets for other necessities.

2486
03:40:46,712 --> 03:40:56,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked the opponents of this bill, how is it anti middle class to put more money in the pockets of working class people like myself who would otherwise be paying upwards of half of their monthly income on rent.

2487
03:40:57,221 --> 03:41:02,485
[SPEAKER_10]: How is this anti homeowner if invested in would give more people the ability to actually afford a home.

2488
03:41:03,326 --> 03:41:11,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to emphasize that the council is not making a final decision tonight, but only to decide to envision what this idea could look like in practice.

2489
03:41:12,070 --> 03:41:14,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I do encourage the city council to move forward.

2490
03:41:14,791 --> 03:41:17,012
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a housing crisis, full stop.

2491
03:41:17,412 --> 03:41:26,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I voted for most of you in hopes that you would continue to improve fair and equitable access to housing, and I hope that you act in the face of opposition voiced here tonight.

2492
03:41:27,316 --> 03:41:36,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I say to the opponents of this, the right to an affordable place to live can happen for more people if you realize this is not coming at the expense of your ability to succeed or make a living.

2493
03:41:37,083 --> 03:41:49,433
[SPEAKER_10]: If passed, I have full faith in the council to write an ordinance that will aim to do the most good for the most amount of people possible, such as carve outs for retirees, veterans and those with property valued than less of the proposed threshold.

2494
03:41:49,893 --> 03:41:51,354
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I elected you to do.

2495
03:41:52,515 --> 03:42:04,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I implore opponents of this moving forward to take a more macro approach and consider what this could do for future generations of locals who want to lay down roots here, open businesses here, and send their kids to school here.

2496
03:42:05,104 --> 03:42:10,168
[SPEAKER_10]: If my family who owns homes here and have for generations can see the benefits, so can all of you.

2497
03:42:10,428 --> 03:42:10,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2498
03:42:10,808 --> 03:42:12,509
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2499
03:42:12,529 --> 03:42:17,193
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm going to go to John Menino on Zoom.

2500
03:42:17,313 --> 03:42:18,554
[SPEAKER_47]: John, you have five minutes.

2501
03:42:33,980 --> 03:42:35,780
[SPEAKER_47]: John, you're unmuted.

2502
03:42:41,923 --> 03:42:42,723
[SPEAKER_45]: Hello, can you hear me?

2503
03:42:43,743 --> 03:42:44,924
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, we can hear you now, John.

2504
03:42:45,304 --> 03:42:46,184
[SPEAKER_45]: How you doing?

2505
03:42:46,925 --> 03:42:47,905
[SPEAKER_45]: My name is John Menino.

2506
03:42:48,005 --> 03:42:49,406
[SPEAKER_45]: I attend Revere Beach Parkway.

2507
03:42:51,687 --> 03:42:52,527
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm sorry, can you hear me?

2508
03:42:53,510 --> 03:42:54,831
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, go ahead john.

2509
03:42:54,891 --> 03:42:55,591
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you so much.

2510
03:42:56,012 --> 03:43:02,036
[SPEAKER_45]: I just wanted to thank Councilman Scarpelli for everything he's done so far.

2511
03:43:03,076 --> 03:43:13,603
[SPEAKER_45]: I truth be told, I'm not sure what these people are talking about but I just wanted one thing I wanted to bring up was the dispensaries in the city.

2512
03:43:15,104 --> 03:43:16,205
[SPEAKER_45]: I'd like it to not.

2513
03:43:17,930 --> 03:43:20,572
[SPEAKER_47]: John, you have to keep on topic about the transfer fee.

2514
03:43:20,592 --> 03:43:22,913
[SPEAKER_47]: Do you have a comment on the transfer fee?

2515
03:43:23,353 --> 03:43:28,136
[SPEAKER_45]: Not at this time, but if there could be less dispensaries near my house, I'd appreciate it.

2516
03:43:28,156 --> 03:43:30,017
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, thank you, John.

2517
03:43:30,037 --> 03:43:39,382
[SPEAKER_54]: Martha.

2518
03:43:42,164 --> 03:43:43,945
[SPEAKER_47]: In a second, let's let everybody settle.

2519
03:43:45,586 --> 03:43:46,886
[SPEAKER_47]: It gets pretty punchy around 11, so.

2520
03:43:48,143 --> 03:43:49,865
[SPEAKER_61]: That is a hard act to follow.

2521
03:43:49,925 --> 03:43:51,546
[SPEAKER_61]: I have to say.

2522
03:43:52,707 --> 03:43:55,190
[SPEAKER_47]: Martha, name and address for the record please.

2523
03:43:55,310 --> 03:43:56,451
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm Martha Andres.

2524
03:43:56,691 --> 03:43:58,913
[SPEAKER_61]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue.

2525
03:43:58,953 --> 03:44:00,214
[SPEAKER_61]: We've had the house for 34 years.

2526
03:44:02,807 --> 03:44:05,269
[SPEAKER_61]: It's worth a lot more now than it was then.

2527
03:44:06,910 --> 03:44:12,294
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm here to say I think we should talk about this issue.

2528
03:44:13,035 --> 03:44:18,498
[SPEAKER_61]: I appreciate Councilor Callahan mentioning that this isn't likely to go anywhere.

2529
03:44:18,518 --> 03:44:21,280
[SPEAKER_61]: At the State House, it's an uphill battle.

2530
03:44:21,320 --> 03:44:31,167
[SPEAKER_61]: They aren't really granting these home rule petitions very much, but I do think that affordable housing is, and how to fund it,

2531
03:44:32,481 --> 03:44:37,865
[SPEAKER_61]: really important issue and somebody back there's talking and it's, you know, it's that kind of night.

2532
03:44:37,905 --> 03:44:40,648
[SPEAKER_61]: Everybody's being rude, but I'll wait a minute.

2533
03:44:43,210 --> 03:44:45,071
[SPEAKER_61]: Councilor Scapelli, are those your people?

2534
03:44:47,273 --> 03:44:53,458
[SPEAKER_53]: All right, we can, we can, we can.

2535
03:45:12,808 --> 03:45:13,248
[SPEAKER_61]: I agree.

2536
03:45:16,651 --> 03:45:19,634
[SPEAKER_47]: I think she was asking that the quorum continue to be maintained.

2537
03:45:21,377 --> 03:45:23,238
[SPEAKER_61]: Asking for a little help, but anyway.

2538
03:45:23,258 --> 03:45:25,098
[SPEAKER_61]: They won't listen to me.

2539
03:45:25,478 --> 03:45:30,499
[SPEAKER_61]: I think this back on topic, this issue is an important one to talk about.

2540
03:45:32,180 --> 03:45:40,902
[SPEAKER_61]: I don't know if you could design a transfer tax that didn't hit people who've invested a lot in their homes, people who need the money when they sell.

2541
03:45:42,282 --> 03:45:47,924
[SPEAKER_61]: You know, there are a lot of people who for very good reasons shouldn't be hit with a tax when they sell the home.

2542
03:45:49,883 --> 03:46:01,452
[SPEAKER_61]: You know, if there's some developer businesses that are making a nice profit and this doesn't take too much off the top I think it would be an excellent way to put some money back into the city for affordable housing.

2543
03:46:01,892 --> 03:46:02,253
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

2544
03:46:02,773 --> 03:46:06,136
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you Martha and yes again please take private conversations out into the hall.

2545
03:46:12,841 --> 03:46:14,282
[SPEAKER_60]: My name is Juanita Waltrip.

2546
03:46:14,693 --> 03:46:24,836
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you name and address for the record and I live on 49 Samson Road, and this is the first time I've ever really attended a city council meeting, and first time I've ever spoken.

2547
03:46:25,677 --> 03:46:29,438
[SPEAKER_60]: And so consequently I have written down my thoughts so that I won't ramble.

2548
03:46:29,458 --> 03:46:33,299
[SPEAKER_60]: I tend to talk a lot, but I'd like to stay on topic.

2549
03:46:33,739 --> 03:46:34,059
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

2550
03:46:34,139 --> 03:46:36,040
[SPEAKER_60]: And so, if you would allow me please.

2551
03:46:36,140 --> 03:46:36,600
[SPEAKER_45]: Absolutely.

2552
03:46:38,481 --> 03:46:41,422
[SPEAKER_60]: The home I live in has been a family home, since 1950.

2553
03:46:43,510 --> 03:46:50,775
[SPEAKER_60]: when my parents bought it following my father's return from World War II, and they afforded it with the help of the GI Bill.

2554
03:46:52,216 --> 03:46:59,122
[SPEAKER_60]: In that home, five children were raised, myself and my brothers and sisters, and three grandchildren, my sons.

2555
03:46:59,142 --> 03:47:00,242
[SPEAKER_60]: I have three sons.

2556
03:47:01,123 --> 03:47:03,385
[SPEAKER_60]: I've been a resident of Medford for 53 years.

2557
03:47:04,786 --> 03:47:07,368
[SPEAKER_60]: My three sons attended public schools here in Medford.

2558
03:47:08,168 --> 03:47:11,831
[SPEAKER_60]: They attended state colleges and they took loans

2559
03:47:12,461 --> 03:47:15,944
[SPEAKER_60]: so they could afford their tuition along with my contribution.

2560
03:47:16,924 --> 03:47:21,748
[SPEAKER_60]: And let me add here that they all paid back their loans without any government bailouts.

2561
03:47:27,893 --> 03:47:38,741
[SPEAKER_60]: I am a retired teacher with a small pension, and I continue to tutor part-time in elementary schools with a special reading program, Wharton-Gillingham.

2562
03:47:39,781 --> 03:47:41,202
[SPEAKER_60]: I have mortgage on my home.

2563
03:47:41,222 --> 03:47:45,465
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm single, and I sustain myself and my lifestyle.

2564
03:47:46,266 --> 03:47:47,627
[SPEAKER_60]: This April, I will be 72.

2565
03:47:47,887 --> 03:47:57,694
[SPEAKER_60]: By now, you must know I'm not a millionaire in terms of financial investment or money in the bank.

2566
03:47:58,715 --> 03:48:03,959
[SPEAKER_60]: Rather, I like to think I am a millionaire in terms of how I invested myself in people.

2567
03:48:05,037 --> 03:48:11,559
[SPEAKER_60]: My millions are held in the students I taught in public school in Malden, and before that in the South.

2568
03:48:12,740 --> 03:48:16,701
[SPEAKER_60]: I invested myself in my family and my community that way.

2569
03:48:18,301 --> 03:48:19,402
[SPEAKER_60]: Why do I tell you this?

2570
03:48:20,822 --> 03:48:29,225
[SPEAKER_60]: Any part of this million dollars label is held in the value of my home, less the debt to the bank.

2571
03:48:30,612 --> 03:48:34,617
[SPEAKER_60]: This is a tax and it needs to be called that what it is.

2572
03:48:35,518 --> 03:48:37,079
[SPEAKER_60]: It is not a transfer fee.

2573
03:48:37,320 --> 03:48:38,221
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't know what that is.

2574
03:48:38,841 --> 03:48:41,544
[SPEAKER_60]: How dishonest to call it anything but what it is.

2575
03:48:42,646 --> 03:48:50,735
[SPEAKER_60]: Moreover, it is yet another unfair burden on residents like me who have complex histories and situations.

2576
03:48:55,410 --> 03:48:56,110
[SPEAKER_60]: Allow me please.

2577
03:48:56,990 --> 03:49:05,212
[SPEAKER_60]: This is just another unfair tax on the hardworking middle class who have earned over a lifetime in their homes and lifestyles.

2578
03:49:05,952 --> 03:49:10,974
[SPEAKER_60]: They've raised families and educated their children and others and taught them values.

2579
03:49:11,714 --> 03:49:15,135
[SPEAKER_60]: One of which is to earn it, earn what you want.

2580
03:49:16,575 --> 03:49:24,657
[SPEAKER_60]: You must understand that as retirees get closer to the end of their lives, their homes may be their retirement financial security.

2581
03:49:25,905 --> 03:49:28,526
[SPEAKER_60]: a real transfer to another way of living.

2582
03:49:29,927 --> 03:49:36,369
[SPEAKER_60]: By the time we get to that place, our homes will most probably be worth a million dollars or more.

2583
03:49:36,389 --> 03:49:40,691
[SPEAKER_60]: A million is not what it used to be in these inflationary times.

2584
03:49:42,172 --> 03:49:44,453
[SPEAKER_60]: Our homes are our future financial security.

2585
03:49:46,260 --> 03:49:46,960
[SPEAKER_60]: little research.

2586
03:49:47,560 --> 03:49:55,924
[SPEAKER_60]: After doing some research and looking at the data, I see that the tax is most punishing on the middle class in Middlesex County.

2587
03:49:57,044 --> 03:50:11,950
[SPEAKER_60]: Looking at the map from the state projected plan, it shows that Middlesex County has the largest amount of single family homes, but also the greatest amount of commercial real estate, which far exceeds the residential properties.

2588
03:50:13,130 --> 03:50:15,651
[SPEAKER_60]: It would seem that the greatest revenue

2589
03:50:16,181 --> 03:50:18,402
[SPEAKER_60]: should be derived from commercial sector.

2590
03:50:19,883 --> 03:50:31,369
[SPEAKER_60]: After reading many opinions, the one that was most logical to me came from the Greater Boston Real Estate Board article written by Gregory Legassil called The Tax.

2591
03:50:31,930 --> 03:50:36,052
[SPEAKER_60]: He calls it regressive, not progressive, and discriminatory.

2592
03:50:36,933 --> 03:50:39,114
[SPEAKER_60]: He explains the argument of equity.

2593
03:50:40,273 --> 03:50:54,005
[SPEAKER_60]: low income households will have to pay a fair higher share of their annual income because of the transfer tax while higher income households will pay a far lower share of their annual income.

2594
03:50:55,046 --> 03:51:04,814
[SPEAKER_60]: As I have outlined in my personal situation, there are many owners of homes that do not have the income that others in more wealthy cities and towns have.

2595
03:51:05,094 --> 03:51:05,375
[SPEAKER_47]: And yet,

2596
03:51:07,728 --> 03:51:12,612
[SPEAKER_60]: They will be taxed at the same rate as those wealthier income households.

2597
03:51:14,253 --> 03:51:15,354
[SPEAKER_60]: Consider these points.

2598
03:51:17,456 --> 03:51:32,328
[SPEAKER_60]: I consider that you, and you should consider that you are very young, some of you, and have not lived long enough to look back over a lifetime to see all the effort and the work and the sacrifice that was made to earn everything one has.

2599
03:51:32,348 --> 03:51:34,930
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't mean this in any demeaning way.

2600
03:51:36,775 --> 03:51:38,035
[SPEAKER_60]: It's just perspective.

2601
03:51:38,856 --> 03:51:39,756
[SPEAKER_60]: It's just a fact.

2602
03:51:40,436 --> 03:51:40,856
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Ms.

2603
03:51:40,876 --> 03:51:41,157
[SPEAKER_47]: Waldrop.

2604
03:51:41,177 --> 03:51:42,077
[SPEAKER_47]: Your time has expired.

2605
03:51:42,437 --> 03:51:43,577
[SPEAKER_60]: Could I please continue?

2606
03:51:43,597 --> 03:51:45,358
[SPEAKER_47]: I've waited a long time.

2607
03:51:45,378 --> 03:51:46,478
[SPEAKER_47]: There's a long line behind you, Ms.

2608
03:51:46,498 --> 03:51:46,638
[SPEAKER_47]: Waldrop.

2609
03:51:46,658 --> 03:51:48,459
[SPEAKER_47]: I've waited a long time.

2610
03:51:48,499 --> 03:51:49,499
[SPEAKER_47]: You can come back up.

2611
03:51:50,800 --> 03:51:50,960
[SPEAKER_47]: Ms.

2612
03:51:50,980 --> 03:51:55,181
[SPEAKER_47]: Waldrop, we have rules for a reason, and I'm very sorry, but I have to hear from everyone equally.

2613
03:51:55,242 --> 03:51:55,622
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2614
03:51:57,922 --> 03:52:00,063
[SPEAKER_60]: I want to finish with two quotes, if I could.

2615
03:52:00,183 --> 03:52:02,124
[SPEAKER_60]: Okay.

2616
03:52:02,764 --> 03:52:04,985
[SPEAKER_60]: From The Democracy,

2617
03:52:06,441 --> 03:52:12,725
[SPEAKER_60]: will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.

2618
03:52:14,406 --> 03:52:22,250
[SPEAKER_60]: I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.

2619
03:52:23,151 --> 03:52:27,874
[SPEAKER_60]: This comes from Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers and a creator of the constitution.

2620
03:52:28,654 --> 03:52:30,235
[SPEAKER_60]: Think about that for a minute if you would.

2621
03:52:30,255 --> 03:52:31,496
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

2622
03:52:34,172 --> 03:52:39,853
[SPEAKER_50]: We're going to go to Jessica Healy on Zoom.

2623
03:52:48,735 --> 03:52:50,195
[SPEAKER_47]: Jessica, do you still wanna speak?

2624
03:52:51,476 --> 03:52:55,957
[SPEAKER_63]: I'm actually gonna, I'll wait till the people there can speak first.

2625
03:52:56,517 --> 03:52:56,857
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

2626
03:52:58,057 --> 03:53:01,098
[SPEAKER_47]: We will go to Frank Castanello on Zoom.

2627
03:53:09,366 --> 03:53:10,587
[SPEAKER_47]: That's not the rule, thank you.

2628
03:53:11,287 --> 03:53:21,174
[SPEAKER_47]: Frank Castanello on Zoom.

2629
03:53:21,214 --> 03:53:21,735
[SPEAKER_41]: Can you hear me?

2630
03:53:22,635 --> 03:53:23,656
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, Frank, thank you.

2631
03:53:23,696 --> 03:53:24,777
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, how are you?

2632
03:53:27,439 --> 03:53:30,341
[SPEAKER_41]: All right, I'm gonna be real brief about this.

2633
03:53:32,042 --> 03:53:34,304
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm so thankful for all your patience.

2634
03:53:35,845 --> 03:53:37,146
[SPEAKER_41]: Let me just say, frankly,

2635
03:53:38,061 --> 03:53:40,543
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm a landlord and a homeowner myself.

2636
03:53:41,363 --> 03:53:48,268
[SPEAKER_41]: And, um, the current tenants I have have been very, very backed up and late on payments.

2637
03:53:49,569 --> 03:53:53,031
[SPEAKER_41]: That's something I wanted to get off first and foremost.

2638
03:53:55,233 --> 03:54:01,897
[SPEAKER_41]: And another thing that I'm going to add is that councilman Scarpelli, you know, I just want to thank you so much.

2639
03:54:02,718 --> 03:54:07,841
[SPEAKER_41]: You're a great man and I'm appreciative of what you've done for the city and everything.

2640
03:54:09,389 --> 03:54:14,691
[SPEAKER_41]: and everyone involved here, I just wanna say thank you for your time, and go Celtics.

2641
03:54:16,611 --> 03:54:17,112
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2642
03:54:20,873 --> 03:54:30,676
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go to Nate Merritt, and we're having a technical issue with the TV and the live stream, so we may need to take another recess, but Mr. Merritt, name and address for the record, please.

2643
03:54:30,796 --> 03:54:33,157
[SPEAKER_33]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Avenue, Medford.

2644
03:54:34,097 --> 03:54:38,459
[SPEAKER_33]: So I've been around for a little bit, only about 10 years, moved in in 2014, a lot has happened.

2645
03:54:40,237 --> 03:54:41,118
[SPEAKER_33]: The roads still suck.

2646
03:54:41,898 --> 03:54:43,559
[SPEAKER_35]: And there's been a lot of development.

2647
03:54:43,579 --> 03:54:43,939
[SPEAKER_35]: No, no, no, no.

2648
03:54:43,959 --> 03:54:44,640
[SPEAKER_35]: But here's the thing.

2649
03:54:44,980 --> 03:54:48,642
[SPEAKER_35]: There was a ton of new housing development that happened right around the corner.

2650
03:54:48,662 --> 03:54:50,903
[SPEAKER_35]: The 61 Locust Street project, right?

2651
03:54:51,143 --> 03:54:53,825
[SPEAKER_35]: We're gonna build all new units and there's gonna be affordable housing.

2652
03:54:53,845 --> 03:54:54,925
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been hearing about housing.

2653
03:54:55,245 --> 03:54:56,606
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been hearing about linkage.

2654
03:54:56,966 --> 03:55:05,431
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been hearing about all these other taxes that are gonna benefit the area, but my street still sucks and another car can come up over the curb and hit my house.

2655
03:55:06,231 --> 03:55:07,712
[SPEAKER_35]: Nothing's happened in a decade.

2656
03:55:09,394 --> 03:55:11,335
[SPEAKER_35]: So the first thing I ask is, well, where's the tax money?

2657
03:55:12,935 --> 03:55:15,176
[SPEAKER_35]: So, you know, it's funny.

2658
03:55:15,216 --> 03:55:17,537
[SPEAKER_35]: I haven't lived in Medford my whole life, right?

2659
03:55:17,717 --> 03:55:20,398
[SPEAKER_35]: When I came out of college, I couldn't get a job in Massachusetts.

2660
03:55:20,458 --> 03:55:21,718
[SPEAKER_35]: I moved to upstate New York.

2661
03:55:22,899 --> 03:55:23,959
[SPEAKER_35]: It's really cheap to live there.

2662
03:55:23,979 --> 03:55:24,939
[SPEAKER_35]: There's plenty of housing.

2663
03:55:24,979 --> 03:55:29,361
[SPEAKER_35]: If people wanna go live somewhere, I recommend the Syracuse area, okay?

2664
03:55:31,462 --> 03:55:33,443
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm originally from Western Massachusetts.

2665
03:55:34,123 --> 03:55:37,665
[SPEAKER_35]: If you wanna find some housing that's actually relatively cheap, go to Western Mass.

2666
03:55:37,685 --> 03:55:40,286
[SPEAKER_35]: There's good people, good jobs, and they all have funny accents.

2667
03:55:41,567 --> 03:55:42,307
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I said it.

2668
03:55:44,348 --> 03:55:46,509
[SPEAKER_35]: So I know people wanna play to identity politics.

2669
03:55:46,569 --> 03:55:47,249
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, I'm white.

2670
03:55:48,130 --> 03:55:49,170
[SPEAKER_35]: My wife is Asian.

2671
03:55:49,510 --> 03:55:50,631
[SPEAKER_35]: I have two half babies.

2672
03:55:51,371 --> 03:55:54,833
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, they're whole babies, half Asian, half white, okay?

2673
03:55:55,987 --> 03:55:57,068
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, a little levity.

2674
03:55:57,628 --> 03:55:59,049
[SPEAKER_35]: I think everyone needs it a little bit here.

2675
03:55:59,369 --> 03:56:03,151
[SPEAKER_35]: But seriously, I mean, this is now the third meeting in a row that's happened.

2676
03:56:03,191 --> 03:56:06,972
[SPEAKER_35]: I have had to come and not put my kids to bed because this city has been a dumpster fire.

2677
03:56:07,493 --> 03:56:11,775
[SPEAKER_35]: And there's no other good way to put it between the firemen issue and everything else going on.

2678
03:56:11,895 --> 03:56:15,376
[SPEAKER_35]: It has been a dumpster fire and it's been going to 11 o'clock habitually.

2679
03:56:16,797 --> 03:56:18,398
[SPEAKER_35]: So we're kind of in a sad state of events.

2680
03:56:18,818 --> 03:56:21,059
[SPEAKER_35]: Upstate New York, you see your taxes in play.

2681
03:56:21,099 --> 03:56:22,540
[SPEAKER_35]: They have volunteer firefighters.

2682
03:56:22,980 --> 03:56:24,301
[SPEAKER_35]: That's what I did when I was out there.

2683
03:56:25,302 --> 03:56:26,263
[SPEAKER_35]: People didn't have a lot of money.

2684
03:56:26,283 --> 03:56:26,843
[SPEAKER_35]: They made due.

2685
03:56:27,784 --> 03:56:28,764
[SPEAKER_35]: I went and found work.

2686
03:56:28,904 --> 03:56:30,485
[SPEAKER_35]: I only moved back because my dad got sick.

2687
03:56:31,426 --> 03:56:32,927
[SPEAKER_35]: Now I make okay money.

2688
03:56:33,767 --> 03:56:35,008
[SPEAKER_35]: We bought a house we could afford.

2689
03:56:35,028 --> 03:56:35,668
[SPEAKER_35]: You know what I want?

2690
03:56:35,708 --> 03:56:44,894
[SPEAKER_35]: I want a gold brick to fall in my backyard so I can afford stuff and fix my crappy house that my wife and I saved up and bought without assistance from my folks.

2691
03:56:45,674 --> 03:56:46,575
[SPEAKER_35]: My folks are gone now.

2692
03:56:46,655 --> 03:56:48,196
[SPEAKER_35]: So there is no assistance coming from them.

2693
03:56:49,619 --> 03:56:59,545
[SPEAKER_35]: Right, I have a single family house, you have some problems that y'all are trying to address, and I'm hearing a lot of convolution, it's, we need quantity of housing, we need affordability of housing.

2694
03:56:59,945 --> 03:57:05,569
[SPEAKER_35]: Those two circles don't necessarily need to intersect, they're separate issues and they might have separate solutions.

2695
03:57:06,609 --> 03:57:08,690
[SPEAKER_35]: An affordable house is a single family house.

2696
03:57:09,330 --> 03:57:11,551
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not necessarily a multifamily house.

2697
03:57:11,571 --> 03:57:15,573
[SPEAKER_35]: So if a person wants to sell their single family house to another family, like we got lucky.

2698
03:57:16,233 --> 03:57:17,014
[SPEAKER_35]: It was a bidding war.

2699
03:57:17,034 --> 03:57:20,715
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, this is what, and we used to pay it all the taxes and da, da, da, da, right?

2700
03:57:21,035 --> 03:57:23,196
[SPEAKER_35]: But we got into a single family crappy house.

2701
03:57:23,236 --> 03:57:24,757
[SPEAKER_35]: I have an 1100 square foot house.

2702
03:57:24,817 --> 03:57:25,597
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a three bedroom.

2703
03:57:25,617 --> 03:57:26,638
[SPEAKER_35]: I got two young kids.

2704
03:57:27,038 --> 03:57:28,118
[SPEAKER_35]: I wanna go somewhere else.

2705
03:57:28,158 --> 03:57:32,220
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, have a little more room to move, but I can't necessarily make that move right now.

2706
03:57:33,916 --> 03:57:36,697
[SPEAKER_35]: but I have a job, my wife has a job, we're middle-class.

2707
03:57:37,517 --> 03:57:39,097
[SPEAKER_35]: I have no idea what the value of my house is.

2708
03:57:39,117 --> 03:57:41,798
[SPEAKER_35]: I wanna say it was like 700,000 or something, which is just ridiculous.

2709
03:57:42,838 --> 03:57:43,918
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, I sell it tomorrow.

2710
03:57:44,318 --> 03:57:45,039
[SPEAKER_35]: Where am I gonna go?

2711
03:57:45,059 --> 03:57:49,000
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna go what, pay 800, 900 for the same house.

2712
03:57:49,040 --> 03:57:53,121
[SPEAKER_35]: I would literally sell my house and then with the cap gains and everything else, I'd still be in the hole.

2713
03:57:54,041 --> 03:58:02,683
[SPEAKER_35]: So now I have a job in New Hampshire just so I can go afford to pay my higher taxes, my daycare for my two kids so my wife and I can both go to work.

2714
03:58:03,800 --> 03:58:07,864
[SPEAKER_35]: which is a mortgage in itself is 1400 bucks a kid and they're not even full time.

2715
03:58:07,964 --> 03:58:08,945
[SPEAKER_47]: You have 30 seconds Nate.

2716
03:58:09,025 --> 03:58:10,046
[SPEAKER_35]: Grandma's helping them out.

2717
03:58:11,147 --> 03:58:12,808
[SPEAKER_35]: You should shut this down tonight.

2718
03:58:14,710 --> 03:58:16,892
[SPEAKER_35]: The councilor Scarpelli made a good suggestion.

2719
03:58:16,912 --> 03:58:20,055
[SPEAKER_35]: So to councilor Penta, you don't have to take this.

2720
03:58:20,135 --> 03:58:22,697
[SPEAKER_35]: A perfectly acceptable answer tonight is no.

2721
03:58:22,957 --> 03:58:27,841
[SPEAKER_35]: And there've been plenty of other resolutions have been passed by this body, but without going to committee first.

2722
03:58:28,737 --> 03:58:32,619
[SPEAKER_35]: So I think it was a little disingenuous council, what you said initially where it has to go to pay.

2723
03:58:32,899 --> 03:58:33,519
[SPEAKER_47]: That's not true.

2724
03:58:33,539 --> 03:58:34,420
[SPEAKER_47]: Your time has expired.

2725
03:58:34,680 --> 03:58:35,040
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2726
03:58:43,864 --> 03:58:44,704
[SPEAKER_54]: No hands on zoom.

2727
03:58:44,724 --> 03:58:45,665
[SPEAKER_54]: So we'll go to the podium.

2728
03:58:45,745 --> 03:58:47,465
[SPEAKER_47]: Jamie Damon address for the record, please.

2729
03:58:47,485 --> 03:58:48,386
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

2730
03:58:49,306 --> 03:58:49,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everybody.

2731
03:58:50,007 --> 03:58:50,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your patience.

2732
03:58:51,127 --> 03:58:52,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm following Nate with the humor.

2733
03:58:52,788 --> 03:58:53,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

2734
03:58:53,228 --> 03:58:54,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna throw some numbers at you.

2735
03:58:55,998 --> 03:59:01,622
[SPEAKER_04]: There's much smarter people here than me and I'd be happy to discuss this data at a later time and definitely if this moves forward, I'll be bringing more back.

2736
03:59:02,883 --> 03:59:11,529
[SPEAKER_04]: On the transfer tax from reviewing public available data, Medford has 15,775 residential units across single, condo, two and three families.

2737
03:59:12,110 --> 03:59:13,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Of those, 12,368 are owner-occupied, 78%.

2738
03:59:17,577 --> 03:59:27,043
[SPEAKER_04]: By my calculation on a transfer tax of 2% based on last year's sales in Medford of singles, condos, multis over a million dollars, you would have generated $350,000.

2739
03:59:30,025 --> 03:59:32,527
[SPEAKER_04]: With the governor's 1%, that would be $175,000.

2740
03:59:33,568 --> 03:59:35,089
[SPEAKER_04]: How much money are you looking to get from this?

2741
03:59:36,049 --> 03:59:37,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't look at commercial property.

2742
03:59:37,770 --> 03:59:38,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't able to pull that data.

2743
03:59:38,891 --> 03:59:41,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we've got experts that can get that data for us to look at that.

2744
03:59:43,474 --> 03:59:44,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have heavily,

2745
03:59:45,222 --> 03:59:49,963
[SPEAKER_04]: If the target is commercial property, you're gonna have heavily fluctuating numbers annually, depending on that market.

2746
03:59:50,323 --> 03:59:55,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And this would also impact commercial growth opportunities, if this is where you expect to make the bulk of the funds.

2747
03:59:56,085 --> 03:59:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Now to the CPA, which is predictable, measurable amount of money you can plan around.

2748
04:00:00,406 --> 04:00:04,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a quick question, prior to walking court, how many units has the CPA generated?

2749
04:00:06,448 --> 04:00:10,129
[SPEAKER_04]: If the city chose to allocate just 20% of the CPA that would generate $400,000 annually,

2750
04:00:12,230 --> 04:00:23,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can choose to make that four times 80% you can make that choice and put 10% historic 10% parks and dump a whole bunch of money into the affordable trust fund in one year.

2751
04:00:25,099 --> 04:00:30,343
[SPEAKER_04]: You also have the option to raise the CPA to 3% which would net and double all of that money for all three pools.

2752
04:00:31,411 --> 04:00:36,072
[SPEAKER_04]: This is tax money already collected with no impact to residents other than the tax, obviously.

2753
04:00:36,752 --> 04:00:48,794
[SPEAKER_04]: If Medford is for affordable housing, we need to better use this resources that we've had at our hands for 15 years and all the projects and development that would meet the 10% number that Matt brought up to move forward before asking us all for more.

2754
04:00:49,714 --> 04:00:54,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here because we don't want you to spend your time discussing this as there are more important items to work on.

2755
04:00:55,055 --> 04:00:57,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've already said that this is gonna be tough to get through the state.

2756
04:00:58,876 --> 04:00:59,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2757
04:01:06,903 --> 04:01:09,344
[SPEAKER_54]: Come to the podium, yeah, name and address for the record, please.

2758
04:01:11,585 --> 04:01:13,326
[SPEAKER_38]: Javier Bellini, 42 Circuit Street.

2759
04:01:14,726 --> 04:01:19,288
[SPEAKER_38]: God, I've been waiting here for so long, I don't even know where to start.

2760
04:01:19,308 --> 04:01:22,390
[SPEAKER_38]: I think we all need affordable housing, right?

2761
04:01:23,230 --> 04:01:24,771
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a housing crisis, we get it.

2762
04:01:25,611 --> 04:01:32,334
[SPEAKER_38]: I think everybody has a right to live in a respectable and affordable home, but it's very challenging times.

2763
04:01:32,734 --> 04:01:34,795
[SPEAKER_38]: And there's a lot of economics at play in that,

2764
04:01:35,879 --> 04:01:37,501
[SPEAKER_38]: And those economics are hard to control.

2765
04:01:39,622 --> 04:01:42,785
[SPEAKER_38]: And I understand what is being discussed here.

2766
04:01:42,805 --> 04:01:47,169
[SPEAKER_38]: I know some of the council mentions, this is just process, put it to committee and all that.

2767
04:01:47,209 --> 04:01:50,452
[SPEAKER_38]: But I think at the point where people just don't want it, regardless of what form it takes.

2768
04:01:50,992 --> 04:01:55,196
[SPEAKER_38]: So there's no sense of putting it to committee if most of the people don't want it.

2769
04:01:55,336 --> 04:01:56,377
[SPEAKER_38]: Save yourselves the breath.

2770
04:01:57,078 --> 04:01:59,199
[SPEAKER_38]: I did vote for most of you on this council.

2771
04:01:59,620 --> 04:02:01,702
[SPEAKER_38]: I know, I know, I know.

2772
04:02:04,354 --> 04:02:04,894
[SPEAKER_38]: It's okay.

2773
04:02:04,954 --> 04:02:24,128
[SPEAKER_38]: So, and I'm sorry that you, the way you've been treated and stuff like that, because really, we, in order to promote affordable housing, we need to be collaborative, but it can't be done on the backs of homeowners, you know, it has, if you want to spur more development, we need support from both sides.

2774
04:02:24,728 --> 04:02:24,948
[SPEAKER_38]: Right.

2775
04:02:25,409 --> 04:02:28,211
[SPEAKER_38]: And all this is doing is dividing the town even further.

2776
04:02:28,991 --> 04:02:44,317
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, so when myself, who actually has skin in the game, because I'm a commercial loan officer, and I help lend in these in this field, I also volunteer because I'm on the board of directors of a nonprofit developer of affordable housing, I know what I'm talking about.

2777
04:02:44,537 --> 04:02:58,163
[SPEAKER_38]: So when I want to come to Medford, and do an affordable housing project, and you got this going on, you're making it very difficult for me to get support from all these people here, which I need, because they're neighbors.

2778
04:02:59,002 --> 04:03:01,083
[SPEAKER_38]: You can't alienate half the town.

2779
04:03:02,004 --> 04:03:03,785
[SPEAKER_38]: And you say you want to get affordable housing going.

2780
04:03:04,285 --> 04:03:05,065
[SPEAKER_38]: That doesn't work.

2781
04:03:06,186 --> 04:03:06,586
[SPEAKER_38]: It doesn't.

2782
04:03:07,347 --> 04:03:17,192
[SPEAKER_38]: The Healy-Joseph School Administration just passed the largest investment in affordable housing to create 40,000 new units, 27,000 units of preservation and rehab.

2783
04:03:18,233 --> 04:03:21,915
[SPEAKER_38]: And you're on the heels of that, you're talking about

2784
04:03:22,998 --> 04:03:30,603
[SPEAKER_38]: passing on additional costs to homeowners and Metro to develop affordable housing, when you already have a CPA funds that haven't been properly allocated.

2785
04:03:31,884 --> 04:03:38,308
[SPEAKER_38]: I just don't understand it you're making it very hard, making it very hard there's ways people so altruistic about other people's money.

2786
04:03:41,294 --> 04:03:44,177
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, you can as a renter contribute.

2787
04:03:44,778 --> 04:03:48,061
[SPEAKER_38]: We can start that fund, they can contribute and donate to that fund.

2788
04:03:48,381 --> 04:03:49,222
[SPEAKER_38]: They don't have to wait.

2789
04:03:49,803 --> 04:03:52,065
[SPEAKER_38]: Same thing with homeowners who actually want to contribute to that fund.

2790
04:03:52,426 --> 04:03:56,029
[SPEAKER_38]: Go ahead, just like you can elect to pay higher taxes at the end of the year that no one ever does.

2791
04:03:57,642 --> 04:04:12,988
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, so I'm just, I'm just asking to for some consideration here, we need to be collaborative, we need to find ways to develop more affordable housing, we that's a lot of it comes down to zoning, right, and garnering more support.

2792
04:04:13,448 --> 04:04:17,029
[SPEAKER_38]: And hey, I'll even give you on the parking, reducing two and a half to less.

2793
04:04:17,570 --> 04:04:21,771
[SPEAKER_38]: None of it makes sense, because I've been a landlord for 10 years here.

2794
04:04:22,111 --> 04:04:23,092
[SPEAKER_38]: I've always had tenants.

2795
04:04:23,652 --> 04:04:24,872
[SPEAKER_38]: that have commuted into town.

2796
04:04:25,032 --> 04:04:32,595
[SPEAKER_38]: I've personally worked in Boston twice, Cambridge once, taking public transit all the time, and always had a car.

2797
04:04:33,075 --> 04:04:34,235
[SPEAKER_38]: My tenants do that now.

2798
04:04:34,295 --> 04:04:37,616
[SPEAKER_38]: They commute into town and they have cars, each of them.

2799
04:04:38,237 --> 04:04:42,958
[SPEAKER_38]: So, I mean, Councilor Scarpelli, through the president.

2800
04:04:43,338 --> 04:04:43,698
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

2801
04:04:43,918 --> 04:04:45,159
[SPEAKER_38]: You're welcome.

2802
04:04:46,299 --> 04:04:49,460
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, back when you were renting on Irving Street, how many jobs you have?

2803
04:04:51,541 --> 04:04:51,721
[SPEAKER_38]: Three.

2804
04:04:52,671 --> 04:04:53,892
[SPEAKER_38]: And then you were by the house and heights.

2805
04:04:55,053 --> 04:04:57,514
[SPEAKER_38]: I know because I helped move them in a death trap of a U-Haul.

2806
04:05:00,313 --> 04:05:09,059
[SPEAKER_38]: I had to work two, three jobs for going a lot of things that I could have done with my friends in order to afford to come into Medford now I have two kids.

2807
04:05:09,359 --> 04:05:21,607
[SPEAKER_38]: We've been looking for cows, before we even had kids my daughter's turning three, and I'm still struggling to buy houses, a bigger house in Medford because I'm going up against developers who come in and flip.

2808
04:05:22,748 --> 04:05:25,110
[SPEAKER_38]: You know in the condo multis and stuff like that.

2809
04:05:25,490 --> 04:05:26,611
[SPEAKER_38]: So there's a lot of challenges.

2810
04:05:26,631 --> 04:05:28,373
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm facing them just as much.

2811
04:05:28,714 --> 04:05:41,449
[SPEAKER_38]: But I look to people like, you know, my parents who if they were to sell their home in the heights, they would need every penny to buy something else if they wanted a downside to once one floor living 30 seconds.

2812
04:05:42,069 --> 04:05:50,934
[SPEAKER_38]: And everything, whether you go, it's no longer affordable metric, you go past 128, still not affordable, go for 95 still not affordable, you can go to New Hampshire now, it's getting unaffordable.

2813
04:05:50,954 --> 04:05:55,256
[SPEAKER_38]: So, you know, we all have to come together and find a way to collaborate.

2814
04:05:55,776 --> 04:05:58,057
[SPEAKER_38]: But we're just stuck in this push pull.

2815
04:05:58,658 --> 04:06:02,540
[SPEAKER_38]: And I voted for you guys, because I want things to change.

2816
04:06:02,960 --> 04:06:08,723
[SPEAKER_38]: But I also want to empower you that it's okay to say no on issues you feel strong about, because there's sometimes a better ways of doing it.

2817
04:06:09,653 --> 04:06:10,694
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's all I have to say.

2818
04:06:10,934 --> 04:06:12,075
[SPEAKER_47]: Could you wait just one second?

2819
04:06:13,375 --> 04:06:14,196
[SPEAKER_47]: I just have a question.

2820
04:06:15,317 --> 04:06:22,621
[SPEAKER_47]: And I did want to say, you know, when this started many years ago now in other communities, the intent was to focus on flippers, right?

2821
04:06:22,862 --> 04:06:29,626
[SPEAKER_47]: And the high value transactions and the flip transactions, which are keeping and outcompeting people like you who want to go owner occupied.

2822
04:06:30,006 --> 04:06:31,267
[SPEAKER_47]: So that's one of the reasons this exists.

2823
04:06:31,347 --> 04:06:37,151
[SPEAKER_47]: And I just want to also ask the nonprofit that you're on the board of, and feel free if you don't want to answer it,

2824
04:06:37,930 --> 04:06:41,152
[SPEAKER_47]: Do you know if they've endorsed the state transfer fee of Governor Haley or not?

2825
04:06:41,172 --> 04:06:42,612
[SPEAKER_38]: We haven't endorsed it officially, no.

2826
04:06:42,993 --> 04:06:46,254
[SPEAKER_38]: But to be honest with you, there's ways of raising funds that could benefit everybody.

2827
04:06:46,614 --> 04:06:50,336
[SPEAKER_38]: For example, the CITC program, which allows you, we get a lot of it.

2828
04:06:51,077 --> 04:06:52,197
[SPEAKER_38]: You guys want a tax break?

2829
04:06:52,737 --> 04:06:57,360
[SPEAKER_38]: You can donate $1,000, you get 500 back in a tax credit, that goes towards affordable housing.

2830
04:06:57,420 --> 04:06:59,141
[SPEAKER_38]: That actually has been extended by the governor.

2831
04:06:59,421 --> 04:07:04,143
[SPEAKER_38]: There's ways that we can all be collaborative in work, but I wanna know, what's Medford's plan?

2832
04:07:04,263 --> 04:07:07,105
[SPEAKER_38]: Do you have a nonprofit developer partner that you can partner with now?

2833
04:07:07,825 --> 04:07:12,790
[SPEAKER_47]: I don't think there is one we have, we have member community housing as a chodo but they've all been small projects.

2834
04:07:12,930 --> 04:07:23,560
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I mean, to go approach just to start, or Noah or Paula, there's so many CDs go to mass CDC, talk to the chair, they will point you in the right direction find some partners.

2835
04:07:23,760 --> 04:07:30,487
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, but then come back to the table as far as how do we find these projects because I don't know about a project that has been denied.

2836
04:07:34,711 --> 04:07:39,016
[SPEAKER_47]: This is one proposal of many proposals we have been working extensively on zoning.

2837
04:07:39,396 --> 04:07:49,547
[SPEAKER_47]: We're trying to look huge, and we've been working really hard on it we have a meeting tomorrow night, based on the comprehensive plan which came together for two years based on the housing production plan, and I just think it's important for people to know.

2838
04:07:49,909 --> 04:07:52,631
[SPEAKER_47]: that there are city plans and there is a comprehensive approach.

2839
04:07:52,951 --> 04:07:58,835
[SPEAKER_47]: And this is one proposal in a large toolbox of proposals that's being looked at to address this issue holistically.

2840
04:07:59,175 --> 04:08:02,357
[SPEAKER_47]: And I think we have to treat it that way, but I appreciate your perspective on it.

2841
04:08:02,677 --> 04:08:11,163
[SPEAKER_47]: And again, I think you've heard here tonight from all of my colleagues that the intent is to have the discussion and talk through the issues that you brought up about who this impacts.

2842
04:08:11,623 --> 04:08:19,368
[SPEAKER_47]: If we can target this in a way where it goes after the flip transactions that all of us hate, where you're turning affordable starter homes into massive luxury homes,

2843
04:08:20,522 --> 04:08:29,190
[SPEAKER_47]: I can't I don't know anyone in the city who doesn't want that to change except for maybe people building the luxury homes, but it feels a little it feels a little bit of a slippery slope.

2844
04:08:29,591 --> 04:08:35,977
[SPEAKER_38]: That's just I think I, you open the door, and then here's the thing you might have been well intended but, you know, be honest with your Councilors bears.

2845
04:08:38,513 --> 04:08:56,407
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know if you end up you know you find a dream home because you started a family and it ends up not being in Manfred and we read, you know, and then you move, and we had another city Councilor, who feels a little bit differently and then pivots, and then you see the ball roll so I might have confidence in you, I may not necessarily have confidence from the person I don't know that's going to replace you eventually.

2846
04:08:56,943 --> 04:09:10,766
[SPEAKER_47]: I can say this I'm stuck here so you may not be stuck with me though I know Councilors are had something to say, with all due respect, I think we should go to say, Councilor Leming, I'm going to go to Councilor Lazzaro, and then to you Councilor Lazzaro.

2847
04:09:11,686 --> 04:09:26,269
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't need to repeat what you said it was just going to be the point of privilege just that this, this doesn't preclude any of the stuff that you mentioned we can do many things at the same time and our goal is always to try as many things as possible and this can be

2848
04:09:27,289 --> 04:09:29,911
[SPEAKER_30]: something that specifically targets exactly what we want.

2849
04:09:29,951 --> 04:09:31,832
[SPEAKER_30]: We haven't established what it's going to be yet.

2850
04:09:32,372 --> 04:09:35,194
[SPEAKER_30]: It's only to open up the door to have more conversations.

2851
04:09:35,254 --> 04:09:36,315
[SPEAKER_30]: And I love what you mentioned.

2852
04:09:36,335 --> 04:09:42,199
[SPEAKER_30]: I would love for you to send me an email with links so that I can learn more about it.

2853
04:09:42,239 --> 04:09:43,880
[SPEAKER_30]: Because I want to be learning more about it.

2854
04:09:43,920 --> 04:09:45,621
[SPEAKER_30]: It sounds like you have a lot of awesome ideas.

2855
04:09:46,041 --> 04:09:47,082
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'd love to talk more.

2856
04:09:48,022 --> 04:09:50,724
[SPEAKER_30]: But we're diversifying this all the time.

2857
04:09:50,744 --> 04:09:52,265
[SPEAKER_30]: We're talking about this all the time.

2858
04:09:52,705 --> 04:10:09,860
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not just this one it's a lot of different options, and it's not targeting anybody individually it's all different ways of doing this and we're trying to keep our, the way that we're approaching this as progressive as possible so that it's not, it's not targeting just people on the bottom, it's helping everybody and it's, and everybody's working together.

2859
04:10:10,180 --> 04:10:15,084
[SPEAKER_38]: Right, but we're into that point and that's really and that's really great but just thinking about this way.

2860
04:10:15,104 --> 04:10:18,687
[SPEAKER_38]: In a sense, you are targeting because right now you're speaking about homeowners.

2861
04:10:19,208 --> 04:10:20,269
[SPEAKER_38]: So, and renters

2862
04:10:22,246 --> 04:10:38,000
[SPEAKER_47]: Right, but on this on this particular topic we're speaking about homeowners, not necessarily, you know, it would also apply to commercial property, it would apply to the large developers who own multiple apartments so it's not just homeowners it's all owners of property residential commercial at all sizes.

2863
04:10:38,331 --> 04:10:46,536
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, so expand the definition I understand commercial owners landowners which all of our major taxes target target per se, right.

2864
04:10:47,257 --> 04:10:48,297
[SPEAKER_47]: So, thank you.

2865
04:10:48,978 --> 04:10:55,702
[SPEAKER_42]: Go to Councilor Leming then we'll go back to public participation Councilor Leming know I was just saying that we should move on to the next.

2866
04:10:56,122 --> 04:10:56,763
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2867
04:10:56,803 --> 04:11:16,560
[SPEAKER_43]: Any further comments from members of the council Councilor say, I just wanted to thank the last speaker for for his tone, and it, you know, I support President Bears is and Councilor Lazzaros, what what what they said about it I don't think this is the one tool I don't think it's a be all, and all I think a lot of it depends on the design of the program.

2868
04:11:18,444 --> 04:11:24,808
[SPEAKER_43]: Looking at Governor Healey's plan, 80% of revenue generated by this would actually be from commercial.

2869
04:11:24,828 --> 04:11:28,530
[SPEAKER_43]: So it would be from the flippers and not from the residential as well.

2870
04:11:29,190 --> 04:11:30,891
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think that's really important to mention.

2871
04:11:31,431 --> 04:11:37,715
[SPEAKER_43]: I think equally important to mention is that zoning is a top priority of both this council, but also me as a councilor.

2872
04:11:37,795 --> 04:11:40,437
[SPEAKER_43]: And we're, I believe, holding a meeting on it tomorrow at 6 p.m.

2873
04:11:40,597 --> 04:11:41,157
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, we are.

2874
04:11:41,477 --> 04:11:42,998
[SPEAKER_43]: So we're very much getting on it.

2875
04:11:43,759 --> 04:11:44,799
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2876
04:11:45,279 --> 04:11:45,960
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Marks.

2877
04:11:47,336 --> 04:11:48,298
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2878
04:11:48,438 --> 04:11:54,448
[SPEAKER_32]: And thank you for to the members of the council for hearing us all so late.

2879
04:11:54,989 --> 04:11:55,710
[SPEAKER_32]: We appreciate it.

2880
04:11:56,531 --> 04:11:56,652
[SPEAKER_32]: Um

2881
04:11:58,181 --> 04:12:13,190
[SPEAKER_32]: The one thing I need to start off by addressing is the fact that it was mentioned by Councilor Callahan that this proposal may not have legs to stand on, you know, it may never get through the legislative process.

2882
04:12:14,010 --> 04:12:22,255
[SPEAKER_32]: And I would say with all the things that we need to do as a community, in particular regarding affordable housing,

2883
04:12:23,136 --> 04:12:29,291
[SPEAKER_32]: Why would we waste an ounce of energy on something that we know is not going to go anywhere?

2884
04:12:30,177 --> 04:12:41,645
[SPEAKER_32]: And the reason why I say that is under the current housing production plan, which is a five year plan that was signed by the council on September 27th, 2022.

2885
04:12:42,545 --> 04:12:56,194
[SPEAKER_32]: And it created by the city and is a state recognized planning tool, which establishes 18 housing strategies for the planning and production of affordable housing stock in the community.

2886
04:12:57,215 --> 04:12:59,617
[SPEAKER_32]: A transfer fee alone

2887
04:13:00,407 --> 04:13:03,989
[SPEAKER_32]: is not a plan to create affordable housing.

2888
04:13:05,130 --> 04:13:22,180
[SPEAKER_32]: It was never mentioned at all a transfer fee in the 117 page housing production plan that the city hired a private consultant to come in and work with many city agencies, state agencies, this council to develop.

2889
04:13:23,661 --> 04:13:24,662
[SPEAKER_32]: One strategy

2890
04:13:25,441 --> 04:13:34,749
[SPEAKER_32]: to create additional affordable housing outlined in the housing production plan is called affordable infill.

2891
04:13:35,910 --> 04:13:40,373
[SPEAKER_32]: And that may be a new terminology for people, but it's written right within the production plan.

2892
04:13:40,754 --> 04:13:53,144
[SPEAKER_32]: And I remember as a city council, we discussed this issue ad nauseum because at the time it had a lot of merit in creating additional affordable housing citywide.

2893
04:13:54,448 --> 04:14:00,011
[SPEAKER_32]: not just in Wellington Circle where I live, or not just in South Bedford, but citywide.

2894
04:14:01,492 --> 04:14:02,112
[SPEAKER_32]: Think about that.

2895
04:14:02,152 --> 04:14:05,374
[SPEAKER_32]: Think about adding affordable housing in all sections of the neighborhood.

2896
04:14:05,934 --> 04:14:15,479
[SPEAKER_32]: There are roughly currently right now 550 vacant city and privately owned lots that are non-buildable.

2897
04:14:17,220 --> 04:14:23,363
[SPEAKER_32]: Through zoning, through dimensions, through setbacks, through lot size, but they're non-buildable.

2898
04:14:24,656 --> 04:14:44,323
[SPEAKER_32]: We can create, through zoning provisions, an infill ordinance that would allow us, with these existing current lots, we're not talking about transfer fee, we're not talking about all these pies in the sky, the current lots, the city owns 128 of these 550-odd lots that are out the community.

2899
04:14:48,104 --> 04:14:56,109
[SPEAKER_32]: we could create a housing trust fund with those hundred and 20 think about 129 lots in the city that could be valued at 75 85 100,000.

2900
04:14:58,071 --> 04:15:02,814
[SPEAKER_32]: And the reason why I value that is because we're looking at creating affordable housing.

2901
04:15:03,214 --> 04:15:03,414
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

2902
04:15:03,795 --> 04:15:17,664
[SPEAKER_32]: So think about creating a first of its kind, where we tap into these odd sized lots, work with the city, work with developers that do affordable housing, and start moving, not rental units,

2903
04:15:19,085 --> 04:15:24,909
[SPEAKER_32]: We're talking about home ownership, generational wealth that we would create in this community.

2904
04:15:25,750 --> 04:15:30,534
[SPEAKER_32]: And this right now is something that you have at your fingertips.

2905
04:15:30,974 --> 04:15:32,836
[SPEAKER_32]: This is something you can do tomorrow.

2906
04:15:34,477 --> 04:15:37,079
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's been in this plan since FY21.

2907
04:15:37,219 --> 04:15:40,442
[SPEAKER_32]: And there's been, you know what action on this?

2908
04:15:41,703 --> 04:15:44,265
[SPEAKER_32]: Goose eggs, goose eggs.

2909
04:15:46,215 --> 04:15:54,200
[SPEAKER_32]: And the low-lying fruit right now, councilor, is what a monkey would decide to do, is let's just tax people.

2910
04:15:55,560 --> 04:15:56,641
[SPEAKER_32]: That's the easy thing, right?

2911
04:15:56,781 --> 04:15:58,362
[SPEAKER_32]: We need money, let's just tax people.

2912
04:15:59,022 --> 04:16:08,728
[SPEAKER_32]: We have a way to create revenue, we have land, we have the will of the city, we have the will of this council, and we're not moving forward.

2913
04:16:09,188 --> 04:16:13,871
[SPEAKER_32]: So rather than waste time on something, a home rule petition that's gonna go nowhere,

2914
04:16:15,049 --> 04:16:18,972
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's start spinning our wheels on things that will produce results.

2915
04:16:19,473 --> 04:16:20,714
[SPEAKER_32]: And this is one of them.

2916
04:16:20,734 --> 04:16:22,755
[SPEAKER_32]: 30 seconds.

2917
04:16:22,776 --> 04:16:23,216
[SPEAKER_32]: 30 seconds.

2918
04:16:24,477 --> 04:16:27,539
[SPEAKER_32]: One last thing I'd like to mention, and this is important.

2919
04:16:28,080 --> 04:16:30,622
[SPEAKER_32]: I was involved with creating Method's first dog park.

2920
04:16:30,982 --> 04:16:32,143
[SPEAKER_32]: What does it have to do with this?

2921
04:16:32,564 --> 04:16:33,384
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely nothing.

2922
04:16:33,785 --> 04:16:38,569
[SPEAKER_32]: I was involved with creating Method's first art center that we just had a ribbon cutting.

2923
04:16:39,109 --> 04:16:40,610
[SPEAKER_32]: And I can tell you unequivocally,

2924
04:16:41,411 --> 04:16:49,417
[SPEAKER_32]: If we started off both those meetings, we would not have a dog park, reference for a dog park, or an art center, by saying, you know how we're going to pay for this?

2925
04:16:49,998 --> 04:16:51,259
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go to the taxpayers.

2926
04:16:51,879 --> 04:16:55,723
[SPEAKER_32]: We went to the Stanton Foundation, and they paid for the entire dog park.

2927
04:16:56,448 --> 04:17:09,337
[SPEAKER_32]: Right, we got a fund in a public private partnership with fitness wellness fitness to pay for our center for the next 10 years, not one cent of taxpayer money went to this.

2928
04:17:10,018 --> 04:17:16,243
[SPEAKER_32]: So if we're looking at killing affordable housing this community, keep on this track, we're going to kill a dead.

2929
04:17:17,216 --> 04:17:24,427
[SPEAKER_32]: And if you want to have the opportunity to explore these other avenues that are already out there, there's already a plan.

2930
04:17:24,648 --> 04:17:25,689
[SPEAKER_32]: He's already been vetted.

2931
04:17:25,709 --> 04:17:26,951
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's move forward.

2932
04:17:26,991 --> 04:17:27,853
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to work with you.

2933
04:17:28,053 --> 04:17:29,155
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's move forward.

2934
04:17:29,235 --> 04:17:29,796
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2935
04:17:29,896 --> 04:17:30,216
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2936
04:17:38,464 --> 04:17:42,087
[SPEAKER_47]: We actually we have been talking about the infill overlay.

2937
04:17:42,547 --> 04:17:53,597
[SPEAKER_47]: We have a meeting tomorrow night on an infill overlays part of the process of what we're doing so again we are spinning the wheels, as was said on that, and many other we can pass it tomorrow.

2938
04:17:57,503 --> 04:17:58,243
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Callahan.

2939
04:17:58,303 --> 04:18:06,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, just point of personal privilege and I appreciate the opportunity in case other folks, maybe I misspoke or people didn't understand what I said earlier.

2940
04:18:06,525 --> 04:18:10,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I was not saying that if we pass something like this, it will never get through the state house.

2941
04:18:10,606 --> 04:18:20,389
[SPEAKER_08]: What I was saying is that the likelihood that our version, that any version we pass is different from Governor Healey's version is very low.

2942
04:18:20,689 --> 04:18:22,530
[SPEAKER_08]: And what that means is that it will be a 1% tax

2943
04:18:24,250 --> 04:18:30,076
[SPEAKER_08]: on buyer or seller, it will only affect homes over a million dollars and only the amount of money over a million dollars.

2944
04:18:30,196 --> 04:18:33,380
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the reason that I brought up how difficult it is to pass through the statehouse.

2945
04:18:33,620 --> 04:18:36,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for giving me the opportunity to restate that.

2946
04:18:36,303 --> 04:18:36,903
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2947
04:18:36,923 --> 04:18:39,266
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

2948
04:18:39,286 --> 04:18:40,287
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

2949
04:18:40,503 --> 04:18:41,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

2950
04:18:41,044 --> 04:18:47,169
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Penny Taylor I'm a resident at 29 Martin Street in Medford and I appreciate the opportunity and all of your time.

2951
04:18:48,130 --> 04:18:49,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I love living here.

2952
04:18:49,531 --> 04:19:00,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I want me and everyone who wants to live in this great place to be able to do so I'm proud to be a renter, a dedicated community member and that is why I'm so excited that we're talking about the transfer fee here tonight.

2953
04:19:00,922 --> 04:19:14,994
[SPEAKER_03]: My day job is coordinating anti displacement programs and policies, many of which are funded by an affordable housing trust fund, and what they do is they work they keep neighbors house, they keep kids stable in their schools, and they keep workers near their jobs.

2954
04:19:15,535 --> 04:19:20,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So spoiler alert, I'm excited about the transfer fee here in Medford I'm excited we're talking about it, and I'm.

2955
04:19:20,859 --> 04:19:33,249
[SPEAKER_03]: really excited that there's a local option to craft what we need for our community here it's not a boiler print it's not one size fits all it's a recruiting the local option, which is also what the state level legislation allows us to do.

2956
04:19:33,669 --> 04:19:34,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really support it.

2957
04:19:34,850 --> 04:19:39,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to drop some facts because I was hearing a lot about homeowners earlier so I was going to

2958
04:19:41,940 --> 04:19:43,041
[SPEAKER_03]: present some information.

2959
04:19:43,161 --> 04:19:47,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So to rent a place means to pay monthly to have a place to live a home, right?

2960
04:19:48,564 --> 04:19:54,568
[SPEAKER_03]: An old rule of thumb that you hear for budgeting sake is that you should not spend more than 30% of your income on rent.

2961
04:19:55,109 --> 04:19:59,131
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do spend more than 30% of your income on rent, you're considered rent burdened.

2962
04:19:59,672 --> 04:20:04,235
[SPEAKER_03]: If you spend more than 50% of your income on rent, you are considered severely rent burdened.

2963
04:20:05,196 --> 04:20:11,680
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the 2024 America's Rental Housing Report from the Harvard Joint Center on Housing in our region,

2964
04:20:13,881 --> 04:20:29,851
[SPEAKER_03]: 52% of renters are rent burdened, that's more than half of all renters are paying more than 30% for their rent, and 27% of renters in our area are severely rent burdened, which means they're paying more than 50% of their income for rent every single month.

2965
04:20:30,252 --> 04:20:33,314
[SPEAKER_03]: A quarter of our neighbors are paying that much for rent every month.

2966
04:20:34,374 --> 04:20:35,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we going to do?

2967
04:20:38,700 --> 04:20:48,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I really met for can support the state level local option transfer fee which allows all cities and towns to make decisions based on what they need create their own legislation.

2968
04:20:48,893 --> 04:20:53,119
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we really should do is start having this conversation now and committees figure out

2969
04:20:53,720 --> 04:20:59,443
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to, there isn't a thing people are referring to the stress about percentages and things like it hasn't been written yet.

2970
04:20:59,523 --> 04:21:00,263
[SPEAKER_03]: It is up to us.

2971
04:21:00,343 --> 04:21:01,304
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to decide.

2972
04:21:01,364 --> 04:21:02,604
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the exciting thing here.

2973
04:21:02,945 --> 04:21:05,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk about who pays the fee, the buyer, the seller or split.

2974
04:21:06,226 --> 04:21:07,907
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk about what the threshold is.

2975
04:21:08,267 --> 04:21:09,548
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about the percentage.

2976
04:21:09,608 --> 04:21:11,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these are not decisions that have been made yet.

2977
04:21:12,109 --> 04:21:16,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight I saw as an opportunity to share what we thought those decisions should be.

2978
04:21:16,591 --> 04:21:19,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate the opportunity to say so.

2979
04:21:20,693 --> 04:21:32,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I would encourage people to check out realestatetransferfee.org for the state level lots of reports, studies that have been done to see the financial feasibility on individuals and a community with these situations.

2980
04:21:33,400 --> 04:21:38,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do just wanna say like, I love living here, I love my neighbors.

2981
04:21:38,723 --> 04:21:49,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a lot of talk tonight about fear of the imagined impacts of this on people instead of acknowledging the current real fears and stresses renters are experiencing in this area.

2982
04:21:50,367 --> 04:21:59,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And the extreme inability to have economic mobility that the current housing price presents to so many residents in Medford, and the region.

2983
04:22:00,361 --> 04:22:06,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love Medford and my neighbors, I hope future meetings are a little more neighborly than tonight this was.

2984
04:22:07,470 --> 04:22:09,291
[SPEAKER_03]: a strange feeling for me in this room.

2985
04:22:09,671 --> 04:22:16,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just urge everybody, oh, actually I did hear one great idea, which was more taxes for renters.

2986
04:22:16,133 --> 04:22:20,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would really, you know, I love the enthusiasm for more taxes in this group.

2987
04:22:20,274 --> 04:22:21,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I appreciate your time.

2988
04:22:21,555 --> 04:22:22,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night.

2989
04:22:23,115 --> 04:22:23,756
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2990
04:22:25,716 --> 04:22:30,678
[SPEAKER_47]: If folks could take their private conversations outside and please just close the doors of the room, that would be appreciated.

2991
04:22:30,738 --> 04:22:31,158
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2992
04:22:32,218 --> 04:22:33,839
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. McGilvery, if you could maybe grab that one.

2993
04:22:35,435 --> 04:22:36,535
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the records, please.

2994
04:22:36,555 --> 04:22:39,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, my name is Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road.

2995
04:22:40,557 --> 04:22:46,799
[SPEAKER_16]: I only have like basically a couple of points because I heard like a lot of arguments that I agree with.

2996
04:22:47,519 --> 04:22:58,603
[SPEAKER_16]: So to me, basically the main point is that what's flawed about tonight's discussion is that we are already discussing funding affordable housing through taxation.

2997
04:23:00,664 --> 04:23:06,047
[SPEAKER_16]: which involves using someone else's money to assist others.

2998
04:23:06,427 --> 04:23:09,609
[SPEAKER_16]: And this often leads to an efficiency and a lack of accountability.

2999
04:23:10,529 --> 04:23:12,711
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was mentioned about, for example, the budget.

3000
04:23:13,651 --> 04:23:14,212
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

3001
04:23:14,892 --> 04:23:23,037
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems that there's a lack of transparency in government, or at least not as much transparency as one would like to see, as a citizen would like to see in Medford.

3002
04:23:24,257 --> 04:23:43,089
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure why, instead of just having decided that we're gonna discuss funding affordable housing through taxation, we're not voting tonight, or you're voting tonight, what other mechanisms we can use in order to fund affordable housing.

3003
04:23:44,630 --> 04:23:52,535
[SPEAKER_16]: So for example, more market-oriented approach that promotes competition and reducing regulatory barriers might be more effective,

3004
04:23:54,396 --> 04:23:57,179
[SPEAKER_16]: We're meeting on that tomorrow night.

3005
04:23:57,199 --> 04:24:02,924
[SPEAKER_16]: But why are you voting on this tonight versus voting on discussing all approaches?

3006
04:24:03,024 --> 04:24:13,373
[SPEAKER_47]: It's kind of just how Councilor Callaghan, and I'll pause your time, apologies, but every topic we want to discuss has to be proposed on the agenda, and then it can go to a committee to be discussed further.

3007
04:24:13,473 --> 04:24:15,535
[SPEAKER_47]: So we've already brought up topics around

3008
04:24:17,481 --> 04:24:23,005
[SPEAKER_47]: inclusionary zoning, around zoning reform to reduce regulatory barriers, around a multitude of issues.

3009
04:24:23,025 --> 04:24:28,910
[SPEAKER_47]: So those are already in committee, we've already been discussing them, and this is being added to a list of items for consideration.

3010
04:24:29,070 --> 04:24:42,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, but by being done this way, President Bears, then what happens is that now you basically have opened the doors to go in this route tonight, taxation, and then maybe tomorrow you address zoning

3011
04:24:43,501 --> 04:24:44,702
[SPEAKER_16]: for some other reasons, right?

3012
04:24:45,042 --> 04:24:59,488
[SPEAKER_16]: So it would have been a lot more efficient, efficient government to basically have the discussion about what are all the approaches, including taxation, but others like market-oriented approaches to solve the housing affordability problem.

3013
04:24:59,528 --> 04:25:00,549
[SPEAKER_47]: That is what we're doing.

3014
04:25:00,749 --> 04:25:01,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I hope to see that.

3015
04:25:02,069 --> 04:25:07,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So the second point, and I brought this before related to the tree ordinance,

3016
04:25:08,052 --> 04:25:26,248
[SPEAKER_16]: is that, and I want to say this based on some comments from city councillors before we had the recess, so I would like to remind everyone that, you know, elected officials govern for all citizens of Medford, not just those that voted for them,

3017
04:25:27,089 --> 04:25:36,545
[SPEAKER_16]: And moreover, only just above 30% of registered voters vote in an election, which is appalling.

3018
04:25:37,106 --> 04:25:39,169
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you know, I think

3019
04:25:40,185 --> 04:25:41,686
[SPEAKER_16]: We are all interested in democracy.

3020
04:25:42,327 --> 04:25:45,871
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm confident that you are heavily invested in it.

3021
04:25:45,931 --> 04:25:47,692
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why you're city councilors.

3022
04:25:48,153 --> 04:25:58,183
[SPEAKER_16]: I encourage you to examine why 70% of registered voters, and that doesn't even include the people that drop out of the registered voting list.

3023
04:25:58,723 --> 04:26:05,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I get the census every year, every other year, and if you don't respond to it and you fail to vote, then you drop out.

3024
04:26:06,114 --> 04:26:14,586
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're talking that less than 30% of people age 18 and older that could vote are actually not even involved in our democratic process.

3025
04:26:15,467 --> 04:26:28,437
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would like you to put some emphasis on why that is happening and how we can actually get those people to get involved because you're also governing for them.

3026
04:26:29,078 --> 04:26:31,240
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not just for people that have voted for you.

3027
04:26:31,560 --> 04:26:42,549
[SPEAKER_16]: So I please urge you to just consider everyone's opinions and not just those that the ones that you think have voted for you.

3028
04:26:43,169 --> 04:26:46,090
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think those are the two issues I wanted to bring up.

3029
04:26:46,110 --> 04:26:47,010
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much.

3030
04:26:47,290 --> 04:26:53,551
[SPEAKER_47]: And I just wanted to note as well, we are meeting on that issue of public engagement and why we have low turnout in elections.

3031
04:26:53,571 --> 04:26:57,772
[SPEAKER_47]: There's a number of items in the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee on that issue as well.

3032
04:26:58,272 --> 04:27:05,034
[SPEAKER_47]: And to be quite frank, all of us have devoted not just hours, but also tens of thousands of dollars to trying to get more people to vote.

3033
04:27:05,114 --> 04:27:05,674
[SPEAKER_47]: So we share.

3034
04:27:06,161 --> 04:27:08,523
[SPEAKER_47]: that same goal of trying to turn more people out in this community.

3035
04:27:09,324 --> 04:27:11,666
[SPEAKER_47]: Personally, I believe more turnout and more voice is better.

3036
04:27:11,786 --> 04:27:14,288
[SPEAKER_47]: So the more people we can get to vote, it's a good thing.

3037
04:27:15,149 --> 04:27:15,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

3038
04:27:15,609 --> 04:27:15,869
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3039
04:27:19,492 --> 04:27:19,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3040
04:27:19,812 --> 04:27:21,174
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

3041
04:27:21,514 --> 04:27:24,136
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, my name is Harrison Green to Ronaleigh Road.

3042
04:27:24,156 --> 04:27:26,158
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm prepared a short statement.

3043
04:27:28,506 --> 04:27:31,308
[SPEAKER_24]: In 2021, I was fortunate enough to buy my house.

3044
04:27:32,128 --> 04:27:35,630
[SPEAKER_24]: In the time since, it has appreciated over $50,000, according to Zillow.

3045
04:27:36,130 --> 04:27:41,572
[SPEAKER_24]: That huge increase didn't come from my sweat mowing the yard or being a mediocre amateur handyman.

3046
04:27:42,153 --> 04:27:45,494
[SPEAKER_24]: It's because of housing scarcity in Medford and the surrounding communities.

3047
04:27:46,555 --> 04:27:53,178
[SPEAKER_24]: While I now stand to profit from this scarcity, I understand that it comes at the cost of pushing out our most financially vulnerable residents.

3048
04:27:54,124 --> 04:28:02,390
[SPEAKER_24]: paying into any potentially proposed fund, if applicable, when and if I move, would be a small step towards repaying those who I profited from.

3049
04:28:03,110 --> 04:28:08,514
[SPEAKER_24]: I support the City Council exploring methods to fund the Affordable Housing Trust, including a real estate transfer fee.

3050
04:28:09,235 --> 04:28:14,538
[SPEAKER_24]: Over time, it will allow our city to mitigate our local housing crisis while prioritizing residents.

3051
04:28:15,019 --> 04:28:15,319
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3052
04:28:15,959 --> 04:28:16,360
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3053
04:28:20,902 --> 04:28:22,662
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi Sharon name and address for the record, please.

3054
04:28:23,062 --> 04:28:32,444
[SPEAKER_68]: Good evening sharing DSL mass average circuit road, I've been a resident of the city for over, you had to make me say it right present yes, 60 years.

3055
04:28:33,164 --> 04:28:34,625
[SPEAKER_68]: So, here we go.

3056
04:28:35,185 --> 04:28:46,627
[SPEAKER_68]: I will bet right now, I was going to start this on a different note and I'm not going to take a lot of time because people are tired I even left roast stuffed peppers with my company at home to come down here.

3057
04:28:47,407 --> 04:28:51,093
[SPEAKER_68]: So, I may go to a dispensary myself tomorrow.

3058
04:28:51,113 --> 04:28:53,376
[SPEAKER_68]: It's about.

3059
04:28:53,937 --> 04:29:01,948
[SPEAKER_68]: It's probably sorry about 50 years since I've had one of those babies in my mouth so anyway.

3060
04:29:02,509 --> 04:29:05,490
[SPEAKER_68]: But I wouldn't be able, I wouldn't be able to teach again.

3061
04:29:05,890 --> 04:29:09,231
[SPEAKER_68]: I had the had the gracious honor of having Mr. shop Kelly's daughter.

3062
04:29:10,011 --> 04:29:13,252
[SPEAKER_68]: Last year so we all we all we've all been there.

3063
04:29:14,192 --> 04:29:17,673
[SPEAKER_68]: Very lovely family Mr. shop Kelly Thank you and President beers.

3064
04:29:18,114 --> 04:29:22,475
[SPEAKER_68]: I have conversed with these gentlemen in the past and also the Honorable Adam.

3065
04:29:23,215 --> 04:29:25,637
[SPEAKER_68]: her to be and also, Mr. poor.

3066
04:29:26,437 --> 04:29:28,138
[SPEAKER_68]: So, my, my year show.

3067
04:29:29,139 --> 04:29:34,822
[SPEAKER_68]: I'll make a bet that half of you know maybe all of you now including Adam etc.

3068
04:29:35,502 --> 04:29:42,046
[SPEAKER_68]: The outpour, not only of interest but of intelligence that came to this podium that I'm lacking.

3069
04:29:42,726 --> 04:29:46,787
[SPEAKER_68]: in statistics in real estate and figure work, etc.

3070
04:29:47,387 --> 04:29:58,511
[SPEAKER_68]: What was disappointing to me, except for a couple because I know that they have been here for many years and I've heard them go with our public records and statistics etc you people are newer.

3071
04:29:59,918 --> 04:30:01,199
[SPEAKER_68]: That should be your job.

3072
04:30:01,959 --> 04:30:12,447
[SPEAKER_68]: That should have been reviewed before these people had to come out tonight, because this is a little bit jarring to us, not just for property owners.

3073
04:30:12,487 --> 04:30:19,092
[SPEAKER_68]: You see, it's gonna have, and you might not like this, because it probably came partly from Reagan and Trump, it is a little trickle down.

3074
04:30:19,672 --> 04:30:28,818
[SPEAKER_68]: It will affect the community in the future, not only for older people, they may be 58, maybe wanna go live near their kids or something, selling their homes,

3075
04:30:30,139 --> 04:30:38,144
[SPEAKER_68]: It also will eventually affect real estate agents because they're going to have to drop a little bit of an extra cracked eggshell.

3076
04:30:38,724 --> 04:30:42,687
[SPEAKER_68]: Oh, before you sign the passing we forgot to tell you we have to disclose all facts.

3077
04:30:43,187 --> 04:30:47,930
[SPEAKER_68]: If you decide you need to move because of your job in five years, you have to pay the city 2%.

3078
04:30:49,671 --> 04:30:54,394
[SPEAKER_68]: I'm sorry, there's a couple of real estate agents here, I hope that they're agreeing with me.

3079
04:30:55,094 --> 04:31:05,408
[SPEAKER_68]: Then what's going to happen, people who do move in and buy multi unit homes, they're going to have to raise their rent because they're going to have that 2% that's going to keep going in their, in their minds.

3080
04:31:05,848 --> 04:31:09,493
[SPEAKER_68]: So what was amazing for me tonight and the reason why I wanted to come down was.

3081
04:31:11,735 --> 04:31:14,156
[SPEAKER_68]: I used to write articles for our newspaper.

3082
04:31:14,356 --> 04:31:15,577
[SPEAKER_68]: Isn't this sad, everybody?

3083
04:31:15,757 --> 04:31:17,138
[SPEAKER_68]: We don't even have a newspaper.

3084
04:31:17,178 --> 04:31:21,840
[SPEAKER_68]: It's amazing that people even know that Method is still on the map.

3085
04:31:22,260 --> 04:31:26,662
[SPEAKER_68]: It's very, very sad and disheartening and disenchanting to me.

3086
04:31:28,203 --> 04:31:37,507
[SPEAKER_68]: So I wrote articles, and one of them was, and one of the criticisms for a public election, that this country is a very benevolent country.

3087
04:31:39,252 --> 04:31:42,913
[SPEAKER_68]: Just not on the voice of religion, I want to bring up something briefly.

3088
04:31:43,314 --> 04:31:58,099
[SPEAKER_68]: As an example, Catholic charities and Jewish philanthropies are the largest, largest donations of missionary goods, goods to help young children in strife, donations for food and money, biggest in history all over the world.

3089
04:31:58,139 --> 04:32:01,040
[SPEAKER_68]: We've all heard the names, all heard the names out there.

3090
04:32:01,420 --> 04:32:03,161
[SPEAKER_68]: So I don't want to hear from anybody.

3091
04:32:03,321 --> 04:32:07,743
[SPEAKER_68]: If you don't support this 2% tax, you're being a mean person.

3092
04:32:08,203 --> 04:32:20,628
[SPEAKER_68]: The hurting thing is that people came to the microphone tonight, they have a myriad, a myriad of ideas, this meeting tonight, if not years ago, and in the future meetings should be with you.

3093
04:32:21,548 --> 04:32:33,936
[SPEAKER_68]: Maybe the mayor, people who are interested in developers interested in projects like this, bringing them to the table and thinking of ways to entice them to be in this community.

3094
04:32:34,416 --> 04:32:44,402
[SPEAKER_68]: What in the world made you attack, again, the homeowner of this, you know, the city, we try to maintain our properties, and you know why I was almost crying coming here tonight.

3095
04:32:44,602 --> 04:32:46,063
[SPEAKER_68]: Do you know what I did the other day?

3096
04:32:46,363 --> 04:32:48,385
[SPEAKER_68]: And I'm going to maybe ready for hip surgery.

3097
04:32:48,425 --> 04:32:52,407
[SPEAKER_68]: And I did it even though my eye surgeon said, don't bend and lift things.

3098
04:32:52,787 --> 04:32:55,669
[SPEAKER_68]: I helped Colin clean trash out of his gutter.

3099
04:32:55,930 --> 04:33:05,176
[SPEAKER_68]: And then I was down in Salem Street picking trash up out of the gutter and all blown all over the area that I'm going to clean again next to Colleen's for my flowers.

3100
04:33:05,576 --> 04:33:12,441
[SPEAKER_68]: You should be here discussing via really, really vital issues with our taxpayer money that are simple and used to be.

3101
04:33:13,041 --> 04:33:29,365
[SPEAKER_68]: taking care of with a phone call and Mr. Shapely can attest to it, to people who own businesses and were on the council, who were former doctors and were on the council, who were former principals of the city on the council and were real estate agents and owned big vital business and knew how to run a budget.

3102
04:33:29,825 --> 04:33:39,008
[SPEAKER_68]: That's who should be here having a meeting, developing land more, the loss of Mr. Marks, so devoted to this city still, and also on Mystic Avenue.

3103
04:33:39,148 --> 04:33:40,028
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you very much.

3104
04:33:40,048 --> 04:33:40,468
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Sharon.

3105
04:33:45,697 --> 04:33:47,117
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

3106
04:33:48,458 --> 04:33:58,781
[SPEAKER_58]: Patrick McCabe, 78 Whittier Road, and I was gonna speak, but she said she had stuffed peppers and marijuana.

3107
04:34:01,662 --> 04:34:03,443
[SPEAKER_47]: Don't say that to me and George, okay?

3108
04:34:03,463 --> 04:34:04,763
[SPEAKER_47]: We're the only ones left out here.

3109
04:34:04,923 --> 04:34:08,245
[SPEAKER_58]: I think George said motion to adjourn.

3110
04:34:08,265 --> 04:34:09,585
[SPEAKER_58]: Stuffed peppers and marijuana?

3111
04:34:09,825 --> 04:34:10,625
[SPEAKER_58]: With marijuana?

3112
04:34:10,725 --> 04:34:13,026
[SPEAKER_58]: That was motion to adjourn, George said.

3113
04:34:13,766 --> 04:34:14,967
[SPEAKER_47]: At least a long recess.

3114
04:34:15,566 --> 04:34:18,468
[SPEAKER_58]: So I've lived in Medford for 22 years.

3115
04:34:20,069 --> 04:34:27,714
[SPEAKER_58]: Some of those years as a renter, like half of the council, some of those years as an owner, like half of the council, and now I'm a landlord.

3116
04:34:28,054 --> 04:34:34,799
[SPEAKER_58]: And I applaud the city council for taking up this action and doing something.

3117
04:34:35,379 --> 04:34:43,184
[SPEAKER_58]: And the reason why I'm saying doing something is because I was fourth generation Somerville, born of Irish immigrants.

3118
04:34:44,426 --> 04:34:59,114
[SPEAKER_58]: And our family, our family, four generations in Somerville and we could not, I could not afford to move back to Somerville when I left the military after serving four years at West Point and eight years in the Army Infantry.

3119
04:34:59,294 --> 04:35:01,115
[SPEAKER_58]: I could not afford to move back to Somerville.

3120
04:35:01,835 --> 04:35:04,737
[SPEAKER_58]: So I want my kids to be able to move back to Medford.

3121
04:35:04,757 --> 04:35:06,998
[SPEAKER_58]: And that's why I applaud what you're doing.

3122
04:35:07,739 --> 04:35:13,142
[SPEAKER_58]: I want the hundreds of kids that I coached in Medford rec hockey to be able to come back to the city.

3123
04:35:13,903 --> 04:35:19,426
[SPEAKER_58]: I want our city workers, I used to be executive director of SEIU 888 that represents the city workers.

3124
04:35:19,967 --> 04:35:23,209
[SPEAKER_58]: I want them to be able to afford to live in this city.

3125
04:35:24,252 --> 04:35:30,958
[SPEAKER_58]: I want the nursing home workers at Courtyard and Medford Rehab that I represent to be able to live in this city.

3126
04:35:31,618 --> 04:35:38,824
[SPEAKER_58]: And they make $18 an hour cleaning ass, which is an honorable job.

3127
04:35:38,844 --> 04:35:43,628
[SPEAKER_58]: And they shouldn't need to have three jobs to be able to afford a job in this city.

3128
04:35:44,809 --> 04:35:46,410
[SPEAKER_58]: And why are prices going up?

3129
04:35:46,930 --> 04:35:48,272
[SPEAKER_58]: Because of the profiteering.

3130
04:35:48,872 --> 04:35:50,954
[SPEAKER_58]: And we need to put an end to the profiteering.

3131
04:35:52,262 --> 04:35:54,343
[SPEAKER_58]: And so we're trying to do something here.

3132
04:35:54,883 --> 04:35:55,503
[SPEAKER_58]: I applaud it.

3133
04:35:56,203 --> 04:36:09,646
[SPEAKER_58]: And I also, I respect what everybody here said about not taking it out on working class people, not taking it out on seniors, not taking it out on people who are below median wage.

3134
04:36:10,786 --> 04:36:13,227
[SPEAKER_58]: I've heard the council say that they all support that.

3135
04:36:14,047 --> 04:36:17,628
[SPEAKER_58]: So, so long as you support that, I support you and what you're pushing forward.

3136
04:36:18,604 --> 04:36:21,647
[SPEAKER_58]: saying is to those who much is given, much is expected.

3137
04:36:22,227 --> 04:36:31,434
[SPEAKER_58]: I've been given a lot and I'm okay with giving back to the city of Method, to the children of Medford so that they can afford to live in this city.

3138
04:36:31,955 --> 04:36:38,820
[SPEAKER_58]: So I applaud you for doing something and we need to do something or Medford's gonna be just like Summerville.

3139
04:36:38,901 --> 04:36:40,422
[SPEAKER_58]: I don't wanna be like Summerville is now.

3140
04:36:40,482 --> 04:36:42,483
[SPEAKER_58]: I want Medford to stay the way Medford is.

3141
04:36:43,164 --> 04:36:45,806
[SPEAKER_58]: And if we do nothing, that's what's gonna happen.

3142
04:36:46,847 --> 04:36:47,768
[SPEAKER_58]: So thank you very much.

3143
04:36:49,531 --> 04:36:49,991
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3144
04:36:51,292 --> 04:36:52,853
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

3145
04:36:53,834 --> 04:36:54,294
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, thank you.

3146
04:36:54,334 --> 04:36:57,596
[SPEAKER_57]: It's Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street.

3147
04:36:57,997 --> 04:37:03,320
[SPEAKER_57]: My wife and I have lived there and owned that home for almost 24 years.

3148
04:37:04,921 --> 04:37:18,291
[SPEAKER_57]: I want to speak in favor of the council exploring adding this fee for certain real estate transactions, but also add that I share

3149
04:37:19,504 --> 04:37:26,747
[SPEAKER_57]: All if most, if not all the concerns of people that have expressed them tonight, some downright in opposition of this.

3150
04:37:27,468 --> 04:37:43,955
[SPEAKER_57]: And the reason I say that is I think we desperately need more revenue in across the city, particularly for affordable housing, where we're in jeopardy of losing funding from the state because we're not at the required amount.

3151
04:37:45,876 --> 04:37:46,656
[SPEAKER_57]: But also, we

3152
04:37:50,333 --> 04:37:56,077
[SPEAKER_57]: we need to look at doing this properly and correctly.

3153
04:37:56,257 --> 04:38:10,045
[SPEAKER_57]: And I think if we do it properly, and this is the first step toward assessing how we would do that, probably this fee would not affect 99% of the people who are in this room tonight.

3154
04:38:11,486 --> 04:38:14,088
[SPEAKER_57]: There's 18 communities that have already passed

3155
04:38:15,523 --> 04:38:21,048
[SPEAKER_57]: this exercise and submitted a home rule petition, one of them being Somerville.

3156
04:38:21,668 --> 04:38:32,177
[SPEAKER_57]: And there was a lot of information presented tonight that I don't know where it came from, but it was gonna be 2%, it was gonna be over a million, nothing has been even proposed.

3157
04:38:32,297 --> 04:38:39,984
[SPEAKER_57]: And there was a misinformation campaign that was put out aggressively about this issue that was very unfortunate.

3158
04:38:40,464 --> 04:38:44,167
[SPEAKER_57]: because this is the first step, as was described, where the process begins.

3159
04:38:44,227 --> 04:38:53,233
[SPEAKER_57]: And I think perhaps the way it was on the agenda, it looked like it was farther along than it had been, and it was gonna be sent to the legislature, and it was gonna be done.

3160
04:38:53,593 --> 04:38:55,034
[SPEAKER_57]: This is the first step.

3161
04:38:56,015 --> 04:39:04,901
[SPEAKER_57]: Somerville's first step, also, if people are concerned about this happening tomorrow, Somerville's first step was in 2015, and they're still waiting for their Home Rule petition to be approved.

3162
04:39:05,322 --> 04:39:09,184
[SPEAKER_57]: But a couple of things I'll say about Somerville is that they're,

3163
04:39:10,916 --> 04:39:20,099
[SPEAKER_57]: proposal exempts all owner occupant sellers and all buyers who intend to occupy the property.

3164
04:39:20,539 --> 04:39:21,439
[SPEAKER_57]: That's been said before.

3165
04:39:21,499 --> 04:39:33,483
[SPEAKER_57]: But for example, if I, as the owner of the house I live in, want to sell it to Justin Tsang, who's going to live in the building, there will be no transfer fee on either of us.

3166
04:39:33,963 --> 04:39:43,093
[SPEAKER_57]: even if it's over a million dollars because the aspect that the provision exempting what I just described would trump the amount of money.

3167
04:39:43,213 --> 04:39:47,377
[SPEAKER_57]: So that's an important factor and a lot of people are in that position.

3168
04:39:47,697 --> 04:39:51,081
[SPEAKER_57]: The main intention was to levy what it was 1% some ago.

3169
04:39:52,751 --> 04:39:59,779
[SPEAKER_57]: on investors, developers, and absentee landlords who buy and sell property in Somerville.

3170
04:40:00,219 --> 04:40:02,382
[SPEAKER_57]: Go up and down the streets in Medford today.

3171
04:40:02,442 --> 04:40:07,968
[SPEAKER_57]: This is a real issue that we need to look at with regard to this fee.

3172
04:40:10,014 --> 04:40:28,429
[SPEAKER_57]: Developers are coming in and finding homes that are in poor condition, buy them for four or $500,000, put another three or $400,000 into them, converting them to condos, and then selling each condo for a million dollars or more.

3173
04:40:28,489 --> 04:40:31,492
[SPEAKER_57]: Look in the Boston Globe, they sit there every Sunday, they're in there.

3174
04:40:31,512 --> 04:40:33,613
[SPEAKER_57]: Go up and down the streets, you can see it happening everywhere.

3175
04:40:33,633 --> 04:40:34,474
[SPEAKER_47]: You have 30 seconds, Ken.

3176
04:40:34,614 --> 04:40:39,978
[SPEAKER_57]: That's where we need to focus on imposing this fee on that type of developers.

3177
04:40:40,038 --> 04:40:49,586
[SPEAKER_57]: But I urge you to move forward this, begin the process at committee, look at the best practices that already have been vetted in 18 communities to figure out what would work here.

3178
04:40:50,387 --> 04:40:57,152
[SPEAKER_57]: There's a solution to this and I think it's worth exploring because we desperately need the revenue for the city overall.

3179
04:40:57,592 --> 04:40:58,053
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3180
04:41:02,486 --> 04:41:05,068
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi, name and address for the record, please.

3181
04:41:05,088 --> 04:41:05,909
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

3182
04:41:06,049 --> 04:41:06,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

3183
04:41:06,710 --> 04:41:10,193
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Carol Kaskowski 624 High Street.

3184
04:41:11,154 --> 04:41:12,175
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be very brief.

3185
04:41:13,176 --> 04:41:18,080
[SPEAKER_17]: I am a homeowner, I've owned my home in West Bedford for 36 years.

3186
04:41:20,620 --> 04:41:34,785
[SPEAKER_17]: I've heard a lot of different points of view tonight, but I would urge the council to move this forward and continue the discussion with the input of the folks that we've heard from tonight.

3187
04:41:34,805 --> 04:41:39,126
[SPEAKER_17]: I am in favor of this going forward.

3188
04:41:39,607 --> 04:41:40,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

3189
04:41:40,547 --> 04:41:41,187
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much.

3190
04:41:41,207 --> 04:41:45,569
[SPEAKER_47]: Hello again, name and address for the record, please.

3191
04:41:45,609 --> 04:41:46,489
[SPEAKER_47]: You have five minutes.

3192
04:41:47,350 --> 04:41:49,513
[SPEAKER_66]: Angela Murphy 16 cutting street.

3193
04:41:50,855 --> 04:41:55,402
[SPEAKER_66]: My parents bought the home I live in, in 1956 when I was five.

3194
04:41:56,243 --> 04:41:59,007
[SPEAKER_66]: I've been there 68 years I'm 73 this year.

3195
04:41:59,888 --> 04:42:02,352
[SPEAKER_66]: And it's the only home my son has ever known he's 48 tomorrow.

3196
04:42:04,234 --> 04:42:07,939
[SPEAKER_66]: This home over the course of those 68 years that we've owned it.

3197
04:42:08,499 --> 04:42:16,989
[SPEAKER_66]: They have been good stewards they've had only five tenants maybe in the fifth to rent the apartment on the first floor because it's a two family and everything.

3198
04:42:17,389 --> 04:42:19,411
[SPEAKER_66]: We've taken care of everything in that house.

3199
04:42:20,925 --> 04:42:34,909
[SPEAKER_66]: And over the 68 years, I guarantee we've spent over a million dollars keeping that property in shape and all the things we've had to do, because it was derelict when we first bought it in 56 and everything.

3200
04:42:35,409 --> 04:42:48,813
[SPEAKER_66]: If you were to tax my home, and my home is worth over a million dollars, anything you take would take away from the inheritance that my parents left to my sisters and myself.

3201
04:42:49,393 --> 04:42:49,753
[SPEAKER_66]: And now,

3202
04:42:50,393 --> 04:42:55,399
[SPEAKER_66]: to the future generation of my family which hopes to keep on living in that property.

3203
04:42:55,879 --> 04:42:56,860
[SPEAKER_66]: It is our home.

3204
04:42:57,321 --> 04:42:58,282
[SPEAKER_66]: It has been our home.

3205
04:42:58,702 --> 04:43:07,332
[SPEAKER_66]: So if my house is worth 1 million one, anything over that you would take away from me, where I have made no profit on that property in 68 years.

3206
04:43:08,433 --> 04:43:16,997
[SPEAKER_66]: And that's stealing from a person who is working full time at 73 to live in the home that she has lived in for 68 years.

3207
04:43:17,237 --> 04:43:22,779
[SPEAKER_66]: You have no right to do that and should not control anything on my private property.

3208
04:43:23,320 --> 04:43:24,400
[SPEAKER_66]: And that's what I'm saying.

3209
04:43:24,780 --> 04:43:26,601
[SPEAKER_66]: And as a renter, I've been a renter too.

3210
04:43:27,382 --> 04:43:28,242
[SPEAKER_66]: I've been a renter.

3211
04:43:28,322 --> 04:43:29,302
[SPEAKER_66]: I've been on section eight.

3212
04:43:29,683 --> 04:43:31,703
[SPEAKER_66]: I've had to have affordable housing.

3213
04:43:31,723 --> 04:43:33,284
[SPEAKER_66]: I'm a single mother of two children.

3214
04:43:34,505 --> 04:43:35,285
[SPEAKER_66]: I've known it all.

3215
04:43:35,325 --> 04:43:36,486
[SPEAKER_66]: I've been on every spectrum.

3216
04:43:37,529 --> 04:43:38,810
[SPEAKER_66]: What is affordable housing?

3217
04:43:39,610 --> 04:43:41,992
[SPEAKER_66]: Affordable housing, you throw that words around.

3218
04:43:42,952 --> 04:43:56,741
[SPEAKER_66]: You know, the average income for a rental property that you can make for affordable housing, I was brought to my attention by somebody who got the information was $80,000 a year to live in affordable housing.

3219
04:43:56,761 --> 04:43:59,643
[SPEAKER_66]: That's a maximum that somebody can make for a single person.

3220
04:44:00,303 --> 04:44:05,687
[SPEAKER_66]: I made $16,000 a year working at CVS and brought up two children.

3221
04:44:07,409 --> 04:44:10,853
[SPEAKER_66]: And that's never see $80,000 in my life.

3222
04:44:11,494 --> 04:44:22,729
[SPEAKER_66]: So please table this, listen for once to what the residents of Methodist say, because in the past when I was stood at this podium, nobody has listened to anything.

3223
04:44:23,229 --> 04:44:25,172
[SPEAKER_66]: And maybe you were pretending to listen.

3224
04:44:26,510 --> 04:44:40,646
[SPEAKER_66]: But the thing is you don't hear what the people say you have your minds made up, and I'm sad to say, I think they made up already before we even got here, and I'm here and I'm probably not going to work tomorrow because I am so exhausted and frustrated.

3225
04:44:41,107 --> 04:44:41,527
[SPEAKER_66]: Thank you.

3226
04:44:42,068 --> 04:44:42,488
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3227
04:44:48,399 --> 04:44:49,620
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

3228
04:44:50,320 --> 04:44:51,461
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, okay.

3229
04:44:51,541 --> 04:44:53,062
[SPEAKER_42]: It was just a minor point.

3230
04:44:53,082 --> 04:44:54,203
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

3231
04:44:54,583 --> 04:44:58,746
[SPEAKER_42]: But again, we haven't actually discussed the details of what this would look like.

3232
04:44:58,786 --> 04:45:00,227
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd have to go to the committee to do that.

3233
04:45:00,347 --> 04:45:13,217
[SPEAKER_42]: But in other transfer fee proposals, transfers between family members where usually no cash is actually exchanged or it's pretty standard to exclude those from consideration.

3234
04:45:14,057 --> 04:45:23,404
[SPEAKER_42]: you know, and if you gave a, you know, million dollar home to your child, like they're not giving you a million dollars for it.

3235
04:45:23,444 --> 04:45:26,146
[SPEAKER_42]: So there's no cash sort of tax.

3236
04:45:26,166 --> 04:45:31,790
[SPEAKER_42]: So that would, I just want to put that out there that typically in these proposals, those are exempt.

3237
04:45:31,950 --> 04:45:32,230
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

3238
04:45:33,852 --> 04:45:34,552
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Kelly.

3239
04:45:34,572 --> 04:45:35,873
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

3240
04:45:36,233 --> 04:45:39,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Kelly Catalo, 23 Salem Street in Medford.

3241
04:45:39,456 --> 04:45:40,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Kit still with us?

3242
04:45:42,350 --> 04:45:42,810
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, sure.

3243
04:45:42,830 --> 04:45:43,391
[SPEAKER_47]: She's still here.

3244
04:45:43,411 --> 04:45:44,291
[SPEAKER_47]: But okay, good.

3245
04:45:44,311 --> 04:45:44,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3246
04:45:44,771 --> 04:45:49,534
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to have coffee with kit couple of weeks ago.

3247
04:45:50,154 --> 04:45:52,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had great coffee at grounder, which was awesome.

3248
04:45:52,916 --> 04:45:55,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also had a great conversation in an hour.

3249
04:45:56,237 --> 04:46:03,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that hour, a lot of the stuff that I was telling kit that the people in Medford are going through whether they rent,

3250
04:46:03,871 --> 04:46:05,492
[SPEAKER_05]: or they own, it just doesn't matter.

3251
04:46:05,832 --> 04:46:07,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a housing crisis.

3252
04:46:07,613 --> 04:46:09,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We all see it, we all understand it.

3253
04:46:10,134 --> 04:46:13,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a 34 year old son who's a school teacher.

3254
04:46:14,897 --> 04:46:17,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I pray someday that child can own a home.

3255
04:46:17,318 --> 04:46:19,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I want him to be able to own a home.

3256
04:46:19,619 --> 04:46:24,802
[SPEAKER_05]: My oldest brother who passed away in 2015 spent most of his adult life homeless.

3257
04:46:25,522 --> 04:46:27,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anybody should have to worry about that.

3258
04:46:28,624 --> 04:46:32,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that the way that this is happening this year,

3259
04:46:33,226 --> 04:46:34,607
[SPEAKER_05]: process matters.

3260
04:46:35,007 --> 04:46:36,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It really matters.

3261
04:46:36,728 --> 04:46:39,850
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no announcement about any of these things.

3262
04:46:39,970 --> 04:46:54,398
[SPEAKER_05]: If people weren't watching the stuff being uploaded to the city council, you know, like when you guys upload stuff, if it could automatically be emailed to anybody that gets a notice from the city, that would be better communication.

3263
04:46:54,999 --> 04:46:57,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that's going to affect

3264
04:46:57,640 --> 04:47:09,914
[SPEAKER_05]: The property owner, I would love to see the whole city mailed I get it it's expensive, but at least if you can mail the 60 and over crowd, there was a woman that was here a few weeks ago talking about walking court.

3265
04:47:10,396 --> 04:47:11,756
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't have a computer.

3266
04:47:12,056 --> 04:47:14,097
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't have the internet.

3267
04:47:14,197 --> 04:47:15,677
[SPEAKER_05]: My office is in the square.

3268
04:47:16,057 --> 04:47:24,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Many a time, the elderly people from the buildings, they'll come walking in and whatever, and they have no idea what's going on in Medford.

3269
04:47:25,159 --> 04:47:28,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really sad, because I don't think that that's your intent.

3270
04:47:29,220 --> 04:47:38,942
[SPEAKER_05]: When we talk about a transfer tax, I will tell you, I have never seen anybody add a cost to housing that made housing more affordable.

3271
04:47:40,604 --> 04:47:40,906
[SPEAKER_05]: work.

3272
04:47:41,229 --> 04:47:43,406
[SPEAKER_05]: There are plenty of studies that are out there.

3273
04:47:43,948 --> 04:47:47,689
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay that 18 other communities have already signed on to it.

3274
04:47:48,149 --> 04:47:52,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean that it's right, because it doesn't matter what everybody here said.

3275
04:47:53,090 --> 04:47:54,330
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't get a vote.

3276
04:47:54,750 --> 04:47:58,010
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that were here only knew because of social media.

3277
04:47:58,410 --> 04:48:06,192
[SPEAKER_05]: If you mail this out to everyone in the city, and I mean everyone, all 58,000 people, what would they have to say about it?

3278
04:48:06,692 --> 04:48:08,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that the only answer?

3279
04:48:08,752 --> 04:48:09,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

3280
04:48:09,452 --> 04:48:10,813
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a million answers.

3281
04:48:11,133 --> 04:48:13,233
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, former Councilor Marks,

3282
04:48:13,553 --> 04:48:18,454
[SPEAKER_05]: hit on a big one that we all talked about a few years ago with all these vacant lots.

3283
04:48:18,654 --> 04:48:23,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Alicia Hunt's office two, three weeks ago, talking about a couple of vacant lots.

3284
04:48:23,816 --> 04:48:25,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I get a guy that'll sell this lot cheap.

3285
04:48:25,816 --> 04:48:27,577
[SPEAKER_05]: You match up with the city and Medford stuff.

3286
04:48:27,697 --> 04:48:30,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's gear it to it's an affordable housing developer.

3287
04:48:30,538 --> 04:48:32,158
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two more units there.

3288
04:48:32,558 --> 04:48:38,600
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you guys were talking about a couple of the other housing things, and I think rent control was what was being talked about that night.

3289
04:48:39,140 --> 04:48:43,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Even Alicia said, I don't think that is going to lower the cost of housing.

3290
04:48:44,065 --> 04:48:45,927
[SPEAKER_47]: It was the housing stability notification.

3291
04:48:46,528 --> 04:48:46,948
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

3292
04:48:46,988 --> 04:48:48,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that, I'm sorry.

3293
04:48:49,171 --> 04:49:00,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Zach, unfortunately, I've been in here an awful lot lately, but it's not going to lower the cost of housing as you're sitting here talking about adding a transfer fee.

3294
04:49:01,633 --> 04:49:06,836
[SPEAKER_05]: There are realtors that are in Washington DC for the last two years petitioning Congress.

3295
04:49:07,357 --> 04:49:20,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you give us a moratorium on capital gains for either three months or six months, because this is a 31 year realtor in this community and there's a quite a few other ones that can come up here and talk about their own lived experience.

3296
04:49:21,546 --> 04:49:28,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Our entire first-time homebuyer market in 2017 and 2018, it got bought up by investors.

3297
04:49:28,553 --> 04:49:32,436
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about those single-family homes, a lot of them in North Medford.

3298
04:49:32,496 --> 04:49:35,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia talked to you about how she was excited to buy her starter home.

3299
04:49:36,319 --> 04:49:38,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Those starter homes are now the forever homes.

3300
04:49:38,561 --> 04:49:44,166
[SPEAKER_05]: However, we do have a lot of those that are owned by investors, adding a transfer tax.

3301
04:49:44,967 --> 04:49:48,349
[SPEAKER_05]: is not going to help them let go of those properties.

3302
04:49:48,469 --> 04:49:50,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another reason for them not to.

3303
04:49:50,651 --> 04:49:56,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like people aren't letting go of their real estate because they don't want to let go of their 2% rate or their 3% rate.

3304
04:49:57,295 --> 04:49:59,417
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people that are in Washington, D.C.

3305
04:49:59,477 --> 04:50:02,319
[SPEAKER_05]: now that are trying to do something with the mortgages.

3306
04:50:02,639 --> 04:50:06,001
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too many clogs in the funnel of housing.

3307
04:50:06,341 --> 04:50:07,782
[SPEAKER_05]: There's clogs with the rentals.

3308
04:50:07,842 --> 04:50:09,203
[SPEAKER_05]: There's clogs with the purchases.

3309
04:50:09,263 --> 04:50:14,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody here said, you know, all the people buying homes in Medford now are millionaires.

3310
04:50:15,267 --> 04:50:16,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I guarantee you they're not.

3311
04:50:17,048 --> 04:50:25,332
[SPEAKER_05]: We are seeing two and three generations of a family go buy a house together, because that's the only way that they can afford to do it.

3312
04:50:25,773 --> 04:50:30,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if that tax is $500 in the buyer and $500 in the seller.

3313
04:50:30,815 --> 04:50:31,956
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another fee.

3314
04:50:32,176 --> 04:50:34,077
[SPEAKER_05]: All of you have moved at some point.

3315
04:50:34,117 --> 04:50:34,477
[SPEAKER_05]: You've moved.

3316
04:50:34,537 --> 04:50:35,658
[SPEAKER_05]: You moved to college, right?

3317
04:50:36,118 --> 04:50:37,099
[SPEAKER_05]: You've moved.

3318
04:50:37,119 --> 04:50:37,799
[SPEAKER_05]: You've all moved.

3319
04:50:37,819 --> 04:50:38,639
[SPEAKER_47]: Kelly, that's time.

3320
04:50:38,699 --> 04:50:39,780
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll give you 20 seconds to wrap.

3321
04:50:40,165 --> 04:50:41,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I have one minute?

3322
04:50:41,066 --> 04:50:42,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you- Come on.

3323
04:50:42,407 --> 04:50:43,127
[SPEAKER_05]: 45, 45 seconds.

3324
04:50:43,708 --> 04:50:44,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a minute.

3325
04:50:45,069 --> 04:50:47,571
[SPEAKER_05]: 45 seconds, but you've been- Here's what I'm gonna ask you.

3326
04:50:47,591 --> 04:51:00,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to ask you to just think, if you table this paper and you table these other things, because I got to tell you, the fact that you bring it up in the spring housing market is causing a lot of issues.

3327
04:51:01,283 --> 04:51:05,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a landlord that has a little old lady for a tenant who only pays $1,200 a month for rent.

3328
04:51:06,787 --> 04:51:13,931
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I don't want to raise her rent, but if I don't, they're going to cap that rent, and then my house is devalued.

3329
04:51:14,271 --> 04:51:18,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because you guys are just discussing it now, this is what the people of Medford are thinking.

3330
04:51:19,014 --> 04:51:28,179
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing with the transfer tax, it's another reason for them not to let go with their house, when reality is that single person that's 80 years old, she doesn't need nine rooms anymore.

3331
04:51:28,220 --> 04:51:35,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe your family needs that house, but if we can't get them to let go of that one, we can't take you from paying rent to making you a homeowner.

3332
04:51:36,064 --> 04:51:37,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is plenty of opportunity.

3333
04:51:38,205 --> 04:51:39,666
[SPEAKER_05]: One question, my only question.

3334
04:51:39,686 --> 04:51:39,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

3335
04:51:40,207 --> 04:51:51,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to ask you to consider, to deeply consider, to take the paper off the table, to have a housing symposium where everyone can come in.

3336
04:51:51,053 --> 04:51:57,838
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a lot of educated people in the community of Medford and they can sit here and we can discuss housing.

3337
04:51:58,218 --> 04:52:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: What are all the opportunities

3338
04:52:00,439 --> 04:52:02,501
[SPEAKER_05]: to relieve the housing opportunity.

3339
04:52:02,581 --> 04:52:05,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait until you open up the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

3340
04:52:05,723 --> 04:52:07,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford is extremely generous.

3341
04:52:07,384 --> 04:52:08,665
[SPEAKER_05]: They can donate to it.

3342
04:52:09,106 --> 04:52:10,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Go after the CPA.

3343
04:52:11,047 --> 04:52:14,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Take 80% of your CPA money for the next two or three years.

3344
04:52:14,970 --> 04:52:16,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

3345
04:52:17,352 --> 04:52:19,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask the taxpayers to raise that to 3%.

3346
04:52:19,733 --> 04:52:21,395
[SPEAKER_05]: That's equitable across the city.

3347
04:52:21,715 --> 04:52:22,876
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm counting that as one question.

3348
04:52:24,178 --> 04:52:25,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

3349
04:52:25,479 --> 04:52:26,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking you.

3350
04:52:26,299 --> 04:52:27,860
[SPEAKER_47]: I appreciate the comment.

3351
04:52:27,900 --> 04:52:36,023
[SPEAKER_47]: And I do want, I do hope that when you hear those kinds of stories, I think you've heard and you know, the process is not that anything just because we're discussing a thing.

3352
04:52:36,043 --> 04:52:38,004
[SPEAKER_47]: And I think this is, this is the flip side of it.

3353
04:52:38,624 --> 04:52:39,605
[SPEAKER_47]: There may be a discussion.

3354
04:52:40,424 --> 04:53:03,452
[SPEAKER_47]: The processes we discuss it we will discuss it for a period of time and committee meetings, things like rent stabilization or the transfer fee have to go to the State House for approval, you are well aware that they're not getting approved so when you hear people say I'm nervous about this would be really helpful if you could reassure them and say, even though these ideas are being discussed now, at best, they are at least a year away if not more, and that they don't impact because I think you know

3355
04:53:04,138 --> 04:53:08,600
[SPEAKER_47]: Part of all of our duty is to try to make sure that people understand the process.

3356
04:53:08,660 --> 04:53:09,981
[SPEAKER_47]: I agree that process matters.

3357
04:53:10,541 --> 04:53:12,162
[SPEAKER_47]: We've been very intentional about process.

3358
04:53:12,642 --> 04:53:16,164
[SPEAKER_47]: We have a lot of stuff and a lot of committees about trying to reach out to more people.

3359
04:53:16,624 --> 04:53:22,807
[SPEAKER_47]: We all try our best with the time and resources that we have to reach out to people through email, phone, social media, et cetera.

3360
04:53:23,367 --> 04:53:30,491
[SPEAKER_47]: And I will say too, you've said, I've been here a lot and you kind of were like, I have had to be here a lot.

3361
04:53:31,598 --> 04:53:38,444
[SPEAKER_47]: You know, part of this is on each and every one of us as citizens of Medford to also be paying attention to what the city government is doing.

3362
04:53:39,424 --> 04:53:41,526
[SPEAKER_47]: We're thinking about ways that we can try to enhance that.

3363
04:53:41,966 --> 04:53:51,955
[SPEAKER_47]: I think if all of us do the same, more people will be involved and, and, but I really hope you'll reassure folks when you hear that that that is not the process and you know that's not the process.

3364
04:53:53,294 --> 04:53:54,654
[SPEAKER_05]: You've made it really clear.

3365
04:53:54,674 --> 04:54:06,398
[SPEAKER_05]: The seven of you are the only people they're going to get to vote on that home rule petition that you're going to send to the state house on behalf of 58,000 people.

3366
04:54:06,438 --> 04:54:07,299
[SPEAKER_47]: That is the process.

3367
04:54:07,439 --> 04:54:07,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

3368
04:54:08,259 --> 04:54:15,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And you believe that you have that right to do that because you were elected regardless of who people vote for.

3369
04:54:15,221 --> 04:54:17,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you sit in that chair, you serve.

3370
04:54:18,463 --> 04:54:39,080
[SPEAKER_05]: 58,000 people in this community like unfortunately in the last four years, we haven't seen citizens brought into these chambers to discuss these things, the way the former mayors used to do that that doesn't happen anymore, but maybe in your capacity, you guys can make these things happen.

3371
04:54:39,500 --> 04:54:47,524
[SPEAKER_05]: There are better ways, not just the best thing that you're being told from way down the street to go sell to the people of Medford.

3372
04:54:47,885 --> 04:54:50,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean it's the best thing for Medford.

3373
04:54:50,406 --> 04:54:52,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at Cambridge, look at Homebridge.

3374
04:54:53,047 --> 04:54:56,249
[SPEAKER_05]: They've had an affordable housing trust fund since 1989.

3375
04:54:57,710 --> 04:54:58,951
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done amazing things.

3376
04:54:59,031 --> 04:55:04,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I've sold properties over there that they've matched the money and made people homeowners, but they've been working on it a long time.

3377
04:55:05,254 --> 04:55:09,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just asking you to take a step back and reassess the situation.

3378
04:55:09,375 --> 04:55:11,675
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you guys just thought I appreciate it.

3379
04:55:11,755 --> 04:55:12,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3380
04:55:16,016 --> 04:55:18,676
[SPEAKER_48]: Mr. McGilvrey, I'm gonna wait just if we could just wait till we're done.

3381
04:55:18,696 --> 04:55:19,316
[SPEAKER_48]: We're almost done.

3382
04:55:19,796 --> 04:55:20,917
[SPEAKER_47]: Let's have comments at the end.

3383
04:55:21,017 --> 04:55:21,377
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3384
04:55:22,937 --> 04:55:24,597
[SPEAKER_27]: Harold McGilvrey for Piedmont Road.

3385
04:55:24,617 --> 04:55:24,837
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks.

3386
04:55:24,877 --> 04:55:25,437
[SPEAKER_27]: You have five minutes.

3387
04:55:25,778 --> 04:55:26,238
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

3388
04:55:27,258 --> 04:55:31,038
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe everybody should vote and I believe everybody should participate in the process.

3389
04:55:31,058 --> 04:55:32,899
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's why I'm here speaking tonight.

3390
04:55:35,345 --> 04:55:36,066
[SPEAKER_27]: I am against this.

3391
04:55:36,886 --> 04:55:47,295
[SPEAKER_27]: It doesn't mean that I'm not charitable or that I'm not sympathetic towards other people's plights and I don't believe anyone in this room tonight is unsympathetic or not charitable.

3392
04:55:47,975 --> 04:55:50,097
[SPEAKER_27]: It was a pretty solid blue collar crowd.

3393
04:55:52,759 --> 04:55:53,320
[SPEAKER_27]: It's American.

3394
04:55:53,580 --> 04:55:56,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Americans don't like to be taxed and they don't like to pay fees.

3395
04:55:56,742 --> 04:55:59,464
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just the American way.

3396
04:56:00,205 --> 04:56:03,308
[SPEAKER_27]: Whether we agree or not or not, that's the American way.

3397
04:56:05,475 --> 04:56:19,560
[SPEAKER_27]: When we had the discussion about the leaf blowers, we were talking about transparency and this body said that they had an overwhelming or a lot of support to ban leaf blowers.

3398
04:56:20,000 --> 04:56:24,081
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, this is a pretty overwhelming statement made here tonight.

3399
04:56:24,962 --> 04:56:31,844
[SPEAKER_27]: And I still believe, even with that overwhelming statement that was made here tonight, I still believe you're just gonna vote the way you wanna vote.

3400
04:56:32,124 --> 04:56:33,605
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's your right, but,

3401
04:56:35,202 --> 04:56:37,744
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanted to make it on the record that I opposed this.

3402
04:56:38,945 --> 04:56:43,609
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think the majority of the people in the city of Method opposed us.

3403
04:56:44,629 --> 04:56:58,000
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's for no other reason than this is, when I totally understand the process and you just said it, it's a process and this is the first step and it's going to happen.

3404
04:56:58,420 --> 04:57:00,942
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why we wanted to stop it here tonight.

3405
04:57:01,362 --> 04:57:03,304
[SPEAKER_27]: Because if it doesn't get stopped here,

3406
04:57:04,295 --> 04:57:16,763
[SPEAKER_27]: Just like everything else, it's gonna roll downhill and it's gonna pick up speed and you're not going to listen to the people that come to this podium and tell you that they're against it.

3407
04:57:17,424 --> 04:57:22,487
[SPEAKER_27]: So, like Ronald Reagan said, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.

3408
04:57:22,967 --> 04:57:24,328
[SPEAKER_27]: That's not what the people wanna hear.

3409
04:57:24,909 --> 04:57:25,309
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3410
04:57:26,670 --> 04:57:28,371
[SPEAKER_47]: He certainly did a lot of damage.

3411
04:57:29,672 --> 04:57:31,093
[SPEAKER_54]: Name and address for the record, please.

3412
04:57:32,145 --> 04:57:35,966
[SPEAKER_49]: Hi guys, I'm Anne Haggerty, Levin Sagamore Park, Medford.

3413
04:57:35,986 --> 04:57:47,769
[SPEAKER_49]: Right in the evening, I've learned a lot and I want to thank you guys for doing this because it is, we do have a challenge with affordable housing in the country.

3414
04:57:48,290 --> 04:57:49,910
[SPEAKER_49]: This is not just a Medford issue.

3415
04:57:50,910 --> 04:57:56,232
[SPEAKER_49]: And I appreciate the blog posts that Kit and Matt have.

3416
04:57:56,392 --> 04:57:57,692
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm glad someone reads them.

3417
04:58:00,988 --> 04:58:01,928
[SPEAKER_49]: I have some questions.

3418
04:58:05,189 --> 04:58:09,690
[SPEAKER_49]: Of the 18 communities, 11 are on the Cape and the islands.

3419
04:58:11,071 --> 04:58:15,012
[SPEAKER_49]: And really only a couple are neighbors of us.

3420
04:58:15,032 --> 04:58:19,493
[SPEAKER_49]: Does anybody know why so many on the Cape have done this?

3421
04:58:20,080 --> 04:58:28,766
[SPEAKER_47]: they're having a really severe, they're kind of the bleeding edge of this problem, both from a supply issue and especially on the islands.

3422
04:58:29,127 --> 04:58:37,072
[SPEAKER_47]: I mean, you look at Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, the speculation and the rampant, you know, you're talking about an average home value of the two, $3 million range.

3423
04:58:37,473 --> 04:58:39,574
[SPEAKER_47]: They can't afford, teachers can't afford to live on the island.

3424
04:58:39,674 --> 04:58:41,275
[SPEAKER_47]: You know, people are coming in on the ferries.

3425
04:58:42,116 --> 04:58:43,297
[SPEAKER_47]: So they've really seen a lot of it.

3426
04:58:43,757 --> 04:58:46,419
[SPEAKER_47]: I think the Cape and the islands is a leading edge.

3427
04:58:46,459 --> 04:58:48,340
[SPEAKER_47]: And then the urban core has really been next.

3428
04:58:48,400 --> 04:58:49,141
[SPEAKER_47]: And it's mainly,

3429
04:58:49,588 --> 04:59:04,441
[SPEAKER_47]: Because that's where the most the land values and then the property values are going up the fastest so that's you know Boston Somerville, the urban core Cambridge inside inside 95 and then the Cape and the islands are also have a big supply issue.

3430
04:59:05,592 --> 04:59:10,235
[SPEAKER_49]: You know, I know a lot of people and myself, I was scared too, a little bit about hearing 2%.

3431
04:59:12,857 --> 04:59:14,399
[SPEAKER_49]: I think it's worthy of a discussion.

3432
04:59:14,419 --> 04:59:32,912
[SPEAKER_49]: I would like to know how the public will be able to participate in that conversation with you, because I read every single one of the 18 proposals at the state house bill, and I was talking to Councilor Callahan about this earlier, and it varies considerably.

3433
04:59:34,281 --> 04:59:55,575
[SPEAKER_49]: the threshold varies, whether the threshold is re-evaluated in the subsequent years, who pays, is it split, is it just the buyer, is it the seller, what the percentage is, even where the funds are allocated.

3434
04:59:56,291 --> 05:00:01,093
[SPEAKER_49]: Like there's a couple of towns that, several towns, all of it goes into the Affordable Housing Trust.

3435
05:00:01,813 --> 05:00:12,818
[SPEAKER_49]: But others, a proportion of it goes into the Affordable Trust, and then other funds raised through this fee go into sustainability funds or general funds.

3436
05:00:14,099 --> 05:00:17,901
[SPEAKER_49]: I think we, I would appreciate, I don't want to speak for everybody,

3437
05:00:19,457 --> 05:00:26,583
[SPEAKER_49]: Another thing that I think we've heard a lot of anecdotes, people's kids, people's parents, people experiencing stuff.

3438
05:00:27,324 --> 05:00:29,686
[SPEAKER_49]: I think stats would be helpful.

3439
05:00:29,746 --> 05:00:33,829
[SPEAKER_49]: Exactly, there was that one gentleman who had some great stats.

3440
05:00:33,889 --> 05:00:36,452
[SPEAKER_49]: Knowing exactly how many people are buying in.

3441
05:00:36,492 --> 05:00:41,216
[SPEAKER_49]: I have a lot of new neighbors who have bought into my area of town.

3442
05:00:42,312 --> 05:00:47,814
[SPEAKER_49]: pushing strollers, they're affording, some people are affording buying.

3443
05:00:48,794 --> 05:00:51,255
[SPEAKER_49]: So some of that research would be helpful to know.

3444
05:00:51,275 --> 05:00:57,697
[SPEAKER_49]: I think the dialogue with the community and you guys would enhance everybody's lives.

3445
05:00:58,419 --> 05:01:05,224
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, so so one of the things that we've put forward this term is we've moved to a standing committee structure where we have committees meeting.

3446
05:01:06,165 --> 05:01:12,250
[SPEAKER_47]: The first set well first and third or first and third and second and fourth weeks of the of the month.

3447
05:01:12,870 --> 05:01:17,233
[SPEAKER_47]: So this is going to planning and permitting committee, which I believe meets every second and fourth Wednesday at 6pm.

3448
05:01:19,194 --> 05:01:22,795
[SPEAKER_47]: If people want to look out for the agendas for that they're generally posted the Friday before that.

3449
05:01:23,556 --> 05:01:29,177
[SPEAKER_47]: This probably won't be up on the next one tomorrow night we have one it's on major zoning reform that we're doing.

3450
05:01:29,778 --> 05:01:35,139
[SPEAKER_47]: We really are trying to be super transparent this was on a governing agenda document that we put out at the beginning of the term.

3451
05:01:35,879 --> 05:01:39,721
[SPEAKER_47]: We're using the tools that we have available to us the legislative branch of the city has a $350,000 budget.

3452
05:01:41,598 --> 05:01:42,840
[SPEAKER_47]: The rest of it's on the mayor side.

3453
05:01:44,202 --> 05:01:49,991
[SPEAKER_47]: And, you know, we don't control the communications apparatus of the callback machine and or the

3454
05:01:50,475 --> 05:01:55,457
[SPEAKER_47]: deciding who gets mail, what we can ask for things to go out in tax bills, water bills, et cetera.

3455
05:01:56,017 --> 05:01:57,698
[SPEAKER_47]: But again, I think, you know, that's one way.

3456
05:01:57,778 --> 05:02:08,441
[SPEAKER_47]: So this will be, if passed tonight to the planning and permitting committee, that's where the discussion will start around those questions on threshold percentage, who is this applying to?

3457
05:02:08,481 --> 05:02:09,422
[SPEAKER_47]: What are the exemptions?

3458
05:02:09,442 --> 05:02:16,944
[SPEAKER_47]: And that was really the intent of this proposal was to say, before any even plan, you know, the proponents gonna come out and said, we want one and a half percent.

3459
05:02:16,984 --> 05:02:19,005
[SPEAKER_47]: We want it buyer and seller split even,

3460
05:02:19,545 --> 05:02:22,006
[SPEAKER_47]: We want to exempt these three things, but not these 10 things.

3461
05:02:22,126 --> 05:02:23,707
[SPEAKER_47]: And that's the plan and that's stuck in stone.

3462
05:02:25,168 --> 05:02:34,193
[SPEAKER_47]: I actually think that what they did by saying, we just want to discuss the idea and we're going to have those conversations in public committee meetings where anyone can participate.

3463
05:02:34,773 --> 05:02:39,015
[SPEAKER_47]: They didn't set something in stone and set the terms of debate right up front.

3464
05:02:39,055 --> 05:02:40,536
[SPEAKER_47]: They actually said, let's have the discussion.

3465
05:02:40,596 --> 05:02:41,817
[SPEAKER_47]: So those will be in those meetings.

3466
05:02:42,237 --> 05:02:44,818
[SPEAKER_47]: Council Vice President Collins is the chair of that committee as well.

3467
05:02:45,499 --> 05:02:47,079
[SPEAKER_47]: Those are public meetings just like this one.

3468
05:02:48,447 --> 05:03:00,112
[SPEAKER_47]: And again, they happen every second and fourth Wednesday at 6pm we're considering in that committee maybe 15 other proposals on a number of things that people like we're considering a tax break for landlords who keep their rents affordable.

3469
05:03:00,572 --> 05:03:03,853
[SPEAKER_47]: We're considering significant zoning reforms to allow more supply to be built.

3470
05:03:04,278 --> 05:03:11,742
[SPEAKER_47]: We're considering like, again, this holistic toolbox of issues to address the housing situation, which is what we've heard from a lot of people tonight.

3471
05:03:12,103 --> 05:03:13,483
[SPEAKER_47]: This is one potential tool.

3472
05:03:14,684 --> 05:03:22,529
[SPEAKER_47]: And again, I think, you know, there's been a disservice in the information that's been put out there and quite frankly, the fear that has been whipped up.

3473
05:03:22,549 --> 05:03:32,715
[SPEAKER_49]: Well, part of it is in some of the language from a couple of the blogs where it was a 2% was listed or from Keely's press release.

3474
05:03:33,095 --> 05:03:35,237
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, with 2% listed.

3475
05:03:35,297 --> 05:03:39,260
[SPEAKER_49]: And so I think, you know, lack of knowledge, it's a new thing.

3476
05:03:39,280 --> 05:03:50,368
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, you know, and honestly, if you have a million dollar home, that doesn't mean you're, like, really wealthy.

3477
05:03:51,109 --> 05:03:51,389
[SPEAKER_49]: Right.

3478
05:03:52,650 --> 05:03:57,334
[SPEAKER_49]: So just as long as the dialogue is open, and you guys are going to consider

3479
05:03:58,143 --> 05:04:01,424
[SPEAKER_49]: input from folks, how it will affect people.

3480
05:04:01,525 --> 05:04:05,266
[SPEAKER_49]: I think that a discussion is probably warranted.

3481
05:04:05,766 --> 05:04:05,966
[SPEAKER_47]: Great.

3482
05:04:06,167 --> 05:04:17,692
[SPEAKER_47]: And I will also add, if you are kind of hungry for numbers, if you go to massbudget.org, they have a tool that estimates for each city and town, what the impact of different thresholds are.

3483
05:04:17,832 --> 05:04:22,634
[SPEAKER_47]: Actually, I think it's just what different rates would be based on the Healey proposal.

3484
05:04:22,674 --> 05:04:25,295
[SPEAKER_47]: So you can go massbudget.org, you can go to Medford,

3485
05:04:25,834 --> 05:04:29,415
[SPEAKER_47]: You can see what point five would look like what one would look like what two would look like.

3486
05:04:30,975 --> 05:04:45,119
[SPEAKER_47]: It's not complete because it doesn't have all the exemptions and everything that might be incredibly highly tailored to any community but that is out there, and they put one out also for 2022 as well that I think might still be available at real estate transfer fee.org.

3487
05:04:45,179 --> 05:04:50,460
[SPEAKER_40]: Point of information that counts as a Councilor Scarborough brought up some good points and I appreciate that I think that

3488
05:04:51,311 --> 05:04:56,415
[SPEAKER_40]: I think this council also has to understand this dialogue being said that someone threw out bad information.

3489
05:04:57,396 --> 05:05:13,849
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm gonna be honest with you, the feedback that I got back from people was the fact that we had a meeting with one of our subcommittees that's also been put forth to me that's very confusing to people to what they were used to.

3490
05:05:14,450 --> 05:05:16,671
[SPEAKER_40]: Because the document that you have in place

3491
05:05:17,711 --> 05:05:21,973
[SPEAKER_40]: is very, it could be very cumbersome for just the average person.

3492
05:05:22,553 --> 05:05:26,155
[SPEAKER_40]: Not everybody is involved in government and understands this process.

3493
05:05:26,755 --> 05:05:36,140
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think I mentioned that to have something where it really highlights what the old subcommittees were and how we're tying them in, we didn't do that.

3494
05:05:36,840 --> 05:05:38,441
[SPEAKER_47]: And I think that- It is on the city website, George.

3495
05:05:38,721 --> 05:05:41,763
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, but not from what I was told, but I'll go over that with you.

3496
05:05:41,803 --> 05:05:44,284
[SPEAKER_40]: But the other concerning is that

3497
05:05:45,307 --> 05:05:47,969
[SPEAKER_40]: What started this off was the whole rent control issue.

3498
05:05:49,571 --> 05:05:53,995
[SPEAKER_40]: The meeting was called for home rule petition.

3499
05:05:54,615 --> 05:05:55,516
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what it was called for.

3500
05:05:56,237 --> 05:06:01,261
[SPEAKER_40]: Two hours before the meeting, information went out about a litany of rent control issues.

3501
05:06:02,062 --> 05:06:06,746
[SPEAKER_40]: So this is compounded with that the comment was put out there for 2%.

3502
05:06:08,257 --> 05:06:11,420
[SPEAKER_40]: So there was a dialogue out there said 2%.

3503
05:06:12,001 --> 05:06:21,931
[SPEAKER_40]: So what happened was you had people that are invested that wanted to get the word out because they don't feel like they're being heard.

3504
05:06:22,652 --> 05:06:30,921
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think we have to be realistic that we do a terrible job in really informing our community, terrible job.

3505
05:06:31,966 --> 05:06:41,632
[SPEAKER_40]: Even the conversation that we had in subcommittee talking about having a newsletter with our Councilors writing it and saying we could start it, but where does it go to?

3506
05:06:42,392 --> 05:06:45,394
[SPEAKER_40]: It goes to the same has, but the have-nots don't get it.

3507
05:06:46,755 --> 05:06:48,256
[SPEAKER_40]: But I said, it's the same thing.

3508
05:06:48,296 --> 05:06:51,118
[SPEAKER_40]: We have to find a mechanism that hits everybody.

3509
05:06:51,158 --> 05:06:53,279
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't have a newspaper, so we don't have that.

3510
05:06:53,979 --> 05:07:01,144
[SPEAKER_40]: But that's why these issues get brought into this atmosphere and why so many people are so contentious because

3511
05:07:02,421 --> 05:07:05,423
[SPEAKER_40]: they're hearing it as something attacking.

3512
05:07:06,043 --> 05:07:10,987
[SPEAKER_49]: There are some folks who are trying to get a community supported news outlet.

3513
05:07:11,047 --> 05:07:11,227
[SPEAKER_40]: Right.

3514
05:07:11,507 --> 05:07:21,674
[SPEAKER_40]: And I know I know that just so just like you said, I know that there is a group that they're having a kickoff event on May 2, and it's for all method

3515
05:07:22,222 --> 05:07:33,347
[SPEAKER_40]: is a group of residents organizing to keep Medford informed about important issues that affect your housing as well as the issues that affect your quality of life here in Medford.

3516
05:07:33,667 --> 05:07:37,109
[SPEAKER_40]: And I applaud that grassroots organization because I think that's what it is.

3517
05:07:37,149 --> 05:07:39,790
[SPEAKER_40]: It's welcome to everybody from what I've told, and just come on in.

3518
05:07:39,850 --> 05:07:46,153
[SPEAKER_40]: And even if you get your name on an email, maybe that's how we start that conversation that we talked about at subcommittee.

3519
05:07:46,653 --> 05:07:48,954
[SPEAKER_49]: So it is hard to find information.

3520
05:07:48,974 --> 05:07:55,137
[SPEAKER_49]: I mean, I've fallen into the Reddit group, which is where I found some of the blogs, postings, and they're very informative.

3521
05:07:55,698 --> 05:08:01,581
[SPEAKER_49]: But there is, it's also good to talk to people in like the renters.

3522
05:08:02,341 --> 05:08:04,842
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, there's a challenge for folks.

3523
05:08:04,902 --> 05:08:10,985
[SPEAKER_49]: They are the homeowners to people like there's all the challenges of facing all these different groups.

3524
05:08:11,406 --> 05:08:13,847
[SPEAKER_49]: And we have to consider those everybody.

3525
05:08:16,738 --> 05:08:17,198
[SPEAKER_47]: Thanks, Sam.

3526
05:08:17,979 --> 05:08:18,359
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3527
05:08:19,039 --> 05:08:22,121
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comments by members of the public on this item?

3528
05:08:24,943 --> 05:08:26,243
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

3529
05:08:26,323 --> 05:08:29,285
[SPEAKER_19]: John Lodato, 9 Wareham Street, Medford, Mass.

3530
05:08:30,225 --> 05:08:33,087
[SPEAKER_19]: Guys, I am one of the people you want in this town.

3531
05:08:33,227 --> 05:08:37,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Somebody who works as butt-off, dirty hands, clean money kind of a guy.

3532
05:08:37,569 --> 05:08:38,410
[SPEAKER_19]: My...

3533
05:08:41,710 --> 05:08:48,272
[SPEAKER_19]: goal in life is to put all my money into my houses so that when I die, I have something to leave my kids.

3534
05:08:48,992 --> 05:08:52,253
[SPEAKER_19]: I have no intention on selling so this doesn't really affect me.

3535
05:08:52,733 --> 05:09:00,155
[SPEAKER_19]: But the lack of communication coming from you guys telling us the only way we heard about it was all rumors minutes before meetings happen.

3536
05:09:00,635 --> 05:09:05,417
[SPEAKER_19]: So we weren't fully informed in in

3537
05:09:07,156 --> 05:09:14,860
[SPEAKER_19]: aware of what's going on, most of us don't care about the thousand dollars that you want from us when we saw the house we could, most of us could afford it.

3538
05:09:15,440 --> 05:09:25,805
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just the way you guys, we feel like you guys sneaking it in on us you want to add, you know, multiple issues all in the same package at least that's how it was interpreted to me.

3539
05:09:27,105 --> 05:09:32,988
[SPEAKER_19]: The, the rent control and a couple other things that we're going to get added on to this.

3540
05:09:36,014 --> 05:09:39,418
[SPEAKER_19]: My thing is, once it leaves here, there's no stopping it.

3541
05:09:39,638 --> 05:09:40,599
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be a snowball.

3542
05:09:40,639 --> 05:09:41,720
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to go to the state house.

3543
05:09:42,160 --> 05:09:43,882
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like putting drugs in front of a drug addict.

3544
05:09:43,962 --> 05:09:44,162
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

3545
05:09:44,282 --> 05:09:45,503
[SPEAKER_19]: More money from the taxpayer?

3546
05:09:45,523 --> 05:09:45,864
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great.

3547
05:09:45,904 --> 05:09:46,324
[SPEAKER_19]: Give it to us.

3548
05:09:46,825 --> 05:09:48,246
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it's going to come back to you guys.

3549
05:09:48,626 --> 05:09:50,608
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys are going to approve it.

3550
05:09:50,728 --> 05:09:55,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Who knows if we're going to stop at the 1% from the buyer, 1% from the seller.

3551
05:09:55,833 --> 05:09:57,815
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys are just entertaining this.

3552
05:09:57,875 --> 05:10:00,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, maybe if you guys send it to the state,

3553
05:10:01,078 --> 05:10:04,161
[SPEAKER_19]: with some firm things, maybe you would have more support from us.

3554
05:10:04,421 --> 05:10:07,664
[SPEAKER_19]: Because like I said, it's not $1,000 that we're worried about.

3555
05:10:07,684 --> 05:10:11,827
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, you know, once it gets approval, is it now gonna be 3% from each party?

3556
05:10:12,548 --> 05:10:14,770
[SPEAKER_47]: That's what the future meetings are gonna be to discuss it.

3557
05:10:15,050 --> 05:10:19,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, but once it gets rolling, once we get the approval, there's no stopping it.

3558
05:10:20,114 --> 05:10:21,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Please.

3559
05:10:22,156 --> 05:10:22,496
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

3560
05:10:22,516 --> 05:10:24,999
[SPEAKER_47]: If we could just withhold from this point.

3561
05:10:25,059 --> 05:10:27,341
[SPEAKER_47]: I'd just like to finish public comment.

3562
05:10:27,401 --> 05:10:27,701
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3563
05:10:30,269 --> 05:10:35,512
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to hear, I want to I want to be, like I said, if it's 1%, I'm good with it.

3564
05:10:35,892 --> 05:10:40,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure a lot of people out there are going to be pissed at me for saying that but if it's the 1%, I'm good with it.

3565
05:10:40,916 --> 05:10:47,240
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just we really don't trust you guys with our money, not just you, the mayor's office we don't trust you guys with our money.

3566
05:10:47,541 --> 05:10:49,182
[SPEAKER_19]: You see what's happening with the fire department.

3567
05:10:49,522 --> 05:10:54,305
[SPEAKER_19]: It just, you know, the teachers, the school committees, two and a half million dollars.

3568
05:10:55,186 --> 05:10:58,589
[SPEAKER_19]: over budget, I mean, we just don't trust you with any more money.

3569
05:10:59,149 --> 05:11:03,133
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the bottom line, presented to us with some firm facts.

3570
05:11:03,853 --> 05:11:11,780
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, and then if we, you know, if you get some support from us, send it to the state house and once those pigs get it, then you can come back and take all our money from us.

3571
05:11:12,260 --> 05:11:15,283
[SPEAKER_19]: But you know, you know, once it leaves here tonight,

3572
05:11:16,758 --> 05:11:18,959
[SPEAKER_19]: And you let somebody else- It's staying with the council.

3573
05:11:18,979 --> 05:11:21,180
[SPEAKER_47]: It's just going to the council committee on planning and permitting.

3574
05:11:21,200 --> 05:11:21,940
[SPEAKER_47]: So it's staying with us.

3575
05:11:22,040 --> 05:11:25,522
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but once it leaves here tonight, man, it's as good as gold.

3576
05:11:25,862 --> 05:11:29,264
[SPEAKER_19]: It might take four or five years, six years, but eventually it is.

3577
05:11:29,544 --> 05:11:35,387
[SPEAKER_19]: And believe me, listen, because of section eight, I had a lot of help with my family.

3578
05:11:35,707 --> 05:11:37,848
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have nothing against helping somebody.

3579
05:11:38,008 --> 05:11:39,008
[SPEAKER_19]: Believe me, I don't.

3580
05:11:39,408 --> 05:11:41,649
[SPEAKER_19]: My career is helping people, okay?

3581
05:11:43,772 --> 05:11:47,053
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't trust you guys with the money.

3582
05:11:47,073 --> 05:11:48,434
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay, thank you.

3583
05:11:49,674 --> 05:11:52,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you guys aren't forward with us with what's going on.

3584
05:11:53,356 --> 05:11:53,656
[SPEAKER_47]: Thanks.

3585
05:11:54,676 --> 05:11:55,777
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record.

3586
05:11:58,958 --> 05:12:00,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Beverly O'Reilly 16 Joyce Road.

3587
05:12:03,320 --> 05:12:11,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for staying here so late so late tonight and Councilor Scarpelli, thank you very much for your support of the residents and the homeowners

3588
05:12:12,887 --> 05:12:27,548
[SPEAKER_18]: A few things I'm going to just backtrack a couple months a few months ago you guys talked about private roads and how you're going to be taking services away and I don't know who the city person was that spoken that he was very gleeful and

3589
05:12:28,368 --> 05:12:33,910
[SPEAKER_18]: about his approach that legally, you don't have to provide services to private roads.

3590
05:12:33,990 --> 05:12:36,291
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's about 40% of us on private roads.

3591
05:12:36,331 --> 05:12:37,571
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a point to all of this.

3592
05:12:37,591 --> 05:12:38,311
[SPEAKER_18]: So bear with me.

3593
05:12:39,371 --> 05:12:44,093
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition to taking services away on our private roads, which that could be the tip of the iceberg.

3594
05:12:44,133 --> 05:12:46,834
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't think there's been a lot of communication to neighbors about that.

3595
05:12:46,854 --> 05:12:50,435
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't even think that there was an agreement on how the communication was gonna go to neighbors.

3596
05:12:51,415 --> 05:12:56,817
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys wanna get in everybody's houses and reevaluate the assessment so you can raise property taxes.

3597
05:12:57,421 --> 05:12:59,582
[SPEAKER_18]: and now you're talking about this transfer fee.

3598
05:13:00,022 --> 05:13:05,544
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's just one thing after another that you guys are coming after the residential homeowners on.

3599
05:13:06,084 --> 05:13:09,565
[SPEAKER_18]: And in the meantime, we have some serious infrastructure issues in our city.

3600
05:13:09,625 --> 05:13:11,946
[SPEAKER_18]: We are seriously lacking a fire department.

3601
05:13:12,406 --> 05:13:15,187
[SPEAKER_18]: The high school is in a state of disrepair.

3602
05:13:15,707 --> 05:13:16,807
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't have supplies.

3603
05:13:16,867 --> 05:13:18,628
[SPEAKER_18]: The teachers and the parents are paying for things.

3604
05:13:19,068 --> 05:13:23,269
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're talking about collecting yet more fees to provide affordable housing.

3605
05:13:23,649 --> 05:13:26,390
[SPEAKER_18]: I get it, I support that, but I am asking that you guys

3606
05:13:27,489 --> 05:13:34,731
[SPEAKER_18]: consider fixing the infrastructure issues in the city before you start taking fees for some other kind of initiative.

3607
05:13:34,931 --> 05:13:36,552
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wanna thank Ms.

3608
05:13:36,592 --> 05:13:37,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Catalo for her comments.

3609
05:13:37,972 --> 05:13:40,653
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanna thank all of the residents for coming out today.

3610
05:13:41,133 --> 05:13:50,556
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we really need to band together, the homeowner residents, and think about what it is that the priorities of this city are, and think about that when we vote next time as well.

3611
05:13:50,996 --> 05:13:51,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks very much.

3612
05:13:51,737 --> 05:13:52,637
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you for your time.

3613
05:13:53,717 --> 05:13:55,398
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comment by members of the public?

3614
05:13:56,249 --> 05:14:02,572
[SPEAKER_47]: I can't counsel this, I'm going to go to Councilor let me then Councilor Scarpelli Councilor let me, I just have the reading.

3615
05:14:03,152 --> 05:14:04,072
[SPEAKER_47]: I have to as well.

3616
05:14:04,393 --> 05:14:04,633
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

3617
05:14:05,413 --> 05:14:08,334
[SPEAKER_40]: I just love saying no to me by the way that's a no time.

3618
05:14:08,574 --> 05:14:09,755
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm counting, I get a radio.

3619
05:14:10,095 --> 05:14:10,335
[SPEAKER_40]: Go ahead.

3620
05:14:10,975 --> 05:14:11,976
[SPEAKER_47]: Say no to me a lot too.

3621
05:14:14,037 --> 05:14:15,578
[SPEAKER_47]: If we have actually more public comment.

3622
05:14:16,278 --> 05:14:18,979
[SPEAKER_47]: If you'd like to speak or name and address for the record, please.

3623
05:14:21,060 --> 05:14:23,181
[SPEAKER_47]: If you could just pull the microphone down a little bit sorry.

3624
05:14:24,329 --> 05:14:28,050
[SPEAKER_34]: Valerie Guzzleman, High Street, Medford, longtime citizen.

3625
05:14:31,631 --> 05:14:33,231
[SPEAKER_34]: Just a very short comment.

3626
05:14:33,891 --> 05:14:47,554
[SPEAKER_34]: My health insurance wants to charge me a health penalty on my insurance because I didn't sign up for pharmaceutical RX coverage.

3627
05:14:48,415 --> 05:14:51,795
[SPEAKER_34]: And they're charging me an indefinite penalty.

3628
05:14:51,855 --> 05:14:52,916
[SPEAKER_34]: It's already up to about $800.

3629
05:14:54,787 --> 05:15:01,310
[SPEAKER_34]: And now it feels like maybe my old hometown wants to charge me a real estate transfer fee.

3630
05:15:01,930 --> 05:15:05,972
[SPEAKER_34]: So it's getting very complicated and difficult to become a senior citizen.

3631
05:15:06,912 --> 05:15:07,272
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

3632
05:15:07,512 --> 05:15:07,972
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3633
05:15:09,833 --> 05:15:12,394
[SPEAKER_47]: Do you wanna do the read into the record now?

3634
05:15:12,654 --> 05:15:13,855
[SPEAKER_47]: I have two, you have a couple.

3635
05:15:14,195 --> 05:15:14,435
[SPEAKER_47]: Could I?

3636
05:15:14,915 --> 05:15:18,016
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, I just, if we were gonna comment, I wanna- Yeah, no, I'm not gonna comment, just gonna read.

3637
05:15:18,036 --> 05:15:18,777
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, yeah, all right.

3638
05:15:19,217 --> 05:15:22,618
[SPEAKER_47]: He'll read a couple on the record, I have a couple, and then we'll go to council.

3639
05:15:22,758 --> 05:15:23,439
[SPEAKER_40]: So this is from,

3640
05:15:24,841 --> 05:15:33,535
[SPEAKER_40]: This is from residences dear method city council, I'm unable to make tonight's meeting live or on zoom due to conflict, I want to express my thoughts.

3641
05:15:34,119 --> 05:15:35,960
[SPEAKER_40]: on tonight's real estate tax proposal.

3642
05:15:36,460 --> 05:15:40,422
[SPEAKER_40]: I understand the issue of affordable housing and the need to address this issue.

3643
05:15:40,522 --> 05:15:44,944
[SPEAKER_40]: Maybe tonight's meeting will raise more awareness to our affordable housing needs in Medford.

3644
05:15:45,525 --> 05:15:47,986
[SPEAKER_40]: I for one will certainly pay more attention to this issue.

3645
05:15:48,586 --> 05:15:50,347
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm a lifetime resident of Medford.

3646
05:15:50,767 --> 05:15:56,130
[SPEAKER_40]: I raised my family here and went to Medford public schools and have contributed to the community in many ways.

3647
05:15:56,370 --> 05:15:58,591
[SPEAKER_40]: In fact, that's what I'm doing tonight.

3648
05:15:59,369 --> 05:16:07,239
[SPEAKER_40]: I think what's missing in this whole issue is the fact that there are thousands of different scenarios that homeowners have been planning for sales of their homes.

3649
05:16:07,419 --> 05:16:11,223
[SPEAKER_40]: Many people I know are thinking of their home as an asset for retirement.

3650
05:16:11,883 --> 05:16:16,868
[SPEAKER_40]: As we all know the cost of living and the cost of health care in this area are tremendously expensive.

3651
05:16:17,369 --> 05:16:21,793
[SPEAKER_40]: Some have leveraged their homes values to offset the college education of the children.

3652
05:16:22,334 --> 05:16:31,303
[SPEAKER_40]: Others were hit with illness and sent them in a different direction in life and thus the need for this asset is paramount to living a normal life in the city.

3653
05:16:31,943 --> 05:16:33,344
[SPEAKER_40]: I know this from experience.

3654
05:16:33,985 --> 05:16:37,868
[SPEAKER_40]: Most of us are not real estate moguls looking to make a fast buck.

3655
05:16:37,908 --> 05:16:41,851
[SPEAKER_40]: We're citizens who have worked hard our whole lives in this community.

3656
05:16:42,291 --> 05:16:48,175
[SPEAKER_40]: We deserve the right to use the sale of our home to make the right decisions for our families and our future in the city.

3657
05:16:48,616 --> 05:16:57,342
[SPEAKER_40]: So please do not derail the thousands of plans citizens have laid out for themselves by now blindsiding them with another tax.

3658
05:16:57,903 --> 05:17:00,765
[SPEAKER_40]: That's Jim McCarthy, 37 Blakely Road in Medford.

3659
05:17:01,854 --> 05:17:02,174
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

3660
05:17:05,056 --> 05:17:05,417
[SPEAKER_47]: That's it.

3661
05:17:05,437 --> 05:17:06,157
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

3662
05:17:09,920 --> 05:17:14,324
[SPEAKER_47]: Dear members of the Medford City Council, unfortunately I'm away and cannot be present at tonight's city council meeting.

3663
05:17:14,404 --> 05:17:21,009
[SPEAKER_47]: However, I'm submitting this letter in support of item 24-041, a resolution to develop a real estate transfer fee home rule petition.

3664
05:17:21,549 --> 05:17:25,432
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm a homeowner in Medford and I've watched as my home has gained value over the past 30 plus years.

3665
05:17:25,892 --> 05:17:28,354
[SPEAKER_47]: It is now worth about five times more than it was when it purchased in 1991.

3666
05:17:29,611 --> 05:17:48,199
[SPEAKER_47]: skyrocketing real estate costs may have benefited those of us who own homes, but it has been devastating for renters and those seeking to buy a home, a real estate transfer fee could begin to correct this imbalance, a home rule would allow men for to work out the details of an RTF in a way that is best for assuring that Medford has the housing resources it needs to continue to be a welcoming community.

3667
05:17:48,752 --> 05:17:53,175
[SPEAKER_47]: I believe that the RETF should apply to all properties and not be limited to those selling for over $1 million.

3668
05:17:53,776 --> 05:18:07,005
[SPEAKER_47]: As others have pointed out, a 1-2% transfer fee for affordable housing is not going to break the bank for those of us who have pocketed years of property value increases, nor will realtors who take a commission of 5-7% be put out of business by this additional 1-2%.

3669
05:18:07,525 --> 05:18:12,289
[SPEAKER_47]: The fact that our homes are worth more now than when we bought them is not to any effort on our part, but as a windfall.

3670
05:18:12,709 --> 05:18:16,752
[SPEAKER_47]: Sharing a small percentage of our good fortune through the RTETF is a small price to pay,

3671
05:18:17,213 --> 05:18:25,269
[SPEAKER_47]: For increasing affordable housing and making a home rented or purchased a reality for more people sincerely Jennifer Yanko 16 Monument Street Medford ma 02155.

3672
05:18:25,429 --> 05:18:26,030
[SPEAKER_47]: And I have one more.

3673
05:18:30,762 --> 05:18:41,048
[SPEAKER_47]: Dear President Bears I'm sorry that I will not be able to participate in the city council meeting on Tuesday but I would like to express my support for paper to four dash zero for one to submit a home real petition for a real estate transfer fee.

3674
05:18:41,628 --> 05:18:57,196
[SPEAKER_47]: Our ETF, I recognize that the details are to be worked out later but I would like to add that I oppose the exclusions that have been discussed exclusions from sales of properties under 1 million and sales by seniors would leave out about 94% of residential transactions and cut the amount of funds generated for affordable housing to merely 260,000 a year or so.

3675
05:18:59,096 --> 05:19:01,318
[SPEAKER_47]: A drop in the bucket when when we need is a waterfall.

3676
05:19:01,998 --> 05:19:10,425
[SPEAKER_47]: Many low income seniors like myself have owned our own properties for decades and benefited greatly from the speculative bubble that real estate has become my hundred and $6,000 home is now worth over $600,000.

3677
05:19:10,485 --> 05:19:12,927
[SPEAKER_47]: Is it too much to ask that I pay 6000 or 12,000 of my 500,000 profit upon its sale.

3678
05:19:17,932 --> 05:19:24,137
[SPEAKER_47]: gain not due to my hard work, but merely to living here while it appreciated in value so that others might have a chance of buying or renting a home.

3679
05:19:24,777 --> 05:19:28,500
[SPEAKER_47]: I would like to note that the loudest voices in opposition to an RETF are those of realtors.

3680
05:19:28,660 --> 05:19:37,847
[SPEAKER_47]: In my opinion, it is highly offensive for these people who pocket a whopping five to 7% per transaction to sound alarm bells about how a one to 2% fee would harm home buyers and sellers.

3681
05:19:38,327 --> 05:19:40,969
[SPEAKER_47]: I hope I'm not the only person to call attention to this hypocrisy.

3682
05:19:41,029 --> 05:19:43,091
[SPEAKER_47]: Sincerely, Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

3683
05:19:51,614 --> 05:19:54,317
[SPEAKER_42]: What a, what an evening it's been.

3684
05:19:54,338 --> 05:20:06,773
[SPEAKER_42]: So, so I just would like to address some of the just sort of reiterate what I said earlier in my initial comments which is to say that the.

3685
05:20:09,153 --> 05:20:17,339
[SPEAKER_42]: The way that this got broken to the public was really not ideal, and I do wanna recognize that.

3686
05:20:19,321 --> 05:20:33,412
[SPEAKER_42]: Normally something like this would be put on the agenda, discussed at a council meeting, and then a lot more public information would come out then, and then something a little bit more solid would be developed in committee.

3687
05:20:33,826 --> 05:20:47,713
[SPEAKER_42]: What happened was our February 20 meeting, we ended up, you know, addressing the fire for the firefighter issues and of course that just ended up pushing the whole meeting to past midnight.

3688
05:20:48,094 --> 05:20:49,134
[SPEAKER_42]: So this was tabled.

3689
05:20:50,235 --> 05:20:53,476
[SPEAKER_42]: And then we also had the election on March 5 so that

3690
05:20:54,917 --> 05:21:05,727
[SPEAKER_42]: was another delay and basically just it meant that there was three weeks where again, this was on the agenda with zero details to the public.

3691
05:21:06,928 --> 05:21:14,655
[SPEAKER_42]: And Councilors here were also a little bit hamstrung in terms of what we could promise the details would look like because again, we hadn't actually discussed it yet.

3692
05:21:14,676 --> 05:21:16,517
[SPEAKER_42]: I was trying to

3693
05:21:18,339 --> 05:21:28,605
[SPEAKER_42]: I was trying to write on my website about what different RETF policies could look like, what the process was, and just generally try to clarify things there.

3694
05:21:28,745 --> 05:21:34,188
[SPEAKER_42]: But again, it was difficult because I can't promise anything because the proposal itself hasn't been developed.

3695
05:21:34,968 --> 05:21:46,430
[SPEAKER_42]: I do wanna, I would like to recognize that and acknowledge that the way that this was broken to the public, especially in this instance, wasn't ideal.

3696
05:21:46,550 --> 05:21:50,251
[SPEAKER_42]: And we do have a lot of improving to do in that space.

3697
05:21:50,271 --> 05:21:51,231
[SPEAKER_42]: So thank you.

3698
05:21:52,531 --> 05:21:52,931
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3699
05:21:52,951 --> 05:21:54,732
[SPEAKER_47]: I mean, we did have good turnout.

3700
05:21:57,592 --> 05:21:58,252
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Tseng.

3701
05:21:58,852 --> 05:22:00,513
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, President Bears.

3702
05:22:00,913 --> 05:22:03,053
[SPEAKER_43]: And thank you everyone for bearing with

3703
05:22:04,215 --> 05:22:05,336
[SPEAKER_43]: Sorry, bad, bad joke.

3704
05:22:07,299 --> 05:22:13,205
[SPEAKER_43]: Awful joke too late for it to be bearing with us as we've met tonight.

3705
05:22:13,806 --> 05:22:19,412
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, you know I wanted to piggyback off of what Councilor Leming was saying.

3706
05:22:20,934 --> 05:22:38,079
[SPEAKER_43]: Unfortunately, state law does constrain the amount of discourse that we can have in public before a meeting when it comes to the fleshing out, or I mean when it comes to talking about a proposal like this but also fleshing out the details, as I think we are very conscious about opening one.

3707
05:22:39,119 --> 05:22:40,980
[SPEAKER_43]: we want to make sure that we're not breaking it.

3708
05:22:41,980 --> 05:22:51,983
[SPEAKER_43]: And that's hindered our ability to talk freely about what we as individual Councilors would like to see in a home rule petition like this.

3709
05:22:53,203 --> 05:22:59,565
[SPEAKER_43]: As has been noted by a member of the public, the 18 home rule petitions that have passed are all different.

3710
05:22:59,585 --> 05:23:01,525
[SPEAKER_43]: They're all customized to their municipality.

3711
05:23:01,745 --> 05:23:05,527
[SPEAKER_43]: And I want us to have a chance to do that for Medford.

3712
05:23:05,967 --> 05:23:06,527
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, whether,

3713
05:23:07,552 --> 05:23:14,335
[SPEAKER_43]: we'll vote for it or not, whether we'll pass it is truly contingent on what the language is.

3714
05:23:15,035 --> 05:23:18,637
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think, you know, my fellow Councilors know that's my stance.

3715
05:23:19,656 --> 05:23:26,079
[SPEAKER_43]: When I think about my obligations as a city councilor, it truly is to represent everyone.

3716
05:23:26,479 --> 05:23:31,281
[SPEAKER_43]: And there are a lot of people who oppose this, I acknowledge that.

3717
05:23:31,301 --> 05:23:33,582
[SPEAKER_43]: There are people who agree with it too.

3718
05:23:33,662 --> 05:23:40,965
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, honestly, I think I got just as many correspondences through email in favor as opposed, if not that.

3719
05:23:41,445 --> 05:23:45,387
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, I think in this moment, I think back to,

3720
05:23:47,908 --> 05:23:55,605
[SPEAKER_43]: The 7500 voters who voted for me the doors are not saying that I promised them that we would spend time and committee studying every revenue option that we had.

3721
05:23:56,397 --> 05:24:05,499
[SPEAKER_43]: and the text on my website that essentially promises that, and more specifically says that we should study certain real estate transfer fees.

3722
05:24:05,679 --> 05:24:11,980
[SPEAKER_43]: And so I think it would be breaking my platform and my promise to the voters who voted for me to not vote to continue this night.

3723
05:24:12,080 --> 05:24:18,821
[SPEAKER_43]: But that being said, I think there's a lot more time in the future to flesh out the details.

3724
05:24:18,981 --> 05:24:23,062
[SPEAKER_43]: I think everyone should come to those meetings and participate as well.

3725
05:24:24,203 --> 05:24:38,574
[SPEAKER_43]: And on the communication aspect of things, I know things aren't ideal, but at 7pm tomorrow night in the Resident Services Committee, I'm going to continue proposing a whole litany of reforms when it comes to communications.

3726
05:24:38,634 --> 05:24:50,403
[SPEAKER_43]: I've been working with the Communications Director of the City to develop channels for us to reach out to residents as well, alternative channels that don't just build off of lists that we have, but expand those lists

3727
05:24:50,983 --> 05:25:05,934
[SPEAKER_43]: We've talked I know a few of us have talked to Pam Kelly at the senior center, talking about how we can reach out to seniors and put updates about what we're talking about in city council on into the senior center newsletter as well.

3728
05:25:06,395 --> 05:25:13,520
[SPEAKER_43]: On the budget item, we know that we have to be more transparent and that's why on the agenda for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it but on an agenda for tonight.

3729
05:25:13,880 --> 05:25:15,722
[SPEAKER_43]: There is a brand new get to it.

3730
05:25:17,284 --> 05:25:18,104
[SPEAKER_43]: I'd love to get to it.

3731
05:25:18,385 --> 05:25:29,716
[SPEAKER_43]: We have a brand new budget ordinance that lays out more clearly what developing our city budget will look like it will have more opportunities for people to contribute feedback, and for people to see more information.

3732
05:25:30,817 --> 05:25:31,918
[SPEAKER_47]: And with that, I'll.

3733
05:25:32,813 --> 05:25:33,253
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3734
05:25:33,874 --> 05:25:46,700
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng, I want to give one minute, as requested to Councilor Scarpelli and then we will vote on the question the motion by Councilor Collins, seconded by I believe Councilor let me that was made about four hours ago.

3735
05:25:46,720 --> 05:25:48,801
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, thank you.

3736
05:25:49,542 --> 05:25:51,723
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, I think that this is a very

3737
05:25:53,305 --> 05:25:54,066
[SPEAKER_40]: a hot topic.

3738
05:25:54,126 --> 05:26:07,576
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that one thing that I would recommend is as we move forward with our committee meetings, I know that we have in the past been a little free and adding information before the meeting.

3739
05:26:08,136 --> 05:26:18,704
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it'd be important that we try to figure out what the president and our leadership team, that as we move forward, when we send out these topics, when you talk like use the rent control issue,

3740
05:26:19,324 --> 05:26:32,688
[SPEAKER_40]: that the information gets out there so residents can see that, because I think that's one of the things that played into this evening was the fact that that issue was so big, and that information wasn't really put out that way.

3741
05:26:33,368 --> 05:26:35,049
[SPEAKER_40]: It was put out as home rule petition.

3742
05:26:35,469 --> 05:26:41,351
[SPEAKER_40]: Now legally that's the way they've done, but in all sincerity, it's, it's that starts the divide.

3743
05:26:42,219 --> 05:26:57,026
[SPEAKER_40]: So I think that whether we change our way of business, Mr. President, and how we allow ourselves to present information for certain meetings, I think that's something we should revisit.

3744
05:26:57,486 --> 05:27:02,088
[SPEAKER_40]: But a question that I had was, we keep skipping over a step.

3745
05:27:02,108 --> 05:27:04,029
[SPEAKER_40]: Everybody keeps saying here, right?

3746
05:27:04,409 --> 05:27:05,289
[SPEAKER_40]: And then we go to the state.

3747
05:27:05,729 --> 05:27:08,671
[SPEAKER_40]: There's one person we're not talking about.

3748
05:27:08,831 --> 05:27:11,272
[SPEAKER_40]: What is the mayor saying about these issues?

3749
05:27:12,176 --> 05:27:13,417
[SPEAKER_40]: Has anyone talked to the mayor?

3750
05:27:14,818 --> 05:27:17,920
[SPEAKER_40]: Because this is funny, what I see that it's a problem.

3751
05:27:18,781 --> 05:27:21,683
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the most important person suppose in our community, our leader.

3752
05:27:22,724 --> 05:27:24,065
[SPEAKER_40]: And we have yet to hear from her.

3753
05:27:25,786 --> 05:27:28,368
[SPEAKER_40]: She's very busy fighting right fights, right?

3754
05:27:28,909 --> 05:27:31,451
[SPEAKER_40]: I mean, postponing meetings for two months, we'll get into that another day.

3755
05:27:31,831 --> 05:27:36,754
[SPEAKER_40]: But the mayor hasn't been transparent in anything we're talking about.

3756
05:27:37,955 --> 05:27:39,396
[SPEAKER_40]: One of the issues we hear right now is,

3757
05:27:40,546 --> 05:27:50,838
[SPEAKER_40]: Why so late was because something might have been very simple, really turned into a snowball effect to the fact that we truly don't know what our budget looks like.

3758
05:27:51,398 --> 05:27:57,245
[SPEAKER_40]: So I know you have the resolution coming up this evening, and I had, I would have motions going forward.

3759
05:27:57,265 --> 05:27:58,706
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know if we're going to get to it, truly don't know.

3760
05:27:59,187 --> 05:28:00,909
[SPEAKER_40]: But the truth of the matter is,

3761
05:28:02,577 --> 05:28:04,399
[SPEAKER_40]: We need to know where the mayor stands with this.

3762
05:28:04,439 --> 05:28:21,333
[SPEAKER_40]: So whether it's passed or not, I'd like to, as an addition or a separate motion, that the mayor is involved in these meetings and her administration to help us if this moves forward to craft something that's reasonable.

3763
05:28:21,353 --> 05:28:21,993
[SPEAKER_47]: It's on the transfer fee.

3764
05:28:22,334 --> 05:28:24,055
[SPEAKER_47]: Right, all right, thank you.

3765
05:28:24,556 --> 05:28:27,838
[SPEAKER_47]: I did promise Mr. Castagnetti that he could finish his point.

3766
05:28:27,878 --> 05:28:28,539
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, come on.

3767
05:28:28,759 --> 05:28:29,099
[SPEAKER_47]: I did.

3768
05:28:31,748 --> 05:28:38,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Scott Powell, you get a gag order, it's my turn, quiet.

3769
05:28:38,431 --> 05:28:39,391
[SPEAKER_13]: You get 20 minutes.

3770
05:28:39,451 --> 05:28:41,472
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, my wife's been wrong.

3771
05:28:42,693 --> 05:28:42,973
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

3772
05:28:43,053 --> 05:28:46,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, by the way, thank you for, I think you remember.

3773
05:28:46,474 --> 05:28:48,575
[SPEAKER_47]: I almost remembered.

3774
05:28:49,116 --> 05:28:50,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

3775
05:28:51,577 --> 05:28:53,798
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanna thank you very, very much, I appreciate it.

3776
05:28:54,458 --> 05:28:57,739
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to close off meetings, but I didn't realize it would be the next day.

3777
05:28:58,119 --> 05:28:58,840
[SPEAKER_13]: What time is it?

3778
05:28:59,451 --> 05:29:00,616
[SPEAKER_47]: What is that piece of paper?

3779
05:29:00,636 --> 05:29:01,219
[SPEAKER_47]: 1238 AM.

3780
05:29:01,299 --> 05:29:04,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, what was the question?

3781
05:29:05,253 --> 05:29:05,773
[SPEAKER_13]: My paper?

3782
05:29:06,013 --> 05:29:07,374
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, what's that piece of paper?

3783
05:29:07,394 --> 05:29:08,615
[SPEAKER_42]: I've been curious all evening.

3784
05:29:09,115 --> 05:29:10,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's who's talking?

3785
05:29:10,575 --> 05:29:11,136
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Matt.

3786
05:29:11,516 --> 05:29:13,477
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was from the movie, 13 Ghosts.

3787
05:29:13,497 --> 05:29:14,317
[SPEAKER_13]: I just watched it.

3788
05:29:15,298 --> 05:29:15,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind.

3789
05:29:16,078 --> 05:29:17,899
[SPEAKER_13]: You wouldn't get it.

3790
05:29:18,019 --> 05:29:18,539
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 1964.

3791
05:29:20,240 --> 05:29:26,002
[SPEAKER_13]: These papers, I have to get my notes in order because these are my president notes, my cue cards.

3792
05:29:26,222 --> 05:29:29,524
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all shuffled from not speaking before.

3793
05:29:30,144 --> 05:29:30,724
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what they are.

3794
05:29:30,764 --> 05:29:32,405
[SPEAKER_13]: They're cue cards, presidential ones.

3795
05:29:33,786 --> 05:29:34,146
[SPEAKER_42]: I gotcha.

3796
05:29:37,329 --> 05:29:38,209
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet you do.

3797
05:29:39,469 --> 05:29:42,590
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyways, maybe I can get this done real quick.

3798
05:29:44,530 --> 05:29:50,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll agree affordability is a monumental problem, but it's not my fault, it's not their fault.

3799
05:29:51,551 --> 05:30:01,313
[SPEAKER_13]: And to make matters much, much worse, three years this week, we've had the most worst rampant inflation in 50 years.

3800
05:30:02,413 --> 05:30:02,853
[SPEAKER_13]: P.S.

3801
05:30:02,993 --> 05:30:06,014
[SPEAKER_13]: inflation is the most regressive tax of all.

3802
05:30:07,012 --> 05:30:07,933
[SPEAKER_47]: You did this one already.

3803
05:30:08,493 --> 05:30:10,555
[SPEAKER_47]: You did, you already did that one.

3804
05:30:11,015 --> 05:30:13,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess you interrupted me, I mixed up my presidential cut.

3805
05:30:13,697 --> 05:30:15,699
[SPEAKER_47]: That's okay, I'll get you on it.

3806
05:30:16,139 --> 05:30:18,701
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so this is, I think it's number two.

3807
05:30:19,302 --> 05:30:22,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Math doesn't lie, but people skew the numbers.

3808
05:30:22,104 --> 05:30:22,945
[SPEAKER_47]: You did this one too.

3809
05:30:23,685 --> 05:30:23,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

3810
05:30:25,146 --> 05:30:26,888
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm serious, I remember what you said.

3811
05:30:27,028 --> 05:30:28,169
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great, good memory.

3812
05:30:28,229 --> 05:30:29,690
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a great memory, what did I say?

3813
05:30:29,710 --> 05:30:32,432
[SPEAKER_47]: You said math doesn't lie.

3814
05:30:33,173 --> 05:30:34,754
[SPEAKER_13]: And what was below it?

3815
05:30:36,800 --> 05:30:40,981
[SPEAKER_47]: My old man paid co ops, you talked about co ops.

3816
05:30:43,462 --> 05:30:44,802
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not coming here.

3817
05:30:46,283 --> 05:30:49,123
[SPEAKER_13]: My old man paid 11 five for the house.

3818
05:30:49,724 --> 05:30:56,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he met his $5,000 salary, the call of 50 so he paid triple the salary today you make 100,000 a year, I have no clue.

3819
05:30:57,386 --> 05:30:58,266
[SPEAKER_13]: I never seen that kind of money.

3820
05:30:59,502 --> 05:31:01,605
[SPEAKER_13]: The same formula would be you could pay only 300,000.

3821
05:31:01,645 --> 05:31:04,148
[SPEAKER_13]: You ain't gonna find for three, it's gonna be six or 900.

3822
05:31:04,228 --> 05:31:11,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're gonna have to put up a heck of a hundreds of thousands and thousands of dollars down payment in order to qualify with the mortgagor.

3823
05:31:14,578 --> 05:31:20,942
[SPEAKER_13]: I gave you a solution a month ago from the New York Post, cooperative shares.

3824
05:31:21,562 --> 05:31:23,364
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a condo, but you have shares.

3825
05:31:23,604 --> 05:31:30,729
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same thing, but instead of a million dollar condo in this condo area in Station Landing, you get into it for 300,000.

3826
05:31:30,769 --> 05:31:31,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about that.

3827
05:31:34,204 --> 05:31:43,967
[SPEAKER_13]: If we take a mortgage for the whole $300,000, no money down, it's $510, $1,500 a month, instead of you paying $2,500 a month rent right now.

3828
05:31:44,887 --> 05:31:45,967
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a solution.

3829
05:31:46,327 --> 05:31:48,568
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Castagnetti, I'm gonna ask you to get to your last cue card.

3830
05:31:49,088 --> 05:31:51,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you know I had my last one.

3831
05:31:51,388 --> 05:31:53,009
[SPEAKER_47]: That's not fair.

3832
05:31:53,029 --> 05:31:54,269
[SPEAKER_47]: That's not fair.

3833
05:31:54,349 --> 05:31:56,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I waited until after midnight.

3834
05:31:56,670 --> 05:31:56,930
[SPEAKER_47]: I know.

3835
05:31:57,210 --> 05:31:57,450
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

3836
05:31:57,670 --> 05:31:59,991
[SPEAKER_47]: It's already been three minutes on your second five minutes.

3837
05:32:00,471 --> 05:32:01,191
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you're a pain.

3838
05:32:03,004 --> 05:32:05,506
[SPEAKER_42]: This is only like the first resolution on the agenda.

3839
05:32:05,906 --> 05:32:09,588
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, the CPA tax, there's a story about that.

3840
05:32:09,628 --> 05:32:14,972
[SPEAKER_13]: When they started gathering the signatures like five years ago, and one of the girls was Ms.

3841
05:32:14,992 --> 05:32:30,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Cameroon, along with other girls, and they gathered signatures by the hat shell here, and they only needed half the required signatures that you and I, the regular people, would have to acquire in order to put it on the ballot.

3842
05:32:31,852 --> 05:32:34,154
[SPEAKER_13]: because the state did that, because they liked the tax.

3843
05:32:34,535 --> 05:32:35,235
[SPEAKER_13]: They allowed that.

3844
05:32:35,956 --> 05:32:44,344
[SPEAKER_13]: And anyways, that was not fair, because not only that, they put the ballot question on the CPA tax on the back of the ballot.

3845
05:32:44,724 --> 05:32:49,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Not very many people turned the ballot over, and it passed by a narrow margin.

3846
05:32:50,249 --> 05:32:52,111
[SPEAKER_13]: That was like unfair.

3847
05:32:53,483 --> 05:33:00,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, by the way, I told you about the HO3, car insurance came in yesterday, $2,500 to $3,000.

3848
05:33:00,626 --> 05:33:02,267
[SPEAKER_47]: $2,500 to $3,000 in the past year, yep.

3849
05:33:03,147 --> 05:33:05,248
[SPEAKER_13]: That's crazy, the house bills are insane.

3850
05:33:06,748 --> 05:33:12,951
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a quote that goes like this, tax the rich, feed the poor, until there are no rich no more.

3851
05:33:13,591 --> 05:33:14,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell me where is sanity?

3852
05:33:17,052 --> 05:33:17,813
[SPEAKER_13]: But the point is,

3853
05:33:18,905 --> 05:33:19,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't worry about the rich.

3854
05:33:21,006 --> 05:33:24,167
[SPEAKER_13]: They can only sleep in one house if they have five mansions like the Rolling Stones.

3855
05:33:24,647 --> 05:33:27,087
[SPEAKER_13]: The point is, it's the middle class you're destroying now.

3856
05:33:27,368 --> 05:33:28,588
[SPEAKER_13]: No more the lower middle class.

3857
05:33:28,928 --> 05:33:30,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you're going after the middle class.

3858
05:33:31,609 --> 05:33:33,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Once you do that, we don't have a society worth a damn.

3859
05:33:34,190 --> 05:33:37,931
[SPEAKER_13]: You might have a Marie Antoinette running on the best deal.

3860
05:33:38,371 --> 05:33:40,031
[SPEAKER_13]: That's serious stuff you're talking.

3861
05:33:40,431 --> 05:33:42,832
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not blaming you, I'm blaming your government.

3862
05:33:43,692 --> 05:33:44,773
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Mr. Kessler.

3863
05:33:44,813 --> 05:33:45,613
[SPEAKER_47]: You got 10 seconds.

3864
05:33:47,350 --> 05:33:48,370
[SPEAKER_13]: or say middle class.

3865
05:33:49,251 --> 05:33:53,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah one thing Council my uncle said something there's a city council you probably don't know him.

3866
05:33:54,513 --> 05:34:03,036
[SPEAKER_13]: He just say one thing that I agree with one, and he said leave the people alone and Council March when he retired from this body, you might recollect.

3867
05:34:03,476 --> 05:34:06,377
[SPEAKER_13]: He says to you, Councils, as he left.

3868
05:34:07,264 --> 05:34:14,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Go easy on the people, especially his mother probably trying to on a fixed income like me and West method, trying to support herself.

3869
05:34:14,809 --> 05:34:15,229
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

3870
05:34:15,249 --> 05:34:17,691
[SPEAKER_13]: So please consider we got to wrap it up there.

3871
05:34:17,911 --> 05:34:19,793
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a one paragraph.

3872
05:34:19,813 --> 05:34:20,193
[SPEAKER_53]: All right.

3873
05:34:20,473 --> 05:34:21,093
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll speak quick.

3874
05:34:21,314 --> 05:34:27,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Please reconsider your proposal because if we give you an inch, you will become the ruler.

3875
05:34:27,738 --> 05:34:28,238
[SPEAKER_13]: What's next?

3876
05:34:28,258 --> 05:34:29,579
[SPEAKER_13]: A 51% sales tax or a hundred percent.

3877
05:34:32,682 --> 05:34:35,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, no more taxation without proper representation.

3878
05:34:36,525 --> 05:34:37,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Leave the people alone.

3879
05:34:38,066 --> 05:34:38,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for listening.

3880
05:34:38,707 --> 05:34:39,287
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3881
05:34:39,307 --> 05:34:42,050
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

3882
05:34:42,870 --> 05:35:00,104
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor Leming as amended by Councilor Scarpelli to request the mayor's opinion and involvement on the creation of a home rule petition that great.

3883
05:35:01,085 --> 05:35:02,306
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

3884
05:35:02,674 --> 05:35:02,954
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

05:35:02,974 --> 05:35:03,254
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

3887
05:35:03,574 --> 05:35:03,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

3888
05:35:05,635 --> 05:35:05,735
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

3889
05:35:05,795 --> 05:35:09,796
[SPEAKER_52]: Oh, that's a that's a that's a no.

3890
05:35:32,455 --> 05:35:33,456
[SPEAKER_47]: but almost not.

3891
05:35:34,196 --> 05:35:42,922
[SPEAKER_47]: All right, call the rest of the roll, please.

3892
05:35:45,764 --> 05:35:49,166
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, on six and a half in favor, half opposed.

3893
05:35:49,206 --> 05:35:51,268
[SPEAKER_47]: The motion is referred to the Planning and Permanent Committee.

3894
05:35:51,288 --> 05:35:56,191
[SPEAKER_47]: 21-057, leaf blower ordinance.

3895
05:35:59,616 --> 05:36:07,843
[SPEAKER_47]: The latest draft of the lease floor ordinance was reported on the committee of the whole meeting on February 21st, 2024 for consideration by the full council and a copy is attached to this packet.

3896
05:36:09,004 --> 05:36:13,508
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by.

3897
05:36:13,528 --> 05:36:17,091
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by councilor Zara for first reading.

3898
05:36:17,111 --> 05:36:19,954
[SPEAKER_47]: We will take any comments from councilors.

3899
05:36:21,055 --> 05:36:22,456
[SPEAKER_47]: Any comments on the lease floor ordinance?

3900
05:36:22,476 --> 05:36:25,359
[SPEAKER_47]: I have a councilor Collins.

3901
05:36:27,213 --> 05:36:28,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Bears.

3902
05:36:28,655 --> 05:36:42,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, this is an ordinance that I've worked on over my terms and city council I believe this is an exercise and compromise is the result of what we have put forward over a couple years of working on this hearing.

3903
05:36:44,480 --> 05:36:55,503
[SPEAKER_14]: strong opposition to the idea of regulating these devices and also very strong support for the idea of mitigating these devices that we know cause significant air pollution and also noise pollution.

3904
05:36:55,523 --> 05:37:03,746
[SPEAKER_14]: What we've arrived at is an ordinance that seeks to provide some reasonable constraints around which devices can be used,

3905
05:37:04,446 --> 05:37:14,633
[SPEAKER_14]: at what times of the day, where, and phases out the most polluting versions of these devices, gas-powered, for residential and commercial users over different timescales over the next several years.

3906
05:37:14,693 --> 05:37:17,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have one motion before we vote, which is Section 3858, subsection 2,

3907
05:37:21,934 --> 05:37:24,296
[SPEAKER_14]: think that the word continuous should be removed.

3908
05:37:24,897 --> 05:37:33,725
[SPEAKER_14]: A constituent got in touch and indicated that this created kind of a loophole that was counter to the goals of this section.

3909
05:37:34,486 --> 05:37:40,592
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be to remove the word continuous from section 3858 subsection 2 before we vote.

3910
05:37:42,094 --> 05:37:44,176
[SPEAKER_47]: Could you repeat the section again a little louder?

3911
05:37:44,216 --> 05:37:44,476
[SPEAKER_47]: Sorry.

3912
05:37:45,914 --> 05:37:51,098
[SPEAKER_14]: section 38, 58, and then numeral two in that section.

3913
05:37:51,118 --> 05:37:52,519
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, much appreciated.

3914
05:37:53,540 --> 05:38:09,413
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan, or Lazzaro, as amended by Councilor Collins to remove the word continuous from section 38, 58, section two.

3915
05:38:10,714 --> 05:38:12,315
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comment by members of the Council?

3916
05:38:12,455 --> 05:38:13,116
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Callahan.

3917
05:38:14,625 --> 05:38:15,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

3918
05:38:15,145 --> 05:38:18,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you, we are voting to do what exactly?

3919
05:38:18,406 --> 05:38:21,206
[SPEAKER_47]: This is the first reading of the leaf blower ordinance.

3920
05:38:21,286 --> 05:38:25,267
[SPEAKER_47]: It will then go be advertised in the paper and then come back to us for third reading.

3921
05:38:25,287 --> 05:38:25,727
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3922
05:38:28,608 --> 05:38:34,309
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further discussion by members of the council, members of the public, name and address for the record, please.

3923
05:38:35,089 --> 05:38:37,150
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you for sticking it out.

3924
05:38:40,650 --> 05:38:41,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning.

3925
05:38:46,478 --> 05:38:47,499
[SPEAKER_47]: Only 53 minutes.

3926
05:38:50,261 --> 05:38:51,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some sad news.

3927
05:38:52,022 --> 05:39:01,608
[SPEAKER_06]: My 125 consecutive day Wordle streak has ended because of tied up here tonight.

3928
05:39:01,628 --> 05:39:05,150
[SPEAKER_42]: I am so sorry.

3929
05:39:05,170 --> 05:39:08,372
[SPEAKER_06]: A full disclosure.

3930
05:39:08,392 --> 05:39:10,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not own a leaf blower.

3931
05:39:11,678 --> 05:39:13,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not use a leaf blower.

3932
05:39:13,579 --> 05:39:18,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not permit any contractors to use a leaf blower on my property.

3933
05:39:18,822 --> 05:39:22,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I do own a rake and I do own a broom and I use them.

3934
05:39:24,786 --> 05:39:26,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I had an opportunity yesterday.

3935
05:39:26,447 --> 05:39:27,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually it wasn't yesterday.

3936
05:39:27,608 --> 05:39:37,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It was two days ago to review the version four of the proposed leaf blower ordinance that was dated March 7th.

3937
05:39:38,467 --> 05:39:42,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I have four specific points to address with the council.

3938
05:39:42,829 --> 05:39:55,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually now only three, now that Vice President Collins has addressed one of my issues and that had to do with the word continuous.

3939
05:39:57,334 --> 05:40:03,556
[SPEAKER_06]: First, the concept of clearing lawns and leaves and grass clippings

3940
05:40:04,687 --> 05:40:28,494
[SPEAKER_06]: by whipping up the landscape with machines that generate airstreams, airstream blasts of 200 miles per hour might actually be humorous if not for the fact that they produce clouds of unhealthy particulate debris, including animal feces, heavy metals, construction dust, mold,

3941
05:40:30,119 --> 05:40:43,647
[SPEAKER_06]: fungus, pollen, pesticides, and herbicides that naturally travel beyond the property of the owner's borders and stay suspended in the air for hours.

3942
05:40:44,587 --> 05:40:58,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though 85 to 90% of Medford households do not employ commercial landscapers, we, the super majority, are still forced to inhale that debris.

3943
05:40:59,938 --> 05:41:07,741
[SPEAKER_06]: As the draft ordinance now stands, there are no seasonal restrictions on battery or electric leaf blowers.

3944
05:41:08,361 --> 05:41:20,066
[SPEAKER_06]: They would be allowed to operate 365 days a year, apparently under the false assumption that they do not cause any adverse impact.

3945
05:41:21,158 --> 05:41:36,688
[SPEAKER_06]: While it is true that they do not produce the toxic exhaust from incomplete burning of gasoline and oil, they are just as powerful as their gas-powered counterparts.

3946
05:41:37,898 --> 05:41:40,380
[SPEAKER_06]: and they aren't exactly elevator music either.

3947
05:41:41,781 --> 05:41:51,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I compared the maximum air speeds between gas powered and battery powered leaf blowers manufactured by three leading companies.

3948
05:41:51,670 --> 05:41:54,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I got this information directly from their websites.

3949
05:41:54,793 --> 05:42:02,219
[SPEAKER_06]: The still or steel Magnum BR 800 gas backpack leaf blower tops out at 239 miles per hour.

3950
05:42:05,438 --> 05:42:10,280
[SPEAKER_06]: The same company's BGA 300 battery backpack blower tops out at 195 miles per hour.

3951
05:42:10,340 --> 05:42:14,722
[SPEAKER_06]: The Echo PB770T gas backpack blower, the commercial grade, 234 miles per hour.

3952
05:42:27,401 --> 05:42:38,334
[SPEAKER_06]: The same company's DPB 5800 TD2-2 battery backpack blower, 195 miles per hour.

3953
05:42:39,836 --> 05:42:47,144
[SPEAKER_06]: The Husqvarna, and I think that's how the Swedish pronounce it, 580 BFS gas pack,

3954
05:42:48,015 --> 05:43:02,530
[SPEAKER_06]: gas backpack blower tops out at 220 miles per hour, while the same company's 350 IB battery leaf blaster is 200 miles per hour.

3955
05:43:03,111 --> 05:43:04,092
[SPEAKER_47]: Norman, I just want to give you a warning.

3956
05:43:04,232 --> 05:43:05,193
[SPEAKER_47]: We have one minute left.

3957
05:43:05,706 --> 05:43:10,149
[SPEAKER_47]: on the five minutes, then I'm gonna ask if other folks wanna speak and then I can come back to you for a second, five minutes.

3958
05:43:10,169 --> 05:43:10,389
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

3959
05:43:11,209 --> 05:43:15,912
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no practical difference between the gas and the battery models.

3960
05:43:16,493 --> 05:43:21,396
[SPEAKER_06]: All are extraordinarily powerful at 195 to 200 miles per hour.

3961
05:43:22,797 --> 05:43:27,760
[SPEAKER_06]: These air speeds far exceed category five hurricane levels.

3962
05:43:28,620 --> 05:43:34,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the prior draft, all leaf blowers, gas and battery were prohibited

3963
05:43:35,652 --> 05:43:41,255
[SPEAKER_06]: except between March 15th and May 31st, and October 1st and December 15th in any year.

3964
05:43:42,795 --> 05:43:52,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't we at least have a few months in the late spring, summer, and early fall, when we do not have to endure leaf blowing, when there are no leaves on the ground?

3965
05:43:53,240 --> 05:43:53,821
[SPEAKER_47]: Thanks, Norman.

3966
05:43:53,841 --> 05:43:57,162
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm just gonna ask at this point, is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this subject?

3967
05:43:57,222 --> 05:44:03,065
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could just have 20 seconds to finish this section, and then I'll come back to the other two.

3968
05:44:04,952 --> 05:44:24,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna respectfully suggest that the battery slash electric blowers be subject to the same seasonal restrictions as the gas blowers, because we're dealing with the same issue in terms of the disbursement of the debris.

3969
05:44:25,500 --> 05:44:28,061
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no difference between the gas and the electric.

3970
05:44:28,381 --> 05:44:31,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll deal with the last two when I return.

3971
05:44:31,643 --> 05:44:32,163
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3972
05:44:34,338 --> 05:44:38,263
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further comment by members of the public on the proposed leaf blower ordinance?

3973
05:44:42,950 --> 05:44:43,250
[SPEAKER_47]: Anyone?

3974
05:44:43,991 --> 05:44:46,154
[SPEAKER_47]: There's just still people here, so I figured maybe you're here for this.

3975
05:44:47,236 --> 05:44:47,896
[SPEAKER_47]: Anyone on Zoom?

3976
05:44:47,936 --> 05:44:49,018
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm not seeing any hands, Norman.

3977
05:44:49,158 --> 05:44:50,820
[SPEAKER_47]: Five more minutes, last two points.

3978
05:44:51,201 --> 05:44:51,481
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3979
05:44:54,475 --> 05:45:14,117
[SPEAKER_06]: My second point, in the prior draft, that's the one dated October, 2022, Sundays and legal holidays were off limits for any leaf blowing, except for emergencies, such as a violent storm or a downed tree or something of the like.

3980
05:45:16,405 --> 05:45:20,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And on Mondays through Saturdays, use was restricted between 9 a.m.

3981
05:45:21,167 --> 05:45:22,207
[SPEAKER_06]: and 5 p.m.

3982
05:45:22,807 --> 05:45:35,091
[SPEAKER_06]: But the current draft, there's no prohibition for leaf blowing on Sundays or legal holidays, and no specific limitation on the allowable hours on any day.

3983
05:45:36,204 --> 05:45:46,654
[SPEAKER_06]: In short, under the current draft, battery electric leaf blowing with its 200 mile per hour airstream blast,

3984
05:45:47,728 --> 05:45:53,631
[SPEAKER_06]: and noise is essentially unrestricted, seven days a week, 24 hours per day.

3985
05:45:53,971 --> 05:45:56,212
[SPEAKER_47]: It is limited to 7 a.m.

3986
05:45:56,252 --> 05:45:56,792
[SPEAKER_47]: to 6 p.m.

3987
05:45:56,832 --> 05:45:58,653
[SPEAKER_47]: for the city noise and nuisance control.

3988
05:45:58,993 --> 05:46:03,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think with the leaf blowing, I think it should be specified.

3989
05:46:03,675 --> 05:46:05,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you want leaf blowers anyway at 7 a.m.

3990
05:46:05,936 --> 05:46:07,196
[SPEAKER_06]: in the morning, no matter what.

3991
05:46:07,376 --> 05:46:10,157
[SPEAKER_47]: I can just say this to speak to why these amendments were made.

3992
05:46:10,598 --> 05:46:13,719
[SPEAKER_47]: The building department said that outside of the noise ordinance,

3993
05:46:14,286 --> 05:46:18,410
[SPEAKER_47]: and the Sunday and holiday restrictions would be unenforceable and they don't have the staff to enforce it.

3994
05:46:19,971 --> 05:46:23,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I respectfully disagree on on any.

3995
05:46:24,847 --> 05:46:30,651
[SPEAKER_06]: issue of enforcement, because you're assuming that people are going to violate the law.

3996
05:46:31,151 --> 05:46:37,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Most responsible contractors, they may not like the ordinance, but they're gonna respect it because they're law abiding.

3997
05:46:38,515 --> 05:46:43,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're dealing with a few recalcitrant outliers and we'll deal with them.

3998
05:46:43,999 --> 05:46:50,743
[SPEAKER_06]: There's ways of dealing with people who are scofflaws and lawbreakers.

3999
05:46:51,583 --> 05:46:53,223
[SPEAKER_06]: There's civil actions that can be taken.

4000
05:46:53,243 --> 05:46:58,884
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go to file a application for a complaint in court.

4001
05:46:59,425 --> 05:47:07,846
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that's just a very weak argument against passing an ordinance because you don't think you can enforce it.

4002
05:47:08,046 --> 05:47:12,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you should assume that people will follow the law.

4003
05:47:13,467 --> 05:47:17,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what, contractors are not law abiding?

4004
05:47:20,168 --> 05:47:21,829
[SPEAKER_06]: So that to me doesn't make any sense.

4005
05:47:25,510 --> 05:47:32,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Councilor Collins dealt with the continuous hour.

4006
05:47:32,233 --> 05:47:35,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll just bypass that.

4007
05:47:37,275 --> 05:47:39,756
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I would say is that, you know,

4008
05:47:41,390 --> 05:47:48,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend though combining paragraphs two and three in section 3858.

4009
05:47:50,636 --> 05:47:53,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just gonna read what I think the way it should be read.

4010
05:47:53,937 --> 05:48:06,205
[SPEAKER_06]: On parcels 10,000 square feet or less, only one leaf blower may be used, but not for more than 30 minutes in total per day.

4011
05:48:07,361 --> 05:48:26,046
[SPEAKER_06]: On parcels larger than 10,000 square feet, only one leaf blower may be used within each 10,000 square foot area, but not for more than 30 minutes in total per day within each 10,000 square foot area.

4012
05:48:26,646 --> 05:48:28,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I say 30 combined minutes.

4013
05:48:29,767 --> 05:48:43,955
[SPEAKER_06]: because I don't believe in the aggregate more than 30 minutes of leaf blowing is necessary to clear a property of 10,000 square feet or less.

4014
05:48:44,835 --> 05:48:53,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Bearing in mind that a large portion of that 10,000 square feet is occupied by a building, a garage, a shed, a combination of all three.

4015
05:48:53,928 --> 05:48:54,969
[SPEAKER_47]: Got one minute left, Norman.

4016
05:48:55,209 --> 05:48:55,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

4017
05:48:56,691 --> 05:49:06,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final point is there's no need for leaf blowing gas or battery for the entire month of May, and certainly not beyond May 15th.

4018
05:49:06,960 --> 05:49:14,887
[SPEAKER_06]: A maximum of eight weeks in the spring should be plenty of time to remove whatever leaves remain from the previous fall cleanup.

4019
05:49:15,628 --> 05:49:17,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaf blowers in May are mainly used

4020
05:49:18,581 --> 05:49:23,664
[SPEAKER_06]: to disperse grass clippings and to polish, that's landscaper speak, the lawns.

4021
05:49:24,084 --> 05:49:28,887
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also no need for leaf blowing in September when the leaves are still on the trees.

4022
05:49:29,668 --> 05:49:42,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the current draft, we will get more needless nuisance blowing of grass clippings and maybe some shrub trimmings between September 15th and the 30th, along with all the unhealthy airborne pollution.

4023
05:49:43,188 --> 05:50:03,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, I respectfully suggest that the allowable dates for both gas and battery machine blowing be confined to March 15th to May 15th, that's eight weeks in the spring, and September 15th to December 15th in the fall, that's 12 weeks when there actually are leaves on the ground.

4024
05:50:03,739 --> 05:50:08,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So those two periods are more than adequate to deal with the falling leaves.

4025
05:50:10,922 --> 05:50:17,965
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll leave you with that, and I appreciate the time, and good luck with the rest of the meeting.

4026
05:50:17,985 --> 05:50:19,505
[SPEAKER_47]: I appreciate it, thank you.

4027
05:50:20,326 --> 05:50:20,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

4028
05:50:20,806 --> 05:50:22,707
[SPEAKER_47]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

4029
05:50:28,009 --> 05:50:33,851
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, as amended by Councilor Collins.

4030
05:50:34,571 --> 05:50:35,772
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4031
05:50:37,193 --> 05:50:37,853
[SPEAKER_52]: Councilor Callahan.

[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4036
05:50:45,995 --> 05:50:46,275
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4037
05:50:47,696 --> 05:50:50,957
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

05:50:52,898 --> 05:50:53,378
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4040
05:50:53,418 --> 05:51:04,502
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, 60 affirmative one of the negative the motion passes for first reading 22-49 for budget ordinance I request a motion that this be tabled for one week to appear on the agenda for March 19.

4041
05:51:05,922 --> 05:51:07,843
[SPEAKER_47]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli seconded by.

4042
05:51:08,851 --> 05:51:11,293
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Leming to postpone for one week.

4043
05:51:11,653 --> 05:51:12,374
[SPEAKER_47]: I can't make motions.

4044
05:51:13,074 --> 05:51:25,585
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4045
05:51:26,966 --> 05:51:27,246
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay.

4046
05:51:30,128 --> 05:51:30,789
[SPEAKER_54]: Where are you at, Matt?

4047
05:51:40,897 --> 05:51:41,117
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

4048
05:51:42,738 --> 05:51:43,318
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4049
05:51:45,078 --> 05:51:45,278
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4050
05:51:46,798 --> 05:51:47,039
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4051
05:51:51,439 --> 05:51:51,960
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4052
05:51:54,460 --> 05:51:54,760
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

4053
05:51:55,340 --> 05:51:55,680
[SPEAKER_47]: Seven.

4054
05:51:55,700 --> 05:51:56,320
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm sorry.

4055
05:51:56,380 --> 05:51:57,201
[SPEAKER_47]: Six of the affirmative.

4056
05:51:57,241 --> 05:52:06,782
[SPEAKER_47]: One of the negative motions tabled 24-047 offered by Councilor Leming resolutions to request linkage fee updates in the city of Method.

4057
05:52:12,705 --> 05:52:27,433
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so basically this is, this is sort of supposed to be three resolutions but I think it was, it was now I'm just getting emotion table until the next meeting table to the meeting on March 19 Councilor living seconded by Councilor gala.

4058
05:52:28,293 --> 05:52:34,797
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. please follow Mr. quick says hang on I feel like we've been doing that for a while.

4059
05:52:40,680 --> 05:52:40,780
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4060
05:52:40,820 --> 05:52:40,940
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4061
05:52:40,960 --> 05:52:41,020
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4062
05:52:41,060 --> 05:52:41,360
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4063
05:52:41,380 --> 05:52:41,600
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4064
05:52:41,761 --> 05:52:42,041
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4065
05:52:42,341 --> 05:52:42,541
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4066
05:52:42,581 --> 05:52:42,681
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4067
05:52:42,701 --> 05:52:42,841
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4068
05:52:42,921 --> 05:52:43,221
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

4069
05:52:44,001 --> 05:52:44,321
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

4070
05:52:45,382 --> 05:52:47,822
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm just going to read this from the chair.

4071
05:52:47,842 --> 05:52:49,543
[SPEAKER_52]: This is really easy guys.

4072
05:52:49,563 --> 05:52:51,064
[SPEAKER_52]: I can find it, of course.

4073
05:53:08,763 --> 05:53:24,013
[SPEAKER_47]: Be it resolved by the Bedford City Council that in accordance with the intent of the council's vote in 2022 to establish an independent elections department, the name of said department be updated on the city website, city letterhead, and all of the city signage to election department to distinguish the department and staff from their governing board, the election commission.

4074
05:53:24,033 --> 05:53:25,714
[SPEAKER_47]: This is pretty self-explanatory.

4075
05:53:25,754 --> 05:53:29,196
[SPEAKER_47]: This has come with discussions with elections commissioners.
