    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=404.947">That's</a>  incredible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=405.547">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=405.867">And</a>  yeah, part of the part of the mission of the podcast is to sort of focus on community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=411.23">And</a>  that seems like a really community focused effort. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=415.052">And</a>  yeah, we, you know, we were talking about balance and like, you know, being open and you shared that some of your criticism you get sometimes is that you're only open a few days a week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=424.397">I</a>  will. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=426.087">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I will say that I went in before COVID and it was so overwhelming to try to get in there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=433.133">And</a>  then you're always hoping you'll get the bagel that you want that like during COVID, it was nice to be able to know like I can order exactly what I want, go and pick it up and like still the same way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=444.523">So</a>  I appreciate it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=445.624">And</a>  we were talking about how they're kind of like a lure of something that's hard to get and delicious.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=450.749">Yeah,</a>  limited edition, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=452.63">weekends</a>  well we always say big as bagels are for weekends so um and definitely like saturday and sunday we were previous to the pandemic we were open wednesday through sunday i think and we definitely had people were going to the office and school and stuff more obviously before 2020 so we had like a decent amount early early but then it would kind of like be a lull and like there's only so much we were a brand new shop too there's only so much you can clean there's only so much you can stock there's only so much you can stamp so um it wasn't the greatest use of everyone's time and so we really took <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=480.581">Not</a>  that I ever want this opportunity again, but we really took the pandemic as an opportunity to sort of pare down our menu and make sure we were offering what we wanted to offer and in the times to just really make the most of what we had to give to folks without any extra stuff that maybe was sort of sucking up resources. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=495.345">And</a>  that was that was a that was one silver lining that I don't know if we would have, I think we probably would have just gone gone gone until we</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=501.386">hit</a>  the wall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=502.027">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=503.328">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=504.009">You</a>  started fast and furious. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=504.869">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=505.15">It</a>  was like when I think about it, such a, they almost seem like two different shops. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=508.253">Like</a>  it was such an overwhelming experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=510.275">Like</a>  we were so, we knew it would be popular. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=512.236">We</a>  knew people were excited, but like, we literally like Medford was so welcoming from like day one, but it was, it was a line. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=520.704">And</a>  we didn't know how to do inventory yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=522.845">So</a>  we learned so much just on the job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=524.766">I'm</a>  a preparer, but there's just so much that you can't learn until you actually do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=530.669">And</a>  it was definitely, again, not nice to be isolated at home, but it was nice to be able to take a pause and figure out how to do things more the way we wanted to do stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=538.613">That</a>  was just such a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=543.412">And</a>  yet ordering, we do allow folks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=545.153">So</a>  yeah, that's another thing that people don't know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=546.674">You</a>  can definitely come in and order now, but we started that two years ago again, I think in 2022. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=552.076">But</a>  yeah, ordering ahead, you definitely, if you really want a poppy bagel and you're not sure we'll have one, you can order it on like Tuesday and pick it up Friday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=558.119">So</a>  I love that model.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=560.76">Wonderful,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=561.941">Any</a>  other kind of takeaways for you guys from the first five years?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=568.003">Yeah,</a>  I mean, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=570.71">There's</a>  a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=571.651">I</a>  guess the main thing would be is as a small business owner and working with other people, having employees is definitely the biggest challenge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=584.98">So</a>  being a boss is hard.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=587.702">Yeah,</a>  we were never bosses before.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=589.082">So</a>  I know a lot of people don't have sympathy for the boss man, but it is definitely a hard role and it is hard to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=600.47">It</a>  is hard to learn how to be an effective leader and a boss and... While doing the whole job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=608.396">While</a>  doing the job and not coming off like a raging a-hole sometimes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=616.503">So</a>  yeah, learning how to manage your personality and be a decent human at work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=624.409">It</a>  can be challenging when you're, you know, you've got, you know,</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=629.697">Everybody's</a>  got their own stuff going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=630.659">Pressure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=631.06">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=633.423">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=633.843">And</a>  also just, I think one thing that I've actually, I was thinking of this, this weekend, like I was definitely, I worked at corporate before for like a thousand years and such lovely people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=641.865">I</a>  always had a good team, which is why I stayed at it for so long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=645.686">But</a>  also you see a lot of like, ugh, like the world, ugh, like what's going on there? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=649.447">Like</a>  just like sort of cutthroat blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=651.327">I</a>  feel like our customers, again, there's like the 2% that I want to punch in the face. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=654.568">Not</a>  really, I'm not a violent person, but you know what I mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=656.188">But</a>  like, you see how many good, like just everybody's just really doing their best coming out in the world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=661.71">They're</a>  like making, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=663.57">And</a>  to our shop on a Saturday is a treat like they look forward to it they like our stickers like it really did sort of reinforce my faith in people which was nice because I didn't realize how much I kind of lost that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=673.674">So</a>  I I've appreciated that and like we didn't know like one of the super bonus of having this in our neighborhood like we know our neighbors now like we didn't know we knew our immediate like for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=682.777">But</a>  other than that, now we're like, oh, we live on Orchard Street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=685.018">It's</a>  like, oh, I live on Dearborn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=686.118">Oh,</a>  I live on Winthrop Lake. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=687.178">And</a>  we're like, oh, wow, all these people live near us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=688.659">And</a>  everybody's just like, we see them out now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=690.859">People</a>  shout at our dogs when they see us because they know them from Instagram. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=693.86">So</a>  that's been a really, really nice thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=696.661">And</a>  also, people are very particular about their food. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=698.721">I</a>  did not realize. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=699.941">I</a>  have a couple of friends who are very particular. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=701.902">I</a>  thought they were outliers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=702.802">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=703.602">People</a>  are very particular about their food. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=706.043">But</a>  I think that's why they like us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=707.123">We</a>  definitely try to do our best to accommodate <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=710.524">anything</a>  people are asking for, if we can do it within reason. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=712.886">But</a>  yeah, especially in the morning too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=716.109">Morning</a>  food is very, very specific, but now I'm an expert.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=720.333">Yeah,</a>  I think I remember when I had to go, I had to cut out dairy for like a little while and I was able to like text something or was this true or call and to see if any what didn't have dairy in it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=731.319">Yeah,</a>  we have we do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=732.14">So</a>  that's a good thing about out there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=733.04">We</a>  do have an allergen page. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=734.401">So</a>  that usually is updated with everything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=736.802">We</a>  do have a vegan cream cheese for non-dairy folks right now both our specials we have pretzel and cherry chocolate chip. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=741.985">They're</a>  both non-dairy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=743.726">We</a>  outsource gluten-free bagels, we get them from a little shop in Canada, keep them frozen, so that you know if there's a group and somebody can't have gluten or is trying, there's a lot of times people are on sort of temporary diets as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=754.652">So</a>  we try to do our best, that's kind of why we keep our menu small, because it is definitely challenging, but yeah we want everybody to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=760.931">be</a>  able to have a good bagel on a weekend morning.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1066.582">Yeah,</a>  you have to mold them the right way, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1068.743">To</a>  get to that outcome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1070.284">Yeah,</a>  wow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1071.664">That's</a>  cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1072.024">I</a>  didn't know that you guys did that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1073.105">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1074.245">Yeah,</a>  no, it's, you know, it's hard to find good help. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1080.047">And</a>  I think people who are young, you know, teenager age, like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1086.996">You,</a>  you essentially have a ball of clay and you can, you know, you can impart your, your good work practices and habits and attitude and that, you know, there's good energy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1099.442">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1100.102">You</a>  know, they're like a sponge, you know, soaking it all in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1103.964">So</a>  if you, if you can create a, you know, a good, fun, you know, yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1111.657">hard-working</a>  productive environment they're gonna pick it up and like I've had youngsters go other places and be like I worked at this place and they're like you know what a crap show that was like you guys have it together so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1127.047">We</a>  have been fooled. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1127.787">Just</a>  kidding.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1130.448">No,</a>  it sounds like you've taken your experience of what doesn't maybe work in terms of managing your life and your work and what you expect of your employees or what was expected of you and you've used that to create a work environment that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1144.472">You</a>  know, you're seeing works for people.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1146.533">So</a>  yes, we're definitely both like 80s babies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1149.395">So</a>  like capitalism, consumerism totally drilled into our heads. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1152.437">And</a>  like, I think we realized a while ago, like, oh, like, you don't just have to work your whole life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1156.88">Like,</a>  it's obviously important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1158.681">We</a>  both love working. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1159.461">We</a>  both value hard work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1160.922">And</a>  you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1162.603">But</a>  yeah, there is just, there is a balance and there is like treating people properly and paying people properly and just doing, it's like, and again, we definitely come from a place of privilege, but just like doing the right thing as a business owner and a boss, like it's definitely challenging, but like you can do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vXB2q6fgU4WmfnDwYklr0?t=1177.529">And</a>  we're hoping to continue to be able to do that.</p>
