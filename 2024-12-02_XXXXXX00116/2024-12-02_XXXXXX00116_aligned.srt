Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:32,406
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:34,908
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,748
All right, thank you both for being with me today.

10
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:44,371
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:51,775
Sure, I am Lindsay Gaudette, she, hers, and I am a co-owner of Goldilocks Bagels in beautiful Medford.

12
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:56,718
I am Ed Phil, pronouns are he, him.

13
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:57,859
I am the

14
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,519
other owner of Goldilocks Bagels.

15
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:02,319
Great.

16
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:02,879
Well, thank you.

17
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:14,702
I will say this is a much anticipated interview for me because, well, I love your bagels, but also the next question that I'm going to ask, we ask everybody, which is their favorite place to eat in Medford, what they like to eat there.

18
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:18,643
And the rosemary salt bagel comes up all the time from Goldilocks.

19
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,524
So, but I'll pose that question to you.

20
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:25,525
It might be a little controversial, but are there other places in Medford that you guys like to eat and what do you like to eat there?

21
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:30,600
Yes, I think we would both say Chili Garden, we love.

22
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:33,422
And then I would also say Colleen's, we love.

23
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,204
And Pikaichi, we love.

24
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:37,285
I'm probably forgetting things too.

25
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,067
But yeah, we're like once a week Chili Garden people.

26
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:43,369
It's so good.

27
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,251
Yeah, I second all that.

28
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:48,193
Pikaichi's great.

29
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:53,372
He's also, seems like he takes quite a bit of time off.

30
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:57,156
So he's creating some hype for himself too.

31
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:59,498
But yeah, I love it all.

32
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,059
Yeah.

33
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,240
Yeah.

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,821
Great.

35
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:02,301
Thank you.

36
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:09,529
Yeah, you two were so we're part of the reason we're meeting today is to celebrate your fifth anniversary of Goldilocks being open.

37
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:15,617
And we were chatting a little bit before about kind of the, you described yourself as burnouts from life.

38
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:19,981
So I think demonstrating a work-life balance is really nice and important.

39
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,423
It sounds like those folks are doing that as well.

40
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:28,949
But yeah, so to celebrate your anniversary, I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about how you decided to start Goldilocks.

41
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:37,666
Um, so I'm a lifelong bagel lover, um, grew up on frozen Sara Lee's from the, you know, with a little butter and cream cheese.

42
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:46,948
And, um, I think we finally got a Bruegger's when I was like 10 or 11, but, uh, yeah, so we were always looking for a good bagel around and bagel source closest one.

43
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,568
There's still like 2.7 miles from us.

44
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:52,969
Um, and Ed is a. Gifted chef, baker, everything.

45
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:55,550
Um, and so just sort of kind of started playing around.

46
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,871
He did some cooking school and was sort of trying some different techniques and started playing around with bagels.

47
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:00,311
And we just.

48
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:02,872
kind of worked on a recipe for a few years.

49
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:08,873
And then we were both sort of, as mentioned, burning out on our previous careers.

50
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:13,095
So we were able to sort of transition away from that, find a space that happens.

51
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:14,775
The shop is four blocks from our house.

52
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:18,876
So we were kind of looking for commercial spaces, which is a really, that's a whole separate issue.

53
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:23,878
Finding commercial spaces that like are good and you can actually like get, it's a whole separate issue.

54
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:23,978
But

55
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:34,040
The universe loved us and yeah, we found a place four blocks from our house and sort of did a lot of work and got set up in there for, in 2019 we opened.

56
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm talking a lot, go ahead.

57
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,500
No, no, it's good.

58
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:38,261
That means I don't have to.

59
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:45,723
Yeah, definitely burnt out on life, career.

60
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:48,144
What was I gonna add?

61
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:51,325
Sorry, Mondays are hard.

62
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,025
You love cooking.

63
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:59,648
Yeah, no, I've always been passionate about food and at my previous job, I got to go into a lot of kitchens.

64
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:09,441
I was working for a mozzarella wholesaler and I got to meet lots of people in various kitchens in and around Boston, Metro Boston.

65
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:12,822
when I saw what these people were doing.

66
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:20,605
And, you know, I could always tell the minute I walked into a kitchen, like who was serious, really serious about the craft and who wasn't.

67
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:29,129
And it was definitely like inspirational to see like what some of the people were doing and just the vibe.

68
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,229
And I was like, I, you know, I could do this.

69
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,510
I was like, I want this.

70
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,471
So we're both serious workers.

71
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:37,905
You could even say workaholics.

72
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:39,387
Try not to be.

73
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:41,350
It's nice to be a workaholic for yourself.

74
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:41,810
I'll give it.

75
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,832
That's much better.

76
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:43,533
For sure, yes.

77
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:46,417
Working for yourself is... Very lucky.

78
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,079
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

79
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:48,700
If you can.

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,102
Not everybody has the luxury.

81
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:55,575
Yeah, I will say that bagel, we are really excited about a good bagel place in Medford.

82
00:04:55,595 --> 00:05:04,361
My wife was in New York before here and she was so always like really looking for a, we've been to Bagelsaurus, but it's still a little too far, but she loves the Bate Your Bagels.

83
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:07,383
And I mean, so do I, but it's a nice like weekend treat.

84
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:24,379
yeah that's what we like make it a treat and we have lots of folks new york and new jersey folks are like our favorite because they're always like i'm from new york i'm from new jersey and i'm like let us know what you think and then they always i'm not always but most of the time they come back and they're like that's a good bagel so that's always a little bit of an extra like an asterisk bonus when we get that compliment from them

85
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:30,038
And I just remembered that I have a friend, Leilani, when the place first opened.

86
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:30,718
Love Leilani.

87
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,678
I actually thought she was an investor.

88
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:37,439
I was like, because she was always posting about the bagels and cookies.

89
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:43,301
She has a child walking around now that was literally like eating our bagels in her belly when we opened.

90
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:43,681
So weird.

91
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:44,861
What's up, G?

92
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,401
That's a good measure of time there.

93
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,141
It is.

94
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,682
Raised up cinnamon raisin, that baby.

95
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,082
So it's very good.

96
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,010
Yeah.

97
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,971
So I did want to, I noticed that you do like on your menu, you have the locks, locks of love.

98
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:57,472
Can you tell us a little bit about what that is?

99
00:05:58,252 --> 00:05:58,432
Yeah.

100
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:02,113
So we, we love, as I said, we live close to the shop.

101
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:09,835
We love our community and we love sort of we like putting bagels out into the world, but also some, some good, good vibes and good stuff.

102
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:15,396
So we started in 2020, we started the locks love program and we basically pick a different group or organization.

103
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:19,757
Sometimes we do schools, sometimes we do teams, sometimes we do local charities, organizations, whatever.

104
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:23,518
whatever we can find that needs some love and pick them every week.

105
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:30,979
And then we take $0.25 from every breakfast sandwich we sell and any additional donations that our incredibly generous customers want to give.

106
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,000
And we give that to a different group every week.

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,020
I probably give once a month because I do them in batches, but it's a weekly organization.

108
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,161
And it's, yeah, I think we're up to $50,000 since 2020 that we've donated.

109
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:40,761
Yeah, it's awesome.

110
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:45,507
That's incredible.

111
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:45,787
Yeah.

112
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:51,170
And yeah, part of the part of the mission of the podcast is to sort of focus on community.

113
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,572
And that seems like a really community focused effort.

114
00:06:55,052 --> 00:07:04,377
And yeah, we, you know, we were talking about balance and like, you know, being open and you shared that some of your criticism you get sometimes is that you're only open a few days a week.

115
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:05,058
I will.

116
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:13,113
Yeah, I mean, I will say that I went in before COVID and it was so overwhelming to try to get in there.

117
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:23,242
And then you're always hoping you'll get the bagel that you want that like during COVID, it was nice to be able to know like I can order exactly what I want, go and pick it up and like still the same way.

118
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:25,544
So I appreciate it.

119
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:30,348
And we were talking about how they're kind of like a lure of something that's hard to get and delicious.

120
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,190
Yeah, limited edition, right?

121
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:59,721
weekends well we always say big as bagels are for weekends so um and definitely like saturday and sunday we were previous to the pandemic we were open wednesday through sunday i think and we definitely had people were going to the office and school and stuff more obviously before 2020 so we had like a decent amount early early but then it would kind of like be a lull and like there's only so much we were a brand new shop too there's only so much you can clean there's only so much you can stock there's only so much you can stamp so um it wasn't the greatest use of everyone's time and so we really took

122
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:14,904
Not that I ever want this opportunity again, but we really took the pandemic as an opportunity to sort of pare down our menu and make sure we were offering what we wanted to offer and in the times to just really make the most of what we had to give to folks without any extra stuff that maybe was sort of sucking up resources.

123
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:20,786
And that was that was a that was one silver lining that I don't know if we would have, I think we probably would have just gone gone gone until we

124
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:21,987
hit the wall.

125
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:23,208
Yeah.

126
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:23,989
Yeah.

127
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:24,849
You started fast and furious.

128
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:25,130
You're right.

129
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,213
It was like when I think about it, such a, they almost seem like two different shops.

130
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:30,254
Like it was such an overwhelming experience.

131
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,196
Like we were so, we knew it would be popular.

132
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:39,483
We knew people were excited, but like, we literally like Medford was so welcoming from like day one, but it was, it was a line.

133
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,825
And we didn't know how to do inventory yet.

134
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:44,706
So we learned so much just on the job.

135
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:50,289
I'm a preparer, but there's just so much that you can't learn until you actually do it.

136
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:58,593
And it was definitely, again, not nice to be isolated at home, but it was nice to be able to take a pause and figure out how to do things more the way we wanted to do stuff.

137
00:08:58,613 --> 00:08:59,634
That was just such a lot.

138
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,133
And yet ordering, we do allow folks.

139
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,613
So yeah, that's another thing that people don't know.

140
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:11,156
You can definitely come in and order now, but we started that two years ago again, I think in 2022.

141
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:18,019
But yeah, ordering ahead, you definitely, if you really want a poppy bagel and you're not sure we'll have one, you can order it on like Tuesday and pick it up Friday.

142
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,840
So I love that model.

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,841
Wonderful, yeah.

144
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:24,622
Any other kind of takeaways for you guys from the first five years?

145
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:28,724
Yeah, I mean,

146
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,491
There's a lot.

147
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:44,099
I guess the main thing would be is as a small business owner and working with other people, having employees is definitely the biggest challenge.

148
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,261
So being a boss is hard.

149
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:48,962
Yeah, we were never bosses before.

150
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:58,289
So I know a lot of people don't have sympathy for the boss man, but it is definitely a hard role and it is hard to

151
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:08,116
It is hard to learn how to be an effective leader and a boss and... While doing the whole job.

152
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:15,842
While doing the job and not coming off like a raging a-hole sometimes.

153
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:24,209
So yeah, learning how to manage your personality and be a decent human at work.

154
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,273
It can be challenging when you're, you know, you've got, you know,

155
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:30,639
Everybody's got their own stuff going on.

156
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,040
Pressure.

157
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,381
Yeah.

158
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:33,643
Yeah.

159
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:41,845
And also just, I think one thing that I've actually, I was thinking of this, this weekend, like I was definitely, I worked at corporate before for like a thousand years and such lovely people.

160
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:43,925
I always had a good team, which is why I stayed at it for so long.

161
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,427
But also you see a lot of like, ugh, like the world, ugh, like what's going on there?

162
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,167
Like just like sort of cutthroat blah, blah, blah.

163
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:54,488
I feel like our customers, again, there's like the 2% that I want to punch in the face.

164
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:56,168
Not really, I'm not a violent person, but you know what I mean?

165
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:01,670
But like, you see how many good, like just everybody's just really doing their best coming out in the world.

166
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,650
They're like making, yeah.

167
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:12,693
And to our shop on a Saturday is a treat like they look forward to it they like our stickers like it really did sort of reinforce my faith in people which was nice because I didn't realize how much I kind of lost that.

168
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:22,317
So I I've appreciated that and like we didn't know like one of the super bonus of having this in our neighborhood like we know our neighbors now like we didn't know we knew our immediate like for.

169
00:11:22,777 --> 00:11:24,998
But other than that, now we're like, oh, we live on Orchard Street.

170
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,018
It's like, oh, I live on Dearborn.

171
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,138
Oh, I live on Winthrop Lake.

172
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:28,619
And we're like, oh, wow, all these people live near us.

173
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,659
And everybody's just like, we see them out now.

174
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,360
People shout at our dogs when they see us because they know them from Instagram.

175
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,641
So that's been a really, really nice thing.

176
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:38,641
And also, people are very particular about their food.

177
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:39,821
I did not realize.

178
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,822
I have a couple of friends who are very particular.

179
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:42,762
I thought they were outliers.

180
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:43,562
That's not true.

181
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,703
People are very particular about their food.

182
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:47,103
But I think that's why they like us.

183
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,024
We definitely try to do our best to accommodate

184
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:52,706
anything people are asking for, if we can do it within reason.

185
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:55,969
But yeah, especially in the morning too.

186
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:59,031
Morning food is very, very specific, but now I'm an expert.

187
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:11,279
Yeah, I think I remember when I had to go, I had to cut out dairy for like a little while and I was able to like text something or was this true or call and to see if any what didn't have dairy in it.

188
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:12,040
Yeah, we have we do.

189
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,020
So that's a good thing about out there.

190
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,281
We do have an allergen page.

191
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,762
So that usually is updated with everything.

192
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:21,845
We do have a vegan cream cheese for non-dairy folks right now both our specials we have pretzel and cherry chocolate chip.

193
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:22,866
They're both non-dairy.

194
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:34,312
We outsource gluten-free bagels, we get them from a little shop in Canada, keep them frozen, so that you know if there's a group and somebody can't have gluten or is trying, there's a lot of times people are on sort of temporary diets as well.

195
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:39,975
So we try to do our best, that's kind of why we keep our menu small, because it is definitely challenging, but yeah we want everybody to

196
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,194
be able to have a good bagel on a weekend morning.

197
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:51,467
So, and I was lucky enough at Oktoberfest to try your pizza because I feel like I've tried, but how do people, how can you get pizza?

198
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,408
Like when do you guys make it?

199
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:53,250
Where can people find it?

200
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,191
So right now it's Saturdays.

201
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:59,413
So we make a small amount of, we do a pepperoni and a cheese pie on Saturdays.

202
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:05,395
So you can order those starting, ordering goes up online every Monday, yeah, Monday morning, maybe Sunday night if you're lucky.

203
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:07,816
And yeah, Saturday is the day for pizza.

204
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:13,199
We'd like to, again, if we could maybe get a couple more team members or figure some stuff out, move some stuff around, we'd like to offer it more.

205
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,659
But right now it's Saturday mornings.

206
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,420
And yeah, it's a big, beautiful slice of Sicilian pan pizza.

207
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,361
It's really, really good.

208
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:20,262
And occasionally Medford Brewing?

209
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:21,462
What, I'm sorry?

210
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:22,983
Occasionally Medford Brewing?

211
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:36,416
We did, we did have a thing going on with Medford Brewery for a while, but yeah, we kind of, we were doing, we did a lot of say yesing this summer, which I admire so much folks that do like farmers markets and events every week.

212
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:37,637
I don't know how you guys do that.

213
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:38,638
That is, whoo.

214
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:43,202
So we did that a lot this summer and definitely tried a lot of things, met a lot of people, glad to do it.

215
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,624
We're taking a little break from that for now, focusing back on the show.

216
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:47,505
on the shop for fall and winter.

217
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:51,947
But yeah, and we do have pizza bagels every day too.

218
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:52,507
That's a good point.

219
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,527
That's on the app.

220
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:55,288
That's not a separate thing.

221
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:56,449
Yes.

222
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,990
Yeah.

223
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,910
Great.

224
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,570
Well, yeah, thanks.

225
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:08,234
So it sounds like, you know, you've learned a bit about what it's like to be bosses and connecting with your, you know, your immediate community as well.

226
00:14:09,254 --> 00:14:15,757
Anything that you kind of would reflect on in terms of like appreciation for Medford or kind of our community of our city?

227
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:24,699
I mean, so for our five year, I like, of course, put together something insanely way too long, way too many words, slideshow for the internet, because that's my specialty.

228
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,343
But just looking back over 2019 until now, it has been, I think we've had two slow days.

229
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:35,184
It's really very, is heartening a word?

230
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:39,306
It's very heartening just how much we're appreciated for like, we sell one thing, you know what I mean?

231
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:41,127
So it's just been very nice.

232
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:41,968
People are so generous.

233
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:46,069
They bring our bagels on planes to see their families when they go home for the holidays.

234
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,990
They bring them to like,

235
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:54,253
birthday parties in the park, like the office, like they're always a treat, like somebody's always like, I'm bringing these to the teachers today on Fridays, which is like, so nice.

236
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,314
Everybody's very patient.

237
00:14:56,374 --> 00:15:00,336
We had some, some delays this weekend, and nobody like yelled at us or barks at us.

238
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:01,737
Occasionally we get the one star review.

239
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:03,298
Those people have thoughts about that.

240
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:04,278
That's a separate podcast.

241
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:09,201
But yeah, just how welcoming and like consistently supportive everybody has been.

242
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,822
I'm not surprised, but it's just been very nice to experience.

243
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:12,682
So yeah.

244
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:20,026
Stole the words right out of my mouth.

245
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:27,513
Yeah, no, I definitely appreciate the community aspect of it.

246
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:35,821
And, you know, in the morning when we're baking, sometimes like people just come to the back door and just say, hey, I just wanted to say hi.

247
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:41,987
So it's we are very blessed to be in the neighborhood that we're in and have so many

248
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:45,814
wonderful, loving customers.

249
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:46,595
And their dogs.

250
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:50,138
Yeah, I get lots of visits from dogs at the back door.

251
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,661
Backdoor cookie hookups for dogs.

252
00:15:56,024 --> 00:16:07,695
So yeah, we love Medford and we love what we're doing and hopefully we can keep this going for a while.

253
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:08,633
Yes.

254
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,315
We all hope that, too.

255
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:11,035
Great.

256
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:11,476
Thank you.

257
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:15,299
Anything else you want to mention or plug before you wrap up?

258
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:15,960
Yeah.

259
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:25,348
I did want to say one thing that I personally have been enjoying about this, and that is the mentorship of youth.

260
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:37,735
Right now we have, we've actually been working with the Medford Vogue and we've had a couple people come through who've been, everybody so far has been great.

261
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:41,256
Shout out Madison, Sophie, Josera, and Patty.

262
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:47,997
Yeah, lots of great workers have come from our high school and they're all in the Vogue.

263
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:51,058
But yeah, I really think,

264
00:16:52,638 --> 00:17:04,522
You know, people should not overlook mentorship and trying to like teach you know our youth, a skill and a trade I think it's hugely important, and just how to exist in the world.

265
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:10,965
Yeah, just, just how to be social in the workplace and what the rest of the world but yeah it's.

266
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:20,070
It's been not only eye opening, but also very rewarding to like teach young people new skills and watch them grow.

267
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:27,474
You know, like we've had a lot of these youngsters in our shop since they were like freshman, sophomore in high school.

268
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:31,036
And now three of them are seniors.

269
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:38,120
But it's been it's been really cool to watch them grow as humans and

270
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,401
become fully functioning, sassy little adults.

271
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,163
Yeah, you have to mold them the right way, right?

272
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:49,883
To get to that outcome.

273
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:51,644
Yeah, wow.

274
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:51,984
That's cool.

275
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,065
I didn't know that you guys did that.

276
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:53,545
That's great.

277
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:59,807
Yeah, no, it's, you know, it's hard to find good help.

278
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:05,549
And I think people who are young, you know, teenager age, like,

279
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:19,422
You, you essentially have a ball of clay and you can, you know, you can impart your, your good work practices and habits and attitude and that, you know, there's good energy.

280
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:20,002
Yeah.

281
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:23,904
You know, they're like a sponge, you know, soaking it all in.

282
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:30,187
So if you, if you can create a, you know, a good, fun, you know, yet.

283
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:45,606
hard-working productive environment they're gonna pick it up and like I've had youngsters go other places and be like I worked at this place and they're like you know what a crap show that was like you guys have it together so.

284
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:47,747
We have been fooled.

285
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:48,447
Just kidding.

286
00:18:50,448 --> 00:19:03,832
No, it sounds like you've taken your experience of what doesn't maybe work in terms of managing your life and your work and what you expect of your employees or what was expected of you and you've used that to create a work environment that

287
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:06,513
You know, you're seeing works for people.

288
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,335
So yes, we're definitely both like 80s babies.

289
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:12,317
So like capitalism, consumerism totally drilled into our heads.

290
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:16,840
And like, I think we realized a while ago, like, oh, like, you don't just have to work your whole life.

291
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,141
Like, it's obviously important.

292
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,441
We both love working.

293
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:20,902
We both value hard work.

294
00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:21,283
And you know,

295
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:37,409
But yeah, there is just, there is a balance and there is like treating people properly and paying people properly and just doing, it's like, and again, we definitely come from a place of privilege, but just like doing the right thing as a business owner and a boss, like it's definitely challenging, but like you can do it.

296
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:39,770
And we're hoping to continue to be able to do that.

297
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:40,931
Yeah.

298
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:42,231
Yeah.

299
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:43,091
Thank you for sharing that.

300
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:44,892
Anything else before we wrap up for today?

301
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:47,893
No, I think we're good.

302
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:48,153
Yeah.

303
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:50,294
Thank you for having us on. 02155.

304
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:53,683
