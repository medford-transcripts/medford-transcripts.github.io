    <p>[Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=139.073s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=140.274s">I'd</a>  like to bring up Joseph as I talk about his accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=147.161s">We've</a>  known Joseph for quite a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=155.15s">He's</a>  a 2017 graduate of Medford High School, attended the <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=159.983s">McGlynn</a>  Middle School and the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=162.904s">All</a>  right, see, I got my facts right. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=166.446s">And</a>  he, this past year, participated, or for a couple of years, has participated in the Event Horizon Telescope work, which was involved in looking at the black hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=181.793s">And</a>  this was <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=183.442s">pretty</a>  secret for a long while because there was a lot that we didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=187.992s">And</a>  then in, I want to say in April, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=192.941s">Of</a>  last year, the team released their data and showed us the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=201.227s">And</a>  they released six papers, six research papers with 347 members on the six papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=209.354s">Joseph</a>  is the only undergraduate named on all six papers, so I got my facts correct on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=218.04s">And</a>  he also <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=220.802s">contributed</a>  to, I think, three directly, and then had another, had one of the conferences that they were talking about the data that you had worked pretty hard on. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=234.205s">So</a>  at this point, we recognize Joseph because it has, the discovery, along with the other 346 researchers, has received a Breakthrough Prize, which, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=249.54s">carries</a>  more money than the Nobel, and it's the USA Nobel Prize, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=257.225s">So</a>  it's a really great honor for Medford to have one of its own so young to be part of that particular research project and contribute to it in such a meaningful way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=271.416s">I</a>  want to congratulate him personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=273.837s">He's</a>  a wonderful human being, a true Mustang, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=280.413s">And</a>  this is the kind of thing we love to see from our graduates, but also from the current students that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=291.303s">He's</a>  done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=292.163s">So</a>  congratulations, Joseph.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=300.819s">If</a>  I could formally read the report into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=303.601s">Medford</a>  High School alumnus of the class of 2017, Joseph Arai, is being recognized with the Science Breakthrough Prize, along with the 346 collaborators of the Event Horizon Telescope's incredible first picture of a black hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=317.829s">The</a>  team is equally splitting the award among all collaborators. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=321.091s">He</a>  is named on all six of the publications for the discovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=324.713s">Joseph</a>  is the only undergraduate student named as an author. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=328.035s">Unbelievable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=328.895s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=330.378s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=333.922s">I</a>  should also add, he also goes to UMass Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=340.207s">So</a>  this is a really important kind of pipeline that I think our UMass system is developing for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=346.091s">So</a>  just all of these things from a public education perspective are so critical for the future of our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=354.798s">So</a>  hopefully this bodes well for the future of everything that's going on.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=360.56s">Joseph,</a>  could you step forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=362.481s">Mr.</a>  Cieri, please feel free to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=367.142s">Medford</a>  Public Schools is proud to recognize Joseph Hurrah for scientific contributions to the Event Horizon Telescope project. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=374.924s">On</a>  behalf of all the members of the Medford School Committee, congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=386.047s">Would</a>  you like to say something? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=392.417s">You</a>  can stand tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=393.297s">It'll</a>  catch you.</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=394.658s">My</a>  mom said I was going to be expected to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=397.76s">I</a>  didn't believe her. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=398.82s">Moms</a>  are always right. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=402.202s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=404.924s">I'd</a>  like to thank all the, especially the science department at Medford High, and all the teachers I've had throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=410.647s">They</a>  just supported me without question throughout everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=412.729s">And</a>  everyone in Medford deserves as much credit for the award as I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=419.292s">So</a>  thank you, everyone.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=427.199s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero?</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=428.362s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=429.544s">Thank</a>  you, Joseph. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=430.547s">Let</a>  me shake your hand.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=431.649s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=433.533s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=434.215s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=454.397s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=455.478s">I</a>  just wanted to say that when I originally saw the images online and I read about them in ScienceDaily.com when I first saw them, I was just blown away by the images. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=465.622s">And</a>  it's just really exciting for me to know that our hometown made a little contribution to that moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=471.385s">I'd</a>  just like to know, Joseph, can I ask you a couple of questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=473.966s">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=474.346s">Yeah,</a>  I'd just love to know, what in particular was your contribution to the project?</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=479.135s">So</a>  I contributed to three aspects of the project, imaging, modeling, and theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=484.602s">So</a>  imaging deals with taking the data, the raw data, and turning it into the image that you saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=491.071s">And</a>  on that end, I was on imaging team one. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=493.994s">I</a>  ran the imaging workshop where we created the first image. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=496.778s">and</a>  I created the comparison metrics that we used for the blind imaging algorithms. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=500.479s">For</a>  the modeling aspect, modeling is how we extract actual information about the black hole from the image, I designed ring image domain feature extraction methods that basically look at the image and in a non-biased manner can determine not just how large the ring is in its width, but its uncertainty in that measurement, and from that the mass of the black hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=521.162s">And</a>  on the theory end, I work on extending Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically the Kerr metric, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=526.563s">to</a>  come up with an alternate parameterization of the black hole shadow, which is how we determine everything we know about the black hole.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=533.601s">That's</a>  amazing.</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=534.361s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=536.343s">Absolutely</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=537.603s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=538.684s">Can</a>  you just help us understand why this is so special and why it's so difficult for, why this discovery hasn't been made before?</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=546.088s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=547.329s">So</a>  Einstein's theory of general relativity and the theory of quantum mechanics are the two most successful theories in physics and they're used to describe everything that we understand today from the very, very small to the very, very large. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=558.635s">But</a>  they have a flaw, which is that they don't work when the thing that you're looking at is both very, very small and very, very large. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=564.236s">And</a>  the only place we know where that happens is in a black hole past the event horizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=567.997s">And</a>  up until the image was released, there was no scientific evidence that black holes even existed and that this flaw was actually a real thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=575.598s">And</a>  so with the advent of the image came the first evidence of an event horizon in the universe, a place where our understanding of physics breaks down.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=583.88s">And</a>  can you tell us the location, how many light years away it is?</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=586.202s">Yeah,</a>  so M87 is an elliptical galaxy 55 million light years away from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=590.085s">The</a>  light from the black hole travels 50,000 light years to escape the galaxy, then 50 million light years to us, and then another 100,000 or so to reach our portion of the Milky Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=599.892s">And</a>  then it had to survive, you know, 15, 16 miles of atmosphere, significant atmosphere, like the water column, to actually reach our telescopes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=607.557s">So</a>  it's an amazing, it's a basic piece of luck that any of the light made it to us at all.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.04s">That's</a>  absolutely amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.761s">For</a>  someone who's not prepared to speak, you certainly do know the topic very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=616.864s">It's</a>  very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=617.824s">I</a>  would like, I'm sure this invitation is already being extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=620.747s">The</a>  discovery was extraordinarily, I mean, was inspirational to me, and I'm sure a number of our other students would love to see your work and see some pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=628.092s">I</a>  imagine a number of science students were very excited about black holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=632.916s">I've</a>  never actually seen them, because my son's first word was actually black hole, because I subjected him to all the videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=640.221s">I</a>  think that there are a lot of students that would be really inspired by what you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=643.325s">Thank</a>  you so much for what. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=644.406s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.187s">Thank</a>  you all.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.948s">As</a>  I said to Joseph coming in, it's such an honor <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=659.248s">to</a>  know him. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=660.049s">And</a>  it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=661.349s">It's</a>  nothing new. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=662.39s">We're</a>  so excited over the years watching you grow and your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=666.392s">And</a>  thank you to the FARA parents as well, who have been so supportive, of course, of their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=672.596s">It's</a>  been so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=674.097s">And,</a>  you know, this is one of those moments, I think, that when I live a very long and healthy life, I'm going to say, I knew him when. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=683.943s">And</a>  it's just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=685.404s">So</a>  thank you so much, Joseph.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=691.539s">Ms.</a>  DiBenedetto.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=692.58s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=693.561s">Um,</a>  Joan, Joseph and I know each other very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=696.523s">His</a>  older sister was also a scientist and did many activities with my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=703.629s">So</a>  I saw him as a very young child and he always <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=708.168s">had</a>  this interest in science, and whatever he put his mind to, whether it was playing his instruments, or for Medford High School Orchestra, or following the girls around to the Broad when they did their internship there, I knew he was going to set off and do wonderful things. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=728.263s">I</a>  just thought it would take a little longer, Joseph, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=732.265s">So</a>  if this is the beginning, I can't wait to see what's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=735.726s">I'm</a>  very proud of you, for yourself, and for MedFed, and for all the teachers that have helped you along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=743.489s">And</a>  mostly because I know the two parents in this room are very similar to myself and my husband, and they're beaming with joy to see you here getting another award. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=754.053s">Because</a>  this isn't your first year, and I don't think it will be your last. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=757.383s">Welcome</a>  back to MEDFED. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=765.667s">So</a>  thanks for coming back to see us and keep coming back.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=769.769s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=779.403s">Next</a>  up, in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of Medford, Ron Morin, Executive Director of Friends of the Middlesex Fells Reservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=788.688s">The</a>  City of Medford is grateful to Mr. Ron Morin for his unfailing commitment to the preservation of the Middlesex Fells Reservation and for his immense contribution to the effort to protect against the development of the 90-millimeter meadow, a 13-acre section of Lawrence Woods <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=806.338s">for</a>  future generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=808.039s">The</a>  Medford School Committee recognizes Mr. Moran's outstanding leadership as the executive director of the Friends of the Fells Reservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=815.261s">By</a>  his own example, Ron demonstrates how to enjoy and protect our natural resources and in turn our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=822.664s">Through</a>  his generosity of time and spirit given to the citizens of Medford and the visitors of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, Ron teaches us to value and protect those resources which sustain and inspire us. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=834.788s">Mr.</a>  Moran, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=836.974s">He's</a>  the outgoing chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=841.337s">And</a>  so we didn't want this moment to go by without paying a tribute to you, because you were so instrumental in protecting the 90 millimeter site, which for those of us in Medford realize it could have been a hockey rink had others had their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=856.008s">So</a>  I wanted to personally thank you, and I know that it's so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=859.651s">We</a>  have all of the Fells walks that our science classes go to, and I'm sure Mr. Farrar had gone down a couple of those paths as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=867.179s">So</a>  it is a living laboratory that we appreciate and respect, and we know you do as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=872.985s">So</a>  in recognition of your outstanding service to the City of Medford, as Executive Director of the Friends of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, Ron Morin presented this day.</p>

    <p>[Buxbaum]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=889.985s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=891.547s">I</a>  just want to say that I don't think I could have done it without the mayor, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=897.411s">We</a>  organized the community, but I have to say the city of Medford really got behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=903.416s">In</a>  the signatures that we raised, the petition that we had signed, over 1,000 people from Medford signed that signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=912.223s">That</a>  was very, very significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=915.245s">Of</a>  all the communities around here, Medford was number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=919.582s">When</a>  Mayor Burke and Stephanie Burke got behind us, that really was a tipping point in our battle with DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=927.786s">And</a>  her authority in this was really what moved, I think, the commissioner to move in our direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=936.049s">So</a>  thank you for the award. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=937.67s">I</a>  didn't do it alone, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=939.391s">I</a>  had a lot of really good people helping me.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=979.895s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=980.215s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=985.88s">Jeff,</a>  would you like to say a few words? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=987.621s">It's</a>  up to you.</p>

    <p>[Buxbaum]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=991.124s">Since</a>  you asked.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=992.065s">Name</a>  and address, please, for our record.</p>

    <p>[Buxbaum]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=994.587s">Jeff</a>  Buxbaum, 31 Hillcroft Park, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=997.83s">Ron</a>  joined us a couple of years ago as an interim director to help us through a transition that we were going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1003.214s">And</a>  he stayed on for an extra year permanently until he decided to retire again. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1009.999s">But</a>  when the 90-millimeter Meadow fight came up, he just sort of got energized. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1014.964s">I</a>  mean, he was great to begin with, but really he was just ready for that fight and really helped mobilize all the communities, you know, got all the different people on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1023.753s">And</a>  so that was probably the biggest contribution, and we really appreciate him for that and everything else he did for us.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1029.538s">Thank</a>  you for everything you do as well, Jack. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1031.82s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1036.727s">Also,</a>  while we're under suspension, report on climate strike communication, Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1048.049s">Good</a>  evening members of the committee and members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1050.67s">So</a>  as many of you know Greta Thunberg is a 16 year old Swedish activist who last year as a 15 year old stood outside with a poster board that translated into English strike for climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1065.835s">And</a>  this has moved into a worldwide movement and she is the world's newest climate warrior. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1070.756s">And</a>  she asked for students across the world to participate in acts of civil disobedience this past Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1076.628s">and</a>  to participate in climate strikes, to walk out of class, and to participate in rallies. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1083.212s">Boston</a>  was one of many places around the world that held such rallies. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1088.536s">She</a>  has made such quotes that I've shared in the document provided to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1094.561s">that</a>  the one thing we need more than hope is action. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1097.102s">Once</a>  we act, hope is everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1098.882s">So</a>  instead of looking for hope, look for action. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1101.522s">Then</a>  and only then will hope come. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1104.143s">And</a>  then Thunberg also said to the House of Representatives just last week, action does not require the permission of an excused absence, sorry, those are my words. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1114.565s">If</a>  there is anything I can do to improve the situation, then I think it's a very small price to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1120.686s">When</a>  we were meeting and discussing the, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1124.355s">conversation</a>  really focused around civil disobedience and giving students the opportunity to have that voice, but not excusing absences. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1134.019s">The</a>  reality is, is that climate change, 97% of scientists agree, yet only approximately 50% of the population agrees with. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1142.383s">I</a>  believe that we all stand on the side of science and we were looking for and hoping that students would make the sacrifice necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1150.768s">that</a>  whatever an unexcused absence may carry with it, that students would realize that, as she said today to the United Nations, now is the time for panic, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1161.817s">And</a>  given those types of things, we hope that students approach us, their leaders, their teachers, myself, their principals, whoever, to address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1173.766s">We</a>  did not look at this climate change strike as an issue of climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1178.905s">But</a>  if we approved unexcused absences for this, then every rally, be it for good and noble reasons, or be it for the ignoble, nefarious, and detestable reasons that may go directly against the core values of Medford and Medford Public Schools, we would then be beholden to excuse absences for. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1201.601s">And</a>  that's one of the main reasons why we stuck with our position of not excusing absences. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1207.008s">Because</a>  when hate shows up at our doorstep, we would be beholden to excuse absences. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1213.195s">There</a>  is no denying <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1215.302s">Climate</a>  change. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1216.703s">As</a>  people in the Bahamas are searching for their loved ones, as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans is still a memory that is still raw and real for many Americans, Harvey, name the storms, Maria, that devastated our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1234.875s">But</a>  as Greta Thunberg said, action is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1239.679s">And</a>  we call upon our students to do that without an excused absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1244.875s">This</a>  is bigger than excused absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1247.917s">And</a>  our concern was the next time that hate shows up at our doorstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1253.882s">And</a>  we have to excuse absences for things that are detestable and that may go against our core values.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1261.007s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1263.309s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1264.85s">Thank</a>  you very much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1268.305s">I</a>  want to start at the end a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1270.088s">Is</a>  there any national conversation around hate rallies that students are leaving school for? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1275.977s">Because</a>  this is completely new to me and sounds a bit like backing into a decision that was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1283.376s">Like,</a>  I've not heard of any of these hate rallies coming up anywhere in our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1287.319s">Do</a>  you think they would make the news?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1288.88s">So</a>  a few weeks ago in Boston, there was a rally. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1291.582s">There</a>  was a march that stood contrary to the beliefs of many people in this country in West Virginia two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1300.63s">There</a>  was a hate march that left one dead and several injured when somebody decided to drive their car into a crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1306.254s">And</a>  so that was the light in which we looked at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1309.617s">The</a>  reality is that we have to be concerned about our students' safety for the lowest common denominator and for the things that may be unthinkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1321.833s">And</a>  trust me, we believe climate change is real and that the realities of a changing world and a changing planet are upon us.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1334.743s">If</a>  you call in sick on a Friday, does Medford Public Schools have a policy that tells you what you can and cannot do on Saturday and Sunday?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1342.629s">So</a>  if I were to call in sick on Friday, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1346.791s">I'd</a>  better be sick because otherwise it would be an abusive sick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1349.954s">For</a>  whatever reason you don't show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1352.797s">For</a>  personal time I would say that Medford Public Schools does not have a policy but I'm not 100% familiar with our policies at this point.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1360.003s">No</a>  I'm talking about anybody who works for our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1363.566s">I</a>  know for my own job if I call in because I need a mental health day or <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1368.837s">I'm</a>  just, you know, for whatever reason I decide not to go to work, my employer has no rules about what I'm allowed to do on the weekend after that Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1377.723s">So</a>  I just wanted to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1380.184s">I</a>  think there was some confusion with some people I've talked to. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1382.686s">I</a>  actually have no issue with whether this is an excused or unexcused. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1386.448s">I</a>  believe the administration should make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1389.07s">I</a>  do believe it should be the policy of the Medford Public Schools that we do not take and then provide punitive measures that extend outside of the school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1398.157s">to</a>  our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1399.058s">There</a>  is not some huge problem based on our absences that we have reported to DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1404.641s">We</a>  are perfectly fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1405.741s">We</a>  are in the regular range of nine and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1409.283s">And</a>  we do not have a problem of kids skipping school who are then wanting to go, like the band kids are all going to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1418.968s">And</a>  so are the football kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1420.749s">And</a>  the natural, when I was an elementary school parent, there was this huge emphasis on natural consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1428.08s">The</a>  natural consequence, if you don't go to work, you don't get paid or you use your sick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1432.202s">The</a>  natural consequence, if you don't go to school and it's unexcused, if the teacher doesn't let you make up the test, then you don't get a grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1440.225s">But</a>  it's an unnatural consequence to then penalize those students that participate in extracurriculars, whether it's football or band, to then take away those things from all of their teammates. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1452.871s">To</a>  me, it is actually abusive to have the pressure that these students were put on <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1458.226s">on</a>  Friday morning and told, you're going to ruin this band performance for all of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1466.713s">Now,</a>  I don't think that the person who put that message out did anything wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1470.736s">The</a>  wrong thing was that they actually would be penalized for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1474.979s">And</a>  if I may, I have a letter from a parent that couldn't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1478.963s">May</a>  I read it? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1479.863s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1481.785s">So</a>  this is from Jen Lewis. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1483.426s">And</a>  unfortunately, I don't have her address right here, but I'll get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1486.791s">Dear</a>  School Committee, I am deeply disappointed at MPS's decision to maintain last Friday as an unexcused absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1493.553s">My</a>  daughter, Laura Lewis, 10th grade MHS, is a Color Guard member, and while she cares deeply about climate change and would have liked to go to the march on Friday, she chose to attend school since to get an unexcused absence would have kept her from being part of the annual home show this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1509.058s">As</a>  some of you may be aware, it is their largest event of the year, and the kids were strongly admonished not to let the ban down. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1516.408s">MPS</a>  could easily have paved the way for more students to attend by keeping them from having to choose between speaking out with hundreds of thousands of people around the world versus abandoning your team when you have all worked hard for a big event since June. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1531.993s">Many</a>  of our surrounding districts chose to allow students to protest at this event without punitive measures, and MPS could have done the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1538.935s">Instead,</a>  knowing the effect it would have on students who were part of weekend activities, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1544.926s">You</a>  chose to allow a state data point to take precedence over encouraging civic participation and free thought among our student body. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1552.649s">Climate</a>  change continues to worsen because our government refuses to take action to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1557.691s">Maintaining</a>  the status quo, not rocking the boat, has gotten us where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1562.132s">We</a>  must speak out, we must protest, and we must encourage and support our children to do the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1567.434s">Your</a>  choice did the exact opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1570.325s">Attending</a>  a big protest engenders a sense of camaraderie and hope that simply cannot be easily replicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1576.811s">I</a>  am proud of my daughter for the choice she made, ashamed of the school that forced her to do so, and saddened that she missed the opportunity to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1584.077s">I</a>  implore you in the future to find ways that the school can encourage students in activism and civic engagement not to, not be another barrier supporting the status quo. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1595.708s">And</a>  that was signed by Jen Lewis. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1599.813s">So</a>  I mean, I just feel like there was a middle ground here. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1604.554s">And</a>  the assertion that, I mean, let's be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1611.455s">The</a>  statement I just heard implies that Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, Arlington, and many other towns did not take into account the student safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1621.617s">That</a>  is a statement that is a direct, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1624.997s">can</a>  be followed directly from the statement that this was about their safety, which is in the letter that we received. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1631.881s">I</a>  don't believe that those superintendents and those districts truly don't care about the safety of their students and decided to do something they felt was going to risk their students' safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1644.329s">But</a>  as I said before, I'm not opposed to just leaving <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1648.684s">This</a>  to me is not about whether it's excused or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1650.965s">It's</a>  about whether the punitive measures are appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1655.147s">I'll</a>  let somebody else talk for a little bit.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1656.667s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1658.708s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1659.048s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1660.809s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1661.729s">So</a>  I thought about this a lot, and because I was disappointed that students who really would have liked to have gone to the March <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1672.054s">didn't</a>  go because they would have adversely affected their team because they're not allowed to take part in those activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1682.942s">But</a>  to me, while there was a question of timing, it happened quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1688.787s">We</a>  only knew about it, or I only knew about it the day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1692.75s">To</a>  me, this is a school committee policy question. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1696.485s">And</a>  to me, I feel like the administrative people probably are doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1702.112s">And</a>  now I have to step in and say, this is a policy question. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1705.816s">I</a>  think we need to look at the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1707.771s">I</a>  don't think that students should be penalized for attending a climate change march. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1713.696s">I'd</a>  love it to be an educational opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1716.758s">I</a>  would even consider some sort of, I mean, I agree with Paul that that distinction between excused and unexcused, perhaps we need to talk about that overall because I've had parents come to me <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1730.689s">with</a>  frustration about that policy in the bigger sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1736.093s">Because</a>  they say, you know, my kid was sick, but not so sick that they needed to go to the doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1741.496s">So</a>  I just put aside over to the left and say, we have a bigger question. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1747.3s">But</a>  I do believe it's a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1750.222s">So</a>  I'd like to make a motion that the school committee meet to discuss the absentee policy, especially in regards to outside events. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1760.567s">that</a>  students would like to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1762.829s">I</a>  think that if we can sit down around the table and come to a better way to handle this, that this would be better for our students, and then we wouldn't be putting our administrators, you know, holding them up with annoyance. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1779.704s">So,</a>  if I could.</p>
