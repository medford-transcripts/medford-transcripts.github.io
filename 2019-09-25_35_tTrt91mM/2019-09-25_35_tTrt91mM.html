    <p>[Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=139.073s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=140.274s">I'd</a>  like to bring up Joseph as I talk about his accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=147.161s">We've</a>  known Joseph for quite a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=155.15s">He's</a>  a 2017 graduate of Medford High School, attended the <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=159.983s">McGlynn</a>  Middle School and the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=162.904s">All</a>  right, see, I got my facts right. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=166.446s">And</a>  he, this past year, participated, or for a couple of years, has participated in the Event Horizon Telescope work, which was involved in looking at the black hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=181.793s">And</a>  this was <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=183.442s">pretty</a>  secret for a long while because there was a lot that we didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=187.992s">And</a>  then in, I want to say in April, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=192.941s">Of</a>  last year, the team released their data and showed us the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=201.227s">And</a>  they released six papers, six research papers with 347 members on the six papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=209.354s">Joseph</a>  is the only undergraduate named on all six papers, so I got my facts correct on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=218.04s">And</a>  he also <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=220.802s">contributed</a>  to, I think, three directly, and then had another, had one of the conferences that they were talking about the data that you had worked pretty hard on. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=234.205s">So</a>  at this point, we recognize Joseph because it has, the discovery, along with the other 346 researchers, has received a Breakthrough Prize, which, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=249.54s">carries</a>  more money than the Nobel, and it's the USA Nobel Prize, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=257.225s">So</a>  it's a really great honor for Medford to have one of its own so young to be part of that particular research project and contribute to it in such a meaningful way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=271.416s">I</a>  want to congratulate him personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=273.837s">He's</a>  a wonderful human being, a true Mustang, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=280.413s">And</a>  this is the kind of thing we love to see from our graduates, but also from the current students that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=291.303s">He's</a>  done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=292.163s">So</a>  congratulations, Joseph.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=300.819s">If</a>  I could formally read the report into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=303.601s">Medford</a>  High School alumnus of the class of 2017, Joseph Arai, is being recognized with the Science Breakthrough Prize, along with the 346 collaborators of the Event Horizon Telescope's incredible first picture of a black hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=317.829s">The</a>  team is equally splitting the award among all collaborators. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=321.091s">He</a>  is named on all six of the publications for the discovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=324.713s">Joseph</a>  is the only undergraduate student named as an author. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=328.035s">Unbelievable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=328.895s">Amazing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=330.378s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=333.922s">I</a>  should also add, he also goes to UMass Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=340.207s">So</a>  this is a really important kind of pipeline that I think our UMass system is developing for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=346.091s">So</a>  just all of these things from a public education perspective are so critical for the future of our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=354.798s">So</a>  hopefully this bodes well for the future of everything that's going on.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=360.56s">Joseph,</a>  could you step forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=362.481s">Mr.</a>  Cieri, please feel free to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=367.142s">Medford</a>  Public Schools is proud to recognize Joseph Hurrah for scientific contributions to the Event Horizon Telescope project. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=374.924s">On</a>  behalf of all the members of the Medford School Committee, congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=386.047s">Would</a>  you like to say something? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=392.417s">You</a>  can stand tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=393.297s">It'll</a>  catch you.</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=394.658s">My</a>  mom said I was going to be expected to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=397.76s">I</a>  didn't believe her. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=398.82s">Moms</a>  are always right. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=402.202s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=404.924s">I'd</a>  like to thank all the, especially the science department at Medford High, and all the teachers I've had throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=410.647s">They</a>  just supported me without question throughout everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=412.729s">And</a>  everyone in Medford deserves as much credit for the award as I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=419.292s">So</a>  thank you, everyone.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=427.199s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero?</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=428.362s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=429.544s">Thank</a>  you, Joseph. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=430.547s">Let</a>  me shake your hand.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=431.649s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=433.533s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=434.215s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=454.397s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=455.478s">I</a>  just wanted to say that when I originally saw the images online and I read about them in ScienceDaily.com when I first saw them, I was just blown away by the images. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=465.622s">And</a>  it's just really exciting for me to know that our hometown made a little contribution to that moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=471.385s">I'd</a>  just like to know, Joseph, can I ask you a couple of questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=473.966s">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=474.346s">Yeah,</a>  I'd just love to know, what in particular was your contribution to the project?</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=479.135s">So</a>  I contributed to three aspects of the project, imaging, modeling, and theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=484.602s">So</a>  imaging deals with taking the data, the raw data, and turning it into the image that you saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=491.071s">And</a>  on that end, I was on imaging team one. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=493.994s">I</a>  ran the imaging workshop where we created the first image. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=496.778s">and</a>  I created the comparison metrics that we used for the blind imaging algorithms. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=500.479s">For</a>  the modeling aspect, modeling is how we extract actual information about the black hole from the image, I designed ring image domain feature extraction methods that basically look at the image and in a non-biased manner can determine not just how large the ring is in its width, but its uncertainty in that measurement, and from that the mass of the black hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=521.162s">And</a>  on the theory end, I work on extending Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically the Kerr metric, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=526.563s">to</a>  come up with an alternate parameterization of the black hole shadow, which is how we determine everything we know about the black hole.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=533.601s">That's</a>  amazing.</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=534.361s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=536.343s">Absolutely</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=537.603s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=538.684s">Can</a>  you just help us understand why this is so special and why it's so difficult for, why this discovery hasn't been made before?</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=546.088s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=547.329s">So</a>  Einstein's theory of general relativity and the theory of quantum mechanics are the two most successful theories in physics and they're used to describe everything that we understand today from the very, very small to the very, very large. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=558.635s">But</a>  they have a flaw, which is that they don't work when the thing that you're looking at is both very, very small and very, very large. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=564.236s">And</a>  the only place we know where that happens is in a black hole past the event horizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=567.997s">And</a>  up until the image was released, there was no scientific evidence that black holes even existed and that this flaw was actually a real thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=575.598s">And</a>  so with the advent of the image came the first evidence of an event horizon in the universe, a place where our understanding of physics breaks down.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=583.88s">And</a>  can you tell us the location, how many light years away it is?</p>

    <p>[Farah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=586.202s">Yeah,</a>  so M87 is an elliptical galaxy 55 million light years away from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=590.085s">The</a>  light from the black hole travels 50,000 light years to escape the galaxy, then 50 million light years to us, and then another 100,000 or so to reach our portion of the Milky Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=599.892s">And</a>  then it had to survive, you know, 15, 16 miles of atmosphere, significant atmosphere, like the water column, to actually reach our telescopes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=607.557s">So</a>  it's an amazing, it's a basic piece of luck that any of the light made it to us at all.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.04s">That's</a>  absolutely amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.761s">For</a>  someone who's not prepared to speak, you certainly do know the topic very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=616.864s">It's</a>  very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=617.824s">I</a>  would like, I'm sure this invitation is already being extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=620.747s">The</a>  discovery was extraordinarily, I mean, was inspirational to me, and I'm sure a number of our other students would love to see your work and see some pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=628.092s">I</a>  imagine a number of science students were very excited about black holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=632.916s">I've</a>  never actually seen them, because my son's first word was actually black hole, because I subjected him to all the videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=640.221s">I</a>  think that there are a lot of students that would be really inspired by what you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=643.325s">Thank</a>  you so much for what. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=644.406s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.187s">Thank</a>  you all.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.948s">As</a>  I said to Joseph coming in, it's such an honor <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=659.248s">to</a>  know him. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=660.049s">And</a>  it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=661.349s">It's</a>  nothing new. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=662.39s">We're</a>  so excited over the years watching you grow and your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=666.392s">And</a>  thank you to the FARA parents as well, who have been so supportive, of course, of their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=672.596s">It's</a>  been so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=674.097s">And,</a>  you know, this is one of those moments, I think, that when I live a very long and healthy life, I'm going to say, I knew him when. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=683.943s">And</a>  it's just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=685.404s">So</a>  thank you so much, Joseph.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=691.539s">Ms.</a>  DiBenedetto.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=692.58s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=693.561s">Um,</a>  Joan, Joseph and I know each other very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=696.523s">His</a>  older sister was also a scientist and did many activities with my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=703.629s">So</a>  I saw him as a very young child and he always <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=708.168s">had</a>  this interest in science, and whatever he put his mind to, whether it was playing his instruments, or for Medford High School Orchestra, or following the girls around to the Broad when they did their internship there, I knew he was going to set off and do wonderful things. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=728.263s">I</a>  just thought it would take a little longer, Joseph, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=732.265s">So</a>  if this is the beginning, I can't wait to see what's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=735.726s">I'm</a>  very proud of you, for yourself, and for MedFed, and for all the teachers that have helped you along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=743.489s">And</a>  mostly because I know the two parents in this room are very similar to myself and my husband, and they're beaming with joy to see you here getting another award. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=754.053s">Because</a>  this isn't your first year, and I don't think it will be your last. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=757.383s">Welcome</a>  back to MEDFED. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=765.667s">So</a>  thanks for coming back to see us and keep coming back.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=779.403s">Next</a>  up, in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of Medford, Ron Morin, Executive Director of Friends of the Middlesex Fells Reservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=788.688s">The</a>  City of Medford is grateful to Mr. Ron Morin for his unfailing commitment to the preservation of the Middlesex Fells Reservation and for his immense contribution to the effort to protect against the development of the 90-millimeter meadow, a 13-acre section of Lawrence Woods <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=806.338s">for</a>  future generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=808.039s">The</a>  Medford School Committee recognizes Mr. Moran's outstanding leadership as the executive director of the Friends of the Fells Reservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=815.261s">By</a>  his own example, Ron demonstrates how to enjoy and protect our natural resources and in turn our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=822.664s">Through</a>  his generosity of time and spirit given to the citizens of Medford and the visitors of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, Ron teaches us to value and protect those resources which sustain and inspire us. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=834.788s">Mr.</a>  Moran, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=836.974s">He's</a>  the outgoing chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=841.337s">And</a>  so we didn't want this moment to go by without paying a tribute to you, because you were so instrumental in protecting the 90 millimeter site, which for those of us in Medford realize it could have been a hockey rink had others had their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=856.008s">So</a>  I wanted to personally thank you, and I know that it's so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=859.651s">We</a>  have all of the Fells walks that our science classes go to, and I'm sure Mr. Farrar had gone down a couple of those paths as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=867.179s">So</a>  it is a living laboratory that we appreciate and respect, and we know you do as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=872.985s">So</a>  in recognition of your outstanding service to the City of Medford, as Executive Director of the Friends of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, Ron Morin presented this day.</p>
