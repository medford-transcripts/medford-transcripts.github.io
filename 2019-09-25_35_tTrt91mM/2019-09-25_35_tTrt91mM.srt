[SPEAKER_05]: Item two, recognition of Joseph Farafa contributions to the event Horizon Telescope Project.

17
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:12,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Cieri is in the audience.

18
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:16,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see my card.

19
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,014
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, everyone.

20
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:26,140
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to bring up Joseph as I talk about his accomplishments.

21
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:35,109
[SPEAKER_19]: We've known Joseph for quite a number of years.

22
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,174
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a 2017 graduate of Medford High School, attended the

23
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:42,304
[SPEAKER_19]: McGlynn Middle School and the Brooks.

24
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:44,645
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, see, I got my facts right.

25
00:02:46,446 --> 00:03:01,332
[SPEAKER_19]: And he, this past year, participated, or for a couple of years, has participated in the Event Horizon Telescope work, which was involved in looking at the black hole.

26
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:02,193
[SPEAKER_19]: And this was

27
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,972
[SPEAKER_19]: pretty secret for a long while because there was a lot that we didn't know.

28
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:11,379
[SPEAKER_19]: And then in, I want to say in April,

29
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:20,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Of last year, the team released their data and showed us the picture.

30
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:28,333
[SPEAKER_19]: And they released six papers, six research papers with 347 members on the six papers.

31
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:35,578
[SPEAKER_19]: Joseph is the only undergraduate named on all six papers, so I got my facts correct on that.

32
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,041
[SPEAKER_19]: And he also

33
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:54,005
[SPEAKER_19]: contributed to, I think, three directly, and then had another, had one of the conferences that they were talking about the data that you had worked pretty hard on.

34
00:03:54,205 --> 00:04:08,208
[SPEAKER_19]: So at this point, we recognize Joseph because it has, the discovery, along with the other 346 researchers, has received a Breakthrough Prize, which,

35
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,444
[SPEAKER_19]: carries more money than the Nobel, and it's the USA Nobel Prize, in my opinion.

36
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:31,175
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a really great honor for Medford to have one of its own so young to be part of that particular research project and contribute to it in such a meaningful way.

37
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,037
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to congratulate him personally.

38
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:38,781
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a wonderful human being, a true Mustang,

39
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:50,782
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is the kind of thing we love to see from our graduates, but also from the current students that we have.

40
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:52,123
[SPEAKER_19]: He's done a great job.

41
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,585
[SPEAKER_19]: So congratulations, Joseph.

42
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,940
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could formally read the report into the record.

43
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:17,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford High School alumnus of the class of 2017, Joseph Arai, is being recognized with the Science Breakthrough Prize, along with the 346 collaborators of the Event Horizon Telescope's incredible first picture of a black hole.

44
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:20,650
[SPEAKER_05]: The team is equally splitting the award among all collaborators.

45
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:24,253
[SPEAKER_05]: He is named on all six of the publications for the discovery.

46
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:27,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Joseph is the only undergraduate student named as an author.

47
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:28,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Unbelievable.

48
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

49
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:30,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

50
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:39,046
[SPEAKER_19]: I should also add, he also goes to UMass Boston.

51
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:46,031
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is a really important kind of pipeline that I think our UMass system is developing for our students.

52
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:54,578
[SPEAKER_19]: So just all of these things from a public education perspective are so critical for the future of our country.

53
00:05:54,798 --> 00:06:00,062
[SPEAKER_19]: So hopefully this bodes well for the future of everything that's going on.

54
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Joseph, could you step forward?

55
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Cieri, please feel free to join.

56
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:14,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Joseph Hurrah for scientific contributions to the Event Horizon Telescope project.

57
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:18,405
[SPEAKER_05]: On behalf of all the members of the Medford School Committee, congratulations.

58
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to say something?

59
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,237
[SPEAKER_05]: You can stand tall.

60
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:33,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll catch you.

61
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:37,440
[SPEAKER_16]: My mom said I was going to be expected to say something.

62
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,800
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't believe her.

63
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Moms are always right.

64
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

65
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:50,207
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to thank all the, especially the science department at Medford High, and all the teachers I've had throughout the years.

66
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:52,709
[SPEAKER_16]: They just supported me without question throughout everything.

67
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:58,632
[SPEAKER_16]: And everyone in Medford deserves as much credit for the award as I do.

68
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,093
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you, everyone.

69
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Ruggiero?

70
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:08,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

71
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:10,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Joseph.

72
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:11,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me shake your hand.

73
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:13,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

74
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

75
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:14,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

76
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:35,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Mayor Burke.

77
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:45,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say that when I originally saw the images online and I read about them in ScienceDaily.com when I first saw them, I was just blown away by the images.

78
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:51,365
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just really exciting for me to know that our hometown made a little contribution to that moving forward.

79
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:53,406
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd just like to know, Joseph, can I ask you a couple of questions?

80
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:54,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sure.

81
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:57,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd just love to know, what in particular was your contribution to the project?

82
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:04,122
[SPEAKER_16]: So I contributed to three aspects of the project, imaging, modeling, and theory.

83
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:09,709
[SPEAKER_16]: So imaging deals with taking the data, the raw data, and turning it into the image that you saw.

84
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,974
[SPEAKER_16]: And on that end, I was on imaging team one.

85
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,398
[SPEAKER_16]: I ran the imaging workshop where we created the first image.

86
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:19,959
[SPEAKER_16]: and I created the comparison metrics that we used for the blind imaging algorithms.

87
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:40,842
[SPEAKER_16]: For the modeling aspect, modeling is how we extract actual information about the black hole from the image, I designed ring image domain feature extraction methods that basically look at the image and in a non-biased manner can determine not just how large the ring is in its width, but its uncertainty in that measurement, and from that the mass of the black hole.

88
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:46,043
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the theory end, I work on extending Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically the Kerr metric,

89
00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:53,216
[SPEAKER_16]: to come up with an alternate parameterization of the black hole shadow, which is how we determine everything we know about the black hole.

90
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,221
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.

91
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:54,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

92
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:57,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely amazing.

93
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

94
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:05,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you just help us understand why this is so special and why it's so difficult for, why this discovery hasn't been made before?

95
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:06,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course.

96
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:18,215
[SPEAKER_16]: So Einstein's theory of general relativity and the theory of quantum mechanics are the two most successful theories in physics and they're used to describe everything that we understand today from the very, very small to the very, very large.

97
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:23,796
[SPEAKER_16]: But they have a flaw, which is that they don't work when the thing that you're looking at is both very, very small and very, very large.

98
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:27,657
[SPEAKER_16]: And the only place we know where that happens is in a black hole past the event horizon.

99
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:34,558
[SPEAKER_16]: And up until the image was released, there was no scientific evidence that black holes even existed and that this flaw was actually a real thing.

100
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:42,340
[SPEAKER_16]: And so with the advent of the image came the first evidence of an event horizon in the universe, a place where our understanding of physics breaks down.

101
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And can you tell us the location, how many light years away it is?

102
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:49,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so M87 is an elliptical galaxy 55 million light years away from us.

103
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:59,852
[SPEAKER_16]: The light from the black hole travels 50,000 light years to escape the galaxy, then 50 million light years to us, and then another 100,000 or so to reach our portion of the Milky Way.

104
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:07,257
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it had to survive, you know, 15, 16 miles of atmosphere, significant atmosphere, like the water column, to actually reach our telescopes.

105
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:11,119
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's an amazing, it's a basic piece of luck that any of the light made it to us at all.

106
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,741
[SPEAKER_10]: That's absolutely amazing.

107
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:16,523
[SPEAKER_10]: For someone who's not prepared to speak, you certainly do know the topic very well.

108
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:17,364
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very clear.

109
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:20,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like, I'm sure this invitation is already being extended.

110
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:27,492
[SPEAKER_10]: The discovery was extraordinarily, I mean, was inspirational to me, and I'm sure a number of our other students would love to see your work and see some pictures.

111
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:32,155
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine a number of science students were very excited about black holes.

112
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:39,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never actually seen them, because my son's first word was actually black hole, because I subjected him to all the videos.

113
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:43,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that there are a lot of students that would be really inspired by what you've done.

114
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:44,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for what.

115
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:45,147
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate it.

116
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:45,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all.

117
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:54,478
[SPEAKER_13]: As I said to Joseph coming in, it's such an honor

118
00:10:59,248 --> 00:10:59,909
[SPEAKER_13]: to know him.

119
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,289
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was.

120
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:02,090
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nothing new.

121
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,192
[SPEAKER_13]: We're so excited over the years watching you grow and your family.

122
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:12,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you to the FARA parents as well, who have been so supportive, of course, of their kids.

123
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:13,597
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been so great.

124
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:23,363
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, this is one of those moments, I think, that when I live a very long and healthy life, I'm going to say, I knew him when.

125
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:25,384
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just great.

126
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:26,605
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you so much, Joseph.

127
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:32,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms. DiBenedetto.

128
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

129
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:36,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Joan, Joseph and I know each other very well.

130
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:43,289
[SPEAKER_03]: His older sister was also a scientist and did many activities with my daughter.

131
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:47,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So I saw him as a very young child and he always

132
00:11:48,168 --> 00:12:07,923
[SPEAKER_03]: had this interest in science, and whatever he put his mind to, whether it was playing his instruments, or for Medford High School Orchestra, or following the girls around to the Broad when they did their internship there, I knew he was going to set off and do wonderful things.

133
00:12:08,263 --> 00:12:11,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it would take a little longer, Joseph, to be honest.

134
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this is the beginning, I can't wait to see what's next.

135
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:23,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very proud of you, for yourself, and for MedFed, and for all the teachers that have helped you along the way.

136
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:34,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And mostly because I know the two parents in this room are very similar to myself and my husband, and they're beaming with joy to see you here getting another award.

137
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this isn't your first year, and I don't think it will be your last.

138
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:43,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to MEDFED.

139
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for coming back to see us and keep coming back.

140
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:49,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

141
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

142
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:07,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of Medford, Ron Morin, Executive Director of Friends of the Middlesex Fells Reservation.

143
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:25,938
[SPEAKER_05]: The City of Medford is grateful to Mr. Ron Morin for his unfailing commitment to the preservation of the Middlesex Fells Reservation and for his immense contribution to the effort to protect against the development of the 90-millimeter meadow, a 13-acre section of Lawrence Woods

144
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,418
[SPEAKER_05]: for future generations.

145
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:34,581
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford School Committee recognizes Mr. Moran's outstanding leadership as the executive director of the Friends of the Fells Reservation.

146
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:41,983
[SPEAKER_05]: By his own example, Ron demonstrates how to enjoy and protect our natural resources and in turn our quality of life.

147
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:54,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Through his generosity of time and spirit given to the citizens of Medford and the visitors of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, Ron teaches us to value and protect those resources which sustain and inspire us.

148
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:55,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Moran,

149
00:13:56,974 --> 00:14:01,177
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the outgoing chair.

150
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:15,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we didn't want this moment to go by without paying a tribute to you, because you were so instrumental in protecting the 90 millimeter site, which for those of us in Medford realize it could have been a hockey rink had others had their way.

151
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:19,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to personally thank you, and I know that it's so important.

152
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:26,719
[SPEAKER_05]: We have all of the Fells walks that our science classes go to, and I'm sure Mr. Farrar had gone down a couple of those paths as well.

153
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:32,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a living laboratory that we appreciate and respect, and we know you do as well.

154
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:41,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So in recognition of your outstanding service to the City of Medford, as Executive Director of the Friends of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, Ron Morin presented this day.

155
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:50,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

156
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:55,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that I don't think I could have done it without the mayor, actually.

157
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:02,055
[SPEAKER_00]: We organized the community, but I have to say the city of Medford really got behind us.

158
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:11,883
[SPEAKER_00]: In the signatures that we raised, the petition that we had signed, over 1,000 people from Medford signed that signature.

159
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:13,884
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very, very significant.

160
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:17,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Of all the communities around here, Medford was number one.

161
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:27,025
[SPEAKER_00]: When Mayor Burke and Stephanie Burke got behind us, that really was a tipping point in our battle with DCR.

162
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:35,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And her authority in this was really what moved, I think, the commissioner to move in our direction.

163
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:37,630
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the award.

164
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do it alone, though.

165
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:41,151
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of really good people helping me.

166
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

167
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:20,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

168
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff, would you like to say a few words?

169
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up to you.

170
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:31,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you asked.

171
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:33,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address, please, for our record.

172
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:36,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Buxbaum, 31 Hillcroft Park, Medford.

173
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron joined us a couple of years ago as an interim director to help us through a transition that we were going through.

174
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:48,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And he stayed on for an extra year permanently until he decided to retire again.

175
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:54,864
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the 90-millimeter Meadow fight came up, he just sort of got energized.

176
00:16:54,964 --> 00:17:03,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was great to begin with, but really he was just ready for that fight and really helped mobilize all the communities, you know, got all the different people on board.

177
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:09,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was probably the biggest contribution, and we really appreciate him for that and everything else he did for us.

178
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:11,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for everything you do as well, Jack.

179
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

180
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:21,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, while we're under suspension, report on climate strike communication, Dr. Cushing.

181
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening members of the committee and members of the public.

182
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:44,754
[SPEAKER_11]: So as many of you know Greta Thunberg is a 16 year old Swedish activist who last year as a 15 year old stood outside with a poster board that translated into English strike for climate.

183
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:50,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And this has moved into a worldwide movement and she is the world's newest climate warrior.

184
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:55,898
[SPEAKER_11]: And she asked for students across the world to participate in acts of civil disobedience this past Friday.

185
00:17:56,628 --> 00:18:02,692
[SPEAKER_11]: and to participate in climate strikes, to walk out of class, and to participate in rallies.

186
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:06,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Boston was one of many places around the world that held such rallies.

187
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:13,599
[SPEAKER_11]: She has made such quotes that I've shared in the document provided to you.

188
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,541
[SPEAKER_11]: that the one thing we need more than hope is action.

189
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:18,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we act, hope is everywhere.

190
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:20,902
[SPEAKER_11]: So instead of looking for hope, look for action.

191
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:23,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Then and only then will hope come.

192
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:33,465
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Thunberg also said to the House of Representatives just last week, action does not require the permission of an excused absence, sorry, those are my words.

193
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:39,306
[SPEAKER_11]: If there is anything I can do to improve the situation, then I think it's a very small price to pay.

194
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,847
[SPEAKER_11]: When we were meeting and discussing the,

195
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:53,179
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation really focused around civil disobedience and giving students the opportunity to have that voice, but not excusing absences.

196
00:18:54,019 --> 00:19:01,322
[SPEAKER_11]: The reality is, is that climate change, 97% of scientists agree, yet only approximately 50% of the population agrees with.

197
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:09,946
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that we all stand on the side of science and we were looking for and hoping that students would make the sacrifice necessary.

198
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:20,936
[SPEAKER_11]: that whatever an unexcused absence may carry with it, that students would realize that, as she said today to the United Nations, now is the time for panic, all right?

199
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:33,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And given those types of things, we hope that students approach us, their leaders, their teachers, myself, their principals, whoever, to address these issues.

200
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:38,130
[SPEAKER_11]: We did not look at this climate change strike as an issue of climate change.

201
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:59,893
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we approved unexcused absences for this, then every rally, be it for good and noble reasons, or be it for the ignoble, nefarious, and detestable reasons that may go directly against the core values of Medford and Medford Public Schools, we would then be beholden to excuse absences for.

202
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:06,367
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's one of the main reasons why we stuck with our position of not excusing absences.

203
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:12,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when hate shows up at our doorstep, we would be beholden to excuse absences.

204
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:14,316
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no denying

205
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:15,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Climate change.

206
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:33,374
[SPEAKER_11]: As people in the Bahamas are searching for their loved ones, as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans is still a memory that is still raw and real for many Americans, Harvey, name the storms, Maria, that devastated our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico.

207
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,598
[SPEAKER_11]: But as Greta Thunberg said, action is needed.

208
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,202
[SPEAKER_11]: And we call upon our students to do that without an excused absence.

209
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,616
[SPEAKER_11]: This is bigger than excused absence.

210
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:52,241
[SPEAKER_11]: And our concern was the next time that hate shows up at our doorstep.

211
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:59,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have to excuse absences for things that are detestable and that may go against our core values.

212
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

213
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:04,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Russo.

214
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for that.

215
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:10,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to start at the end a bit.

216
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:15,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any national conversation around hate rallies that students are leaving school for?

217
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:22,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this is completely new to me and sounds a bit like backing into a decision that was made.

218
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:27,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I've not heard of any of these hate rallies coming up anywhere in our country.

219
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think they would make the news?

220
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So a few weeks ago in Boston, there was a rally.

221
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:39,389
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a march that stood contrary to the beliefs of many people in this country in West Virginia two years ago.

222
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,534
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a hate march that left one dead and several injured when somebody decided to drive their car into a crowd.

223
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:49,037
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that was the light in which we looked at this.

224
00:21:49,617 --> 00:22:00,687
[SPEAKER_11]: The reality is that we have to be concerned about our students' safety for the lowest common denominator and for the things that may be unthinkable.

225
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:10,380
[SPEAKER_11]: And trust me, we believe climate change is real and that the realities of a changing world and a changing planet are upon us.

226
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:22,009
[SPEAKER_09]: If you call in sick on a Friday, does Medford Public Schools have a policy that tells you what you can and cannot do on Saturday and Sunday?

227
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:25,512
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I were to call in sick on Friday,

228
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd better be sick because otherwise it would be an abusive sick time.

229
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:32,516
[SPEAKER_11]: For whatever reason you don't show up.

230
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:39,662
[SPEAKER_11]: For personal time I would say that Medford Public Schools does not have a policy but I'm not 100% familiar with our policies at this point.

231
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:43,406
[SPEAKER_09]: No I'm talking about anybody who works for our district.

232
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:47,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I know for my own job if I call in because I need a mental health day or

233
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:57,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, you know, for whatever reason I decide not to go to work, my employer has no rules about what I'm allowed to do on the weekend after that Friday.

234
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,144
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to be clear.

235
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:02,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there was some confusion with some people I've talked to.

236
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:06,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have no issue with whether this is an excused or unexcused.

237
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the administration should make that decision.

238
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:17,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe it should be the policy of the Medford Public Schools that we do not take and then provide punitive measures that extend outside of the school hours.

239
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:18,877
[SPEAKER_09]: to our students.

240
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:24,180
[SPEAKER_09]: There is not some huge problem based on our absences that we have reported to DESE.

241
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:25,701
[SPEAKER_09]: We are perfectly fine.

242
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:27,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We are in the regular range of nine and a half.

243
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:37,848
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do not have a problem of kids skipping school who are then wanting to go, like the band kids are all going to school.

244
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:40,049
[SPEAKER_09]: And so are the football kids.

245
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:47,673
[SPEAKER_09]: And the natural, when I was an elementary school parent, there was this huge emphasis on natural consequences.

246
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,702
[SPEAKER_09]: The natural consequence, if you don't go to work, you don't get paid or you use your sick time.

247
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:59,285
[SPEAKER_09]: The natural consequence, if you don't go to school and it's unexcused, if the teacher doesn't let you make up the test, then you don't get a grade.

248
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:11,750
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's an unnatural consequence to then penalize those students that participate in extracurriculars, whether it's football or band, to then take away those things from all of their teammates.

249
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:17,613
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, it is actually abusive to have the pressure that these students were put on

250
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:25,672
[SPEAKER_09]: on Friday morning and told, you're going to ruin this band performance for all of Medford.

251
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:30,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I don't think that the person who put that message out did anything wrong.

252
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:33,698
[SPEAKER_09]: The wrong thing was that they actually would be penalized for that.

253
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:38,362
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I may, I have a letter from a parent that couldn't make it.

254
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:39,523
[SPEAKER_09]: May I read it?

255
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:40,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly.

256
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:43,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is from Jen Lewis.

257
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:45,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, I don't have her address right here, but I'll get that.

258
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:52,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear School Committee, I am deeply disappointed at MPS's decision to maintain last Friday as an unexcused absence.

259
00:24:53,553 --> 00:25:08,378
[SPEAKER_09]: My daughter, Laura Lewis, 10th grade MHS, is a Color Guard member, and while she cares deeply about climate change and would have liked to go to the march on Friday, she chose to attend school since to get an unexcused absence would have kept her from being part of the annual home show this weekend.

260
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:15,400
[SPEAKER_09]: As some of you may be aware, it is their largest event of the year, and the kids were strongly admonished not to let the ban down.

261
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:31,073
[SPEAKER_09]: MPS could easily have paved the way for more students to attend by keeping them from having to choose between speaking out with hundreds of thousands of people around the world versus abandoning your team when you have all worked hard for a big event since June.

262
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:38,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of our surrounding districts chose to allow students to protest at this event without punitive measures, and MPS could have done the same.

263
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:44,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, knowing the effect it would have on students who were part of weekend activities,

264
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:51,969
[SPEAKER_09]: You chose to allow a state data point to take precedence over encouraging civic participation and free thought among our student body.

265
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:56,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Climate change continues to worsen because our government refuses to take action to change it.

266
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:01,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Maintaining the status quo, not rocking the boat, has gotten us where we are.

267
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:06,774
[SPEAKER_09]: We must speak out, we must protest, and we must encourage and support our children to do the same.

268
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:09,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Your choice did the exact opposite.

269
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:16,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Attending a big protest engenders a sense of camaraderie and hope that simply cannot be easily replicated.

270
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:23,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I am proud of my daughter for the choice she made, ashamed of the school that forced her to do so, and saddened that she missed the opportunity to be there.

271
00:26:24,077 --> 00:26:34,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I implore you in the future to find ways that the school can encourage students in activism and civic engagement not to, not be another barrier supporting the status quo.

272
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was signed by Jen Lewis.

273
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:43,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, I just feel like there was a middle ground here.

274
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:50,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And the assertion that, I mean, let's be clear.

275
00:26:51,455 --> 00:27:01,237
[SPEAKER_09]: The statement I just heard implies that Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, Arlington, and many other towns did not take into account the student safety.

276
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:04,058
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a statement that is a direct,

277
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:10,861
[SPEAKER_09]: can be followed directly from the statement that this was about their safety, which is in the letter that we received.

278
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:22,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe that those superintendents and those districts truly don't care about the safety of their students and decided to do something they felt was going to risk their students' safety.

279
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,171
[SPEAKER_09]: But as I said before, I'm not opposed to just leaving

280
00:27:28,684 --> 00:27:30,885
[SPEAKER_09]: This to me is not about whether it's excused or not.

281
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:34,706
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about whether the punitive measures are appropriate.

282
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:36,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let somebody else talk for a little bit.

283
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:37,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

284
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:39,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

285
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:39,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Van der Kloot.

286
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:41,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

287
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:51,313
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought about this a lot, and because I was disappointed that students who really would have liked to have gone to the March

288
00:27:52,054 --> 00:28:02,442
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't go because they would have adversely affected their team because they're not allowed to take part in those activities.

289
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:08,506
[SPEAKER_13]: But to me, while there was a question of timing, it happened quickly.

290
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,228
[SPEAKER_13]: We only knew about it, or I only knew about it the day before.

291
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,831
[SPEAKER_13]: To me, this is a school committee policy question.

292
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:21,872
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, I feel like the administrative people probably are doing their job.

293
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:25,756
[SPEAKER_13]: And now I have to step in and say, this is a policy question.

294
00:28:25,816 --> 00:28:27,178
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to look at the policy.

295
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:33,155
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that students should be penalized for attending a climate change march.

296
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:36,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd love it to be an educational opportunity.

297
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:50,069
[SPEAKER_13]: I would even consider some sort of, I mean, I agree with Paul that that distinction between excused and unexcused, perhaps we need to talk about that overall because I've had parents come to me

298
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:55,112
[SPEAKER_13]: with frustration about that policy in the bigger sense.

299
00:28:56,093 --> 00:29:01,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they say, you know, my kid was sick, but not so sick that they needed to go to the doctor.

300
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:07,020
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just put aside over to the left and say, we have a bigger question.

301
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,661
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do believe it's a policy.

302
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:18,728
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to make a motion that the school committee meet to discuss the absentee policy, especially in regards to outside events.

303
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,409
[SPEAKER_13]: that students would like to participate in.

304
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:39,644
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that if we can sit down around the table and come to a better way to handle this, that this would be better for our students, and then we wouldn't be putting our administrators, you know, holding them up with annoyance.

305
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:40,665
[SPEAKER_13]: So, if I could.

306
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:40,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

307
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:41,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second on the motion?

308
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Mr. Russo.

309
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:43,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

310
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:44,168
[SPEAKER_05]: van de Kloot.

311
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:45,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

312
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:45,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Kreatz.

313
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:46,833
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yes.

314
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:50,395
[SPEAKER_20]: So I was thinking, I heard from Mr. Russo and Ms.

315
00:29:50,415 --> 00:30:05,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Van der Kloot, and so I was wondering, I was thinking that in the future, if we knew early enough, could we plan like a civic field trip where maybe one of the teachers could go along with the students and go into town with parent permission

316
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:16,937
[SPEAKER_20]: to go into the strike or, you know, the protest with adult supervision and as long as they had their parental permissions.

317
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,038
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would say the answer to that should be yes.

318
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo made me aware of the climate strike about 10 days beforehand based on email.

319
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:31,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I then went to our nursing staff and other members of our high school to see if we could make that happen.

320
00:30:31,828 --> 00:30:40,075
[SPEAKER_11]: That turnaround time was pretty tight, given where forms may or may not be at the start of the year, kids getting things back, those types of things.

321
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:43,998
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would say most definitely that, but

322
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:50,925
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing, too, to think about here is also we need to find a way to engender student leadership on these issues.

323
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:58,792
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what Greta, if I can be so bold as to use her first name, that's what Greta is really talking about.

324
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:08,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched her speech today and she was basically holding back tears of anger as she said, how dare you to the United Nations, calling on her peer group

325
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:13,122
[SPEAKER_11]: and the adults as well to stand up and to start doing these types of things.

326
00:31:13,182 --> 00:31:15,644
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I encourage students to come to me or to go to their principal.

327
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's find a way to make these things a reality.

328
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:25,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's find a way to make us more green so that we are actually taking action and that we move beyond conversation.

329
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:29,597
[SPEAKER_11]: But I agree with you that yes, we can definitely work to make that happen.

330
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:32,980
[SPEAKER_20]: And do you know how many students

331
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,942
[SPEAKER_20]: do we know if any students attended the strike that day?

332
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:40,063
[SPEAKER_20]: Another parent had asked me, she said, do you know how many students?

333
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:42,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Or we don't know.

334
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:44,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Our attendance was off about a percentage point.

335
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:49,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe our average daily attendance prior to that day was about 97%.

336
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:58,351
[SPEAKER_11]: On that day, I looked it up with Mr. DeLeva, and our attendance was at about 95.8, I believe.

337
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,332
[SPEAKER_11]: But I might be off on the point.

338
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:01,012
Okay.

339
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:12,502
[SPEAKER_20]: And do you know if during the day were there discussions maybe at, you know, at civic class or history class to just talk about the climate strike with the students?

340
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:17,302
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just, I also received that question from parents, like did they actually engage in discussion?

341
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,922
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have sent out resources to teachers to do that.

342
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I have heard from teachers that yes, that discussion was there.

343
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:29,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I have, uh, heard from teachers that I've heard from, um, the principal that there was, I have not heard from teachers.

344
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:39,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard from, uh, the principal that there was robust discussion, um, that students were actually, um, seeing the policy as seeing our stance on it as well.

345
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,347
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an opportunity for civil disobedience.

346
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a moment to do such a thing.

347
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:55,345
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also remember a quote on Friday itself of a Brookline student who talked about walking out at the 1045 bell, I think it was.

348
00:32:55,365 --> 00:33:03,088
[SPEAKER_11]: The quote is in the Boston Globe, 14-year-old student by the name of Jordan, who talked about understanding that there were consequences for walking out.

349
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:09,110
[SPEAKER_11]: We did not consequence kids in that sense of whatever they might do.

350
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:18,873
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we did, what he said was, or she, I forget, honestly, but the comment was that the consequence to not act is too much.

351
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:26,366
[SPEAKER_11]: And so had students done that, I think that teachers would have been supportive, teachers were supportive.

352
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:35,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I know based on what the principals have told me that there were conversations had and that the humanities classes really led that.

353
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:44,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Other resources have been provided to teachers throughout this week and climate change week does go through Friday as well.

354
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:58,622
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just had one more, because I know, I think it was last year, where there was a walk-in, where the students didn't actually walk out, but they were allowed to walk into the gymnasium or the cafeteria for about 10 to 15 minutes.

355
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:01,003
[SPEAKER_20]: It was like a safe walk, where they could do that.

356
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:09,927
[SPEAKER_20]: That was another idea that we could do if the students still wanted to have a strike, they could do it within the school at a certain time.

357
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,648
[SPEAKER_20]: But that was just a suggestion.

358
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:14,389
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

359
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:17,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Ruggiero.

360
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

361
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:19,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the paper.

362
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:22,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a couple of questions about excused absences.

363
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:33,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's assume for a moment we had a child with extraordinary abilities, perhaps they were like a chess master at a very young age, and they had a tournament to attend and it conflicted with school hours.

364
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:38,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Would that student be able to receive an excused absence to attend a tournament?

365
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:42,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Not having the policy directly in front of me.

366
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:44,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I really can't speak to it.

367
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:49,908
[SPEAKER_11]: If I had the policy in front of me and could speak to it, I would be happy to.

368
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,131
[SPEAKER_10]: But I assume the administration wouldn't penalize a child.

369
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:56,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's interesting because that's, generally speaking, that's a non-school event.

370
00:34:57,156 --> 00:35:01,960
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so I'm going to speak in generalities here, having been a principal before and vice principal.

371
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,143
[SPEAKER_11]: So generally speaking, that would be not considered an excused absence.

372
00:35:06,644 --> 00:35:16,133
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the faculty and staff working with would probably see that as an opportunity to provide that student opportunities to make up the work and to not hold that harm.

373
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:20,475
[SPEAKER_11]: against them when it comes to sports and after school activities.

374
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:25,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Generally speaking, though, that might be something that requires a principal's dispensation.

375
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:31,560
[SPEAKER_11]: So most attendance policies are written with the ability of the principal to give a dispensation for some special reason.

376
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:43,705
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's say, hypothetically, the student is out for more than half a day, that the principal gives their blessing to allow them to participate in after school activities.

377
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:46,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just sports, not just band, but anything.

378
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:47,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

379
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:54,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm slightly disappointed by the stance our schools took for a couple of reasons.

380
00:35:54,047 --> 00:36:03,492
[SPEAKER_10]: While I certainly understand member Vander Kloot's thought that we need to review the policy and change the policy and perhaps the direction that we should move forward.

381
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:11,056
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole point of this walkout is to draw attention to the fact that adults aren't solving this problem.

382
00:36:11,756 --> 00:36:22,461
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fact of the matter is that by not sort of excusing these absences, we're actually providing almost proof to that.

383
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:24,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, it's more important for you to go

384
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:31,249
[SPEAKER_10]: practice with your color than deal with the fact that the oceans might rise by a couple of feet in a couple of years.

385
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,736
[SPEAKER_10]: That is, I think, ultimately what disappoints me the most about the school's proposition.

386
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:45,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, to sort of echo what member Ruseau mentioned, we would not excuse students to attend a hate rally.

387
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:46,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

388
00:36:46,746 --> 00:37:03,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's, that, no, it's not the question, just like a child who is a chess prodigy, we'd all get together and say, you know, this kid's doing well in school, we'll make sure they make up their material, or a child that's going to Spain, perhaps, we'll make sure that they make up their material, they won't miss any schoolwork, and we'll give them excused absences.

389
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:07,143
[SPEAKER_10]: That position could have been taken here.

390
00:37:08,504 --> 00:37:10,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess that's what I find

391
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:15,105
[SPEAKER_10]: There is wiggle, I mean, once again, we don't have the policy at hand.

392
00:37:15,445 --> 00:37:23,528
[SPEAKER_10]: But we as a community, as a country and a world, have to recognize that there are things that are more important than words written on paper.

393
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:32,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to, if we have the capacity to, just like I'm sure in Boston, they don't have a only climate activism is excused.

394
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:36,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And just sort of one last point in this regard.

395
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:38,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I also think it's a little,

396
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:42,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't necessarily know whether teachers should be there.

397
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:50,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean part of the idea of this walkout is for students to express their anger and frustration about what we as adults are doing.

398
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:56,859
[SPEAKER_10]: You know and we all share responsibility in what's happening in our world right now.

399
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that these are important things to keep in mind.

400
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:05,699
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of the excused absence, I think we can call it what we like.

401
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,800
[SPEAKER_10]: We should not penalize these students.

402
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,760
[SPEAKER_10]: We should excuse these absences.

403
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:16,862
[SPEAKER_10]: People should not be made to feel like, oh, I have to choose between my world or a bunch of kids I play football with that I really love.

404
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,222
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a fair choice.

405
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:19,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

406
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:21,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

407
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:22,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone.

408
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:23,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

409
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:28,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to ask if Member Van der Kloot would amend her motion to send it to the policy subcommittee.

410
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:30,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

411
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:31,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Could I make?

412
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:32,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

413
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:34,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Policy subcommittee.

414
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:35,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you accept the amendment?

415
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:36,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

416
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:36,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Member?

417
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:37,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

418
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:40,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we go along that motion?

419
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,402
[SPEAKER_05]: We will as soon as Mr. Russo has one more.

420
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:43,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't make all night.

421
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:44,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Russo?

422
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:44,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

423
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:53,090
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a conversation I've had several times over the last week, even before the strike, about the idea that this is civil disobedience.

424
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:55,872
[SPEAKER_09]: It certainly is civil disobedience.

425
00:38:56,033 --> 00:39:00,176
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my issue with giving children the same consequences

426
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,602
[SPEAKER_09]: that the rest of us in this room would have, they do not have the same rights as us.

427
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:06,022
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't.

428
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:07,863
[SPEAKER_09]: The Supreme Court's crystal clear.

429
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:14,246
[SPEAKER_09]: So why should they suffer the same consequences as us when they take an action such as civil disobedience?

430
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:22,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that those, I kind of have trouble getting from the, you do civil disobedience, you get the consequences, whatever they are.

431
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:24,970
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine, I'm a grown up and I can,

432
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:26,692
[SPEAKER_09]: make that decision.

433
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:31,059
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I don't have all the same, if somebody doesn't have all the same rights, I just don't think that is a fair proposition.

434
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:35,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is, I think, everything I wanted to say.

435
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:59,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we have a member of the public that would like to speak your name and address please yes, I'm on Anna Nowogrodzki I live at 20 Pleasant Street in Medford I'm a Medford parent and I'm here representing my husband and myself my husband took our two-year-old out because he's a two-year-old and

436
00:40:00,592 --> 00:40:04,555
[SPEAKER_17]: And my friend Carrie Thorderson as well, who also lives in Medford.

437
00:40:06,577 --> 00:40:14,463
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm disappointed with the school's handling of this, as various points have been made already.

438
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:33,740
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that firstly, allowing students to miss school without punishment for the climate strike would absolutely not make you beholden to excuse them for other absences.

439
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:44,003
[SPEAKER_17]: you are the administration, you have the authority to excuse what you like and not excuse what you don't choose to excuse.

440
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:49,065
[SPEAKER_17]: So that argument does not seem to make any logical sense to me.

441
00:40:51,505 --> 00:40:52,766
[SPEAKER_17]: And in addition,

442
00:40:54,826 --> 00:41:07,092
[SPEAKER_17]: That argument would be saying that Somerville, Arlington, and Cambridge and Boston Public Schools would all be planning to excuse their children to attend hate rallies in the future, which is clearly not true.

443
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:09,573
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I think that...

444
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:25,214
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a logical fallacy, as well as what Paul mentioned, that children don't have the same rights as adults.

445
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Children can't vote.

446
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:30,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Children don't have the power to collective bargaining.

447
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,843
[SPEAKER_17]: There are many things that adults have that children don't.

448
00:41:37,302 --> 00:42:05,073
[SPEAKER_17]: there's a fallacy that students need to defy your school administration in order for their protest to be meaningful, while I think that students defying global leaders, the US government, and the entire UN is meaningful enough and is a huge enough deck to have stacked against them that they don't need to also have your policies stacked against them.

449
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:26,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Finally, I would say that when people of any kind work for justice, obstacles are always going to stand in their way, but I think we are beholden to them not to be those obstacles and to treat those obstacles as if we have no power over them when we are in fact making them is irresponsible and disingenuous.

450
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:32,123
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that is especially true of our own children and the children of our community in Medford.

451
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:33,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

452
00:42:34,124 --> 00:42:34,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

453
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:36,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

454
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:36,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

455
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:44,011
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to be clear that by asking to send this to the policy committee, it's not because in any way that I agree with it.

456
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,233
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't agree with the choice.

457
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:53,218
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just because I'm taking the power that we have as school committee members, and that is to make and set policy.

458
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:57,481
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's the way that we can go about it and craft what we

459
00:42:58,582 --> 00:42:59,923
[SPEAKER_13]: will agree on.

460
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:12,890
[SPEAKER_13]: I also just want to mention in all of this, the one thing that I kept on thinking about was that lovely young lady that came to us last spring, wanting to bring to our attention her frustration with the styrofoam trays.

461
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:24,316
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think now it's September, and I know we're working on it, but yet it doesn't feel like

462
00:43:25,512 --> 00:43:32,237
[SPEAKER_13]: we're really concerned enough, because if we're concerned enough, then price wouldn't be a matter, and we would get reusable trays.

463
00:43:32,257 --> 00:43:38,801
[SPEAKER_13]: I was at Tufts yesterday, at the Tufts Community Day, and I noticed all the plates were, they're recycled paper.

464
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:50,350
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm concerned that our own body isn't feeling the pressure enough, that we're gonna get to it,

465
00:43:51,957 --> 00:43:53,678
[SPEAKER_13]: but we're not getting to it fast enough.

466
00:43:54,018 --> 00:44:03,104
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that it's up to us when we have a student like this, and we all agreed, we all agreed what we should do, that we should make it happen, not wait until it happens.

467
00:44:04,384 --> 00:44:04,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

468
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:05,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Vandekloot.

469
00:44:06,385 --> 00:44:07,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Rochero.

470
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:11,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I support where member Vander Kloot is going with this.

471
00:44:11,928 --> 00:44:14,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to offer a friendly suggestion or two amendment.

472
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:22,272
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to excuse the 1% of students right now that did not attend school on that day.

473
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:24,653
[SPEAKER_10]: The 1% that you said there was a dip.

474
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:28,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to excuse all students that did not attend school that day.

475
00:44:29,946 --> 00:44:50,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that makes more sense than, if we're going to start actually beginning to take action on what's happening on climate, I think then we have to recognize in talking about policy, about which students need to be excused when, I don't necessarily think that, that addresses the issue to the spirit of what the students are trying to protest.

476
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:53,778
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to stand behind them in any way possible, and this is the way I think we can do it.

477
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:26,168
[SPEAKER_13]: It may be trickier than you think because the excused and unexcused, I mean, I'm not sure that matters as much as, and I don't think we can go back and unfortunately change the fact that the real issue was they couldn't participate in their extracurriculars if they went.

478
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:33,023
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what is at the real meat of this, is that that's what the problem was.

479
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not certain.

480
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:55,940
[SPEAKER_13]: So just as I try to think about this and I may need some help from the administration here of saying we could ask students if they went to the climate change on Friday, I guess that's how we would identify who went as opposed to who was sick or who was whatever.

481
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not quite sure.

482
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,082
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we kind of need to look at our policy.

483
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:03,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not against it, Michael.

484
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:05,464
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just not quite sure how to do it.

485
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:16,339
[SPEAKER_13]: We could, it doesn't have to be decided tonight, we could go to that policy, the policy subcommittee and we could discuss it there and it could be retroactive.

486
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:17,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that be okay?

487
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:28,902
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a motion on the floor to send this policy on absenteeism, send it to the policy subcommittee and seconded by Mr. Russo.

488
00:46:28,942 --> 00:46:30,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Mr. Russo seconded that already.

489
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:33,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can, we can work through it there.

490
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:36,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the policy is the policy.

491
00:46:36,183 --> 00:46:39,326
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the administrator.

492
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:41,888
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have the policy in front of us to tweak it.

493
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:43,230
[SPEAKER_10]: We need language to tweak it.

494
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:01,904
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is the action that we critique.

495
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:08,788
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about 1% of students, if there were some students that were sick that day, but not sick enough to go to the doctor, okay, we'll count them among them.

496
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,709
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll count them among the excused.

497
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:14,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there's going to be some sort of huge consequence to this behavior.

498
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:21,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think that we're setting some sort of awful precedent that if people want to go to Charlottesville and hit someone else in the car that we're somehow supporting them.

499
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:45,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this, with all due respect to the committee, and with all due respect, I think it sends more of a message to our support of the students, that if we vote now and excuse all the students that weren't able to, that have unexcused absences on the book, now we can do that as a committee, rather than send it to a subcommittee where we talk about it and it comes again in like four weeks.

500
00:47:46,832 --> 00:47:47,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we do Ms.

501
00:47:47,753 --> 00:47:52,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot's motion first, and then if you want to make a motion and there's a second for it, we can take a vote.

502
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:54,378
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Ms.

503
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:59,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot to send this policy review to subcommittee on rules, roll call vote, please.

504
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:00,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

505
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:00,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Mastone.

506
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:06,308
[SPEAKER_05]: The policy.

507
00:48:06,408 --> 00:48:10,111
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the policy paper.

508
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:10,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

509
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

510
00:48:21,249 --> 00:48:22,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

511
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:23,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

512
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:23,870
[SPEAKER_05]: DiBenedetto.

513
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:24,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

514
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:29,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand and I can feel your frustration and you want to take action immediately.

515
00:48:30,254 --> 00:48:45,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just concerned for the students that chose to show up on Friday to now get that change, their frustration with the fact that we changed the policy and they could have gone and still marched or still played

516
00:48:45,854 --> 00:48:55,161
[SPEAKER_03]: and that would escalate that frustration from both their parents and those students that made a choice that was extremely difficult.

517
00:48:55,541 --> 00:49:08,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So for that reason, I'm going to ask you as another member to just really trust that this policy will be looked at effectively by all of us, because we all want to take action immediately.

518
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:14,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I can do is suggest that that committee meets as soon as possible.

519
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,544
[SPEAKER_03]: to expedite your concerns and to say that we are going to take action.

520
00:49:21,864 --> 00:49:24,246
[SPEAKER_03]: We aren't going to sit very long on it.

521
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:33,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just hate to be one of the students that showed up and then found out that I could have gone after the fact.

522
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:37,254
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be very hard to process.

523
00:49:37,435 --> 00:49:39,556
[SPEAKER_03]: As a child, that would be very hard to process.

524
00:49:40,017 --> 00:49:52,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So for that reason, I ask you to wait and trust in our committee, this committee, this very active committee that wants effective change to change this policy very soon and very quickly.

525
00:49:52,941 --> 00:49:53,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

526
00:49:54,721 --> 00:49:55,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Regiro.

527
00:49:56,422 --> 00:50:00,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I suppose that this is my reservation in all of this.

528
00:50:02,944 --> 00:50:08,406
[SPEAKER_10]: While I deeply understand students, they wanted to go, they were worried that they would get an unexcused absence.

529
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we're going to retcon it in retroactive.

530
00:50:10,987 --> 00:50:16,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say, maybe that's- They were worried that they couldn't participate in- They couldn't participate, but they could have.

531
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if it was just an unexpected thing involving in Boston.

532
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's an important lesson.

533
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:26,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's something that will actually, they'll remember that they had a moment when they could have gone.

534
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,354
[SPEAKER_10]: They could have standed out for the climate.

535
00:50:31,017 --> 00:50:34,601
[SPEAKER_10]: But they were worried about some sort of consequence or inconvenience or problem.

536
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:41,369
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe next time they are more willing to actually stand up for the environment.

537
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe next time they're more willing to move forward with this.

538
00:50:46,234 --> 00:50:46,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion?

539
00:50:48,377 --> 00:50:49,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'll let it pass for now.

540
00:50:50,729 --> 00:50:53,611
[SPEAKER_05]: On the paper, is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

541
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:54,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

542
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:57,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved by Ms. DiBenedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

543
00:50:57,233 --> 00:50:58,054
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

544
00:50:58,874 --> 00:50:59,535
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

545
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:00,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

546
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

547
00:51:01,356 --> 00:51:01,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

548
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:02,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, doctor.

549
00:51:02,136 --> 00:51:06,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business?

550
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,081
[SPEAKER_05]: By Ms. DiBenedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

551
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:10,021
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

552
00:51:10,722 --> 00:51:11,482
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

553
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:12,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

554
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:13,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on committees.

555
00:51:13,964 --> 00:51:15,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Building and ground subcommittee.

556
00:51:15,445 --> 00:51:15,825
[SPEAKER_05]: September 11, 2019.

557
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:15,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

558
00:51:15,965 --> 00:51:16,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone.

559
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:16,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, ma'am.

560
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:24,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will not read the report and hope I can't do the highlights.

561
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Our agenda, five items that were discussed.

562
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:32,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The first was speed bumps at the high school complex.

563
00:51:33,117 --> 00:51:42,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I have emailed the chief of police and John Laughlin, our building manager, facilities manager, and they are looking into it.

564
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:50,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Second was the flashing speed signs that you see throughout the city.

565
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,902
[SPEAKER_06]: telling us what speed we're going, if it is below the speed limit.

566
00:51:55,462 --> 00:52:02,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are all being used throughout the city, but when one frees up, it will go to the high school complex.

567
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:06,349
[SPEAKER_06]: The third was an update on the Andrew Glenn complex.

568
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:15,375
[SPEAKER_06]: As of today, the sidewalks and curbing has been completed, and there's just some detailing work that needs to be finished.

569
00:52:15,976 --> 00:52:26,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four was regarding the school kitchen appliances, and that really stemmed from the desire to not use styrofoam plates.

570
00:52:26,905 --> 00:52:30,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Rhetta Smith, the school nutritionist, did take an inventory.

571
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:35,792
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have many appliances throughout the school kitchens that need updating or repair.

572
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:42,197
[SPEAKER_06]: led us to a conversation with Alicia Hunt, who's the energy coordinator for the city.

573
00:52:42,297 --> 00:52:58,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Kathy Kreatz and I will be meeting with her and some state officials to discuss possible grant applications to update our school kitchen appliances and other ways to be green in our schools.

574
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,611
[SPEAKER_06]: The last item of our agenda was the Medford High School master plan.

575
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:06,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Brown, a teacher at the vocational high school,

576
00:53:07,932 --> 00:53:16,659
[SPEAKER_06]: gave us a report from his perspective as both a teacher and a citizen, and what is the plan for Medford High School.

577
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:23,245
[SPEAKER_06]: His questions really led us to discuss, is it about rehabbing?

578
00:53:24,646 --> 00:53:27,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it about looking for funding to build new?

579
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:32,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it about doing it in phases?

580
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:34,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kathy Kreatz had

581
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:41,324
[SPEAKER_06]: suggested that we make a subcommittee that would almost be a master vision plan for the high school.

582
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:55,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to make a motion to create a subcommittee on a master vision for the high school repair and maintenance.

583
00:53:56,511 --> 00:53:59,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And what?

584
00:54:00,173 --> 00:54:00,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Vision.

585
00:54:00,813 --> 00:54:01,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

586
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:09,237
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would be happy to chair the subcommittee.

587
00:54:09,437 --> 00:54:10,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you all set, Mr. Stone, with your report?

588
00:54:10,678 --> 00:54:11,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to press that little.

589
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:12,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

590
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Koretz.

591
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:15,962
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

592
00:54:16,042 --> 00:54:19,604
[SPEAKER_20]: So yes, I did talk with Mayor about that.

593
00:54:19,764 --> 00:54:25,829
[SPEAKER_20]: And even Mr. Brown, he is interested on serving as a volunteer on the committee.

594
00:54:26,169 --> 00:54:28,311
[SPEAKER_20]: And he can bring his expertise to the table.

595
00:54:29,732 --> 00:54:32,894
[SPEAKER_20]: We also want to have some ideas, just brainstorming.

596
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:39,621
[SPEAKER_20]: doing some tours, walking around the school, and just putting together a plan.

597
00:54:40,162 --> 00:54:43,105
[SPEAKER_20]: We know that we're waiting for the MSBA interest statement.

598
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:53,556
[SPEAKER_20]: We're hoping to get that, but I think what a lot of people want to do is just have a discussion, start talking about things, and putting together a plan, and then prioritizing it.

599
00:54:55,197 --> 00:55:02,340
[SPEAKER_20]: So I do know that currently some of the CTE programs are currently reconfiguring to their new spaces.

600
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:19,067
[SPEAKER_20]: And it would be nice to even, you know, share some of those stories and we can bring it back to the regular committee and just tell everybody what's going on in those, you know, those areas that are reconfiguring and what the status is in progress and maybe something like that.

601
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:23,528
[SPEAKER_20]: And we could have like a Google document where we could, you know, have a timetable.

602
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:24,849
[SPEAKER_20]: This is where we are.

603
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:26,763
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, this is where we want to be.

604
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,344
[SPEAKER_20]: This is when we get the MSBA statement.

605
00:55:29,924 --> 00:55:31,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the five-year capital plan.

606
00:55:31,305 --> 00:55:36,187
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like a lot of planning involved, so it would be a lot of like mini-meetings to just track the progress.

607
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:37,928
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, so that's about it.

608
00:55:38,028 --> 00:55:38,748
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, no problem.

609
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:43,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the past, there's been the Building the Future committee and then Building the Future.

610
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:58,696
[SPEAKER_05]: step two committee, and it was comprised of teachers, parents, a list of faculty, you know, it had administrators on it, so it was a comprehensive group of people that actually looked at things and then made recommendations.

611
00:55:59,176 --> 00:55:59,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar.

612
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:00,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar to that.

613
00:56:01,337 --> 00:56:04,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe something that should be broader than just a few committee members.

614
00:56:05,939 --> 00:56:12,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a motion on the floor to establish a school master vision plan for Medford High School.

615
00:56:13,383 --> 00:56:14,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a second on the floor by Ms.

616
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:15,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Kreatz.

617
00:56:16,145 --> 00:56:16,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms. DiBenedetto.

618
00:56:17,305 --> 00:56:17,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

619
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:21,348
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much what I wanted to add.

620
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:35,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Brown was present, and he said there are a lot of experts, not only as teachers in the vocational school, but throughout the community that would love to come and be present and active on this committee.

621
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:39,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the work that they could do, they could do

622
00:56:41,053 --> 00:57:00,995
[SPEAKER_03]: initial groundwork with the expertise we have in-house without having to pay for anything and just go over just basic information and really research things by professionals that live in the community and it wouldn't cost any money initially and then we can build on that and

623
00:57:01,448 --> 00:57:06,952
[SPEAKER_03]: like build with the foundation and then build up and just not incur costs right away.

624
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:08,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I wanted to add.

625
00:57:09,373 --> 00:57:10,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's an excellent idea.

626
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:16,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could be a three, five, 10 year vision for what needs to be done.

627
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:22,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And until we see that, once we have a vision, then we can make steps to make it happen.

628
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:26,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to know where we are so we can figure out where we need to go.

629
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:34,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So I applaud this committee and its work for bringing this out from that evening and moving forward with this.

630
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:35,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

631
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:37,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Russo.

632
00:57:38,308 --> 00:57:38,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

633
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:50,813
[SPEAKER_09]: So on Friday, I had a conference call with Jim McDonald, Jack McCarthy, and Diane Sullivan of the MSBA, Massachusetts School Building Authority.

634
00:57:51,973 --> 00:57:57,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I had sent them a long list of questions, and they felt it was better to actually just have a conference call with me.

635
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:04,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a very enlightening call, to say the least, and there's a couple of important things I felt the need to share.

636
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:17,363
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, our building, all school buildings are inspected and are given a rating from one to four, one being sound, I guess, to four being like, why is anybody in there?

637
00:58:18,224 --> 00:58:19,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are rated at a one.

638
00:58:20,404 --> 00:58:25,046
[SPEAKER_09]: So we should not have any delusions that they're gonna come in and say, this place has to be demolished.

639
00:58:25,246 --> 00:58:26,487
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not gonna happen.

640
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:38,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Another important information, our reimbursement rate for Medford is 52.3%, so we are looking at paying for almost half of whatever we decide to do there.

641
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:42,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a really, really important piece of information.

642
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:46,121
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got 90% for the elementary and middle schools.

643
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:50,024
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to have that kind of thing in the future, no matter what.

644
00:58:51,704 --> 00:58:59,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was something else I asked about that I almost forgot to ask that turned out to be, for me, the most important piece here.

645
00:59:01,026 --> 00:59:02,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Our high school is built for 5,000 students.

646
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:08,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And the MSBA only has authority on things from K to 12.

647
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:16,929
[SPEAKER_09]: So any kind of major renovation to the school can only be for the size of our population, 1,400, 1,500 kids.

648
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:25,595
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no option where they would demolish the building and give us a new building.

649
00:59:25,615 --> 00:59:28,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they would, but it'd be tiny compared to what we have now.

650
00:59:28,437 --> 00:59:34,042
[SPEAKER_09]: We would lose all other programming that is not part of the K-12 that we have housed there.

651
00:59:34,562 --> 00:59:37,084
[SPEAKER_09]: So to me, that is a really important point.

652
00:59:37,184 --> 00:59:48,754
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of other non-K-12 stuff going on there, and all of that stuff would just be completely orphaned if we were to get a grant for a new high school from them, ignoring how we all pay for it.

653
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:53,942
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought those were really, really interesting and important points.

654
00:59:54,302 --> 01:00:03,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other one I wanted, and just one note for the minutes, I have heard this numerous times lately that there's only five people in DPW or six people in DPW.

655
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:06,726
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor has confirmed, I think it's like 50 people actually work there.

656
01:00:06,746 --> 01:00:13,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's an important thing for people to know, that no, there is not some tiny skeleton crew of people.

657
01:00:14,108 --> 01:00:15,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Six people running around the city.

658
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:19,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see that twice in the minutes and wanted to correct that.

659
01:00:19,751 --> 01:00:21,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

660
01:00:21,672 --> 01:00:22,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

661
01:00:22,212 --> 01:00:29,335
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion that we develop a master vision plan, seconded by Ms.

662
01:00:29,435 --> 01:00:31,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Kreatz, roll call vote, please.

663
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:33,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Ruggiero, sorry.

664
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:36,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

665
01:00:36,863 --> 01:00:42,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I just would like to ask that when the plan is proposed, we have options.

666
01:00:42,648 --> 01:00:44,410
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like this is what we think is the best.

667
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:50,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that the process that we went through for the superintendent search was excellent.

668
01:00:51,436 --> 01:00:54,198
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to make sure that it doesn't go to a subcommittee.

669
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:56,480
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys present us a book, and we vote on it, and we're done.

670
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,942
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something I thoroughly hope that we can all be involved in, because these are serious decisions.

671
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:08,404
[SPEAKER_10]: And I commend member Rousseau for doing research on this regard, because that's useful for me to know as well.

672
01:01:08,924 --> 01:01:24,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to maybe suggest that we add a mandate to this subcommittee, that they provide us with maybe three different plans, or... Just for general information, a feasibility study would have to happen at some point.

673
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:35,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And when a feasibility study comes along, that's when they make recommendations on different ways that we can look at what we want to do, whether it's repair, demolish, build somewhere else.

674
01:01:35,536 --> 01:01:38,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is far down the road.

675
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:41,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, that's when the options start to surface.

676
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when decisions have to be made.

677
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:47,463
[SPEAKER_05]: But for right now, that won't happen.

678
01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:50,365
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to get one option served to you from this committee.

679
01:01:50,705 --> 01:01:51,866
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a working group of people.

680
01:01:52,728 --> 01:01:54,609
[SPEAKER_05]: part of the whole process the entire time.

681
01:01:54,629 --> 01:01:56,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense to you?

682
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, sure.

683
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

684
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:00,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustone, you had your light on.

685
01:02:00,712 --> 01:02:14,038
[SPEAKER_06]: To clarify, I think it evolved from our typical subcommittee, our eight subcommittees, to now more of a committee like the superintendent search where community members are involved, teachers are involved.

686
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:16,999
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't be three of the standing school committee members.

687
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

688
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:18,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

689
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:19,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

690
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,421
[SPEAKER_05]: DiBenedetto.

691
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:38,607
[SPEAKER_03]: We should, I would like to set up some guidelines of what that committee, since we're building the committee now, can we just put out some guidelines that who we want on that committee, and if any members would like to be on that committee could also express interest at this point.

692
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:46,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way, Kathy already offered to be the chairperson of the committee, and I can second her being chairperson.

693
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:49,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if she can nominate herself.

694
01:02:58,243 --> 01:03:02,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I commend Kathy for volunteering to be the chair, and she may very well end up.

695
01:03:03,188 --> 01:03:13,738
[SPEAKER_13]: In previous times when we did, I was on both the Building the Future 1 and Building the Future 2, and part of the much larger community group that was on it, the mayor appointed.

696
01:03:14,078 --> 01:03:19,844
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is typical, in my experience on the school committee, is that the mayor appoints who's going to be on a committee.

697
01:03:20,744 --> 01:03:23,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Just as we did with the superintendent search,

698
01:03:23,827 --> 01:03:27,248
[SPEAKER_13]: We asked the community who was interested in it.

699
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:51,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only is it school committee members, but it's also community members and teachers May it did appoint me as the person and I requested that committee be added so in a similar way we need to have a way for people in the community to contact one person and

700
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:52,439
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be coming.

701
01:03:52,479 --> 01:03:54,240
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not going to be tonight.

702
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,140
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll send out a whole press release.

703
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:04,082
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll reach out through all the PTOs, PTAs, whatever, PTOs, and we will get the word out for people that are interested, just like we did for the superintendent search.

704
01:04:04,122 --> 01:04:11,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we had a really strong search committee because we got people from all different pockets across the city and from all the schools were represented.

705
01:04:12,005 --> 01:04:13,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we had a really broad

706
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:15,641
[SPEAKER_05]: committee that searched for you.

707
01:04:16,122 --> 01:04:18,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that worked very strongly.

708
01:04:18,482 --> 01:04:19,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll put together.

709
01:04:20,183 --> 01:04:26,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there are anything in particular that somebody wants to see, maybe in the next meeting, if you want to make some recommendations.

710
01:04:27,605 --> 01:04:28,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you all set, Ms.

711
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:28,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostone?

712
01:04:29,705 --> 01:04:29,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

713
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:29,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

714
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:30,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostone, cheer.

715
01:04:33,106 --> 01:04:37,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just ask out of the six of us who are interested in being on the Master Vision Plan Committee?

716
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:41,408
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

717
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So Paulette, Erin, Michael, and Kathy.

718
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:46,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

719
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:47,328
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll keep us.

720
01:04:48,408 --> 01:04:48,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

721
01:04:48,909 --> 01:04:49,669
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion.

722
01:04:49,709 --> 01:04:50,689
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

723
01:04:51,469 --> 01:04:52,289
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed.

724
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:53,430
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

725
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept this report and place it on file.

726
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:57,491
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

727
01:04:58,551 --> 01:04:59,231
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed.

728
01:04:59,531 --> 01:05:00,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

729
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:00,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

730
01:05:02,092 --> 01:05:03,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Community participation.

731
01:05:06,413 --> 01:05:08,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Report of the superintendent updates and comments.

732
01:05:08,653 --> 01:05:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Superintendent, uh,

733
01:05:14,642 --> 01:05:21,807
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would like to begin this evening very appreciative of the conversations that have gone forth thus far.

734
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:31,375
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do want us to recognize another Mustang, a student that actually had a wonderful recognition this year.

735
01:05:31,995 --> 01:05:34,677
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to congratulate Antonia Collins.

736
01:05:36,277 --> 01:05:47,600
[SPEAKER_18]: She's a 2019 graduate of Medford High School who received a second place scholarship of $1,000 through the National Spanish Examinations.

737
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

738
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Collins was an advanced placement student under Ms.

739
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:57,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Lepore and currently is studying at Howard University in Washington, D.C.

740
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:09,369
[SPEAKER_18]: students become eligible for the scholarship by scoring in either the gold, silver, or bronze categories on the National Spanish Examinations.

741
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:21,741
[SPEAKER_18]: According to Kevin Sesna Busemi, National Director of the Exams, earning a scholarship for any student on the National Spanish Examinations is very prestigious.

742
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:34,240
[SPEAKER_18]: because only 12 students are chosen from among 150,000 students who take the national Spanish exam each year.

743
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,943
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's a very incredible feat.

744
01:06:38,215 --> 01:06:49,083
[SPEAKER_18]: And students from Medford High School have a long history of high achievement on these exams, and that is a reflection of our strong world language department.

745
01:06:49,524 --> 01:06:56,749
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to recognize Antonia Collins on being one of 12 in a pool of 150,000.

746
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:57,589
[SPEAKER_18]: So congratulations to her.

747
01:07:06,277 --> 01:07:17,762
[SPEAKER_18]: So last Thursday, Mayor Burke and I visited with Jonah Alberto, the student at the McGlynn Elementary School, who found a Ramset Power charge bit in front of the school.

748
01:07:19,142 --> 01:07:24,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Jonah brought the charge to his teacher, and the teacher immediately reported it to school leadership.

749
01:07:25,265 --> 01:07:34,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Upon seeing the item, which looks similar to a .22 caliber bullet casing, the school leadership immediately contacted the Medford police in my office.

750
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:46,419
[SPEAKER_18]: The Medford police confirmed the item was a Ramset power charge bit, which is used in construction to drive nails or bolts into concrete or other solid items.

751
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,761
[SPEAKER_18]: We applaud Jonah for seeing something and saying something.

752
01:07:52,742 --> 01:07:57,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Also last Thursday evening, the McGlynn Middle School hosted their annual curriculum night.

753
01:07:58,645 --> 01:08:03,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Parents had the opportunity to follow their child's schedule with a 12 minute mini class.

754
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:10,970
[SPEAKER_18]: The event was well attended, and parents had the opportunity to experience a simulated middle school schedule.

755
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:13,512
[SPEAKER_18]: It was an enjoyable evening for all.

756
01:08:16,033 --> 01:08:16,773
[SPEAKER_18]: More good news.

757
01:08:17,074 --> 01:08:24,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Our Mustang athletes are in full swing for the fall season, including, for the first time, our middle school sports.

758
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:32,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Athletic director Bobby Maloney is here tonight to provide a more in-depth report on our school sports.

759
01:08:34,264 --> 01:08:44,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Friday morning, I had the pleasure to listen as Mr. Fabian Ramirez delivered his message of anti-bullying to students in grades 5, 6, 7, and 8.

760
01:08:47,307 --> 01:08:54,192
[SPEAKER_18]: at the McGlynn School, courtesy of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, CCSR.

761
01:08:54,932 --> 01:09:00,976
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Ramirez punctuated his message with lots of jokes, so he really had the students' attention.

762
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:05,559
[SPEAKER_18]: He spoke about the importance of treating people the way you want to be treated.

763
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:13,725
[SPEAKER_18]: He advocated for students to reach out to a trusted teacher or Councilor if they ever had a bullying issue arise.

764
01:09:14,345 --> 01:09:17,107
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a wonderful presentation and important message.

765
01:09:17,642 --> 01:09:22,905
[SPEAKER_18]: We thank CCSR and the Cummings Foundation for providing us with this opportunity.

766
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:30,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Our Mustang Band and Color Guard competed this weekend at Hormel Stadium and placed second.

767
01:09:31,144 --> 01:09:40,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations to all of our talented students, band director, Haley Rello, and fine arts director, Tony Zigney, on this outstanding achievement.

768
01:09:41,267 --> 01:09:49,749
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a beautiful day, lots of smiles, smiling faces, and a wonderful event for our students, and they did a fantastic job.

769
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,761
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, this weekend was very, very busy in Medford.

770
01:09:54,321 --> 01:10:01,244
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition to the Mustang band competition, Medford Kiwanis hosted their annual jail day fundraiser.

771
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:12,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Both CCSR students and the Mustang cheerleaders donated their time to assist Kiwanians who have always been very generous to our schools.

772
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:16,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Cache hosted the annual Mystic River celebration.

773
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:22,975
[SPEAKER_18]: The annual motorcycle ride in memory of Crystal Campbell was held this weekend as well.

774
01:10:23,456 --> 01:10:33,285
[SPEAKER_18]: The ride, which one of our own teachers, Miss Lisa Dunphy, works along with Mr. John Joyce to annually fundraise for the Crystal Campbell Scholarship.

775
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:43,114
[SPEAKER_18]: And we all enjoy the Tufts Community Day, where over 60 non-profits from across Medford and Somerville came together for a day of entertainment,

776
01:10:43,654 --> 01:10:45,515
[SPEAKER_18]: food, and valuable information.

777
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:52,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Both the Medford Public Schools and CCSR hosted a table at yesterday's event.

778
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:08,368
[SPEAKER_18]: And which we heard a robust presentation already, but Global Climate Change Week is from September 20th through September 27th, and our teachers are continuing to address topics over the course of this week.

779
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:10,650
[SPEAKER_18]: And those are my updates for today.

780
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:11,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

781
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Superintendent.

782
01:11:16,546 --> 01:11:40,134
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to mention that I was up at Tufts and I saw Diane Caldwell giving out these bookmarks that had been made by our Graphic Arts Department, a nice little PR piece, and I wanted to express my appreciation to Diane for sitting in the sun, as well as I believe Lisa was there earlier, Lisa Evangelista, and also to the CCSR students who were present.

783
01:11:40,234 --> 01:11:42,895
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a hot day, but very, very nice.

784
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:48,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

785
01:11:48,123 --> 01:11:56,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Recommendation to approve $1,500 grant from PFLAG to CCSR to further support our LGBTQ plus population.

786
01:11:57,133 --> 01:11:57,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cushing.

787
01:12:04,768 --> 01:12:07,831
[SPEAKER_11]: PFLAG no longer stands for an acronym.

788
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:09,212
[SPEAKER_11]: It is just PFLAG.

789
01:12:09,852 --> 01:12:15,556
[SPEAKER_11]: But they term themselves as the world's biggest advocates for the LGBT community.

790
01:12:16,137 --> 01:12:18,679
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that you accept this donation of $1,500.

791
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:21,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion for approval by Ms.

792

[SPEAKER_05]: Faza Khan, Ms.

809
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:05,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Khan.

810
01:13:13,134 --> 01:13:14,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everybody.

811
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:15,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

812
01:13:15,234 --> 01:13:15,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

813
01:13:16,235 --> 01:13:21,359
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you very much for your time and budget investment.

814
01:13:21,839 --> 01:13:26,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we have illustrative math across all grades.

815
01:13:26,943 --> 01:13:36,670
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a curriculum that's consistent throughout the classrooms as well, with the exception of accelerated math and math sections.

816
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:42,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Teachers, I have been in many, many classrooms, actually almost all classrooms.

817
01:13:42,814 --> 01:13:47,778
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm seeing that teachers are embracing the new program, they are using it.

818
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:52,822
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some struggles as they'll continue to be throughout this year.

819
01:13:53,723 --> 01:14:05,172
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm hopeful that with the professional development that we have invested in and with their hard work, they can take on this challenge and I'm sure they'll conquer it.

820
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:09,973
[SPEAKER_12]: if not at the end of this year, pretty soon after that.

821
01:14:11,954 --> 01:14:31,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Since Medford Public Schools mission is to provide every student with the best learning opportunity that fits their learning style, we have for years offered an accelerated program for students who have demonstrated the mental ability and or are interested in taking the accelerated path.

822
01:14:33,055 --> 01:14:47,641
[SPEAKER_12]: When I'm looking at the schedule of the teachers, I'm seeing that all 7th and all 8th grade teachers at McGlynn and at Andrews teach one section of accelerated math.

823
01:14:49,122 --> 01:14:53,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Students take a placement test at the end of 6th grade.

824
01:14:53,884 --> 01:14:56,866
[SPEAKER_12]: The results of those placement tests combined with

825
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:16,995
[SPEAKER_12]: student's mental ability throughout the year, teacher's observances, teacher's recommendations, and parent's recommendation or request is taken into account before students are placed in the accelerated path.

826
01:15:17,435 --> 01:15:20,136
[SPEAKER_12]: 15% of our students take the accelerated course

827
01:15:20,778 --> 01:15:32,474
[SPEAKER_12]: class, and in that class in 7th grade, at the end of 6th grade, once they are placed in the accelerated path, or they choose to take the accelerated path, once they are in that

828
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:42,646
[SPEAKER_12]: class, they use Big Ideas as they have been using for quite some time.

829
01:15:43,186 --> 01:15:54,518
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why we have chosen to stay with the Big Ideas textbook slash program for the accelerated path only students

830
01:15:54,938 --> 01:15:59,143
[SPEAKER_12]: is because it's a great textbook which serves the purpose.

831
01:15:59,203 --> 01:16:09,275
[SPEAKER_12]: The purpose of the accelerated 7th grade program is that it teaches the math common core standards of 7th and 8th grade all in one year.

832
01:16:09,395 --> 01:16:10,997
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's very rigorous.

833
01:16:12,598 --> 01:16:16,040
[SPEAKER_12]: And big ideas books, a book achieves it.

834
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:28,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, we are very well aware that then it doesn't allow students and the teachers to go in depth as much as the illustrative math program will allow and will offer.

835
01:16:28,525 --> 01:16:29,486
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's a price.

836
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:37,965
[SPEAKER_12]: one has to think of once you go through that path.

837
01:16:38,025 --> 01:16:47,715
[SPEAKER_12]: So that big ideas book is used with the accelerated path and then the same set of students will continue on in eighth grade.

838
01:16:48,823 --> 01:16:51,845
[SPEAKER_12]: with the Big Ideas textbook for Algebra I as well.

839
01:16:53,066 --> 01:17:03,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Students at any point in time can opt out of the accelerated program, and if they want to test into the accelerated program at the end of seventh grade, that's possible as well.

840
01:17:04,294 --> 01:17:11,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, just a reminder that it's too many standards being taught in one year, but we are doing it because we want to

841
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,344
[SPEAKER_12]: offer the best learning opportunity or the most learning opportunity for students who can handle it.

842
01:17:18,745 --> 01:17:20,666
[SPEAKER_12]: So we want to cover the lower end.

843
01:17:20,707 --> 01:17:24,750
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to also cover the upper end where students can handle the challenge.

844
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:31,015
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have a very rigorous program as we just adopted last year.

845
01:17:34,638 --> 01:17:39,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I'm very confident that once students

846
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:52,411
[SPEAKER_12]: take the accelerated path, they do get to the final goal of taking calculus, either AP calculus or honors calculus by the time they reach 12th grade.

847
01:17:54,673 --> 01:18:04,320
[SPEAKER_12]: For students who don't take that accelerated path, either by choice or they were recommended not to take that route,

848
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:12,049
[SPEAKER_12]: they can still take AP calculus and honors calculus if they double up in their sophomore year.

849
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:28,279
[SPEAKER_12]: And just this year we have had many, many instances where I have signed off on that, on the permission slip after talking to the parents, after talking to the teachers, and just talking to the students in general as to what their final goal is.

850
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:35,482
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's where we are at with the state of middle school mathematics, and I welcome any questions.

851
01:18:35,742 --> 01:18:36,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

852
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Ruggiero.

853
01:18:37,903 --> 01:18:38,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

854
01:18:38,424 --> 01:18:39,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Khan, for the report.

855
01:18:40,245 --> 01:18:42,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to ask some questions about illustrative math.

856
01:18:42,486 --> 01:18:42,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

857
01:18:43,206 --> 01:18:46,528
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think this is how it works.

858
01:18:46,568 --> 01:18:51,370
[SPEAKER_10]: So when kids complete online exercises, all that information is recorded for you to look over.

859
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:51,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

860
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:53,791
[SPEAKER_12]: That is not correct.

861
01:18:54,251 --> 01:19:00,037
[SPEAKER_10]: So, when the online classes, that information isn't compiled globally for you?

862
01:19:00,297 --> 01:19:07,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so when we use the word online in the context of illustrative math, it's not the traditional online.

863
01:19:08,584 --> 01:19:15,531
[SPEAKER_12]: All we mean by saying that illustrative math is online is that the whole textbook is available online.

864
01:19:15,771 --> 01:19:16,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the exercises themselves.

865
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:17,352
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

866
01:19:17,372 --> 01:19:18,073
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not using those.

867
01:19:18,113 --> 01:19:20,154
[SPEAKER_10]: No, exercises themselves are on paper.

868
01:19:20,174 --> 01:19:21,175
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my misunderstanding.

869
01:19:21,195 --> 01:19:21,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

870
01:19:21,695 --> 01:19:22,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

871
01:19:22,475 --> 01:19:29,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a sense of, I remember that printouts and kids carrying binders were a key element of this program.

872
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:29,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

873
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,443
[SPEAKER_10]: So do we have a sense of how our compliance percentage is going?

874
01:19:33,543 --> 01:19:40,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's early in the year, but I remember as a math teacher, I would have a certain percentage of kids and I'd open up their bag and all the papers would come

875
01:19:40,507 --> 01:19:53,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, there are concerns that teachers have and I have been asking them to keep a data on what's going on in the classroom and also how much photocopying paper are they actually using.

876
01:19:53,657 --> 01:20:02,944
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are keeping a track of both how many times has a student lost a paper and come back to get it or a packet and also how many

877
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:06,480
[SPEAKER_12]: reams of paper are you going through per unit.

878
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:15,045
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully by the end of this year, we will be in better shape to have more concrete conversation about it.

879
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:15,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

880
01:20:15,445 --> 01:20:17,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you give us a sense of how things are working so far?

881
01:20:18,126 --> 01:20:19,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I know it's very early in the year.

882
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:20,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

883
01:20:20,368 --> 01:20:22,269
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for asking.

884
01:20:23,249 --> 01:20:25,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I know everybody's trying their very best.

885
01:20:26,911 --> 01:20:30,853
[SPEAKER_12]: All the other programs that we piloted had a traditional mindset.

886
01:20:31,233 --> 01:20:32,314
[SPEAKER_12]: You think forward.

887
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:36,963
[SPEAKER_12]: I am given this standard that I have to teach today.

888
01:20:37,623 --> 01:20:40,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we are asking teachers to look at the cool down.

889
01:20:40,145 --> 01:20:42,106
[SPEAKER_12]: We are looking at the synthesis because

890
01:20:43,408 --> 01:20:54,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Every single lesson that's given to the teachers, by the way, it's all done in illustrative math, has so much to do, so many activities, and we only get about 40 minutes of teaching time.

891
01:20:55,493 --> 01:21:03,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So teachers have to look at the synthesis and then plan backwards as to what activity will be most effective and efficient.

892
01:21:05,216 --> 01:21:07,377
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it's a learning game.

893
01:21:07,957 --> 01:21:09,477
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we are going to play this year.

894
01:21:09,858 --> 01:21:14,379
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will just have to be patient because teachers are actually trying very hard.

895
01:21:14,419 --> 01:21:15,559
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so proud of them.

896
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:17,760
[SPEAKER_12]: They really have been, you know.

897
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I think it's very exciting that we're trying a new program.

898
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just very nervous about the implementation and I just want to make sure I have a couple questions for you.

899
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:27,022
[SPEAKER_10]: So help me understand a little bit about the pedagogy.

900
01:21:27,242 --> 01:21:27,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

901
01:21:27,663 --> 01:21:46,203
[SPEAKER_10]: So here we have there is a page that gives I imagine there's like a page that hits all of the modalities that they're doing sort of a guide for the lesson and then the teachers choose from like a potpourri of exercises that they feel would best fit their students that basically how these classes work.

902
01:21:46,454 --> 01:21:47,594
[SPEAKER_12]: That's exactly right.

903
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:56,236
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a proper lesson plan, basically, that's made with the content objective, the language objective, the vocabulary that will be used.

904
01:21:56,816 --> 01:22:00,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, then we start with exploration piece.

905
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:07,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Then there are activities to really, you know, where students turn and talk to each other and discuss things.

906
01:22:08,019 --> 01:22:09,579
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there are more activities.

907
01:22:09,879 --> 01:22:13,420
[SPEAKER_12]: But in reality, it is very difficult to

908
01:22:13,959 --> 01:22:15,341
[SPEAKER_12]: go through every single activity.

909
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:17,265
[SPEAKER_12]: So teachers will have to pick and choose.

910
01:22:17,325 --> 01:22:18,447
[SPEAKER_12]: This suits my style.

911
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:19,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Today I have a double block.

912
01:22:20,109 --> 01:22:21,452
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have this much time.

913
01:22:21,612 --> 01:22:25,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, it's a lot of backward planning rather than forward planning.

914
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:27,341
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the pedagogy behind it.

915
01:22:28,237 --> 01:22:33,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And do we have a sense of how the teachers, so far, so good?

916
01:22:33,218 --> 01:22:34,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what we're hearing so far?

917
01:22:34,578 --> 01:22:35,678
[SPEAKER_12]: So far, so good.

918
01:22:36,178 --> 01:22:49,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of us are a little behind on the curriculum, but that is very normal in the first month, first two months, and then we have PD day, November 6th PD day.

919
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:55,062
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll be going through a PD and then we'll reassess how far behind are we.

920
01:22:55,722 --> 01:22:59,805
[SPEAKER_12]: So while teachers are talking to me, I... When is that?

921
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:02,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there like a test that students are going to be administering?

922
01:23:02,446 --> 01:23:04,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it sort of like all the teachers have a lot?

923
01:23:04,107 --> 01:23:06,308
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the teacher's professional development day.

924
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:06,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

925
01:23:06,929 --> 01:23:07,549
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the PD day.

926
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:07,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

927
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:15,154
[SPEAKER_12]: So teachers will be working throughout the day with a coach from illustrative math who will

928
01:23:15,834 --> 01:23:24,300
[SPEAKER_12]: help them see things in perspective, and we'll give them suggestions, and they'll work in groups, and they will exchange strategies.

929
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:36,628
[SPEAKER_12]: We already have been doing it in the mathematics department meetings, but then you have an extended period of time, and you really shall walk out with some really good strategies given to you by professionals.

930
01:23:36,648 --> 01:23:36,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

931
01:23:36,848 --> 01:23:38,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for these reports.

932
01:23:38,309 --> 01:23:43,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate as much information about this particular program, because I'm very excited about it.

933
01:23:43,553 --> 01:23:44,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

934
01:23:44,173 --> 01:23:45,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you so much.

935
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:54,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for your generosity and again, in terms of budgeting and in terms of time, we'll appreciate it.

936
01:23:54,723 --> 01:23:59,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I think our students will hopefully benefit from it.

937
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:00,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms. DiBenedetto.

938
01:24:00,949 --> 01:24:01,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

939
01:24:02,987 --> 01:24:04,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few questions as well.

940
01:24:05,028 --> 01:24:08,250
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we start, you said there have been a few struggles.

941
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:10,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us a little bit about what those struggles have been?

942
01:24:11,372 --> 01:24:20,839
[SPEAKER_12]: So the struggles are, so for example, getting the supplies to the teachers in time because some of them have been backordered.

943
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:32,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, we have, once you get the new textbooks, we have to number them because it's public property and we want to make sure they're being accounted for.

944
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:33,387
[SPEAKER_12]: that takes time.

945
01:24:34,107 --> 01:24:42,972
[SPEAKER_12]: And then shipping them out, sometimes, you know, there's a lot going on at the loading dock, and all of them were centralized to the high school.

946
01:24:43,032 --> 01:25:01,922
[SPEAKER_12]: So these logistical issues have been going on, but, you know, teachers have been very kind and patient with me and the department secretary, and I tell them that I'm on their side, and if they really need something immediately to send me an email,

947
01:25:02,382 --> 01:25:04,664
[SPEAKER_12]: and then the rest of the supplies will follow.

948
01:25:04,824 --> 01:25:15,291
[SPEAKER_12]: As you know, we do have a budget to comply with and sometimes you place an order and you just have to wait for the things.

949
01:25:17,877 --> 01:25:18,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.

950
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:25,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair to the superintendent, could you give us some information as what's holding up any orders?

951
01:25:25,385 --> 01:25:28,128
[SPEAKER_03]: We're three weeks at least into the school year.

952
01:25:28,648 --> 01:25:34,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume that with the new academic program, we had them up and running and ready for teachers for day one.

953
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:39,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So could we get an update either by email or

954
01:25:40,419 --> 01:25:52,307
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow reach out to us as to when all the materials are going to be delivered to all teachers, not just regular ed, but special education, as well as EL teachers.

955
01:25:53,668 --> 01:26:00,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have talked to a few people, and from what I'm hearing, the teachers should have two kits.

956
01:26:00,713 --> 01:26:04,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's two different kits that they're working from.

957
01:26:04,836 --> 01:26:09,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And the consumables should be replaced yearly.

958
01:26:10,276 --> 01:26:23,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And in those consumables, there are a lot of things like colored paper, tracing paper, bingo tabs, playing cards, whiteboards, colored pencils, and measuring cups.

959
01:26:23,161 --> 01:26:30,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I look through the programs to see, and there's a long list of things that teachers need.

960
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:32,044
[SPEAKER_03]: What is missing?

961
01:26:32,485 --> 01:26:33,685
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they waiting for?

962
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:37,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And how long will they be waiting are a few of my questions.

963
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:46,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And this seems like it's a very, from what I've reviewed, looked like a very language-based math program.

964
01:26:46,459 --> 01:26:58,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are we doing to help our students that aren't reading at grade level and helping them to access this as well as our

965
01:26:58,937 --> 01:27:03,539
[SPEAKER_03]: non-English first language students that may have trouble with this.

966
01:27:03,999 --> 01:27:09,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only are they having trouble possibly with the math piece, but if they can't get the language, they can't do the math.

967
01:27:10,061 --> 01:27:11,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure that gets frustrating.

968
01:27:12,001 --> 01:27:13,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um... Ms. DiBenedetto?

969
01:27:13,602 --> 01:27:13,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

970
01:27:14,782 --> 01:27:28,207
[SPEAKER_18]: So, just in terms of the students that need additional supports, we do have co-teaching, and we do have, under our new EL programming at the McGlynn, EL teachers are supporting

971
01:27:29,126 --> 01:27:30,187
[SPEAKER_18]: content instruction.

972
01:27:30,748 --> 01:27:36,653
[SPEAKER_18]: So there is another adult supporting and scaffolding the work for those students.

973
01:27:36,993 --> 01:27:47,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So do those co-teachers have books and have access to the programming that they need in order to provide additional supports to these students?

974
01:27:47,162 --> 01:27:52,687
[SPEAKER_12]: So as I mentioned to Mr. Ruggiero, everything is available online.

975
01:27:52,807 --> 01:27:56,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So while their books are getting to them,

976
01:27:56,894 --> 01:28:00,155
[SPEAKER_12]: They have everything available to them online.

977
01:28:00,195 --> 01:28:07,478
[SPEAKER_12]: They can print it or they can consult with the classroom teacher, borrow their teacher's edition.

978
01:28:07,518 --> 01:28:15,901
[SPEAKER_12]: But I feel that with this program, they can just go online and everything is available.

979
01:28:15,961 --> 01:28:25,125
[SPEAKER_12]: The student edition is there, the teacher's edition, and also support for the family and help for the family if they want to help their kids with the problem solving.

980
01:28:25,396 --> 01:28:31,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And do the teachers have the consumables necessary to do lessons with the children?

981
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:38,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I hear from you and from teachers that they don't have what they need to, at this point,

982
01:28:40,953 --> 01:28:44,457
[SPEAKER_03]: pull out those specific lessons from the programming.

983
01:28:44,937 --> 01:28:46,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are three weeks in.

984
01:28:46,358 --> 01:28:50,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to know when, either from you or from the superintendent.

985
01:28:50,443 --> 01:28:55,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Based on what I looked at, the supplies, they are like paper plates.

986
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:17,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Didn't see anything that probably doesn't already exist within a school building There were a few things that definitely need to be on backorder, but it's not like it's something that's a $70 Piece of equipment if it's you know paper plates, maybe I don't know if it's a fractions activity.

987
01:29:17,786 --> 01:29:19,628
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean it's something that could be

988
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,551
[SPEAKER_18]: At the dollar store, you could probably get 100 paper plates for a dollar.

989
01:29:26,032 --> 01:29:43,784
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just saying, when I looked at the list of supplies, because that was brought to my attention, it was really normal, hands-on activities that I said the kids are probably going to have a lot of fun using these materials to understand the mathematics, the mathematical concepts that are being taught.

990
01:29:45,185 --> 01:29:49,968
[SPEAKER_18]: But I still feel, while the curriculum is new and it's being introduced,

991
01:29:50,688 --> 01:29:57,412
[SPEAKER_18]: This curriculum is a rigorous curriculum in terms of it's forcing the children to truly think mathematically.

992
01:29:57,772 --> 01:30:08,558
[SPEAKER_18]: So even if it were to ask for a round peg and you need a square peg, a teacher could go and consult with another classroom.

993
01:30:08,598 --> 01:30:11,580
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be from a different, the former curriculum that you had.

994
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:17,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes you can say, well, I don't have the round, but I have the square and you can make adjustments with that.

995
01:30:17,683 --> 01:30:26,706
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't feel that there was anything on that list that would prevent a skilled teacher from being able to execute the lesson.

996
01:30:27,226 --> 01:30:31,768
[SPEAKER_18]: You could be creative and swap something out temporarily until those other,

997
01:30:33,268 --> 01:30:35,329
[SPEAKER_18]: until the other materials are available.

998
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:42,233
[SPEAKER_18]: And because everything is available online, you're not teaching the entire chapter in one day.

999
01:30:42,453 --> 01:30:44,895
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one lesson at a time.

1000
01:30:45,595 --> 01:30:47,937
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know with

1001
01:30:48,757 --> 01:30:57,940
[SPEAKER_18]: the loading dock, that was true, that the backlog of everything coming in at the same exact time and trying to get the materials delivered.

1002
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:07,263
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't know, Faiza, can you give a tentative time frame for when you think everyone should have a hard copy in hand?

1003
01:31:08,063 --> 01:31:14,305
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that all the general education teachers

1004
01:31:15,143 --> 01:31:19,606
[SPEAKER_12]: and all the special education teachers should have the teacher's edition books.

1005
01:31:20,327 --> 01:31:28,932
[SPEAKER_12]: And all general education classrooms have a classroom set of student books as well.

1006
01:31:30,293 --> 01:31:39,399
[SPEAKER_12]: I am now in talks with the special education teachers to see if they need a couple of books to help with students' IEPs and 504s.

1007
01:31:41,156 --> 01:31:45,299
[SPEAKER_12]: and they will be back in touch with me as to how much they are needed.

1008
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:49,743
[SPEAKER_12]: If they really need it now, we have some in reserve and we are happy to send them.

1009
01:31:50,644 --> 01:31:56,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I know EL teachers books have been ordered because the structure changed over the summer.

1010
01:31:57,369 --> 01:32:06,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I had ordered one because at that time in June, beginning of July when the PO went in, we only had one.

1011
01:32:06,356 --> 01:32:07,257
[SPEAKER_12]: The structure changed.

1012
01:32:07,617 --> 01:32:10,059
[SPEAKER_12]: We are happy to give more support.

1013
01:32:10,419 --> 01:32:17,721
[SPEAKER_12]: to the students in the classroom, but that does mean that we are kind of backlogged on the EL teachers, teachers' editions.

1014
01:32:17,821 --> 01:32:24,644
[SPEAKER_12]: But what gives me a little bit of comfort is that at least they are able to pull it up online.

1015
01:32:24,784 --> 01:32:31,406
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that we are totally dependent on a physical book, although I do know that

1016
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:35,633
[SPEAKER_12]: The physical book is very important for some of us.

1017
01:32:35,993 --> 01:32:36,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I do acknowledge that.

1018
01:32:37,935 --> 01:32:41,318
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern is more for consumable and non-consumable.

1019
01:32:41,398 --> 01:32:50,647
[SPEAKER_03]: The list that I have right here for sixth grade, the consumables, yes, they are easy to add, easy to pick up things.

1020
01:32:50,767 --> 01:32:51,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Doc stickers, power

1021
01:32:52,742 --> 01:32:58,963
[SPEAKER_03]: drink mix, colored pencil, masking tape, index cards, sticky notes, glue sticks, paper cups, food coloring.

1022
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:05,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things you can bring from home or whatever, but I'm just wondering if we're expecting teachers to do that annually.

1023
01:33:06,145 --> 01:33:12,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And non-consumable items that we should have, do we have measuring tapes, cups and spoons?

1024
01:33:12,966 --> 01:33:15,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have wooden and plastic cubes for them to be using?

1025
01:33:16,127 --> 01:33:26,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have the 10 base blocks, the cinders, the meter sticks, the digital scale, the scissors, the snap cubes, the tape, the bingo chips, the playing cards, the whiteboards?

1026
01:33:27,137 --> 01:33:30,319
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many, many items for these non-consumables.

1027
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:37,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only do we need them in the regular ed students' hands, we need them in every classroom that is teaching this program.

1028
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:42,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure if we're hitting a program, we're up and running day one.

1029
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:43,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Teachers have what they need.

1030
01:33:44,187 --> 01:33:45,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Education is starting.

1031
01:33:45,607 --> 01:33:47,168
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not waiting for deliveries.

1032
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:51,528
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew we voted for this early last year.

1033
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:54,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get why we're still waiting for supplies.

1034
01:33:54,909 --> 01:33:58,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that our teachers have the materials to teach it well.

1035
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:01,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Math is a focus for this district this year.

1036
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:10,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be successful in saying we bought the best program and we can prove it because we started off right.

1037
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get it right.

1038
01:34:12,096 --> 01:34:16,678
[SPEAKER_03]: for your sake, for our children's sake, for our teachers' sake, that's all I'm employing.

1039
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:20,880
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be ready, day one.

1040
01:34:21,361 --> 01:34:24,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to fix this as if this is not happening.

1041
01:34:24,782 --> 01:34:27,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like an update at our next meeting.

1042
01:34:27,784 --> 01:34:33,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like a list of what teachers have, everything that's recommended, and what they're missing.

1043
01:34:34,047 --> 01:34:41,931
[SPEAKER_03]: For all teachers, not just regular ed classrooms, I want to know how many books, who's missing what, who needs stuff, and how much money it's going to cost to get it to them.

1044
01:34:42,315 --> 01:34:44,576
[SPEAKER_03]: that we didn't provide enough funds for.

1045
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is a priority.

1046
01:34:46,456 --> 01:34:50,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you've been working very hard, and I applaud you for your effort.

1047
01:34:50,337 --> 01:34:53,178
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't do it by yourself, and I want to stand up and help you.

1048
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:53,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1049
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:58,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So I make a motion for it to come before us again with that list.

1050
01:34:59,139 --> 01:35:02,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I need one of my colleagues to get an update on any backlogged items.

1051
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second on the floor by Ms.

1052
01:35:04,721 --> 01:35:05,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloof?

1053
01:35:05,861 --> 01:35:06,521
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1054
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:08,141
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1055
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:09,942
[SPEAKER_05]: That motion passes.

1056
01:35:09,962 --> 01:35:10,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1057
01:35:10,022 --> 01:35:10,302
[SPEAKER_05]: DeRusso.

1058
01:35:11,516 --> 01:35:11,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1059
01:35:13,598 --> 01:35:22,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, number of divinadettos sort of took a bit of a half, just about everything I had to say, but that's all right.

1060
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:30,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Around the accelerated, what percent of the seventh graders go on to take algebra one in eighth grade?

1061
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:32,832
[SPEAKER_12]: What percent?

1062
01:35:32,892 --> 01:35:36,233
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have the numbers here and done.

1063
01:35:37,994 --> 01:35:44,595
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have 72 students from seventh grade as of now.

1064
01:35:45,876 --> 01:35:57,599
[SPEAKER_12]: If we don't have any movement, we have about 72 of them and we also have around the same number in eighth grade this year.

1065
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:00,820
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm assuming most of them move forward.

1066
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:02,641
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a big drop off.

1067
01:36:03,281 --> 01:36:03,421
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1068
01:36:03,601 --> 01:36:05,122
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1069
01:36:06,422 --> 01:36:07,243
[SPEAKER_09]: That's helpful.

1070
01:36:09,864 --> 01:36:12,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm looking at the wrong notes.

1071
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:12,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1072
01:36:14,006 --> 01:36:14,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know.

1073
01:36:14,586 --> 01:36:22,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we looked at the kids that are testing into the accelerated math to determine what elementary schools they went to.

1074
01:36:24,643 --> 01:36:27,264
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I have not done that data analysis.

1075
01:36:27,404 --> 01:36:38,246
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to do it, but I want to be hopeful that all schools are participating.

1076
01:36:38,406 --> 01:36:40,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I would certainly like that piece of information.

1077
01:36:40,346 --> 01:36:41,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we need it.

1078
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:42,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I can do that.

1079
01:36:42,066 --> 01:36:42,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1080
01:36:42,647 --> 01:36:45,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's not that simple in school brains.

1081
01:36:45,807 --> 01:36:46,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I get that.

1082
01:36:46,507 --> 01:36:47,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, yes.

1083
01:36:47,647 --> 01:36:48,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand.

1084
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,382
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a lot of reservations around the accelerated math.

1085
01:36:54,482 --> 01:37:04,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think you and I have spoken about this whole idea that these kids are really being taught how to just get things done quickly and not have a deep understanding.

1086
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:16,138
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is probably too hard of a question, but are these kids really sticking with math is really my issue and point.

1087
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:19,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Are these kids in accelerated math

1088
01:37:20,526 --> 01:37:23,907
[SPEAKER_09]: just as likely as the kids who are not in accelerated math to take calculus?

1089
01:37:24,087 --> 01:37:29,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these are questions that I feel like you probably have a better sense of than I do.

1090
01:37:29,129 --> 01:37:31,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that's actually a great question.

1091
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:39,873
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have pondered deeply about it because I wondered, you know, we are giving, you know,

1092
01:37:40,808 --> 01:37:47,115
[SPEAKER_12]: a class teacher's one section time to these students, what's going on moving forward.

1093
01:37:47,636 --> 01:37:57,687
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I can do some number crunching, but I would say that there are students who don't want to go the accelerated path once they

1094
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:58,980
[SPEAKER_12]: reach high school.

1095
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,781
[SPEAKER_12]: The numbers might not be astronomical.

1096
01:38:01,821 --> 01:38:09,163
[SPEAKER_12]: There are more students who want to double up and reach calculus than students who say, I don't want to go that path.

1097
01:38:09,943 --> 01:38:18,125
[SPEAKER_12]: But there are cases like that where a child or a student did it because they wanted to be with their friend.

1098
01:38:18,946 --> 01:38:25,212
[SPEAKER_12]: or the parents wanted them to go a certain path, or at that time they were really interested in mathematics.

1099
01:38:25,292 --> 01:38:33,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And it happens that your priorities change, your love for a subject or your interest in a subject changes.

1100
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:34,902
[SPEAKER_12]: This is all human.

1101
01:38:35,162 --> 01:38:36,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1102
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:37,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't pay you for that, just so we're clear.

1103
01:38:38,565 --> 01:38:43,250
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern is around the well-documented drop-off in girls and math.

1104
01:38:44,102 --> 01:38:51,607
[SPEAKER_09]: And aside from what schools these kids are coming from, and I realize 72 is not a big number.

1105
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:54,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can only draw so many conclusions from that.

1106
01:38:54,649 --> 01:39:01,914
[SPEAKER_09]: But understanding the demographics of those 72 students, and also the trajectory.

1107
01:39:01,954 --> 01:39:12,341
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, are all the girls taking middle school accelerated math, and then they get to high school, and all the girls are not in the math courses that they would

1108
01:39:13,154 --> 01:39:15,034
[SPEAKER_09]: that we would hope them to remain in.

1109
01:39:15,054 --> 01:39:22,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm not making that up that girls are not interested in math after middle school as a general statement.

1110
01:39:22,176 --> 01:39:23,656
[SPEAKER_09]: There are plenty of girls, I'm sure, that are.

1111
01:39:23,736 --> 01:39:26,637
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just depressing.

1112
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:27,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Something's happening.

1113
01:39:28,037 --> 01:39:33,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And it isn't that girls are suddenly not mathematically inclined when they get to high school.

1114
01:39:33,518 --> 01:39:41,660
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think if there's anything we're doing that is feeding into that, we should really take a hard look at that.

1115
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:47,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, the point that you have brought up is a nationwide discussion.

1116
01:39:47,947 --> 01:39:55,694
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are definitely things that we should ponder about and think about.

1117
01:39:55,774 --> 01:39:57,715
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is a great point.

1118
01:39:57,836 --> 01:40:01,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I mentioned, this is a national debate.

1119
01:40:01,839 --> 01:40:06,503
[SPEAKER_12]: I taught AP computer science for three or four years at the high school.

1120
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:18,547
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed that trend, too, so we really pushed for girls in STEM and many other initiatives, girls who code with Tufts, and we really tried to market that.

1121
01:40:18,607 --> 01:40:25,532
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think there can be many initiatives that can be taken, but what you're saying has validity to it.

1122
01:40:26,033 --> 01:40:26,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

1123
01:40:26,753 --> 01:40:27,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1124
01:40:27,073 --> 01:40:27,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

1125
01:40:28,274 --> 01:40:30,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Kritz.

1126
01:40:30,256 --> 01:40:32,478
[SPEAKER_20]: So the questions I had, you had already answered.

1127
01:40:32,518 --> 01:40:36,541
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the copy paper and the textbooks and the supplies

1128
01:40:37,085 --> 01:40:38,306
[SPEAKER_20]: I had all the same questions.

1129
01:40:39,106 --> 01:41:00,840
[SPEAKER_20]: I did have one more, and I know we talked about this last year, and I know it's really early on, but I think, Michael, you might have mentioned this, that we wanted to go for an observation day, and maybe sit, I know it's very early on, it's just they're still getting set up and established, but I would really love to go and be invited to the class, and just for the day, without interrupting the instruction, but just,

1130
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:05,863
[SPEAKER_20]: participate with the students, if that's something that would be possible.

1131
01:41:06,063 --> 01:41:07,364
[SPEAKER_12]: I have it in my mind.

1132
01:41:07,765 --> 01:41:11,788
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point in time, I have given teachers some room.

1133
01:41:12,029 --> 01:41:13,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I have given them some room.

1134
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:15,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I just started going.

1135
01:41:15,832 --> 01:41:21,938
[SPEAKER_12]: At first, I was communicating with emails, and then I actually went in after school and said, what is missing?

1136
01:41:22,338 --> 01:41:23,379
[SPEAKER_12]: How can we help you?

1137
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:27,626
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, this last week, I was into classrooms a lot more.

1138
01:41:28,087 --> 01:41:35,813
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to give them some room and feel that we are confident in their capabilities.

1139
01:41:35,873 --> 01:41:39,877
[SPEAKER_12]: So when it's the right time, I will definitely let you know.

1140
01:41:39,917 --> 01:41:43,860
[SPEAKER_12]: But know that it is on my mind, and I have taken a note of it.

1141
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:44,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1142
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:45,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1143
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:47,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1144
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:48,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, one last question.

1145
01:41:48,992 --> 01:41:51,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to ask you this, but it's on my list.

1146
01:41:52,055 --> 01:42:00,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we know what percentage of the two class books that are being taken out for children that don't have access to computers at home?

1147
01:42:01,247 --> 01:42:03,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we know how many of those books are being checked out?

1148
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:09,532
[SPEAKER_12]: We do not know it yet because many teachers received them just last week.

1149
01:42:10,112 --> 01:42:11,892
[SPEAKER_12]: The numbering took a long time.

1150
01:42:12,412 --> 01:42:17,514
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will know better.

1151
01:42:17,654 --> 01:42:29,357
[SPEAKER_12]: As I said, I have requested all special education teachers and general education teachers to let me know if they need a set or two or five student sets extra.

1152
01:42:29,867 --> 01:42:39,666
[SPEAKER_12]: to make sure students are learning and this year it will be a lot of treading on that and next year we will be in better shape but this year.

1153
01:42:40,516 --> 01:42:42,197
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a challenge.

1154
01:42:42,497 --> 01:42:48,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I imagine just sort of with the demographics, I'm sure there's some classes that it's a much higher population.

1155
01:42:48,881 --> 01:42:52,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, are there lots of teachers saying, Faiz, I need books like now?

1156
01:42:53,344 --> 01:42:55,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Are a lot of teachers bugging you about that?

1157
01:42:55,305 --> 01:43:03,710
[SPEAKER_12]: There are about three teachers who have, special education teachers, who have reached out to me about the extra books.

1158
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:08,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of those, one of them I said absolutely.

1159
01:43:09,708 --> 01:43:15,310
[SPEAKER_12]: They wanted two extra books and it was a smaller class size as compared to the others.

1160
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:17,951
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had extras and I happily sent it.

1161
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:20,532
[SPEAKER_12]: Others had a bigger number request.

1162
01:43:20,572 --> 01:43:32,956
[SPEAKER_12]: So I said, please keep an eye and let me know within a month as to are your needs still persisting or you think that it's something that can be taken care of with photocopies.

1163
01:43:32,996 --> 01:43:36,757
[SPEAKER_12]: And at that time, we'll order more or we'll look in our,

1164
01:43:38,878 --> 01:43:41,799
[SPEAKER_12]: in our inventory to see what else is there.

1165
01:43:41,859 --> 01:43:42,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to the update.

1166
01:43:42,759 --> 01:43:43,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1167
01:43:43,299 --> 01:43:44,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. DiCiro.

1168
01:43:44,099 --> 01:43:46,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1169
01:43:46,959 --> 01:43:47,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1170
01:44:04,283 --> 01:44:05,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I go before her next time?

1171
01:44:06,243 --> 01:44:06,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

1172
01:44:08,297 --> 01:44:10,339
[SPEAKER_14]: freezing in here, but thanks for having me.

1173
01:44:12,922 --> 01:44:15,925
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, I want to thank everyone behind the rail for this initiative.

1174
01:44:15,985 --> 01:44:20,990
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gone fantastic, from the mayor to the superintendent to the entire school committee.

1175
01:44:22,491 --> 01:44:25,074
[SPEAKER_14]: We feel as though this initiative, we're going to keep some kids home.

1176
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:28,577
[SPEAKER_14]: It allows us to build relationships between the middle schools,

1177
01:44:29,971 --> 01:44:32,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Rachel Perry, Nick Tucci, Michael Downs, they've been incredible.

1178
01:44:33,094 --> 01:44:34,415
[SPEAKER_14]: We have three great coaches.

1179
01:44:34,475 --> 01:44:35,496
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had great weather.

1180
01:44:36,217 --> 01:44:38,519
[SPEAKER_14]: We're already three weeks into the middle school season.

1181
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:45,805
[SPEAKER_14]: It ends the last week in October and I'm sure our teams are going to do very well to participate.

1182
01:44:46,343 --> 01:44:47,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Participation has been incredible.

1183
01:44:48,445 --> 01:44:50,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Cross country had 50 kids out.

1184
01:44:51,788 --> 01:44:54,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Middle school baseball had 35 kids out.

1185
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:55,932
[SPEAKER_14]: And softball had another 30 kids out.

1186
01:44:56,032 --> 01:44:58,594
[SPEAKER_14]: So the three coaches have done a great job with the kids.

1187
01:44:59,275 --> 01:45:03,159
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, Mr. Tucci and Mike Downs have been incredible assets down the school.

1188
01:45:03,971 --> 01:45:10,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And at this time, I'd like to thank you for all the work you put in, because getting the GVL back off the ground was not an easy task.

1189
01:45:11,274 --> 01:45:18,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And with you and the other communities, we've sat at the table many, many times over the course of the summer to make sure this was in place and working.

1190
01:45:19,065 --> 01:45:25,649
[SPEAKER_05]: and that we're representative, and really to make those other communities that voted us out feel a little bad about this.

1191
01:45:26,189 --> 01:45:30,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully someday we'll go back and play them and show them what we're all about.

1192
01:45:30,651 --> 01:45:30,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1193
01:45:30,971 --> 01:45:34,653
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a great principal too, Paul DeLame, who's very supportive, so we're very lucky.

1194
01:45:34,974 --> 01:45:36,414
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of hard work, so thank you.

1195
01:45:38,195 --> 01:45:38,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1196
01:45:38,896 --> 01:45:40,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So motion to approve this report?

1197
01:45:40,797 --> 01:45:41,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Place it on file.

1198
01:45:42,598 --> 01:45:44,479
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1199
01:45:44,499 --> 01:45:44,879
[SPEAKER_05]: VanDekloot.

1200
01:45:44,939 --> 01:45:45,639
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1201
01:45:45,659 --> 01:45:47,040
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1202
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:47,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1203
01:45:48,703 --> 01:45:50,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on Dyslexia Screening Tools, Ms.

1204
01:45:51,005 --> 01:45:51,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Caldwell.

1205
01:45:52,526 --> 01:45:53,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

1206
01:45:53,307 --> 01:46:01,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like just to take an opportunity to thank all the people who've been working on my committee for screening for some dyslexia tools.

1207
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:12,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single one of the elementary teacher, principals have been working hard, Susanna Campbell, Katie Champoli, and Dr. Nicole Chiesa.

1208
01:46:12,523 --> 01:46:13,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to start by thanking them.

1209
01:46:14,844 --> 01:46:20,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start by reading a quote, and this comes from the International Dyslexia Association.

1210
01:46:21,549 --> 01:46:38,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Since research has shown that the rapid growth of the brain and its response to instruction in the primary years makes the time from birth to age eight a critical period for literacy development, it is essential to identify the instructional needs of struggling students as soon as possible.

1211
01:46:39,764 --> 01:46:47,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Screening measures are typically brief assessments of particular skill or ability that is highly predictive of a late outcome.

1212
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:57,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Screening measures are designed to quickly differentiate students into one of two categories, those that require intervention and those that do not.

1213
01:46:58,217 --> 01:47:07,583
[SPEAKER_02]: A screening measure needs to focus on specific discrete reading skills that are highly correlated with the broader measures of reading achievement.

1214
01:47:07,784 --> 01:47:08,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

1215
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:15,831
[SPEAKER_02]: resulting in a highly accurate sorting of students.

1216
01:47:16,491 --> 01:47:27,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Universal screening results should identify those students who are potentially at risk for reading failure, including those who may have developed reading disabilities.

1217
01:47:27,614 --> 01:47:30,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So Medford Public Schools is partnering with

1218
01:47:30,987 --> 01:47:46,072
[SPEAKER_02]: the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and other districts in the Commonwealth to pilot specific screening tools that will assist us in identifying, thank you so much, potentially at-risk students, specifically in literacy.

1219
01:47:47,533 --> 01:47:55,496
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of August, DESE informed our district that we were awarded the MAPS grant for the Columbus Elementary School.

1220
01:47:56,216 --> 01:47:58,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Martha Coakley, not the one that you know,

1221
01:47:59,675 --> 01:48:06,238
[SPEAKER_02]: is the consultant to MAPS, is providing professional development to our staff and administrators throughout the school year.

1222
01:48:07,299 --> 01:48:16,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, we were lucky enough to have DESE award us the Lexia Rapid Grant to the McGlynn Elementary School.

1223
01:48:17,383 --> 01:48:21,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And as part of our Title IV grant, we requested the DIBLS 8 screening tool.

1224
01:48:22,085 --> 01:48:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: The Brooks and the Roberts will be using the DIBLS 8.

1225
01:48:27,093 --> 01:48:36,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Kate Champoli, Coordinator of Special Education, will oversee the MAP screening tool, along with Dr. Kay, Principal of the Columbus Elementary School.

1226
01:48:37,299 --> 01:48:46,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Susanna Campbell, who is Supervisor of Speech and Language, will oversee the Alexia Rapid screening tool at the McGlynn, along with Diane Guarino, who is the Principal.

1227
01:48:48,085 --> 01:48:49,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Nicole Chiesa,

1228
01:48:49,721 --> 01:48:57,606
[SPEAKER_02]: will oversee DIBLS 8 screening at the Roberts with Principal Kirk Johnson and at the Brooks with Principal Suzanne Glusi.

1229
01:48:58,146 --> 01:49:03,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of these three people have already met, spoken, and worked with the principals.

1230
01:49:03,849 --> 01:49:08,512
[SPEAKER_02]: They are working with the companies to provide professional development.

1231
01:49:08,612 --> 01:49:11,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be set up in the next couple of weeks.

1232
01:49:12,611 --> 01:49:41,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the beginning of the school year, our screening pilot committee, consisting of the administrators above, have been meeting regularly with myself to discuss professional development for each of the assessments, providing assistance to our classroom teachers with our literacy and EL staff as they begin their assessments, this is specifically at the Columbus Elementary School, and requesting technology assistance to download classes and teachers from school rings to the specific screening tool.

1233
01:49:42,634 --> 01:49:55,765
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, these are all online assessments, and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education asked us to pilot four different screening tools, and we were lucky enough to get two.

1234
01:49:57,126 --> 01:49:58,728
[SPEAKER_02]: We are discussing currently

1235
01:50:00,666 --> 01:50:07,469
[SPEAKER_02]: A rubric, the evaluation of the screening tools, and a train-the-trainer model for future professional development.

1236
01:50:08,009 --> 01:50:08,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1237
01:50:08,249 --> 01:50:09,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Champoli, Ms.

1238
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:14,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Campbell, and Dr. Chiesa will provide you with another update in October.

1239
01:50:14,992 --> 01:50:20,634
[SPEAKER_02]: What I wanted to do was to give these administrators some time to work with the principals to develop

1240
01:50:21,649 --> 01:50:31,636
[SPEAKER_02]: to contact the companies and do the professional development and hopefully start some of these assessments within the next few weeks, and then they could report back to you.

1241
01:50:33,417 --> 01:50:41,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, DESE is offering limited statewide professional development workshops on dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia.

1242
01:50:42,263 --> 01:50:47,567
[SPEAKER_02]: These workshops are highly competitive with limited enrollment, but we are proud to announce

1243
01:50:48,015 --> 01:50:52,237
[SPEAKER_02]: that three members of our McGlynn staff were chosen to attend these workshops.

1244
01:50:53,178 --> 01:50:57,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of our teaching staff filled out applications for this PD opportunity.

1245
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:09,546
[SPEAKER_02]: The three McGlynn teachers chosen will provide professional development for our elementary staff in a train-the-trainers model, and this PD will be happening in October and November.

1246
01:51:10,926 --> 01:51:14,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I've provided you with the three different assessments.

1247
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:17,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't go through them because you can read them,

1248
01:51:18,373 --> 01:51:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Dilexia Rapid, and DIBLS, as well as the MAPS.

1249
01:51:25,256 --> 01:51:34,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of these screening tools will be given three times a year, sometime in the fall and winter, and then in the spring.

1250
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be happy to answer any questions.

1251
01:51:38,461 --> 01:51:39,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1252
01:51:39,918 --> 01:51:40,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the report.

1253
01:51:40,878 --> 01:51:47,540
[SPEAKER_10]: This was, I'm speaking for myself, but I think for the other members as well, this was very important that we work on this.

1254
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:55,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the element of the dyscalculia, I'm mispronouncing it, of course, I'm sorry, elements of this.

1255
01:51:56,282 --> 01:52:06,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Do any of these screenings actually address those concerns as well, or dysgraphia is the other issue, or these are all directly, we're mostly concerned with dyslexia in these initial incidents.

1256
01:52:06,084 --> 01:52:07,364
[SPEAKER_02]: We are mostly concerned with that.

1257
01:52:08,284 --> 01:52:13,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to check with the experts would be Susanna Campbell probably would answer that question for you.

1258
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:14,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1259
01:52:14,991 --> 01:52:19,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And in terms of the workshops being very competitive.

1260
01:52:19,615 --> 01:52:28,423
[SPEAKER_10]: So the idea here is that the teacher is going to attend the PD and then they're going to come and share the ideas that they learned from these workshops to all the other teachers.

1261
01:52:29,642 --> 01:52:36,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All the elementary teachers, yes, we're spending a lot of time doing some professional development with our staff.

1262
01:52:36,646 --> 01:52:46,531
[SPEAKER_02]: This one specifically was from the Department of Education, and I think we might have had 50 of our elementary teachers who applied for it.

1263
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:48,572
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to fill out an application and write some essays.

1264
01:52:49,389 --> 01:52:53,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So the department wanted to have all of the teachers from one building.

1265
01:52:54,052 --> 01:52:57,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why they chose the McGlynn Elementary School.

1266
01:52:57,533 --> 01:52:59,855
[SPEAKER_02]: But any one of our schools could have been chosen.

1267
01:52:59,875 --> 01:53:01,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just the McGlynn Elementary.

1268
01:53:01,716 --> 01:53:01,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

1269
01:53:02,636 --> 01:53:04,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like a strange process.

1270
01:53:04,097 --> 01:53:12,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the teachers you would expect to have the professional development would be the ones that are struggling the most to address the problem in the population.

1271
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:18,565
[SPEAKER_10]: And while I think it's great that three teachers were selected to learn this program, I mean,

1272
01:53:19,105 --> 01:53:21,646
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be great if we could have all the teachers attend.

1273
01:53:21,846 --> 01:53:22,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great.

1274
01:53:22,686 --> 01:53:24,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure they would comply with that.

1275
01:53:25,407 --> 01:53:38,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also want to let you know that in our own method professional development, we are offering a series of three workshops that will be taking place in the fall, winter, and in the spring.

1276
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:47,312
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our teachers, actually two of our middle school teachers that will be providing this professional development

1277
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:52,261
[SPEAKER_02]: is Jacqueline Sarasulo, who is a reading specialist in K-12.

1278
01:53:52,662 --> 01:53:55,663
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a master's in special education, Wilson Level 1.

1279
01:53:56,403 --> 01:54:06,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And Noreena Abramian, who has a CAGS in literacy and language from MGH, plus a license as a reading specialist in K-12, and a master's in secondary education.

1280
01:54:07,627 --> 01:54:13,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So these teachers will be providing workshops such as instruction

1281
01:54:14,398 --> 01:54:15,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, let me read that again.

1282
01:54:15,439 --> 01:54:30,786
[SPEAKER_02]: The pillars of reading, breaking down the elements of successful reading instruction, implementing phonemic awareness strategies in the classroom, as well as phonics and fluency strategies in the classroom, and vocabulary and comprehension strategies in the classroom.

1283
01:54:32,067 --> 01:54:38,310
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, we will be attending, there's a handful of us that will be attending a workshop

1284
01:54:39,159 --> 01:54:40,400
[SPEAKER_02]: at Harbin Medical School.

1285
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:43,002
[SPEAKER_02]: The name of the course is Dyslexia and Literacy.

1286
01:54:43,102 --> 01:54:45,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be on Friday, October 18th.

1287
01:54:46,164 --> 01:54:50,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And the workshop is Understanding Spelling, Orthography, and it links to reading.

1288
01:54:51,368 --> 01:54:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a group of five or six of us that will be attending that as well.

1289
01:54:56,331 --> 01:55:05,198
[SPEAKER_02]: This Wednesday, there's a webinar that's on the science, how science should inform reading, which I will do from my office.

1290
01:55:05,857 --> 01:55:11,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really very busy trying to make sure that we get the correct screeners.

1291
01:55:11,879 --> 01:55:17,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that once we have our teachers, they're doing the best they can.

1292
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:18,700
[SPEAKER_02]: School has just started.

1293
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:20,541
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only 18 days into it.

1294
01:55:21,121 --> 01:55:22,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And our kindergarten is only 13 days.

1295
01:55:22,901 --> 01:55:27,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think within the next two to three weeks, we'll be able to do some assessing.

1296
01:55:28,123 --> 01:55:28,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1297
01:55:28,563 --> 01:55:28,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1298
01:55:30,483 --> 01:55:31,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo.

1299
01:55:31,843 --> 01:55:32,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for this.

1300
01:55:32,484 --> 01:55:33,424
[SPEAKER_09]: This report was actually

1301
01:55:34,795 --> 01:55:36,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I shouldn't be surprised, but it was excellent.

1302
01:55:36,696 --> 01:55:48,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciated that where there were deficits in the individual screeners, you're all, you're filling and covering for all of those.

1303
01:55:48,243 --> 01:55:49,604
[SPEAKER_09]: That made me so very happy.

1304
01:55:51,125 --> 01:56:02,332
[SPEAKER_09]: One question I had was, I see that the map product is available in Spanish, and I just realized I have no idea how we handle

1305
01:56:04,648 --> 01:56:11,091
[SPEAKER_09]: have in the past or how we are planning to handle students who are not, English isn't their primary language.

1306
01:56:11,432 --> 01:56:15,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was interesting that you asked that question because I spoke to Mr. Texera about that.

1307
01:56:16,874 --> 01:56:21,637
[SPEAKER_02]: We will assess our grade 1 and 2 students because it gives those students a baseline.

1308
01:56:22,397 --> 01:56:23,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go from there.

1309
01:56:24,058 --> 01:56:31,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of, we would do a DRA on all students, special ed students, EL students, and our regular classroom students.

1310
01:56:31,122 --> 01:56:31,382
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1311
01:56:31,582 --> 01:56:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Gives them a baseline.

1312
01:56:33,463 --> 01:56:33,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1313
01:56:34,565 --> 01:56:36,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1314
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1315
01:56:36,486 --> 01:56:36,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Van der Kloot.

1316
01:56:37,687 --> 01:56:43,790
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanted to ask you about the grade implementation, because on one it says K to 2.

1317
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:47,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we doing K to 2 students in all the schools?

1318
01:56:48,372 --> 01:56:51,253
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing K to 2 students in all the elementary schools, yes.

1319
01:56:51,293 --> 01:56:52,254
[SPEAKER_02]: In all the elementary schools?

1320
01:56:52,294 --> 01:56:52,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1321
01:56:52,854 --> 01:56:53,354
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1322
01:56:53,675 --> 01:56:57,496
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we, is this a one-on-one?

1323
01:57:00,265 --> 01:57:06,127
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because it's an online screener, you can actually put headphones on all of the students.

1324
01:57:06,767 --> 01:57:09,128
[SPEAKER_02]: But with kindergarten, they're little.

1325
01:57:09,788 --> 01:57:15,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have started working with our kindergartners over at the Columbus School with Martha Coakley.

1326
01:57:15,850 --> 01:57:18,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And she brought in a team of people to help her.

1327
01:57:18,751 --> 01:57:24,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And Title I and our reading specialists and EL teachers also are being trained, so they help.

1328
01:57:25,336 --> 01:57:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So they worked with like four or five kids.

1329
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:30,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It took a little bit longer, and it's the first time.

1330
01:57:31,626 --> 01:57:36,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But the grades one and grade two will just get online and do it in one shot.

1331
01:57:37,434 --> 01:57:41,140
[SPEAKER_02]: In actuality, the time commitment will be shorter to do this.

1332
01:57:41,914 --> 01:57:45,795
[SPEAKER_02]: than using the DRA, which is an individualized assessment.

1333
01:57:46,255 --> 01:57:59,020
[SPEAKER_13]: I think at some point, if it's possible, once they get a little bit of practice, I think it would be great if school committee members who are available could go and watch an implementation, see what a child is doing.

1334
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that would be great.

1335
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:01,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they'd like to see it too.

1336
01:58:01,921 --> 01:58:02,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1337
01:58:02,981 --> 01:58:03,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1338
01:58:04,661 --> 01:58:05,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms. DiBenedetto.

1339
01:58:05,982 --> 01:58:06,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1340
01:58:07,983 --> 01:58:09,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Diane, thank you for the report.

1341
01:58:10,126 --> 01:58:16,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for making sure that all students K through 12 will get the screenings, not only to you, but to the district as a whole.

1342
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:22,372
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us were very happy to see this come forward.

1343
01:58:22,972 --> 01:58:26,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to know what our next steps are going to be as a district.

1344
01:58:27,155 --> 01:58:37,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we identify students' needs and how we're going to work with them to close that reading gap so that way they are meeting all reading

1345
01:58:40,234 --> 01:58:41,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Benchmarks.

1346
01:58:41,255 --> 01:58:41,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, benchmarks.

1347
01:58:41,996 --> 01:58:42,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1348
01:58:42,536 --> 01:58:43,397
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain is tired.

1349
01:58:43,777 --> 01:58:50,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry So I just like to know like what our next steps as a district are

1350
01:58:50,478 --> 01:59:02,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also heard last time that there was a dyslexia committee and if we were going to open that up to parents and when, how that will look and what will that look forward to?

1351
01:59:02,587 --> 01:59:05,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really don't have a dyslexia committee.

1352
01:59:06,349 --> 01:59:13,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a screening committee made up of just the administrators and myself for the time being.

1353
01:59:14,735 --> 01:59:16,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I did communicate with Ms.

1354
01:59:16,256 --> 01:59:18,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronayne, who is actually in the audience here tonight,

1355
01:59:19,144 --> 01:59:25,148
[SPEAKER_02]: that as soon as we can put together a committee that she'll be the first one involved in that.

1356
01:59:25,188 --> 01:59:29,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping to do that, but we're just getting our feet wet, getting up and running.

1357
01:59:29,351 --> 01:59:40,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of this school year, the Department of Education is supposed to be making a decision about what's best for our state.

1358
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:44,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're telling us they may not know until the fall of 2020.

1359
01:59:45,836 --> 01:59:48,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we're being proactive instead of reactive.

1360
01:59:48,678 --> 01:59:49,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think so.

1361
01:59:49,559 --> 01:59:51,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've done a lot of work.

1362
01:59:51,381 --> 01:59:51,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1363
01:59:51,701 --> 01:59:56,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's clear that that the groundwork is here, but we need a plan for the next phase.

1364
01:59:56,425 --> 02:00:03,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so once we're, our children are identified, maybe we could have some conversations, um, from now till Christmas.

1365
02:00:03,551 --> 02:00:08,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way, as children are identified, we have a plan to move them forward.

1366
02:00:09,075 --> 02:00:11,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we need to be clear about.

1367
02:00:13,044 --> 02:00:14,265
[SPEAKER_02]: We red flag them.

1368
02:00:14,445 --> 02:00:16,106
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be red flagged.

1369
02:00:16,587 --> 02:00:20,710
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the authority to say, this child has dyslexia.

1370
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:23,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But there may be a tendency towards dyslexia.

1371
02:00:24,453 --> 02:00:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you would have to do further testing with that student.

1372
02:00:28,976 --> 02:00:30,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have that test right now.

1373
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:42,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, because in your quote, it says right there that it says you either are identified as needing supports or in interventions or not.

1374
02:00:43,015 --> 02:00:48,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to know what our plan for interventions are once children are identified.

1375
02:00:48,496 --> 02:00:50,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know you won't have this answer now.

1376
02:00:50,736 --> 02:00:55,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is a future question, but let's have those conversations.

1377
02:00:55,138 --> 02:00:57,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it should go into the

1378
02:00:57,591 --> 02:01:01,697
[SPEAKER_03]: curriculum subcommittee and just have some ideas and brainstorming.

1379
02:01:01,717 --> 02:01:06,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a district, what we can put in place to help move these students forward.

1380
02:01:07,087 --> 02:01:12,349
[SPEAKER_03]: and to make sure that those benchmarks are made and that we make progress for them.

1381
02:01:12,829 --> 02:01:24,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I also wanted to know when the district's MCAS scores are going to be released, and I wanted to follow up on students that, you know, weren't doing well a few years ago.

1382
02:01:24,774 --> 02:01:32,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want to make sure that those students' growth has caught up and is moving forward and that we're not losing any

1383
02:01:35,794 --> 02:01:41,717
[SPEAKER_03]: reading skills or ELA abilities in any specific grade level.

1384
02:01:42,097 --> 02:01:45,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we looked at that a few years ago and I'd like to look at that again.

1385
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:46,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.

1386
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:51,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I know those, that they're not common knowledge yet and I know it will be soon.

1387
02:01:52,203 --> 02:01:59,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we could convene a curriculum subcommittee meeting sometime mid to late October.

1388
02:01:59,167 --> 02:02:00,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1389
02:02:01,803 --> 02:02:02,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all your work.

1390
02:02:06,203 --> 02:02:11,665
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to publicly thank Ms.

1391
02:02:11,705 --> 02:02:27,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Diane Caldwell for her wonderful leadership with the team of administrators that she's working with, Dr. Chiesa, Katie Trampoli, and Susanna Campbell.

1392
02:02:28,773 --> 02:02:33,655
[SPEAKER_18]: The fact that you see the three different programs that are listed here, we are truly

1393
02:02:35,336 --> 02:02:37,157
[SPEAKER_18]: ahead of the curve, ahead of the eight ball.

1394
02:02:38,138 --> 02:02:43,661
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be doing our own data analysis and our own data collection alongside with DESE.

1395
02:02:44,442 --> 02:02:54,068
[SPEAKER_18]: And over the course of this year, to really look at what are the strengths and weaknesses of these programs, DESE will be collecting their data.

1396
02:02:54,808 --> 02:03:04,090
[SPEAKER_18]: But once they gather all the data, they're gonna make a recommendation to the state, but we're not sitting down and just ignoring this mandate.

1397
02:03:04,611 --> 02:03:14,973
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to restate that we are taking it very seriously, and we want to be able to get an accurate read on where our students are at this point in time.

1398
02:03:15,633 --> 02:03:22,515
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I just wanted to emphasize that to you all, the committee, that we are taking this very seriously.

1399
02:03:23,015 --> 02:03:34,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Our teachers are taking it very seriously, and I look forward to see what the data, the preliminary data shows us regarding these assessments and sharing that information with you, the committee, as well.

1400
02:03:34,439 --> 02:03:35,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1401
02:03:35,159 --> 02:03:36,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1402
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:38,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to proceed with this report?

1403
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:39,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1404
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:40,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

1405
02:03:40,101 --> 02:03:40,941
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1406
02:03:41,361 --> 02:03:41,981
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1407
02:03:42,021 --> 02:03:42,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1408
02:03:42,641 --> 02:03:43,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

1409
02:03:43,082 --> 02:03:43,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Caldwell.

1410
02:03:45,302 --> 02:03:49,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, report on English Learner Department's updates.

1411
02:03:49,424 --> 02:03:50,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Texera.

1412
02:03:57,637 --> 02:03:58,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1413
02:03:58,298 --> 02:03:59,119
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be quick.

1414
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:01,023
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like 9,000 degrees in here.

1415
02:04:04,709 --> 02:04:06,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I have to start the projector.

1416
02:04:49,668 --> 02:04:50,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, everyone.

1417
02:04:52,688 --> 02:05:08,502
[SPEAKER_15]: The EL department had a successful summer, or successful summer programs, and that was thanks to the support of May Abu Hassan, Ghislaine Pinto, Emma Rangel, Laney Cahill, Amanda Davis, Teresa Casagnetti, and David York.

1418
02:05:09,243 --> 02:05:11,425
[SPEAKER_15]: I ran three concurrent programs.

1419
02:05:11,925 --> 02:05:14,367
[SPEAKER_15]: High school students were able to take summer classes.

1420
02:05:15,387 --> 02:05:20,529
[SPEAKER_15]: to make up missed credits or get extra credits during the summer to help with graduation.

1421
02:05:20,549 --> 02:05:22,930
[SPEAKER_15]: It was all funded through the Title III grant.

1422
02:05:23,691 --> 02:05:32,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Middle school students had five weeks of project-based enrichment activities, and they focused on social studies and science.

1423
02:05:33,895 --> 02:05:37,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Each week, the Yale Summer Enrichment Program had a theme with a culminating field trip.

1424
02:05:38,817 --> 02:05:42,039
[SPEAKER_15]: So the first week was learning about Massachusetts history,

1425
02:05:44,054 --> 02:05:47,495
[SPEAKER_15]: They got to learn interesting facts, the geography of Massachusetts.

1426
02:05:48,015 --> 02:05:52,876
[SPEAKER_15]: The week ended with a mini civics lesson and a trip to the State House.

1427
02:05:53,956 --> 02:05:59,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Students had the unique opportunity to view government, both past and present, here in Massachusetts.

1428
02:06:02,398 --> 02:06:07,379
[SPEAKER_15]: In the second week of the program, students researched famous bridges and structures from around the world.

1429
02:06:08,697 --> 02:06:14,782
[SPEAKER_15]: They learned the engineering design process, and the project ended with an in-house field trip from Rita Advani.

1430
02:06:15,202 --> 02:06:23,829
[SPEAKER_15]: She's a scientist and engineer who helped the students construct bridges, beams, and columns with paper products and tested weight loads with textbooks.

1431
02:06:25,070 --> 02:06:26,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything was created with paper.

1432
02:06:27,592 --> 02:06:29,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Students designed their own bridges.

1433
02:06:29,693 --> 02:06:35,938
[SPEAKER_15]: They did the weight loads using nuts and bolts to determine what load could be handled on their bridges.

1434
02:06:39,929 --> 02:06:43,130
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the third week of the program focused on rules of the game.

1435
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:53,812
[SPEAKER_15]: In the classroom, students learned grammar, vocabulary, number graphing, developing step-by-step, developing and following step-by-step instructions.

1436
02:06:54,252 --> 02:06:58,493
[SPEAKER_15]: And the week ended with a game day in the courtyard at MHS.

1437
02:06:58,573 --> 02:07:05,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Students played Paper Battleship, Cornhole, Headbands, and Yahtzee, Giant Jenga.

1438
02:07:07,396 --> 02:07:11,657
[SPEAKER_15]: During the fourth and fifth weeks of the program, students learned about oceans and marine life.

1439
02:07:11,897 --> 02:07:16,179
[SPEAKER_15]: They researched endangered species, analyzed the reasons for near extinction.

1440
02:07:16,699 --> 02:07:19,621
[SPEAKER_15]: The project ended with a field trip to the New England Aquarium.

1441
02:07:24,263 --> 02:07:26,443
[SPEAKER_15]: The third program was Starbase.

1442
02:07:27,044 --> 02:07:29,505
[SPEAKER_15]: This is our second year with our partnership with Starbase.

1443
02:07:30,635 --> 02:07:33,217
[SPEAKER_15]: and that's a STEM lab at Hanscom Air Force Base.

1444
02:07:33,938 --> 02:07:44,425
[SPEAKER_15]: So students got to design crash test cars, and they worked in teams to choose three safety features to a modified matchbox.

1445
02:07:45,146 --> 02:07:51,811
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they crashed their car with an egg to determine which safety features would be the most effective.

1446
02:07:52,511 --> 02:07:54,253
[SPEAKER_15]: They got to pick the safety features.

1447
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:57,015
[SPEAKER_15]: They could only use items that were available in the lab.

1448
02:07:58,595 --> 02:08:07,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Then students designed robot cars and they had to code, write the code to program them to have them go around the track.

1449
02:08:08,421 --> 02:08:11,022
[SPEAKER_15]: They had to start and stop in the right place on the map.

1450
02:08:11,382 --> 02:08:15,525
[SPEAKER_15]: They had to stay on the track as well as calculate all of the turns.

1451
02:08:17,461 --> 02:08:22,325
[SPEAKER_15]: And then these robot cars were kind of transformers that grew some arms and legs.

1452
02:08:23,265 --> 02:08:30,350
[SPEAKER_15]: And the students had to program these cars to travel on the surface of the moon and pick up garbage and throw it away.

1453
02:08:30,711 --> 02:08:35,394
[SPEAKER_15]: And students wrote the code to move, lift, and drop the trash into the designated areas.

1454
02:08:37,215 --> 02:08:38,997
[SPEAKER_15]: And then students made their own derby cars.

1455
02:08:40,256 --> 02:08:51,946
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they raced them using CO2 propulsion, and they made predictions on which cars would go fast based on design and design elements, again, going back to the engineering design process.

1456
02:08:52,866 --> 02:08:55,789
[SPEAKER_15]: All of this was covered under the Title III grant.

1457
02:09:00,114 --> 02:09:03,037
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it happens at Hanscom Air Force Base.

1458
02:09:03,077 --> 02:09:07,962
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not drafting students for the military, but this is where the STEM lab happens to be.

1459
02:09:07,982 --> 02:09:14,949
[SPEAKER_15]: And so students got to see a parade, and they also have people come in to talk about STEM careers.

1460
02:09:15,069 --> 02:09:21,475
[SPEAKER_15]: That's also part of the program that they get to take part in.

1461
02:09:21,495 --> 02:09:24,198
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1462
02:09:29,059 --> 02:09:38,483
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have to look, but the males definitely, I think it's probably, one, two, three, four.

1463
02:09:39,383 --> 02:09:45,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd say six to three, so six males, three females.

1464
02:09:45,526 --> 02:09:52,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Although, there were 11 students in the program, so I don't know where some are right now in this picture, but I can look up the data for you.

1465
02:09:56,656 --> 02:09:59,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions on the summer programming before we move on to the next part?

1466
02:10:03,438 --> 02:10:09,120
[SPEAKER_15]: So for the enrollment data, last January I gave a presentation on the enrollment numbers.

1467
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:12,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I explained back then, we have a pretty fluid population.

1468
02:10:12,321 --> 02:10:13,542
[SPEAKER_15]: It changes from year to year.

1469
02:10:14,349 --> 02:10:15,670
[SPEAKER_15]: week to week basically.

1470
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:22,215
[SPEAKER_15]: At one point in the district, at one point we had 500 English learners and then that changes.

1471
02:10:22,235 --> 02:10:30,022
[SPEAKER_15]: And then of course in June we have our end of year meetings to determine placement and that changes the numbers for the following year.

1472
02:10:30,923 --> 02:10:41,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I did look it up and last year we reclassified 88 students in the district as from being English learners to being former English learners.

1473
02:10:41,656 --> 02:10:48,820
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that obviously brought our starting numbers down in this September because of that.

1474
02:10:50,501 --> 02:10:57,985
[SPEAKER_15]: But the Parent Information Center is registering new students and new families are coming in every day and it's still happening.

1475
02:10:58,005 --> 02:10:58,746
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just...

1476
02:11:03,001 --> 02:11:06,603
[SPEAKER_15]: put this together to give you that moment in time for new enrollments.

1477
02:11:07,083 --> 02:11:09,925
[SPEAKER_15]: So September 18th, 2018, we had tested 165 students, and of those 165 students, 110 qualified for services.

1478
02:11:09,945 --> 02:11:13,367
[SPEAKER_15]: September 18th, 2019, this year, we tested 211 students, and of those 211, 138 are English learners.

1479
02:11:13,407 --> 02:11:14,307
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are our numbers.

1480
02:11:29,787 --> 02:11:31,949
[SPEAKER_15]: for this point in time in terms of new enrollment.

1481
02:11:32,269 --> 02:11:37,213
[SPEAKER_15]: But this also doesn't count students who have transferred in from other districts that we have scores for.

1482
02:11:37,674 --> 02:11:41,517
[SPEAKER_15]: If they had taken access in their previous district, we don't test them upon intake.

1483
02:11:41,597 --> 02:11:45,080
[SPEAKER_15]: So the number of Yale students is slightly higher than that 138 for new students.

1484
02:11:49,992 --> 02:11:58,375
[SPEAKER_15]: There are also, as of the writing of this, there are currently eight students waiting to be medically cleared, and I don't know how many students are still somewhere in the registration pipeline.

1485
02:11:58,675 --> 02:12:03,597
[SPEAKER_15]: But most new enrollments at this point in time through the Parent Information Center are English learner families.

1486
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:10,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to take a moment to acknowledge Jessie Reinhold, who's the assessment specialist for the department.

1487
02:12:12,223 --> 02:12:14,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Jessie is welcoming to our family.

1488
02:12:14,563 --> 02:12:16,204
[SPEAKER_15]: She's exemplary at her job.

1489
02:12:17,084 --> 02:12:21,506
[SPEAKER_15]: She takes time with each family and with each student that she tests.

1490
02:12:22,486 --> 02:12:24,227
[SPEAKER_15]: She's extremely detail-oriented.

1491
02:12:24,327 --> 02:12:26,087
[SPEAKER_15]: She makes placement decisions with 100% accuracy.

1492
02:12:27,828 --> 02:12:32,090
[SPEAKER_15]: And she's a tremendous asset to the EL department and to the EL families in Medford.

1493
02:12:32,530 --> 02:12:33,951
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't do this without her.

1494
02:12:34,571 --> 02:12:41,414
[SPEAKER_15]: And these 211 tests, it's a four-domain test, reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

1495
02:12:41,855 --> 02:12:50,318
[SPEAKER_15]: The test can take upwards of three hours per student, especially if they're in high school and they have English and we have to administer the math test.

1496
02:12:51,279 --> 02:12:54,340
[SPEAKER_15]: So she does this single-handedly, and it's pretty amazing.

1497
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:55,101
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm lucky to have her.

1498
02:12:57,946 --> 02:13:00,587
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the last part of the report is Lesley University.

1499
02:13:01,508 --> 02:13:04,130
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my second year with the partnership that I have.

1500
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:07,992
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is different from the district's partnership with Lesley University.

1501
02:13:09,273 --> 02:13:15,918
[SPEAKER_15]: We get, it's the Elementary Education Urban Initiative, EEUI program.

1502
02:13:16,498 --> 02:13:21,542
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the teachers in this program are in a master's program to get elementary ed certified.

1503
02:13:22,062 --> 02:13:24,083
[SPEAKER_15]: And they get an add-on EL license.

1504
02:13:24,264 --> 02:13:25,264
[SPEAKER_15]: And how they do that is,

1505
02:13:26,607 --> 02:13:29,389
[SPEAKER_15]: by doing a year-long internship in one of our schools.

1506
02:13:30,249 --> 02:13:41,536
[SPEAKER_15]: So last year we had two interns, Emma Rangel and Lisa Petri, and we actually hired Emma to fill a retirement at the McGlynn Middle School.

1507
02:13:41,616 --> 02:13:45,518
[SPEAKER_15]: She's sixth grade certified, so, and that comes in with the,

1508
02:13:46,872 --> 02:13:54,962
[SPEAKER_15]: partnership that I have with Nick Tucci and Faiza Khan with shifting the math program over to co-teaching as well.

1509
02:13:56,003 --> 02:14:00,888
[SPEAKER_15]: That allowed us to have co-teaching in both science and math.

1510
02:14:02,570 --> 02:14:09,856
[SPEAKER_15]: The math is new this year, but we're also continuing with the professional development we gave to the teachers last year, the science and EL teachers on co-teaching.

1511
02:14:10,296 --> 02:14:16,922
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll go into year two of that, and then math teachers will run concurrently with that as year one.

1512
02:14:17,862 --> 02:14:24,147
[SPEAKER_15]: So the Lesley program gives us the opportunity to basically get second year teachers who have been trained by

1513
02:14:25,208 --> 02:14:42,453
[SPEAKER_15]: The best teachers we have, we use Christine Hingston, who is at the Roberts, was one of the teachers who mentored one of the candidates, and then Teresa Casagnetti was the other, who also mentored Emma, who we ended up hiring.

1514
02:14:43,034 --> 02:14:53,317
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's kind of a win-win program, where we get a pool of teachers who have been trained by our best teachers to come into the district.

1515
02:14:55,824 --> 02:14:57,286
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this year we have two more.

1516
02:14:57,927 --> 02:15:09,262
[SPEAKER_15]: One is at the Brooks School this year working with mainstream classroom teacher, Suzanne Sarami, and Allie Kennedy, an EL teacher, and then Christine Hingston has another intern in her program at the Roberts this year.

1517
02:15:25,629 --> 02:15:30,833
[SPEAKER_03]: That summer program, is there any way to make sure that we can offer that every year?

1518
02:15:32,214 --> 02:15:32,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Which one?

1519
02:15:32,934 --> 02:15:35,797
[SPEAKER_15]: The Starbase or the enrichment?

1520
02:15:35,817 --> 02:15:36,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Both.

1521
02:15:36,417 --> 02:15:46,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I mean so the biggest struggle is finding teachers to do the program and that's again why I wanted to make sure I acknowledged everybody because without them there wouldn't have been a summer program.

1522
02:15:47,645 --> 02:15:51,348
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a struggle trying to find a teacher to do the entire five weeks.

1523
02:15:51,849 --> 02:15:58,675
[SPEAKER_15]: So then that's when we kind of brainstormed and came up with the idea of doing theme weeks and different teachers did the different weeks.

1524
02:15:59,295 --> 02:16:00,996
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that worked out really well.

1525
02:16:01,057 --> 02:16:03,338
[SPEAKER_15]: And so hopefully we can just expand on that next year.

1526
02:16:03,939 --> 02:16:06,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like it was a lot of fun had by everybody.

1527
02:16:07,742 --> 02:16:10,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the forward thinking of bringing in

1528
02:16:11,989 --> 02:16:28,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Students from Leslie is is a great plus for our community because we don't have to pay them they get x Experience and we get expertise to choose from when we do need to replace our retiring best teachers Thank you Thank you
