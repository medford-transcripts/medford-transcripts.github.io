    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=9.7">Hey</a>  listeners, this is Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=11.46">And</a>  Shelley. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=12.701">Shelley</a>  is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=15.642">And</a>  Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=19.023">And</a>  this is the Medford Bites podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=22.003">Every</a>  two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=29.745">Join</a>  us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=33.206">And</a>  as always, tell us where you like to eat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=42.328">Thanks</a>  for joining me tonight. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=44.189">If</a>  you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=49.813">Yeah,</a>  Dave McGillivray. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=53.576">I</a>  am the president and founder of DMSE Sports and longtime race director of the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=63.423">And</a>  the list goes on and on, but I'll keep it contained to that for the moment.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=70.044">Yeah,</a>  so sports and running we're going to talk about tonight, which is great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=74.627">Before</a>  we get into that part, though, if you don't mind sharing, the question that we ask everyone on the podcast is what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=85.393">Well,</a>  I don't live in Medford any longer, so there's been a lot of changes, obviously, over the years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=95.558">But</a>  lately, when I visit, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=98.816">there's</a>  a Raising Cane's chicken place there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=105.018">And</a>  so I like chicken. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=107.398">And</a>  so that's the place I typically go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=110.159">And</a>  they just have that one meal, chicken and fries and, and, you know, I, anything and everything, but in moderation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=118.061">So</a>  maybe once every couple of months, I might stop by there.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=125.148">Yeah,</a>  I think that area has gotten a reputation for all the chicken stores. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=129.77">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=131.151">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=131.411">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=132.391">Well,</a>  so I know you wear a few different hats. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=134.952">I</a>  think one of the primary things we wanted to talk about today was Run Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=140.375">But</a>  I know that people have probably heard your name because you have a children's book about your run from Medford to Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=149.479">So</a>  Medford, Oregon to Medford, Mass. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=152.22">I</a>  don't know if it's reversed or whatever.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=154.821">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=155.201">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=155.481">And</a>  my son was actually at, um, I know you've talked to like a lot of like kids groups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=158.944">My</a>  son was actually at the power kids camp a few years ago when you came to speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=161.966">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=162.346">I</a>  remember that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=163.086">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=164.027">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=164.687">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=165.027">What</a>  would you like us to know about Ron Medford or could you tell us a little bit about, um, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=171.051">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=171.431">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=171.792">So</a>  back in 1978, I was, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=179.795">wanted</a>  to do something different, maybe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=182.356">I've</a>  heard about a friend of mine who had biked across the United States from Method, Mass and Method, Oregon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=187.758">And</a>  I thought, well, if he can bike across, I'm a runner, I can run across. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=192.739">Well,</a>  it's kind of an idiotic comparison, biking and running, but I was a runner and I just said, I need to train and work hard and give it a shot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=203.103">So</a>  before I took off, I <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=206.563">said,</a>  can I really do this as a personal challenge alone? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=211.245">And</a>  I thought, if I combined it with a greater purpose than just me, maybe that would not only help the cause, but help me get through the difficult times that I knew I would be experiencing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=228.171">So</a>  I ended up doing it for the Jimmy Fund of Boston, which is the fundraising arm of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=237.153">And</a>  I was told by runners world magazine once that that was the first time someone had combined running with raising money for cancer research so I felt good about that whether it's true or not I don't know but I know that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=253.267">you</a>  know, running and philanthropy weren't necessarily what it is today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=259.851">It</a>  seems like every road race in America now is to benefit some cause. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=265.594">The</a>  Boston Marathon, every year we raise between 40 and $50 million for various charities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=274.199">So</a>  I flew out to the West Coast and ceremonially started in the kingdom in Seattle, doing a Red Sox-Seattle Mariners baseball game. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=282.622">next</a>  morning get up, flew down to Medford, Oregon and took off and ran 80 consecutive days without a day off and 45 to 50 miles a day and landed in Medford, Mass on August 29, 1978 at City Hall and then left City Hall after a ceremony there and ran to Boston <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=307.589">and</a>  ran into Fenway Park in front of 32,000 people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=311.791">So</a>  to this day, given all the different things I might have accomplished since, I still look at that as the highlight of my athletic career, you know, fulfilling a commitment to run across the continent and then running into Fenway Park for the finale. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=331.361">So</a>  after that, I opened up a running store <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=335.943">in</a>  Medford, in Haines Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=338.564">And</a>  then I started putting on some events to promote the store. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=344.285">And</a>  I decided after a few years that I like putting on events more than shoes on people's feet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=350.386">So</a>  I sold the store and focused all my attention on my own event management company, DMSC Sports. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=358.308">And</a>  since then, I've helped manage, direct, consult on over 1,400 events <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=365.458">all</a>  over the country, all over the world now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=368.319">Everything</a>  from the Olympic Games to U.S. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=371.421">Olympic</a>  Marathon trials, to world championship events, to national championship events, and so forth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=379.784">So,</a>  you know, the very first event I ever did was a triathlon in Medford called the Big State Triathlon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=387.607">And</a>  the swim was in Wright's Pond, and the bike was around Spot Pond, and the run was around Spot Pond. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=394.351">And</a>  that was like the very first event I ever really directed and put on a few more events in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=402.814">And</a>  then eventually I moved out of Medford, moved up to North Andover. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=407.335">And</a>  now, you know, basically 50 years later, I just said, I never want to forget where I came from. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=416.458">I</a>  never want to forget the people who gave me a chance to succeed in life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=421.915">So</a>  I decided to come up with a race to give back to the city of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=428.518">And</a>  we've done it for three years now called Run Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=431.32">And</a>  it's a series of kids events, a five mile race, a 5K race, a two mile walk, a celebrity mile, a high school mile, a para-adaptive mile. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=441.605">So</a>  a little bit of something for everyone is within the overall scheme of this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=449.377">So</a>  for this year, the fourth year, the kids' events will be at Carmel Stadium on the track there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=455.54">They</a>  named the track after me last year, so it's pretty cool to have, I guess, a track named after you, Dave McGilvey track. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=462.643">I</a>  ran on that track 50 years ago in high school, and then now it's actually named after me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=469.247">So</a>  we're gonna have the kids' events there on Friday night, September 26th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=476.903">And</a>  then Saturday morning, September 27th at City Hall in Medford Square, we'll have all the other races that morning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=486.946">So</a>  looking forward to a really good event this year where proceeds from the event are being donated to the, I think there's five to eight PTOs in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=502.97">So</a>  basically given back to the, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=505.415">all</a>  the schools in the city to support various kids programs within the school system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=513.78">So</a>  that's the whole idea is, you know, I give back to the city that helped give me my start.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=521.805">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=522.325">You</a>  know, it sounds like the event is giving back in terms of like, you know, financial resources, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=527.429">Making</a>  donations to the PTOs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=529.87">I</a>  wonder though, it sounds like running has served a real purpose in your life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=534.473">I</a>  can't believe you ran an ultra marathon every day for 80 days in a row. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=539.895">That's</a>  wild. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=540.816">It</a>  sounds like you shared that there were certain things that you had to prepare for in terms of how you might struggle during that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=548.1">I</a>  do think running is a practice in lots of different disciplines. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=552.602">I</a>  wonder if there's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=554.403">anything</a>  that anything else that you hope like the kids in Medford or the residents of Medford to get out of this event as well?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=561.644">Yeah,</a>  well, people say to me all the time, what do you do for a living? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=565.525">And</a>  I said, Well, you know, in essence, I'm a race director, and they're like a race director, what do they do, like, chalk marking the road, y'all go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=574.767">And</a>  now when people ask me, what do I do for a living? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=578.287">I</a>  say I help raise the level of self esteem and self confidence of 10s of 1000s of people in America. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=584.199">And</a>  that's what I think, you know, participating in, you know, events like this do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=591.702">People</a>  say, or ask me, what's the toughest part about running a marathon? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=596.444">Oh,</a>  the toughest part? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=598.603">signing</a>  the application, having the guts and the courage to commit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=603.847">Once</a>  you commit, then you have to do the work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=606.368">You</a>  have to earn the right to toe the line. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=608.29">Then</a>  you toe the line, you answer the gun, you run the course, you cross the finish line, you get a medal, and magic happens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=617.436">You</a>  go home feeling good about yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=619.878">And</a>  there's nothing more powerful in anyone's life, especially children, than to feel good about themselves, because it's the foundation <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=627.602">by</a>  which we accomplish everything in our lives. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=630.164">So</a>  my ultimate goal in everything I do, whether it's motivational speaking appearances, putting on road races, whatever, is just to make people feel good about themselves, however that might come about, and to encourage them to set goals and not limits and to believe in themselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=651.85">So</a>  and I basically go through my entire athletic career as a lessons learned along the way in terms of what struggles I've had and how I've overcome them and how in some cases to attain a goal, you know, maybe you can't go left, but then you go right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=675.187">There's</a>  always a path. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=676.99">to</a>  the succeeding at what you set out to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=681.392">And</a>  so that's what I try to instill in, especially in kids in the school system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=687.374">Because</a>  a lot of times, you know, I wrote a book called The Last Pick, because actually when I was growing up in Midford, you know, I was, I always wanted to be a professional athlete. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=699.438">I</a>  wanted to play second bases at Fenway Park, but I was short in stature. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=705.441">And</a>  so <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=706.65">All</a>  the kids I hung around with were mainly athletes and they were pretty tall, strong guys. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=714.135">And</a>  here's little Dave. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=715.816">And</a>  so I was always the last one picked when my friends pick sides or the last one cut when I went out for the teams. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=723.742">And</a>  I'm not saying I didn't deserve to be picked or I did or anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=727.685">It's</a>  just, I had to just deal with what I was experiencing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=731.988">And</a>  the whole concept of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=735.996">rejection,</a>  you know, feeling not wanted or needed was almost debilitating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=744.361">And</a>  I said, I gotta fight this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=746.262">I</a>  gotta figure a way out of this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=748.404">And</a>  that's when I started running because no one can catch you from running, you know, just go run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=754.868">And</a>  since then I've run about 165,000 miles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=756.048">I've</a>  run 171 marathons. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=756.909">I've</a>  run the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=764.618">53</a>  years in a row. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=766.319">I've</a>  done 10 Ironman triathlons in Hawaii. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=769.64">I</a>  mean, I ran up the East Coast of America. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=772.741">I</a>  mean, the list goes on and on and on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=774.821">And</a>  I continually challenge myself, because I want to feel good about me too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=780.623">And</a>  so I think all this resonates with everyone, not just children, but adults alike, that we all need to be told that, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=792.835">we</a>  may think we're the last pick or the no pick, but there's always ways to overcome that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=800.897">Yeah,</a>  that sounds like a really powerful message, like especially for children, but like for any of us, right, that have sort of struggled to find our thing or to fit in or to feel confident. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=811.68">I'm</a>  wondering if you have a favorite event that you've organized or that you've run.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=817.001">Well,</a>  of course, the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=818.781">How</a>  do you top that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=820.382">I</a>  mean, it's the most <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=821.698">prestigious</a>  endurance event in the world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=825.739">And</a>  I got offered the job in 1988 to help direct it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=831.18">Really</a>  tough to turn down an opportunity like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=833.821">So</a>  I've been there for the last 38 years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=837.582">So</a>  obviously that's near and dear to my heart. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=841.282">But</a>  there's plenty of other events that I'm involved with. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=845.073">I</a>  actually put on a marathon once inside of Fenway Park. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=849.455">The</a>  whole marathon was on the warning track. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=851.576">So</a>  it was 116 laps. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=854.398">So</a>  50 of us, I directed it and ran in it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=858.179">And</a>  it was just surreal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=859.34">Like</a>  here's the place I always wanted to play in, and now I'm running a marathon inside of it, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=866.804">And</a>  this, so many other events that I have participated in, there's so many other events that I have directed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=874.141">again,</a>  all over the world, that it's hard to pick one over the other, because they all had their individual characteristics and uniqueness that made them attractive and interesting to either direct or run in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=889.335">But</a>  I've been very lucky through all of this that I've been able to combine sort of a passion with a vocation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=899.621">And</a>  I try to tell people the ultimate goal in life, if you have to earn a living, which most of us do, then it makes a lot of sense to do it with something that you love, that you're passionate about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=917.15">When</a>  I get asked by kids all the time, what do you do for work? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=920.052">I</a>  say, I don't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=921.092">They</a>  say, you don't work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=922.193">I</a>  say, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=923.2">No,</a>  not in the traditional or conventional sense of the word, because most people work to earn money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=930.262">I</a>  get it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=931.782">But</a>  it's like nine to five to stay alive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=937.363">I</a>  love what I do so much that I don't consider it work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=943.624">And</a>  I think that that should be everyone's goal, to find something that they enjoy and love and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=951.904">so</a>  much that every day they're excited about getting up and, quote-unquote, going to work, even though it may not feel like it's work for them.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=964.633">And</a>  it sounds like you sort of figured that out by maybe trying some things that didn't work out, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=970.4">Like</a>  that, like, and I think for kids, that's an important message is like, sometimes the things that we maybe fail at, or think we want to do, like, in the failing presents us with another option, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=979.611">That</a>  we might? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=980.071">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=981.373">Well,</a>  I even say to people that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=986.284">in</a>  the world I live in, and again, I don't preach, I don't try to teach people, I just try to show by example and lessons learned, my own personal experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=997.811">But</a>  I never looked at anything that I attempted to do, but maybe not accomplish it as failure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1007.316">And</a>  in my life, there's only one way you can fail, and that's not to try. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1013.36">Because</a>  if you try and you don't, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1016.026">succeed</a>  totally at what you had hoped to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1018.887">It's</a>  not failure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1020.067">It's</a>  a learning experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1022.527">And</a>  then you just put your big boy or big girl pants on and go at it again the next time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1030.129">There's</a>  always tomorrow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1033.169">So</a>  you should at least give yourself credit for having the guts and the courage to try. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1037.95">And</a>  I have a lot of different mantras <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1047.68">sayings</a>  in my life to help me get through each day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1052.184">You</a>  know, when I was living in Medford on my 12th birthday, I woke up the day of my birthday and I ran around Spot Pond in Medford, and it was six miles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1065.194">And</a>  then later on in the day after cake and ice cream, I ran around it again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1068.776">So</a>  I ran <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1070.378">12</a>  miles on my 12th birthday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1071.939">I</a>  thought that was pretty cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1074.24">I</a>  turned 13, I ran 13 on my 13th birthday, and 14 on my 14th, and 15, and 15. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1079.103">When</a>  I turned 50, I ran 50 miles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1082.105">When</a>  I turned 60, I ran 60 miles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1084.986">You</a>  know, now I'm 70, and I've been doing this for 58 years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1090.049">And</a>  people say, or ask me, what are you going to do when you turn 90? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1095.72">I</a>  said, I don't know, I wanna be breathing first, I guess, that's a priority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1100.344">And</a>  then get out of bed and I'll figure it out then. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1105.388">But</a>  my motto in life has always been, it's my game, so it's my rules. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1110.993">So</a>  I can always change the rules. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1113.695">I</a>  can always set it up for success and not failure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1117.178">So</a>  each and every day I think about that, that it's my life, it's my game. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1123.132">So</a>  it's my rules to live by. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1124.612">And</a>  I always try to teach people never to be discouraged by other people who either don't believe in you or don't think you should try something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1138.496">Those</a>  who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it kind of thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1146.919">And</a>  then people ask me all the time, you've done all these different things, what's your best accomplishment? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1152.865">I</a>  always say, well, my best accomplishment is my next one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1157.766">What</a>  do you got for me lately? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1158.807">Because,</a>  I mean, the past is gone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1161.647">You</a>  can't live back there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1163.068">And</a>  a lot of people have a tendency of doing that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1166.369">Like,</a>  where they are today, they're probably not in a comfort zone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1172.839">I</a>  don't know, they don't feel good about themselves, but when they go back to where they came from and live back there a little bit, it's like, oh, I used to do this and I could do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1182.466">Well,</a>  that was before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1183.887">What</a>  about now? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1185.628">So</a>  for me, it's always, yeah, using what I've accomplished in the past as a foundation of confidence in believing in myself, but always <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1196.763">setting</a>  new goals going forward and not limits, you know, live for today, plan for tomorrow, not live in the past. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1205.128">So</a>  it's always what's out there, what's the next one I want to go after? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1210.112">And</a>  again, kids say, you know, the dandest questions, but like, what do you want to be when you grow up? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1219.718">You</a>  know, what makes you want to grow up? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1224.065">But,</a>  um, I saw a billboard on the highway, actually right in the method area on route 93, a couple of years ago, and the billboard had one word on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1234.547">And</a>  the word was accomplisher. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1237.168">And</a>  I said, that's it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1238.808">That's</a>  what I want to be an accomplisher. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1241.549">All</a>  I want to do is set a goal, work hard, earn the right, accomplish it, check it off, move on to the next one.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1251.511">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1253.394">Well,</a>  I'm wondering what the most common question you get about your run from Medford to Medford is.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1260.578">You</a>  know, there's a bunch of questions, you know, how many pairs of shoes did you wear? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1265.681">You</a>  know, things like that, just the mechanics of it all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1271.384">Like,</a>  how did you do that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1273.065">If</a>  you ran 45, 50 miles a day, did you run it all at once? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1277.488">Did</a>  you break it out? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1279.029">So,</a>  cause I can't just like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1282.057">they</a>  can't understand how someone could do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1285.96">First</a>  of all, I was young, I was 23 and I didn't know any better. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1290.123">So</a>  there was no real fear involved in the process at all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1295.568">But</a>  there was a lot of little tricks to it in a sense of like for me, I ran 10 miles at a time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1305.215">I</a>  had a crew of two or three guys with me at a time in a motor home. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1311.788">So</a>  I would leave the motorhome at, say, 6.30 in the morning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1315.851">And</a>  then I'd take off, and maybe 45 minutes later, the motorhome would take off. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1320.374">And</a>  then it'd see me down the road and pass me and go to the 10-mile point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1324.097">So</a>  I'd run until I saw the motorhome again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1327.42">And</a>  that was 10 miles, because I had no other way of knowing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1329.882">There</a>  was no GPS back then, or cell phones, or anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1334.105">No</a>  Garmin watches. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1335.526">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1336.186">No</a>  Garmins, no nothing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1338.128">And</a>  I'd go into the motorhome, get some of the E, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1341.977">You</a>  know, come out 10 minutes later, do another 10. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1344.919">Go</a>  back in the motorhome, do another 10, another 10, another 10. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1348.501">So</a>  I'd break it up into 10 mile segments for the most part. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1352.524">And</a>  I would just think about the next 10 miles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1354.885">I</a>  wouldn't think about 50 for the day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1356.707">I'd</a>  think of 10. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1358.688">And</a>  it's a form of immediate gratification. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1361.129">Get</a>  that done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1362.39">You</a>  feel good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1363.051">All</a>  right, now let that one go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1365.232">You</a>  got the next one on deck. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1367.634">Go</a>  get that one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1370.57">As</a>  far as footwear, you know, I brought like eight different pairs of shoes with me in different styles and different manufacturers, different models. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1382.18">And</a>  so every time I came back in after a 10 mile split, I changed my shoes and I put on a different pair because I felt like it was almost like a renewal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1391.548">Like</a>  I put on a different pair and went out to run and my legs weren't as sore because I'm, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1399.871">accenting</a>  sort of different muscle groups, you know, with a different pair of shoes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1404.732">And</a>  that was a little thing I figured out that helped me get through each day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1410.854">So</a>  there's things like that along the way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1413.814">I</a>  mean, it was like 120 degrees in the desert and running 14,000 feet over the Rocky Mountains and all that kind of thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1423.636">But</a>  I just had a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1427.412">take</a>  one day at a time, and I never really, the weather was the weather, and it didn't matter, because I was getting out there anyways. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1438.536">And</a>  there was, in a sense, no such thing as bad weather, just bad gear. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1442.877">In</a>  other words, you just gotta dress properly for the conditions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1448.599">And</a>  that's what I did, and nothing ever slowed me down.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1454.659">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lqQ8bRRMJFxG5HNizTRRS?t=1455.019">I'm</a>  wondering if there's anything else that you want to make sure that we know about you or not.</p>
