00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:28,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:32,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:43,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining me tonight.

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,733
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:52,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Dave McGillivray.

12
00:00:53,576 --> 00:01:02,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the president and founder of DMSE Sports and longtime race director of the Boston Marathon.

13
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:09,147
[SPEAKER_00]: And the list goes on and on, but I'll keep it contained to that for the moment.

14
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:13,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so sports and running we're going to talk about tonight, which is great.

15
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:24,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get into that part, though, if you don't mind sharing, the question that we ask everyone on the podcast is what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

16
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:33,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't live in Medford any longer, so there's been a lot of changes, obviously, over the years.

17
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:38,180
[SPEAKER_00]: But lately, when I visit,

18
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,737
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a Raising Cane's chicken place there.

19
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,878
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like chicken.

20
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,079
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the place I typically go.

21
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,801
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just have that one meal, chicken and fries and, and, you know, I, anything and everything, but in moderation.

22
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:03,642
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe once every couple of months, I might stop by there.

23
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:08,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that area has gotten a reputation for all the chicken stores.

24
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

25
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:11,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

26
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

27
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so I know you wear a few different hats.

28
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:19,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the primary things we wanted to talk about today was Run Medford.

29
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:29,419
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know that people have probably heard your name because you have a children's book about your run from Medford to Medford.

30
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So Medford, Oregon to Medford, Mass.

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's reversed or whatever.

32
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

33
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:35,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

34
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,924
[SPEAKER_03]: And my son was actually at, um, I know you've talked to like a lot of like kids groups.

35
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: My son was actually at the power kids camp a few years ago when you came to speak.

36
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:42,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

37
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:42,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.

38
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:43,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

39
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:44,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

40
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:45,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

41
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:50,311
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you like us to know about Ron Medford or could you tell us a little bit about, um, yeah.

42
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:51,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

43
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:51,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

44
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,273
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in 1978, I was, um,

45
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:02,096
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do something different, maybe.

46
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:07,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about a friend of mine who had biked across the United States from Method, Mass and Method, Oregon.

47
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:11,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, if he can bike across, I'm a runner, I can run across.

48
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:22,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of an idiotic comparison, biking and running, but I was a runner and I just said, I need to train and work hard and give it a shot.

49
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I took off, I

50
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:31,225
[SPEAKER_00]: said, can I really do this as a personal challenge alone?

51
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:47,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, if I combined it with a greater purpose than just me, maybe that would not only help the cause, but help me get through the difficult times that I knew I would be experiencing.

52
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:55,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up doing it for the Jimmy Fund of Boston, which is the fundraising arm of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

53
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:12,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was told by runners world magazine once that that was the first time someone had combined running with raising money for cancer research so I felt good about that whether it's true or not I don't know but I know that.

54
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:19,831
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, running and philanthropy weren't necessarily what it is today.

55
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:24,813
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like every road race in America now is to benefit some cause.

56
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:33,378
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boston Marathon, every year we raise between 40 and $50 million for various charities.

57
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:41,523
[SPEAKER_00]: So I flew out to the West Coast and ceremonially started in the kingdom in Seattle, doing a Red Sox-Seattle Mariners baseball game.

58
00:04:42,622 --> 00:05:06,535
[SPEAKER_00]: next morning get up, flew down to Medford, Oregon and took off and ran 80 consecutive days without a day off and 45 to 50 miles a day and landed in Medford, Mass on August 29, 1978 at City Hall and then left City Hall after a ceremony there and ran to Boston

59
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,431
[SPEAKER_00]: and ran into Fenway Park in front of 32,000 people.

60
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:29,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So to this day, given all the different things I might have accomplished since, I still look at that as the highlight of my athletic career, you know, fulfilling a commitment to run across the continent and then running into Fenway Park for the finale.

61
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,783
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, I opened up a running store

62
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:37,603
[SPEAKER_00]: in Medford, in Haines Square.

63
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:42,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started putting on some events to promote the store.

64
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:49,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided after a few years that I like putting on events more than shoes on people's feet.

65
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:57,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sold the store and focused all my attention on my own event management company, DMSC Sports.

66
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:03,790
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, I've helped manage, direct, consult on over 1,400 events

67
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,739
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the country, all over the world now.

68
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from the Olympic Games to U.S.

69
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:19,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Olympic Marathon trials, to world championship events, to national championship events, and so forth.

70
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:27,507
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the very first event I ever did was a triathlon in Medford called the Big State Triathlon.

71
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:33,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And the swim was in Wright's Pond, and the bike was around Spot Pond, and the run was around Spot Pond.

72
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:42,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the very first event I ever really directed and put on a few more events in Medford.

73
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:46,395
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually I moved out of Medford, moved up to North Andover.

74
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:56,438
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, basically 50 years later, I just said, I never want to forget where I came from.

75
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:01,080
[SPEAKER_00]: I never want to forget the people who gave me a chance to succeed in life.

76
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:07,658
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to come up with a race to give back to the city of Medford.

77
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:11,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done it for three years now called Run Medford.

78
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:21,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a series of kids events, a five mile race, a 5K race, a two mile walk, a celebrity mile, a high school mile, a para-adaptive mile.

79
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:28,468
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of something for everyone is within the overall scheme of this.

80
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:35,500
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this year, the fourth year, the kids' events will be at Carmel Stadium on the track there.

81
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,623
[SPEAKER_00]: They named the track after me last year, so it's pretty cool to have, I guess, a track named after you, Dave McGilvey track.

82
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:49,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran on that track 50 years ago in high school, and then now it's actually named after me.

83
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna have the kids' events there on Friday night, September 26th.

84
00:07:56,903 --> 00:08:06,886
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Saturday morning, September 27th at City Hall in Medford Square, we'll have all the other races that morning.

85
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:22,870
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking forward to a really good event this year where proceeds from the event are being donated to the, I think there's five to eight PTOs in Medford.

86
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,651
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically given back to the,

87
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:33,680
[SPEAKER_00]: all the schools in the city to support various kids programs within the school system.

88
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:41,145
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the whole idea is, you know, I give back to the city that helped give me my start.

89
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:42,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

90
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:47,289
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it sounds like the event is giving back in terms of like, you know, financial resources, right?

91
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:49,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Making donations to the PTOs.

92
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder though, it sounds like running has served a real purpose in your life.

93
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:59,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe you ran an ultra marathon every day for 80 days in a row.

94
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:00,356
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild.

95
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:08,040
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you shared that there were certain things that you had to prepare for in terms of how you might struggle during that.

96
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think running is a practice in lots of different disciplines.

97
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:13,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if there's

98
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:20,704
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that anything else that you hope like the kids in Medford or the residents of Medford to get out of this event as well?

99
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, people say to me all the time, what do you do for a living?

100
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:33,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Well, you know, in essence, I'm a race director, and they're like a race director, what do they do, like, chalk marking the road, y'all go.

101
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when people ask me, what do I do for a living?

102
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:43,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I say I help raise the level of self esteem and self confidence of 10s of 1000s of people in America.

103
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:50,381
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I think, you know, participating in, you know, events like this do.

104
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:55,783
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, or ask me, what's the toughest part about running a marathon?

105
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:57,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the toughest part?

106
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:02,806
[SPEAKER_00]: signing the application, having the guts and the courage to commit.

107
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:05,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you commit, then you have to do the work.

108
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:08,270
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to earn the right to toe the line.

109
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:16,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you toe the line, you answer the gun, you run the course, you cross the finish line, you get a medal, and magic happens.

110
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:19,157
[SPEAKER_00]: You go home feeling good about yourself.

111
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:26,803
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing more powerful in anyone's life, especially children, than to feel good about themselves, because it's the foundation

112
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,524
[SPEAKER_00]: by which we accomplish everything in our lives.

113
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:49,541
[SPEAKER_00]: So my ultimate goal in everything I do, whether it's motivational speaking appearances, putting on road races, whatever, is just to make people feel good about themselves, however that might come about, and to encourage them to set goals and not limits and to believe in themselves.

114
00:10:51,850 --> 00:11:15,087
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I basically go through my entire athletic career as a lessons learned along the way in terms of what struggles I've had and how I've overcome them and how in some cases to attain a goal, you know, maybe you can't go left, but then you go right.

115
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:16,228
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a path.

116
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,192
[SPEAKER_00]: to the succeeding at what you set out to do.

117
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:27,334
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I try to instill in, especially in kids in the school system.

118
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:39,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times, you know, I wrote a book called The Last Pick, because actually when I was growing up in Midford, you know, I was, I always wanted to be a professional athlete.

119
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:45,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to play second bases at Fenway Park, but I was short in stature.

120
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:45,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And so

121
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:53,435
[SPEAKER_00]: All the kids I hung around with were mainly athletes and they were pretty tall, strong guys.

122
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:55,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's little Dave.

123
00:11:55,816 --> 00:12:02,981
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was always the last one picked when my friends pick sides or the last one cut when I went out for the teams.

124
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:07,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying I didn't deserve to be picked or I did or anything.

125
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,607
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I had to just deal with what I was experiencing.

126
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:14,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole concept of

127
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:23,421
[SPEAKER_00]: rejection, you know, feeling not wanted or needed was almost debilitating.

128
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:26,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I gotta fight this.

129
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,843
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta figure a way out of this.

130
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:34,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I started running because no one can catch you from running, you know, just go run.

131
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then I've run about 165,000 miles.

132
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:36,689
[SPEAKER_00]: I've run 171 marathons.

133
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:37,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I've run the Boston Marathon.

134
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:45,478
[SPEAKER_00]: 53 years in a row.

135
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done 10 Ironman triathlons in Hawaii.

136
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,721
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I ran up the East Coast of America.

137
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the list goes on and on and on.

138
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:59,242
[SPEAKER_00]: And I continually challenge myself, because I want to feel good about me too.

139
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:09,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think all this resonates with everyone, not just children, but adults alike, that we all need to be told that, you know,

140
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:19,017
[SPEAKER_00]: we may think we're the last pick or the no pick, but there's always ways to overcome that.

141
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:30,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds like a really powerful message, like especially for children, but like for any of us, right, that have sort of struggled to find our thing or to fit in or to feel confident.

142
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you have a favorite event that you've organized or that you've run.

143
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, the Boston Marathon.

144
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,182
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you top that?

145
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:41,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the most

146
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:45,399
[SPEAKER_00]: prestigious endurance event in the world.

147
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:49,740
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got offered the job in 1988 to help direct it.

148
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Really tough to turn down an opportunity like that.

149
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:57,401
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been there for the last 38 years.

150
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:59,702
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously that's near and dear to my heart.

151
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:04,083
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's plenty of other events that I'm involved with.

152
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:08,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually put on a marathon once inside of Fenway Park.

153
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:11,516
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole marathon was on the warning track.

154
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,597
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 116 laps.

155
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:17,299
[SPEAKER_00]: So 50 of us, I directed it and ran in it.

156
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:19,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just surreal.

157
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here's the place I always wanted to play in, and now I'm running a marathon inside of it, you know?

158
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:33,407
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, so many other events that I have participated in, there's so many other events that I have directed.

159
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:49,175
[SPEAKER_00]: again, all over the world, that it's hard to pick one over the other, because they all had their individual characteristics and uniqueness that made them attractive and interesting to either direct or run in.

160
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:58,604
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been very lucky through all of this that I've been able to combine sort of a passion with a vocation.

161
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:16,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to tell people the ultimate goal in life, if you have to earn a living, which most of us do, then it makes a lot of sense to do it with something that you love, that you're passionate about.

162
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,371
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get asked by kids all the time, what do you do for work?

163
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:20,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, I don't.

164
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:21,873
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, you don't work.

165
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:22,353
[SPEAKER_00]: I say,

166
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:30,242
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not in the traditional or conventional sense of the word, because most people work to earn money.

167
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.

168
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:35,003
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like nine to five to stay alive.

169
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:42,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what I do so much that I don't consider it work.

170
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:50,786
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that should be everyone's goal, to find something that they enjoy and love and

171
00:15:51,904 --> 00:16:03,326
[SPEAKER_00]: so much that every day they're excited about getting up and, quote-unquote, going to work, even though it may not feel like it's work for them.

172
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:10,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like you sort of figured that out by maybe trying some things that didn't work out, right?

173
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:19,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that, like, and I think for kids, that's an important message is like, sometimes the things that we maybe fail at, or think we want to do, like, in the failing presents us with another option, right?

174
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That we might?

175
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:20,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

176
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:23,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I even say to people that

177
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:37,771
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world I live in, and again, I don't preach, I don't try to teach people, I just try to show by example and lessons learned, my own personal experience.

178
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:46,176
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never looked at anything that I attempted to do, but maybe not accomplish it as failure.

179
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:52,399
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my life, there's only one way you can fail, and that's not to try.

180
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you try and you don't,

181
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:58,787
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed totally at what you had hoped to.

182
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,047
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not failure.

183
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,307
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a learning experience.

184
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:10,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just put your big boy or big girl pants on and go at it again the next time.

185
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,749
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always tomorrow.

186
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:17,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should at least give yourself credit for having the guts and the courage to try.

187
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:25,092
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of different mantras

188
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,662
[SPEAKER_00]: sayings in my life to help me get through each day.

189
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:44,433
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I was living in Medford on my 12th birthday, I woke up the day of my birthday and I ran around Spot Pond in Medford, and it was six miles.

190
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:48,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on in the day after cake and ice cream, I ran around it again.

191
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ran

192
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:51,739
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 miles on my 12th birthday.

193
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty cool.

194
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned 13, I ran 13 on my 13th birthday, and 14 on my 14th, and 15, and 15.

195
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:02,085
[SPEAKER_00]: When I turned 50, I ran 50 miles.

196
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:04,026
[SPEAKER_00]: When I turned 60, I ran 60 miles.

197
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:09,089
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now I'm 70, and I've been doing this for 58 years.

198
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,611
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say, or ask me, what are you going to do when you turn 90?

199
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I don't know, I wanna be breathing first, I guess, that's a priority.

200
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:24,407
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get out of bed and I'll figure it out then.

201
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:30,612
[SPEAKER_00]: But my motto in life has always been, it's my game, so it's my rules.

202
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,635
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can always change the rules.

203
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I can always set it up for success and not failure.

204
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:42,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So each and every day I think about that, that it's my life, it's my game.

205
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:44,592
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my rules to live by.

206
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:56,816
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always try to teach people never to be discouraged by other people who either don't believe in you or don't think you should try something.

207
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:06,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it kind of thing.

208
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,700
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people ask me all the time, you've done all these different things, what's your best accomplishment?

209
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:16,346
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say, well, my best accomplishment is my next one.

210
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:18,787
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got for me lately?

211
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:21,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, the past is gone.

212
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:23,048
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't live back there.

213
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:25,688
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people have a tendency of doing that.

214
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:31,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where they are today, they're probably not in a comfort zone.

215
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:42,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, they don't feel good about themselves, but when they go back to where they came from and live back there a little bit, it's like, oh, I used to do this and I could do that.

216
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:43,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was before.

217
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:44,588
[SPEAKER_00]: What about now?

218
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:55,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's always, yeah, using what I've accomplished in the past as a foundation of confidence in believing in myself, but always

219
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:04,428
[SPEAKER_00]: setting new goals going forward and not limits, you know, live for today, plan for tomorrow, not live in the past.

220
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:10,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always what's out there, what's the next one I want to go after?

221
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:19,277
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, kids say, you know, the dandest questions, but like, what do you want to be when you grow up?

222
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,640
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what makes you want to grow up?

223
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:33,387
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I saw a billboard on the highway, actually right in the method area on route 93, a couple of years ago, and the billboard had one word on it.

224
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,288
[SPEAKER_00]: And the word was accomplisher.

225
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:37,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that's it.

226
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,649
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to be an accomplisher.

227
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:50,791
[SPEAKER_00]: All I want to do is set a goal, work hard, earn the right, accomplish it, check it off, move on to the next one.

228
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:51,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

229
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:58,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm wondering what the most common question you get about your run from Medford to Medford is.

230
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:05,661
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a bunch of questions, you know, how many pairs of shoes did you wear?

231
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:11,344
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things like that, just the mechanics of it all.

232
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:12,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how did you do that?

233
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:16,867
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ran 45, 50 miles a day, did you run it all at once?

234
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:18,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you break it out?

235
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cause I can't just like,

236
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:25,940
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't understand how someone could do that.

237
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,603
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I was young, I was 23 and I didn't know any better.

238
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:34,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no real fear involved in the process at all.

239
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:45,195
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of little tricks to it in a sense of like for me, I ran 10 miles at a time.

240
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:50,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a crew of two or three guys with me at a time in a motor home.

241
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:54,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would leave the motorhome at, say, 6.30 in the morning.

242
00:21:55,851 --> 00:22:00,314
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd take off, and maybe 45 minutes later, the motorhome would take off.

243
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:04,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'd see me down the road and pass me and go to the 10-mile point.

244
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:07,220
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd run until I saw the motorhome again.

245
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was 10 miles, because I had no other way of knowing.

246
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:13,664
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no GPS back then, or cell phones, or anything.

247
00:22:14,105 --> 00:22:14,985
[SPEAKER_00]: No Garmin watches.

248
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:15,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.

249
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:17,387
[SPEAKER_00]: No Garmins, no nothing.

250
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd go into the motorhome, get some of the E,

251
00:22:21,977 --> 00:22:24,379
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, come out 10 minutes later, do another 10.

252
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back in the motorhome, do another 10, another 10, another 10.

253
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:31,963
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd break it up into 10 mile segments for the most part.

254
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:34,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just think about the next 10 miles.

255
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:36,687
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't think about 50 for the day.

256
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:37,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd think of 10.

257
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:41,049
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a form of immediate gratification.

258
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:41,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that done.

259
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,011
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel good.

260
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:45,132
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let that one go.

261
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,353
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the next one on deck.

262
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:48,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get that one.

263
00:22:50,570 --> 00:23:01,439
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as footwear, you know, I brought like eight different pairs of shoes with me in different styles and different manufacturers, different models.

264
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:11,528
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every time I came back in after a 10 mile split, I changed my shoes and I put on a different pair because I felt like it was almost like a renewal.

265
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:18,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I put on a different pair and went out to run and my legs weren't as sore because I'm, you know,

266
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:24,132
[SPEAKER_00]: accenting sort of different muscle groups, you know, with a different pair of shoes.

267
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:29,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a little thing I figured out that helped me get through each day.

268
00:23:30,854 --> 00:23:33,774
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's things like that along the way.

269
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:43,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like 120 degrees in the desert and running 14,000 feet over the Rocky Mountains and all that kind of thing.

270
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:44,997
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just had a

271
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:57,756
[SPEAKER_00]: take one day at a time, and I never really, the weather was the weather, and it didn't matter, because I was getting out there anyways.

272
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:02,857
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was, in a sense, no such thing as bad weather, just bad gear.

273
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:08,119
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you just gotta dress properly for the conditions.

274
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,081
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I did, and nothing ever slowed me down.

275
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:14,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

276
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if there's anything else that you want to make sure that we know about you or not.

277
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:35,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, on the whole runmented thing, again, the way I look at it is it's almost like a gift I'm giving to the city and it's the cities, it's the residents, it's the businesses event.

278
00:24:35,963 --> 00:24:41,624
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but it won't be successful unless you have critical mass.

279
00:24:42,244 --> 00:24:43,344
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is to,

280
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:57,765
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully encourage as many people to participate as possible so that you get the health and fitness aspect of it, you get the social aspect of it, you get the goodwill and giving back aspect of it.

281
00:24:58,025 --> 00:24:59,485
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun.

282
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:07,806
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to see this event be successful over the years so that it can continue long after I'm gone.

283
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:10,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to leave this as a legacy

284
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:24,468
[SPEAKER_00]: to the city in appreciation for so many people from Medved helping me get a start in my business and in my athletic career.

285
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.

286
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:27,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

287
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:32,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that people have enjoyed it so far, and so I hope we get a good amount of people coming out this year.

288
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:33,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

289
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:34,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

290
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:35,697
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Dave.

291
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:36,959
