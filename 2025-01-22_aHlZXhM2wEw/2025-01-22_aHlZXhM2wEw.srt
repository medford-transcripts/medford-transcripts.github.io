1
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:11,681
[SPEAKER_22]: Test one, two.

2
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:53,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Governance Committee, January 22nd, 2025.

3
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

4
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,228
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears.

5
00:03:59,409 --> 00:03:59,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Present.

6
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:01,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

7
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:08,216
[SPEAKER_15]: I see Vice President Collins.

8
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:12,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna mark her as present because I can see her.

9
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:14,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro.

10
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:18,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

11
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:18,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Present.

12
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:22,164
[SPEAKER_13]: chair say present five present non absent.

13
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:24,125
[SPEAKER_13]: The meeting is called to order.

14
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:31,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Today we'll be discussing resolution 24-468 resolution to discuss updates to the city charter.

15
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,451
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one of three scheduled substantive charter.

16
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:46,780
[SPEAKER_13]: charter review meetings where we will review the recommendations sent to us by the mayor's office of the work that the Charter Study Committee has done.

17
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the chair of the Charter Study Committee is in the audience with us today.

18
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:57,289
[SPEAKER_13]: I did send out an official invite to this meeting through the CSC email address.

19
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:09,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking, because we have so much to work through, and just to remind folks at home, what we have to talk about today is the preamble, article one,

20
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:26,413
[SPEAKER_13]: discussing incorporation, short title definitions, article two about the legislative branch, and article nine, general provisions, section 9-6, which concerns itself with ordinances and the legislative branch as well, which is why it's in this meeting.

21
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:38,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's so much to review and talk about today, I was thinking that we could cover the sections in order in the city charter draft that was sent to us.

22
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:52,441
[SPEAKER_13]: and take composition and compensation at the end, because those, I expect, will be very substantive discussions with a lot of input and discussion required.

23
00:05:52,962 --> 00:06:00,144
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't want the small but very important things to get lost in the substance.

24
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:08,447
[SPEAKER_13]: With that being said, do councillors have any opening thoughts or thoughts on the preamble or article one of the draft city charter?

25
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:14,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

26
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:16,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me make sure I can see.

27
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:38,656
[SPEAKER_13]: I should also note that we have representatives from the Collins Center today in the audience with us, too, to work through substance questions.

28
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:56,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

29
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,746
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears.

30
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:00,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I missed that.

31
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:07,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you chair saying, um, I want to, uh, thank my colleagues.

32
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:09,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for putting together these meetings.

33
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:15,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank the members of the charter study committee, the mayor and the Collins center for their work up to this point.

34
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:22,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and especially for those who are here tonight, as well as member of the public members of the public who are interested in this topic.

35
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:24,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we are,

36
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:36,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I've said this a few times now, we're working on all three of the big three that Councilor Knight once told me the city council is responsible for this term.

37
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:41,532
[SPEAKER_04]: We've passed a budget ordinance and a budget, and we have another budget coming up.

38
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:50,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously we are in, I think meeting 18 or 19 of the term of the planning and permitting committee regarding zoning updates.

39
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are here tonight on the charter.

40
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:57,985
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the foundational document for our community.

41
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:16,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are looking at the first update in nearly 40 years and bringing us into, I would say, the modern age of city charters based on what we're looking at here and before us with the proposal from the Charter Study Committee revised by the mayor.

42
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:30,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And by and large, I think this proposal is a really great proposal, a charter that the people can understand and something that I wholeheartedly support as a whole.

43
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:42,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week I submitted to the council and shared with the public very openly a series of amendments that I would like to propose for discussion tonight by this committee.

44
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:47,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am hopeful for the consideration and moving forward on them.

45
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:57,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also just want to note that part of the reason that I went about this the way that I did is that there have been fantastic discussions

46
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:15,891
[SPEAKER_04]: from multiple people all over the Internet talking about what they would like to see, what they wouldn't like to see, bringing forward new ideas that have added to my knowledge base and that I am going to bring to the discussions that we have tonight.

47
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:21,414
[SPEAKER_04]: As regards to the first article and the sections within it,

48
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:28,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank the study committee for putting together a thoughtful preamble.

49
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:40,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think it represents what our community is, as well as its rich history, as it says right in here, our city's rich history and where we want to go and what the purpose of a charter is.

50
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:52,303
[SPEAKER_04]: As regards to the rest of the article one and sections, I did have a couple of minor proposals around the definitions, but they do relate to

51
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,785
[SPEAKER_04]: the proposal around the composition of the city council.

52
00:09:56,825 --> 00:10:04,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will not make any motions or discuss them at this time, but we'll discuss them when that topic comes up for the chair.

53
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:05,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

54
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro is next in the queue.

55
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:12,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

56
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:35,367
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to acknowledge that from the perspective of one of my previous modes of employment was writing and having a really solid draft that is so foundational and so well-written and well-studied and has so much work that's put into it.

57
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,811
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm so grateful to have this to start

58
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:44,803
[SPEAKER_18]: with and so grateful to the committee and all of the work that they've put in.

59
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:47,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree that the preamble is really lovely.

60
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:56,826
[SPEAKER_18]: The first article, I don't have anything that I would want to edit, but I just really appreciate everything that we have to start with.

61
00:10:57,146 --> 00:11:05,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a lot of things that I'd like to say later on tonight, but there's, I just, it's so much easier to start

62
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:14,751
[SPEAKER_18]: doing further work when you have something that's really good to begin with.

63
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:31,541
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to say thank you to the Charter Study Committee for that grueling work, all of that research, all of those conversations with the public, and all of the work that they did at the Collins Center, and express my gratitude for that.

64
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:32,522
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you all very much.

65
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:37,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

66
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:40,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

67
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:52,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I first want to acknowledge the fact that as one councilor, I was, when I first started my journey as a city councilor, I was firmly behind the charter change charter review.

68
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:59,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we started moving forward and we started seeing some of the changes and what it can impact, my biggest

69
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:07,072
[SPEAKER_06]: The piece that really turned me around to vote against the charter review at the time was really looking at ward representation.

70
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:18,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's because of working in a community that has ward representation and really having some situations where you saw

71
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:29,523
[SPEAKER_06]: the input of ward representation being looked at in some cases as special interests from section of the city to section of the city, but not what's best for the whole community.

72
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:35,264
[SPEAKER_06]: So I found myself being very stubborn and stuck on my beliefs.

73
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:38,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I think I needed to do was take a step back.

74
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:47,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that reading all the information that Mr. McDonald's team has done with the charter review and talking to

75
00:12:47,884 --> 00:13:00,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Jovino and different members of the committee and then reaching out to different colleagues from neighboring communities that have ward representation and truly understanding the positive impacts.

76
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:08,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that I was so narrow-minded, my thinking at the time was so narrow-minded that I really need to expand and really look at the greater picture.

77
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I see this presentation, I realized that

78
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:28,144
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if I could turn the clock back and if I could have helped by moving this forward back a few years ago when the commitment for the council was needed, I think I would do that today.

79
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:35,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I see in place is so impressive in the fact that we have people that were committed

80
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:57,038
[SPEAKER_06]: that reached out to probably one of the greatest support teams with the Collins Center and someone who I respect in the world of municipalities, former alderman in Melrose and former city solicitor Frank Wright and listening and answering, listening to how he's answering the questions and his team and I think that this is a great

81
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,431
[SPEAKER_06]: great situation right now.

82
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:02,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I love what we have, what we've crafted.

83
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:16,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some reservations as well, but I know my colleagues have shared some, and I think that the biggest takeaway from this is I'm a huge advocate now for 11 councils.

84
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:21,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a huge advocate for ward representation for all eight wards.

85
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:23,430
[SPEAKER_06]: You realize as I talk to

86
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:29,987
[SPEAKER_06]: as I talk to people, even in the city of Medford, and we talk about getting people involved in the election process.

87
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:33,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I sit with marginalized people and they say, George, you know what?

88
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:34,630
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy for you.

89
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,971
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a base.

90
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:39,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you run at large, it's easy for you to raise $20,000.

91
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:44,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy for you to say you represent everybody, because I think I've done that.

92
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:48,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't ever take away that I represented everybody in the city.

93
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:53,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I ever ran, if it was the time that I ran, I probably would run at large just for the fact that I enjoy

94
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,349
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole community, that whole battle.

95
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:06,935
[SPEAKER_06]: But talking to my fellow colleagues in neighboring communities, you understand how important it is for mostly marginalized people that have been underrepresented.

96
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:12,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now there's a battle going on in another room talking about zoning reform at Salem Street.

97
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:21,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a person who grew up off of Salem Street, my former neighbors have called me and said, George, why wouldn't you want ward representation with every ward considering

98
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:28,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Shame on you, because we didn't hear from you at Salem Street when it came to the ward.

99
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:30,280
[SPEAKER_06]: We felt like we weren't listened to.

100
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is why now it's a battle with the Salem Street zoning situation.

101
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're seeing that in pockets all over the community.

102
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:42,165
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're seeing at Tufts University with the 10-story building, how it's affecting that community.

103
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've talked to friends and neighbors there at St.

104
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:44,566
[SPEAKER_06]: George.

105
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:45,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go again.

106
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:52,810
[SPEAKER_06]: The charter review is important because if we had a representative that we can go into in our own backyard that we see every day at the coffee shop,

107
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:56,747
[SPEAKER_06]: then it wouldn't, the information wouldn't have been getting out there.

108
00:15:56,767 --> 00:16:06,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the biggest things I've had, the negative pieces I've had is a lack of information that's going out to the community because the lack of a written newspaper, the lack of true communication across the board.

109
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:18,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And one piece that I found that made me feel secure in my process as I go forward with this is the thought process saying, you know what, we might not have a newspaper.

110
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:23,901
[SPEAKER_06]: but everybody in every small pocket of our community now will have someone that they feel like they can call.

111
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:42,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there are so many things I've learned, and like, again, I'm a big boy now, and I've learned a lot, good and bad, and I wish I could turn back the clock on some of the decisions I made, but when I see the information that's in front of us,

112
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited.

113
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:48,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited and I commend all of you for all the hard work that you've done.

114
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:55,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, if you've ever felt that I was an enemy to the cause,

115
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I was educated.

116
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:02,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't educate myself to the cost because I was stubborn.

117
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:07,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I see in front of me right now, I can't wait to get this through.

118
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:09,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to get this to the legislature.

119
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:13,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to come back so we can get this on the ballot and see all these great changes.

120
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:19,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we see a lot of things that aren't working in Medford and the divide in Medford.

121
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:22,061
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of it's because we haven't done this, right?

122
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:29,983
[SPEAKER_06]: you're seeing how important word representation is across the Commonwealth.

123
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:44,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's time to, like I said to, my wife and I were talking, I said, Jesus, Dina, she says, it's time for me to grow up and put my big boy pants on and say, hey, listen, this is a great proposal and let's do everything we can to move it forward.

124
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:53,613
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I commend your charter review team and our friends from the Collins Center, they've done so much work.

125
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:58,114
[SPEAKER_06]: are the actual experts in this field.

126
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:04,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think guided this platform to a very robust discussion.

127
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:08,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, so I could talk a buzzard off a meat wagon.

128
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:08,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just thank you.

129
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:09,323
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

130
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:23,566
[SPEAKER_13]: I see President Bears has requested, but I wanted to make sure other city councilors had a chance to give comments first.

131
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:28,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to clarify, we're talking about the preamble and article one.

132
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:32,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I see none.

133
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:32,996
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears.

134
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:37,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to also, I was remiss to not thank the Collins Center.

135
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:46,332
[SPEAKER_04]: They worked up a great comparison document that we received the other, I think yesterday or the day before, comparing what's in the current charter to the proposal.

136
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:49,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to thank the team at the Collins Center for putting that together.

137
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:49,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

138
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:51,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you so much for that.

139
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:53,054
[SPEAKER_13]: That was very, very helpful.

140
00:18:54,795 --> 00:18:59,236
[SPEAKER_13]: With Article 1, I did actually have one question about,

141
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,128
[SPEAKER_13]: a definition.

142
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:05,934
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if Chair McDonald or Collin Center, this is something you guys can help answer.

143
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:11,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I see that there's a definition here for local newspaper when you control F through it.

144
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:16,427
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some references to local newspapers, some references to local news publications.

145
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:37,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I know substantively a lot of that shows up later on and like in subjects will cover in future meetings, but seeing that they're going to be spread through two different meetings, I was, I'd be remiss not to ask if that is some language that we should align through the charter document local newspaper versus local news publication.

146
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:49,167
[SPEAKER_13]: And in the definition itself for local newspaper it talks about newspapers with daily or weekly circulation and given the state of local news media.

147
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:52,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know whether

148
00:19:53,828 --> 00:20:01,612
[SPEAKER_13]: requiring that is something that would eventually hold us up if local news sources were to disappear.

149
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:10,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there are folks at home, folks in the city working on creating local news sources, but I know those are still just in the works.

150
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:28,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

151
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:33,725
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you can, could you give us your name and address for the record?

152
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:36,450
[SPEAKER_13]: And could you spell your name just so we can get it correctly?

153
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:38,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

154
00:20:52,893 --> 00:21:03,499
[SPEAKER_16]: We can certainly take a look at, and if there is some disparity between the use of those terms within the draft document, we can certainly revisit that.

155
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:19,507
[SPEAKER_16]: To the extent your question relates to whether or not there is such a newspaper, generally, so long as a newspaper is available in the community, so that would include the Boston Papers,

156
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:24,027
[SPEAKER_16]: that would satisfy the legal requirement.

157
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:38,516
[SPEAKER_16]: There are often statutory requirements to publish in a local newspaper, particularly you've probably seen them for zoning or for probate in the state issues.

158
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:43,779
[SPEAKER_16]: And so those can be either if you have a local Medford Mercury

159
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:55,590
[SPEAKER_16]: or if, taking you back a few years, the old Medford Mercury, or you could use a Boston newspaper as well, the Globe or the Herald.

160
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,411
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if that, I hope that's helpful.

161
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:00,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that helps a lot with the question.

162
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:01,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

163
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:10,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we move on to article two about the legislative branch, are there any other questions or comments, motions about article one?

164
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:18,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, let's move on to Article 2.

165
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:33,664
[SPEAKER_13]: As the first section is about composition, I'll skip over that really quickly and move on to section 2-2, Council President and Vice President Election Terms and Hours.

166
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:40,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Do any councilors have any questions, comments, or motions about this section of the city charter?

167
00:22:52,589 --> 00:23:00,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had a question for the Collins Center, if you guys already can answer this.

168
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:09,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it normal to put very specific powers and duties for the city council president in the city charter?

169
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:15,838
[SPEAKER_13]: I know something that the Charter Study Committee has been talking about is how currently in Medford,

170
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,900
[SPEAKER_13]: So many of these things are in separate places.

171
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:29,066
[SPEAKER_13]: And something that will help us understand the charter review process better is if this is something that is normally in a city charter.

172
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:30,667
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is yes.

173
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:31,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

174
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:31,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

175
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:41,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, could we get your name and address for the record, too?

176
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:43,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Maryland Country is the concept.

177
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:44,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

178
00:23:52,449 --> 00:24:03,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we foresee any trouble with the phrase, the president shall prepare the agenda, in terms of, I know currently the president works with the clerk's office to prepare the agenda.

179
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:04,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that something

180
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I know textually, that seems like this is the current language is quite limiting.

181
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:22,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this something that has been discussed before in terms of whether that would be a problem, the president working with other people, not Councilors, to prepare the council agenda?

182
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:34,057
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of generic language, and it certainly doesn't forbid involving the clerk.

183
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

184
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:47,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I see President Bears.

185
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,003
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to Councilor Scarpelli.

186
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:49,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

187
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:51,544
[SPEAKER_04]: George, give me a second.

188
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:52,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no problem.

189
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:53,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

190
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:54,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

191
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:54,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

192
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:55,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council Bears.

193
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:59,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that as I went through my notes, I did have a note.

194
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:02,706
[SPEAKER_06]: And correct me if we'll go back to this again.

195
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:05,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little preoccupied.

196
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:33,596
[SPEAKER_06]: As we started looking into composition of terms of office and eligibility, I wanted to ask the Collins Center, I think that one of the constituents, people that have read this and called and asked opinions, with the mayor's four-year term, and the council too, and school committee too, the question they brought up, I said, well, let me ask if it's common,

197
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:45,041
[SPEAKER_06]: you see that two years really sometimes prohibits true government because you see that it's so short that you're finding that you're always politicking instead of doing what's right.

198
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:48,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And the question is, has that been entertained?

199
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:56,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen other communities do a three-year term where it's a two-year for school committee, three-year term for the council, and then four-year term for the mayor?

200
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:03,007
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just something that was asked of me, and I just wanted to get your opinion on that.

201
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:11,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a three-year term is very difficult.

202
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:11,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

203
00:26:11,777 --> 00:26:12,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

204
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me one sec.

205
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:19,001
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.

206
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

207
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:29,648
[SPEAKER_02]: A three-year term is very difficult because you can't have a municipal election in the same year as a presidential.

208
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:30,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, a state election.

209
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:31,589
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, state election.

210
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:31,889
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

211
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:46,829
[SPEAKER_02]: We have communities that have three-year terms, but their elections are in June, so that they don't conflict with the dates of the state primary or the state election.

212
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,570
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great input.

213
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

214
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what they mean.

215
00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:01,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand what the two-year term is difficult, because it seems like you really, once you get going,

216
00:27:03,857 --> 00:27:17,127
[SPEAKER_06]: as an elected official, then all of a sudden you have people that you've promised so much to and they've come to you and said, now it feels like you truly are looking at times at the greater picture of an elected official.

217
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,528
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's the greater good of the community.

218
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:22,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate the input and that's something I'll share with them if they're not watching tonight.

219
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:23,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

220
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:46,991
[SPEAKER_04]: see you president bears thank you Councilor Tseng um just a note uh we're going to come back to 2-1 and 2-4 okay um i just yeah and i appreciated the question i just want to make sure we stay on course have the discussion on those um i have as regards to section 2 or article 2

221
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:56,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I have thoughts on 2-5, 2-7, 2-9, 2-10, and then I also have a thought on 9-6 and moving into section two.

222
00:27:59,644 --> 00:27:59,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

223
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:03,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Bears.

224
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:08,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other questions on section 2-2?

225
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:11,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Not seeing any.

226
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:17,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Section 2-3, prohibitions, are there any questions from councilors on this?

227
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:23,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro.

228
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:30,922
[SPEAKER_18]: I did have a quick question on section two, five, actually, sorry, two, five, subsection three.

229
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:35,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro, I actually had a quick question about two, three.

230
00:28:36,063 --> 00:28:37,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Two, three, you did.

231
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:38,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Could I do that one first?

232
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:38,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

233
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:49,508
[SPEAKER_13]: So in section two, three B, it says that the city council shall contact the officers and employees serving under the mayor solely through the mayor

234
00:28:50,293 --> 00:29:03,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I, so I know, I think all of us as Councilors know that we're contacting city officials city staff with understanding that they serve, they serve the mayor and the people of the city.

235
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:07,298
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm, I know, I also know that a lot of us as Councilors.

236
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:18,004
[SPEAKER_13]: directly outreach to a lot of city staff to ask for input, to ask for, to give suggestions and whatnot.

237
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:26,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we see this language, the language I just read out, as limiting that outreach or that interaction?

238
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:37,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's important to note that relates to section 2.6 when you're conducting an investigation, which is really different than

239
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:41,043
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when do you pick up the trash on Maple Street?

240
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:44,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it forbids inquiries.

241
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:51,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when you're having an investigation or an analysis of something of, you know.

242
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,753
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to clarify.

243
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:54,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

244
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:59,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

245
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:03,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the question is though, not in the case of an investigation or inquiry,

246
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:14,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I regularly communicate with the city assessor to set up a meeting with the resident to talk about their assessment.

247
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,683
[SPEAKER_04]: This would seem to prohibit me from doing that.

248
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:18,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?

249
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:25,389
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, no.

250
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:28,151
[SPEAKER_16]: The purpose of this is you cannot order

251
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

252
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:30,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

253
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:48,586
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, and I so appreciate the, first of all, the work from the commission and also the Collins Center.

254
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:53,469
[SPEAKER_26]: I am not a member of this committee, so thank you so much for allowing me to ask a question.

255
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,931
[SPEAKER_26]: This is on the same exact point.

256
00:30:57,191 --> 00:31:06,437
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that, for example, when we were working to try and reduce the rodent population, that the person sponsoring a piece of legislation

257
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:14,951
[SPEAKER_26]: was communicating with the staff in order to understand best how we can help the staff through the ordinance.

258
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:16,632
[SPEAKER_26]: The staff needed an ordinance to be changed.

259
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:28,114
[SPEAKER_26]: And so working together with staff to understand how we can best tailor the ordinance to meet the needs of the staff, that to me, like, I'm 100% in favor of

260
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:34,527
[SPEAKER_26]: nor shall any member of the city council give orders or direction.

261
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,227
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely, I 100% agree.

262
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:39,189
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're looking for coordination, communication.

263
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:43,731
[SPEAKER_26]: It just says, you know, the city council shall contact only solely through the mayor.

264
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:54,217
[SPEAKER_26]: And it seems like getting information on how to craft ordinances to best meet the needs of staff, that's, I just wanna make sure, again, we're all asking about this.

265
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:55,658
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanna make sure that it's.

266
00:31:55,838 --> 00:31:57,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll look at this language

267
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,339
[SPEAKER_26]: That would be amazing.

268
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:16,826
[SPEAKER_26]: I just specifically, I mean, I wasn't the sponsor of rodent control, but I know how much, you know, that was something staff needed and that the sponsor of that ordinance needed to just hear from and worked with staff members to craft it carefully so that it met the needs of the city.

269
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:21,067
[SPEAKER_26]: So those kinds of things I think are important that we are able to accomplish.

270
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:22,227
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

271
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:23,768
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears?

272
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:24,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

273
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:25,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

274
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:45,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, um, obviously subject if you want to take a look at it and come back, but it would seem to me that if the intent is to make clear that the council cannot order a city employee to do anything, um, maybe just eliminating everything between the comma after section two, six and the word neither.

275
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:51,171
[SPEAKER_04]: So eliminating the city council shall contact the officers and employees serving under the mayor solely through the mayor and

276
00:32:52,027 --> 00:33:04,776
[SPEAKER_04]: because then it would just read, except for the purpose of inquiries and investigations pursuant to section two, six, neither the city council nor any member of the city council shall give orders or directions to any officer or employee, either publicly or privately.

277
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:08,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that makes sense to folks.

278
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:18,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I would really like to talk to the author before I comment.

279
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:19,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a motion to

280
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,823
[SPEAKER_04]: make that amendment pending further discussion and information from the representatives from the Collins Center.

281
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you email that to the court?

282
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:37,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Or yeah, I can work on emailing it.

283
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:37,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

284
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:42,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, we have a motion on the floor by President Bears.

285
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:44,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Anna's gonna email it to you.

286
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:50,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, do we have a second by Councilor Lazzaro?

287
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:59,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing that there might be a lot of motions at the end of this meeting, I think it would be wise to take this vote now, when you're ready, Mr. Clerk.

288
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:01,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give you a second.

289
00:34:15,592 --> 00:34:16,092
[SPEAKER_15]: President Ferris.

290
00:34:16,352 --> 00:34:16,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

291
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:18,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

292
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:19,773
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

293
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:22,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Blasaro.

294
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:33,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry.

295
00:34:36,177 --> 00:34:42,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It would remove the sentence, the city council shall contact the officers and employees serving under the mayor solely through the mayor and

296
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:47,866
[SPEAKER_04]: but maintains the intent that we could not give orders or directions.

297
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:50,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

298
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:51,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

299
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in favor, none opposed, motion passes.

300
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:58,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other comments on section two, four?

301
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none.

302
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:03,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

303
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:06,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Section two, five, exercise of powers quorum rules.

304
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,005
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears, your mic is live.

305
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:12,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

306
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:24,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had one one item here under section two five subsection one that the regular meetings of the city council be held at a time and place fixed by ordinance.

307
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I would change that to the city council rules.

308
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:29,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

309
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:30,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a motion?

310
00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:31,672
[SPEAKER_04]: That that would be a motion, yeah.

311
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:45,005
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a motion from President Bears to amend the words fixed by ordinance to fixed by city council rules in section 2-5B1.

312
00:35:47,307 --> 00:35:50,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And the clerk already has that language in the document I sent over.

313
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:50,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

314
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:55,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Before, do we have a second for that motion?

315
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:57,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

316
00:35:57,694 --> 00:35:58,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro?

317
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,571
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a question just about the process of amending the rules.

318
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:05,391
[SPEAKER_18]: We do that.

319
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:09,812
[SPEAKER_18]: We change the city council rules in city council meetings.

320
00:36:10,592 --> 00:36:11,552
[SPEAKER_18]: But if it's in.

321
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:18,113
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's an ordinance, it needs three readings, uh, to change an ordinance.

322
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:18,653
[SPEAKER_18]: It can be.

323
00:36:18,674 --> 00:36:18,714
[SPEAKER_18]: Um.

324
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:36,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Just as a reminder, or maybe just for the public record, if we can just quickly go over how we change the rules, we do that with a resolution in city council?

325
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:37,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the chair.

326
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:42,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the city council can change the rules of the city council by majority vote.

327
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,303
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't require multiple readings.

328
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:51,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I know oftentimes it goes through, I believe now it's admin and finance.

329
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we haven't had to do it this term, but oftentimes it does go through committee first.

330
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:08,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other comments on section 2-5?

331
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:09,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

332
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:15,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro has seconded President Ferris' motion.

333
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me check on Zoom.

334
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:19,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none.

335
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:20,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

336
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:27,293
[SPEAKER_13]: when you're ready.

337
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:29,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

338
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:30,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

339
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:36,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I had a question about 2-5 section B subsection 3.

340
00:37:37,362 --> 00:37:45,048
[SPEAKER_18]: It says all sessions of the City Council and of every committee or subcommittee of the City Council shall be open to the public unless another provision is allowed by law.

341
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:48,251
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing that comes to mind is executive session.

342
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,292
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that's allowed by law.

343
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:59,256
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't happen very frequently in our meetings, but I just wonder if that's something we would want to say officially in the charter.

344
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:01,177
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's not necessary, we don't need to say it.

345
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:04,358
[SPEAKER_18]: It just occurred to me to ask about it.

346
00:38:04,378 --> 00:38:11,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that something the Collins Center would like to respond to?

347
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:18,304
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, it would just

348
00:38:19,785 --> 00:38:24,948
[SPEAKER_16]: language captures the idea of this executive session.

349
00:38:25,408 --> 00:38:32,492
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you want it to be more clear, we could look at it, but I think it would capture it.

350
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:34,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And then certainly that's state law as well.

351
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,395
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine, that's sufficient.

352
00:38:38,575 --> 00:38:39,955
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm comfortable with that, thank you.

353
00:38:40,396 --> 00:38:40,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

354
00:38:41,796 --> 00:38:47,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other comments on the substance in 2-5 before we take up President Bears' motion?

355
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,064
[SPEAKER_13]: seeing none from councillors.

356
00:38:53,004 --> 00:38:57,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, are you ready for the vote?

357
00:38:57,428 --> 00:38:57,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

358
00:38:57,828 --> 00:38:58,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

359
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:05,094
[SPEAKER_15]: President Ferris, would you change the language of prior City Council meetings to be fixed by ordinance item 2.5.B.1 to be fixed by Council rules?

360
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:05,995
Great.

361
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:06,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

362
00:39:06,936 --> 00:39:07,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

363
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:09,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Second from Councilor Lazzaro.

364
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:11,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

365
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

366
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,060
[SPEAKER_15]: President Ferris?

367
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:13,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

368
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:15,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins?

369
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:15,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

370
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:18,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro?

371
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:18,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

372
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:19,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

373
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:19,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

374
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:21,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

375
00:39:22,857 --> 00:39:24,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in favor, none opposed.

376
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:27,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

377
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:29,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Section 2-6, access to information.

378
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Do any councilors have any comments, questions, notes on this section?

379
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:41,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none.

380
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:43,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

381
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,852
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, section two dash seven appointments of city council.

382
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:50,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, do any Councilors have notes on this one?

383
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, notes, questions, comments, motions.

384
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I see president bears.

385
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:56,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

386
00:39:56,404 --> 00:40:02,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, um, regarding this section, um,

387
00:40:04,731 --> 00:40:24,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I had, well, one comment, which this is the first item that incorporates one of the charter amendments passed in the last term, six to one, subsection B. In the initial draft, I would propose that it be subsection C, but subject to appropriation, the council being able to have additional support positions.

388
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:28,611
[SPEAKER_04]: That was something we advocated for in the last term, and I appreciate its inclusion in this draft.

389
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:41,707
[SPEAKER_04]: My main questions and my proposal here is one, the city messenger position that wasn't included.

390
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So I proposed that it be included.

391
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:52,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that would be a new subsection B. And then I also noted that section A didn't include a residency requirement for the city clerk.

392
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:57,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a draft together that put it back in, but I'm interested to hear

393
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:12,872
[SPEAKER_04]: if that was not included purposefully or if there's another provision of Massachusetts general law that would cover residency or just the reason that that was not mentioned as regards to the city clerk.

394
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:14,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

395
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,133
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot there.

396
00:41:18,694 --> 00:41:20,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I know your most direct question is about the city clerk.

397
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:28,057
[SPEAKER_13]: I was wondering if maybe chair McDonald or the call center would be able to speak to that.

398
00:41:39,025 --> 00:42:06,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember this coming up in the Charter Commission in the Charter Review Committee meetings and so it could be an oversight but I we do have concerns about residency requirements and in terms of it limits the application pool significantly

399
00:42:10,384 --> 00:42:16,469
[SPEAKER_02]: and it can be perceived as sort of assuring that someone from within gets the job.

400
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:19,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

401
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:27,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Withdraw my motion related to residency for the city clerk.

402
00:42:28,317 --> 00:42:29,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

403
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:31,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't made a motion.

404
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,142
[SPEAKER_04]: That, once I submit it, I will not move.

405
00:42:37,592 --> 00:42:38,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

406
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:40,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

407
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:53,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I move on, if anybody wants any information about my glasses, it's a new, very expensive company that I can share with you.

408
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:55,075
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Broke.

409
00:42:55,095 --> 00:42:56,075
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Half Glass.

410
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:57,656
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Broke Cheats.

411
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:01,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize for that, because I know my wife's watching right now.

412
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:04,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I come home tonight, she's going to smash me with one of the

413
00:43:05,362 --> 00:43:06,202
[SPEAKER_06]: the 15 pairs I have at home.

414
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:30,209
[SPEAKER_06]: But the question I had was, I know that as we talked about this, I had a question that a resident asked, and I know it's by ordinance, but when we have boards and commissions, have you ever seen a charter, a part of the charter be put in more, anything that would recommend the concerns of residency requirements for different boards and commissions?

415
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that,

416
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:35,135
[SPEAKER_06]: we would put in our charter or something.

417
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:36,516
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, you certainly could.

418
00:43:36,856 --> 00:43:37,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

419
00:43:37,236 --> 00:43:37,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

420
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:42,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, if I could, that'd be something that I don't see it in front of me.

421
00:43:42,119 --> 00:44:02,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that where we can fit that, I think that that's been a concern where we've had commissions or boards of commissions in the city that residents might've been living here and we can understand if they moved out that they finished the term, but we're seeing a lot of people that, that we see people that have been on boards of commissions that don't even live in the city.

422
00:44:03,577 --> 00:44:13,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that, you know, finding that language and seeing if that's something we should visit, if that, we could see anything pertaining to that would be helpful.

423
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:13,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

424
00:44:16,045 --> 00:44:17,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

425
00:44:19,227 --> 00:44:23,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any, are there any motions or comments, questions?

426
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:24,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

427
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:31,054
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, just make a motion to request friends from the Collins Senate to see if they can draft any,

428
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:44,215
[SPEAKER_06]: information that might be prudent for us to look at and maybe vote on for the possibility of resident requirements for boards and commissions.

429
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:47,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

430
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:55,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I would move to adopt the amendment to include the city messenger and the charter and

431
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:14,089
[SPEAKER_04]: then just renumerate, subsection B would become subsection C, subsection D would be, C would become D, and the city messenger section would be subsection B, and that language is also in the document.

432
00:45:15,568 --> 00:45:33,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe we have two motions on the floor, the first one being Councilor Scarpelli's motion on the residency requirements for the call center to propose draft language for the city council on residency requirements for multiple member boards.

433
00:45:33,662 --> 00:45:37,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be happy to try and make my motion with Councilor Scarpelli, so I just take one vote.

434
00:45:38,245 --> 00:45:39,746
[SPEAKER_13]: And I assume you're seconding it?

435
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:46,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's all one.

436
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:52,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Do it all together.

437
00:45:52,690 --> 00:46:00,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any comments from Chairman Golds before we take that vote?

438
00:46:02,196 --> 00:46:05,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, would you have any comments on that resolution or on that motion?

439
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:10,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

440
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:23,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the city messenger and residency requirements for multiple member boards, although that's for a future meeting.

441
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it is there, and I think it's two meetings away.

442
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:31,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think that was my recollection as well, but I'm happy to just vote on the motion.

443
00:46:33,276 --> 00:46:34,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, are you ready?

444
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:34,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I am.

445
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:35,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

446
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,160
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears?

447
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

448
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins?

449
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:41,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

450
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:47,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

451
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:48,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

452
00:46:48,418 --> 00:46:49,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in favor, none opposed.

453
00:46:49,918 --> 00:46:50,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

454
00:46:52,678 --> 00:46:53,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

455
00:46:56,499 --> 00:47:00,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Now section two dash eight ordinances and other measures.

456
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:06,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any comments, questions, motions from, from Councilors?

457
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:13,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I know,

458
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:20,235
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be discussion later tonight on the composition, the proposed composition for city council.

459
00:47:21,456 --> 00:47:27,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm assuming some of the numbers here will depend on the outcome of those conversations.

460
00:47:31,168 --> 00:47:35,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I did have some more technical questions for the Collins Center, if it's all right.

461
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:43,631
[SPEAKER_13]: In the first line of this section, it says, no ordinance shall be passed finally on the date it is introduced.

462
00:47:45,472 --> 00:47:51,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that date the first reading of the proposed ordinance?

463
00:47:51,654 --> 00:47:58,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it when the councilor proposes, like comes to a city council meeting with ordinance text proposed?

464
00:47:58,155 --> 00:47:59,716
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we've had situations where both

465
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:01,127
[SPEAKER_13]: are happening.

466
00:48:01,187 --> 00:48:02,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, the former being more common.

467
00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:06,271
[SPEAKER_13]: The latter has happened in the city council before too.

468
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:08,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it refers to the former.

469
00:48:09,034 --> 00:48:09,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

470
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,064
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's also discussion of emergency ordinances here.

471
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:22,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

472
00:48:24,822 --> 00:48:31,805
[SPEAKER_13]: it makes sense to me, the current language that an emergency ordinance shall be repealed after the expiration of 60 days.

473
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:37,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there much of a, this is something that's new to Medford, I think.

474
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:49,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there much of a discussion in terms of whether, of making that vote a repeal vote versus an affirmative vote to enshrine?

475
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You can replace the emergency ordinance with something permanent.

476
00:48:56,705 --> 00:49:04,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's the direction that you're moving in terms of addressing the issue.

477
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:04,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

478
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:05,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

479
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:14,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that's all I had for this section.

480
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:17,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other comments or questions from councillors?

481
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:25,889
[SPEAKER_13]: George, I've, you has read for some reason, but you didn't have anything, right?

482
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:27,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, great.

483
00:49:28,651 --> 00:49:28,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

484
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:31,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on to section 2-9.

485
00:49:32,194 --> 00:49:34,075
[SPEAKER_13]: City council confirmation of certain appointments.

486
00:49:34,155 --> 00:49:37,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Do any other, do any councilors have comments or questions on this?

487
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:39,380
[SPEAKER_13]: I see President Bears.

488
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

489
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:41,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Chair Tsang.

490
00:49:42,802 --> 00:49:47,266
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the second of the three charter amendments passed in 2020.

491
00:49:50,703 --> 00:49:51,544
[SPEAKER_04]: three, I believe.

492
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:57,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And this regards the Council confirming the appointments of the mayor.

493
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:05,652
[SPEAKER_04]: The initial amendment that we had put forward that wasn't advanced to the legislature at the time by the mayor

494
00:50:07,513 --> 00:50:15,475
[SPEAKER_04]: would have had us affirmatively approving all appointments unless otherwise noted by mass general law by majority vote.

495
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:25,877
[SPEAKER_04]: This has us having to take a specific motion to reject an appointment by a two thirds vote.

496
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:35,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know that there were some concerns by the mayor about having to send all of the appointments to the council and get affirmative.

497
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:43,195
[SPEAKER_04]: votes, I did read through the study committee report and found that that was relatively common.

498
00:50:45,177 --> 00:50:49,760
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the spirit of compromise, I can understand that concern.

499
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:59,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just propose changing the threshold from a two-thirds vote to a majority vote, which also seems to be very common across most communities.

500
00:50:59,947 --> 00:51:00,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

501
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:21,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a really good point.

502
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:24,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh do folks from do any other city councilors have thoughts on.

503
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:25,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

504
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:27,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

505
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:29,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you and appreciate constantly has bringing us forward.

506
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:34,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that, um and the spirit of what I've seen with this administration.

507
00:51:34,897 --> 00:51:39,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I think having that majority vote in my opinion is isn't robust enough.

508
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I

509
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,984
[SPEAKER_06]: some authority and more openness and transparency when it comes to positions.

510
00:51:54,044 --> 00:52:02,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that one of the biggest things we've seen over the last couple of years is that the positions that are created that this council doesn't even vote for.

511
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:10,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's happened multiple times, not just with this council, but previous councils.

512
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:18,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think lessening that and giving the mayor's office more of autonomy to make these decisions

513
00:52:18,996 --> 00:52:34,408
[SPEAKER_06]: without a more weighted process that really makes it accountable for the position that she's presenting.

514
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:39,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I would rather see the two-thirds vote for the fact that

515
00:52:42,334 --> 00:52:43,395
[SPEAKER_06]: That meat is needed.

516
00:52:43,615 --> 00:52:47,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think my opinions, I don't disagree if I make sure I don't disagree with you.

517
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, the way it's written without my amendment is the council would need two thirds to reject.

518
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:57,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wouldn't see everybody.

519
00:52:58,743 --> 00:53:07,649
[SPEAKER_04]: that we would only appointments would be made and then we would have 30 days to say we don't want that appointment and then it will require two thirds to reject that appointment.

520
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not saying they would come before us.

521
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:10,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually agree.

522
00:53:11,132 --> 00:53:11,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I support.

523
00:53:11,712 --> 00:53:14,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would support if someone else wanted to move in that direction more.

524
00:53:16,448 --> 00:53:19,329
[SPEAKER_04]: affirmative process where all of the appointments come before us.

525
00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:24,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the absence of that, I don't think it should require two-thirds for rejection.

526
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should require just a simple majority to reject an appointment.

527
00:53:28,131 --> 00:53:28,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

528
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:29,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I misunderstood.

529
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:34,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to note that we... I'm reading the red line as I'm reading the original, so... Yes.

530
00:53:34,652 --> 00:53:35,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

531
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:36,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I withdraw.

532
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:37,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

533
00:53:37,093 --> 00:53:39,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wanted to... I completely agree with your sentiment on that.

534
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:43,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I want us to be able to have more authority as regards appointments.

535
00:53:46,594 --> 00:54:09,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, so right now, just to summarize, we are debating or we are discussing changing the requirements that city council reject mayoral appointees with a two-thirds majority, changing that, amending that to just the majority, a majority to reject an appointee, just to frame this conversation.

536
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:15,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Do any other councilors have comments on that proposal, on President Bears's motion?

537
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:28,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any comment from the Charter Study Committee, from Collin Sentry?

538
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:33,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, do we have a second for President Bears' motion?

539
00:54:35,963 --> 00:54:36,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll second.

540
00:54:36,963 --> 00:54:38,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

541
00:55:06,451 --> 00:55:09,454
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to read this back, President Bears.

542
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:14,278
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears, would you include language that a rejection of certain mayoral appointments can be done by a majority vote?

543
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:16,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

544
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that how you want that?

545
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,203
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the recommendation that the state supports that.

546
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:24,207
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second if the Council is compelling.

547
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:27,930
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears?

548
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:28,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

549
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:29,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins?

550
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:31,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

551
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:36,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

552
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:36,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

553
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:37,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair Tsang?

554
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:37,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

555
00:55:38,004 --> 00:55:40,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I have five in favor, none opposed.

556
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:41,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

557
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:54,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

558
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them would pertain if there was a change in the proposed composition.

559
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:12,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll hold those, but we did receive a communication and I noted as well from the chair of the elections commission that the references to the city clerk in here should be references to the elections commission.

560
00:56:13,835 --> 00:56:22,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would move to make those changes, but I'm also just want to see if that is an issue or if the comment center representatives have any

561
00:56:24,696 --> 00:56:25,336
[SPEAKER_04]: notes on that.

562
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:36,019
[SPEAKER_04]: If it should stay as city clerk because we technically adopted a law that said the Elections Commission shall act as city clerk and therefore there are Massachusetts general laws that reference the clerk and not the commission.

563
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:38,539
[SPEAKER_04]: But that seems kind of convoluted.

564
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,281
[SPEAKER_16]: We can certainly revisit state law and make sure everything's in compliance.

565
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:51,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Get to the point where we bring together the final draft.

566
00:56:52,216 --> 00:56:52,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

567
00:56:52,856 --> 00:56:52,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

568
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:57,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think we did hear that note that, I mean, we have the elections commission model.

569
00:56:57,057 --> 00:56:59,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We adopted the mass general law provision.

570
00:56:59,537 --> 00:57:01,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what it is now, a couple of years ago.

571
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:05,339
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have an elections commission running the elections, not the city clerk.

572
00:57:06,279 --> 00:57:17,881
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just move to put that in our notes to the call center as they, so that they can make sure that that is accurate in the final draft.

573
00:57:33,355 --> 00:57:36,518
[SPEAKER_04]: reflect the system that we are operating under.

574
00:57:40,462 --> 00:57:45,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Councilor Collins is telling me that my mic was not on.

575
00:57:45,347 --> 00:57:50,132
[SPEAKER_13]: For Councilor Collins, President Bears has made a motion to request that the Collins Center

576
00:57:50,826 --> 00:58:02,753
[SPEAKER_13]: look at section 2-10, make sure that the references to the city clerk and the election commissions reflect the system that we operate here.

577
00:58:05,174 --> 00:58:11,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I did have one more substance-based question for the members of the Collins Center or the Charter Study Committee.

578
00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:18,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that there, so there's a reference to, so there's a less than 30% mark.

579
00:58:20,216 --> 00:58:21,637
[SPEAKER_13]: for filling the vacancies.

580
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:29,183
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something that I find reasonable, but I'm curious how he arrived at 30% as a number.

581
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:41,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair McDonald?

582
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:46,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, could you come to the microphone so folks at home and other Councilors can hear?

583
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:50,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

584
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:53,969
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

585
00:58:54,369 --> 00:59:02,232
[SPEAKER_22]: As part of the discussion, we looked at other charters and we talked about it and that seemed like a reasonable provision, so we included it.

586
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:04,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I see.

587
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:10,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there charters that go, maybe this is a question that the call-in center would know more.

588
00:59:10,774 --> 00:59:11,895
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some that go to 40%.

589
00:59:12,055 --> 00:59:16,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 30, there are probably a couple at 25.

590
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:23,218
[SPEAKER_13]: I see, so 30 is more of like a median number?

591
00:59:23,238 --> 00:59:23,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

592
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:25,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

593
00:59:28,021 --> 00:59:33,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other questions or comments on section 210 from councillors?

594
00:59:36,446 --> 00:59:37,546
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

595
00:59:37,886 --> 00:59:38,387
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears?

596
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:43,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

597
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I did the wrong mic.

598
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:47,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

599
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:59,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just, I would have some concerns at 30% if the composition of the council were to be as proposed by the study committee, because there'd be a lot of one-on-one races for seats.

600
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:08,417
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would think that in that situation, a 30% result would be not representative.

601
01:00:09,378 --> 01:00:12,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to note that composition wise, that would be a concern for me.

602
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:15,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

603
01:00:15,506 --> 01:00:15,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

604
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:16,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

605
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:17,648
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears.

606
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:20,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's my opinion is similar.

607
01:00:20,731 --> 01:00:30,219
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't want to, um, well, I can't make any motions from the chair, but I also didn't want to make any proposals before we moved before we talked about composition.

608
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:34,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, because I think a lot of this, this does hinge on that.

609
01:00:35,743 --> 01:00:41,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any motions of councils are, um, I actually have a question on that.

610
01:00:41,228 --> 01:00:41,989
[SPEAKER_18]: The, so

611
01:00:44,635 --> 01:01:00,925
[SPEAKER_18]: If a vacancy occurs in the office of Councilor at large, that position is filled by, is it pulled from one of the ward Councilors based on votes received?

612
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,246
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm confused about.

613
01:01:02,866 --> 01:01:09,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Or one of the people who was running for at large, as long as they didn't get less than 30, but you had to have been running for at large.

614
01:01:11,571 --> 01:01:13,232
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my understanding that it's the latter.

615
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:13,292
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

616
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:17,274
[SPEAKER_13]: The call center is confirmed, just for folks watching online.

617
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:18,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Got it.

618
01:01:22,036 --> 01:01:22,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Got it.

619
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:22,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

620
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:31,661
[SPEAKER_13]: I know vacancies is something that we talked about in my charter study committee interview way back when.

621
01:01:31,681 --> 01:01:35,063
[SPEAKER_13]: We talked about different ways of looking at it.

622
01:01:35,183 --> 01:01:41,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there are a lot of arguments that cut in favor of keeping it this way as well.

623
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:54,722
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the main criticism with having the next runner-up fill the seat is that, as President Bears referred to, the next runner-up might not be representative of the will of the voters.

624
01:01:56,263 --> 01:02:00,647
[SPEAKER_13]: But there is also a worry that we would end up having to run a lot of special elections.

625
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:06,873
[SPEAKER_13]: That costs money and time and operational energy at City Hall as well.

626
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:15,595
[SPEAKER_13]: So something to consider as we move forward, but I do think that a lot of this does hinge on the conversation about competition.

627
01:02:16,755 --> 01:02:17,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli?

628
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:25,317
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, I think that with the professionals from the Collins Center, 40% sounds like a lot.

629
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:28,537
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you recommend?

630
01:02:29,398 --> 01:02:35,999
[SPEAKER_06]: What have you seen that really works and where that middle ground where the, you know,

631
01:02:36,863 --> 01:02:39,424
[SPEAKER_06]: extra one-on-one elections that might cost the city money.

632
01:02:39,864 --> 01:02:48,587
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it's the process, but... Well, I think there's also really concern about low turnout at special elections.

633
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:54,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not representative of what the electorate might want.

634
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:04,413
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in choosing the runner up, if they got 30% of the vote, at least you know that they attracted some attention.

635
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:04,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

636
01:03:05,368 --> 01:03:07,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And people thought that they could serve.

637
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:08,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

638
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's my fear.

639
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:18,313
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing what's coming out in local elections recently in Medford, you know, with 60,000 residents and 40,000, 35,000, 40,000 voters and only 13,000, 14,000, 15,000 coming out.

640
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:21,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would pose a problem for the process, you know, going any higher.

641
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:41,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, those who participated in that election.

642
01:03:41,524 --> 01:03:43,365
[SPEAKER_16]: It's votes cast.

643
01:03:43,665 --> 01:03:46,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's votes cast, okay.

644
01:03:47,147 --> 01:03:51,509
[SPEAKER_16]: And keep in mind, it's for the remainder of the existing term.

645
01:03:51,529 --> 01:03:54,270
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're not getting a full term.

646
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:54,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

647
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:58,812
[SPEAKER_16]: They're only completing a two-year term.

648
01:03:59,572 --> 01:04:05,375
[SPEAKER_16]: And they do not get to put on, if they run for the seat after the end of that term.

649
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:08,482
[SPEAKER_16]: They are not candidates for re-election.

650
01:04:08,822 --> 01:04:09,883
[SPEAKER_16]: We will not say that.

651
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:25,271
[SPEAKER_04]: President Barras, to that point in your research, have you found there to be a significant difference in incumbency bias between someone who has the label candidate for re-election and someone who doesn't, even if they were serving?

652
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:30,034
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've never seen a study on it.

653
01:04:33,775 --> 01:04:48,142
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a perception, there is a perception, and there also can be, in some communities, a designation that candidates for re-election are put at the top of the ticket.

654
01:04:48,702 --> 01:04:51,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, which I think this charter gets rid of.

655
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:51,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

656
01:04:51,964 --> 01:04:52,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

657
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:58,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just wondering how much, if you had any knowledge on how much that benefit to incumbents

658
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:07,150
[SPEAKER_04]: is literally the label on the ballot or being able to put Councilor X on their literature or just being in the meetings.

659
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:13,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just being on the council, it's a familiar name.

660
01:05:13,812 --> 01:05:14,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

661
01:05:14,332 --> 01:05:15,992
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen it.

662
01:05:16,172 --> 01:05:18,393
[SPEAKER_02]: It's familiarity, I think.

663
01:05:18,493 --> 01:05:25,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just where I think, I understand why to say, oh, they wouldn't be able to put that on the ballot, but I don't know that that

664
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:32,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get to my point around that when we talk about composition of the council.

665
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

666
01:05:34,574 --> 01:05:34,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

667
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:48,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to clarify that the current text of the ordinance or of the draft city charter is that if they don't reach that 30% threshold, not that we would hold a special election.

668
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:52,499
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we amended that number, it wouldn't be that we hold a special election.

669
01:05:53,380 --> 01:06:00,105
[SPEAKER_13]: The current draft charter says the remaining members of the city council would appoint to fill the vacancy for the rest of the term.

670
01:06:01,026 --> 01:06:06,630
[SPEAKER_13]: That's in subsection C. Just to clarify that point for folks at home.

671
01:06:07,904 --> 01:06:14,913
[SPEAKER_13]: That is something that we could change as a council, right, but I don't hear any appetite to do that.

672
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:16,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, President Bears.

673
01:06:17,816 --> 01:06:25,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just note of all of those options that being selected by duly elected people versus low turnout special election versus low threshold of voting.

674
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:35,568
[SPEAKER_04]: being a selection being made by the rest of the council is probably the most representative of the will of the people in that situation, because the people elected the other Councilors.

675
01:06:36,088 --> 01:06:36,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

676
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:38,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Ferris.

677
01:06:38,388 --> 01:06:47,890
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we have one motion from President Ferris on the floor regarding... There's the Elections Commission, right?

678
01:06:49,731 --> 01:06:50,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a second for that motion?

679
01:06:54,492 --> 01:06:55,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

680
01:06:55,252 --> 01:06:56,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

681
01:06:59,909 --> 01:07:07,675
[SPEAKER_15]: President President Bears with the council language of elections to ensure the language we use reflects the system that we operate method.

682
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:09,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

683
01:07:12,919 --> 01:07:14,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by councilors.

684
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:17,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

685
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:31,398
[SPEAKER_15]: present bears.

686
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:31,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

687
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

688
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

689
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:36,202
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a little Lazzaro.

690
01:07:37,524 --> 01:07:37,964
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a script.

691
01:07:37,984 --> 01:07:38,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Kelly.

692
01:07:38,424 --> 01:07:38,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

693
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:40,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Chairman.

694
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:41,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

695
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:46,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in favor and unopposed motion passes now on to the fun part.

696
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:47,712
[SPEAKER_13]: If that wasn't fun enough.

697
01:07:49,934 --> 01:07:50,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yes.

698
01:07:50,354 --> 01:07:50,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

699
01:07:51,035 --> 01:07:51,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

700
01:07:51,911 --> 01:07:52,672
[SPEAKER_13]: 9.6 slipped my mind.

701
01:07:53,032 --> 01:07:57,034
[SPEAKER_13]: One more fun section before we get to the big topic items.

702
01:07:57,994 --> 01:08:01,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any comments on section 9-6?

703
01:08:01,396 --> 01:08:07,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

704
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,361
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears and then Councilor Wood.

705
01:08:12,262 --> 01:08:14,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

706
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you including this in this meeting.

707
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:24,594
[SPEAKER_04]: as I was going through a section 9-6 in the existing charter's periodic review of ordinances.

708
01:08:25,374 --> 01:08:28,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, ordinances are the purview of the legislative branch.

709
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:37,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the mayor has the ability to sign or veto, but the ordinance authority lies with the legislative branch.

710
01:08:37,263 --> 01:08:43,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, I believe that we should move this section 9-6 to section 2.

711
01:08:43,908 --> 01:08:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I relabel it section 2-11.

712
01:08:47,612 --> 01:08:53,756
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I would make two minor changes, which would be that the city council shall provide for a review.

713
01:08:53,776 --> 01:09:03,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it says the mayor and city council, and I would just change that to read the city council, and that the review shall be made by a special committee to be established by ordinance.

714
01:09:03,663 --> 01:09:06,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I would change that to be established by a vote of the city council.

715
01:09:06,405 --> 01:09:13,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we have a motion from President Bears on a number of amendments, but

716
01:09:13,915 --> 01:09:18,459
[SPEAKER_13]: namely that the special committee be established by a vote at the City Council.

717
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a second for that motion?

718
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:23,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

719
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:27,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we take that- It would be a motion to adopt the language as I propose.

720
01:09:27,185 --> 01:09:27,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

721
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:27,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

722
01:09:29,227 --> 01:09:32,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And we all have that language from the agenda packet.

723
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:32,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lemie?

724
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:38,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chair Sang, for letting me speak.

725
01:09:38,594 --> 01:09:38,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Just

726
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:53,825
[SPEAKER_05]: To clarify for the folks at home, neither Councilor Callahan nor I are on this committee, which means that we can't vote or make motions, but we are at the invitation of the chair able to speak.

727
01:09:55,685 --> 01:10:10,048
[SPEAKER_05]: The one concern that I had was eliminating the part that says the mayor and city council is that you likely would need some support from the executive branch when advertising for the positions that go

728
01:10:12,131 --> 01:10:13,552
[SPEAKER_05]: that would go into that.

729
01:10:13,652 --> 01:10:20,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would help to, you know, have the support from the executive branch to be able to put out feelers.

730
01:10:20,514 --> 01:10:25,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I fully support having it be confirmed by having them be confirmed by a vote of the city council, though.

731
01:10:25,795 --> 01:10:39,580
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just that's just one thought as a potential consequence of removing the mayor and city council, keeping it just city councils that I think would be you do need some staff support for this kind of thing.

732
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine.

733
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:48,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Um And also the city solicitor would be Under under the mayor as well.

734
01:10:48,068 --> 01:10:52,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another concern I would have with removing that explicitly.

735
01:10:52,594 --> 01:10:57,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have some questions about this for the call in center.

736
01:10:57,599 --> 01:10:59,702
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm if I'm able, um

737
01:11:01,271 --> 01:11:07,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So this struck me as a, so two questions.

738
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:11,118
[SPEAKER_05]: One, is this something that is typically in ordinances in other cities?

739
01:11:11,318 --> 01:11:18,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, what usually results from that?

740
01:11:18,424 --> 01:11:22,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So have there been, are there usually like pretty substantial changes that come out of this?

741
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:25,129
[SPEAKER_05]: committees, periodic reviews.

742
01:11:25,809 --> 01:11:31,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any specific instances you can think of where this might have affected policy in the past?

743
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:35,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel like a little bit more historical context would help me out with this one.

744
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:36,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

745
01:11:37,598 --> 01:11:46,425
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very common in charters that you go through a periodic review of the ordinances following a review of the charter.

746
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:52,270
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're trying to guarantee is that those two documents stay in harmony

747
01:11:53,388 --> 01:12:04,231
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for the time, but you understand what I'm saying.

748
01:12:04,271 --> 01:12:07,132
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want one to say one thing and one the other.

749
01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:13,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So the real point of this is to make sure that the ordinances are consistent with any updates to the charter.

750
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:14,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

751
01:12:14,554 --> 01:12:14,834
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

752
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:20,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other is you can then update from any

753
01:12:20,952 --> 01:12:31,802
[SPEAKER_02]: references to state law, any changes to state law that affect your structure and organization that would be in the ordinances, that would be a time that you could make that change.

754
01:12:31,822 --> 01:12:32,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

755
01:12:32,942 --> 01:12:35,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

756
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:43,672
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there was a question for Councilor Fleming about the proposed motion, President

757
01:12:46,235 --> 01:12:46,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

758
01:12:46,535 --> 01:13:05,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, given Councilor Lemmy's comment, I'm happy to amend my proposal to not strike the words mayor and, and then I also just noticed that I also should have changed that the special committee shall file its report with the city clerk on a date specified by a vote of the city council instead of by ordinance.

759
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:10,960
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just further amend my proposal based on Councilor Lemmy's comment and based on that.

760
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

761
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:13,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you?

762
01:13:14,821 --> 01:13:15,681
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll email it.

763
01:13:16,703 --> 01:13:21,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Callaghan, and then Councilor Lazzaro.

764
01:13:24,165 --> 01:13:24,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

765
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:29,207
[SPEAKER_26]: I just had one quick question, which I think Councilor Bears may have just answered.

766
01:13:30,547 --> 01:13:44,331
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not clear to me who is on the committee or who puts people on the committee, but it sounds like what Councilor Bears is suggesting is that it says, this review shall be made by a special committee to be established by a vote of the council.

767
01:13:44,371 --> 01:13:45,672
[SPEAKER_26]: So that would be the council that is

768
01:13:46,864 --> 01:13:49,226
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to understand what that.

769
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:50,346
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

770
01:13:50,466 --> 01:13:52,187
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a suggestion to amend

771
01:14:15,857 --> 01:14:32,569
[SPEAKER_18]: If the intention of this would be to make the ordinances be in alignment with an updated charter, maybe it could say, with every change to the charter, may there be an update or a review of ordinances to align with the charter.

772
01:14:33,109 --> 01:14:45,398
[SPEAKER_18]: This section looks like, and it does say at five-year intervals and each year ending in a seven or a two, it doesn't say every time you update the charter, you'll review all the ordinances to see that they're in alignment with the charter.

773
01:14:45,975 --> 01:14:50,819
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's no implication in this language that that is why it's here.

774
01:14:51,880 --> 01:15:06,373
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, I read this and I thought it was saying there's a special committee appointed to read all of the local ordinances of the city and review them, which I always understood to be the work of city council and what we're doing.

775
01:15:06,893 --> 01:15:07,934
[SPEAKER_18]: on a regular basis anyway.

776
01:15:09,034 --> 01:15:16,598
[SPEAKER_18]: So I thought this was at best redundant as a section to work that's already being done.

777
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:32,266
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe I think my amendment to President Bears's motion would be to say, upon review or changes made to the city charter,

778
01:15:35,436 --> 01:15:37,398
[SPEAKER_18]: and then the rest of this section.

779
01:15:38,639 --> 01:15:45,425
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my understanding from the Collins Center's earlier comment that it's not just for city charter changes.

780
01:15:45,505 --> 01:15:48,207
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also when Massachusetts state law changes.

781
01:15:48,347 --> 01:15:49,408
[SPEAKER_12]: As the state law changes.

782
01:15:49,608 --> 01:15:49,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

783
01:15:50,449 --> 01:15:54,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's mostly to do with your structure and organization.

784
01:15:55,333 --> 01:16:03,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a comprehensive review in the sense that you have to go through every licensing arrangement, especially if it hasn't changed.

785
01:16:06,887 --> 01:16:23,833
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what would be helpful to folks at home and for Councilors is, because Benford hasn't had something like this, at least not under the present form of the charter, could you give us a look into, I think you've described the role, like what they would be doing, but what does this committee typically look like?

786
01:16:23,893 --> 01:16:25,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it composed of lawyers?

787
01:16:28,055 --> 01:16:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's composed, not totally of lawyers, but usually

788
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:56,749
[SPEAKER_02]: a lawyer, maybe a current Councilor, a former Councilor, someone with familiarity with the work, maybe a member of the planning board or the school committee, just willing to get different voices in the sense of their perception of how this ordinance has or has not worked.

789
01:16:57,670 --> 01:17:02,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it meeting the intent when you have to?

790
01:17:04,652 --> 01:17:09,437
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody seeing any glitches or hitches that you could propose to modify.

791
01:17:10,818 --> 01:17:11,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

792
01:17:11,238 --> 01:17:17,283
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that helps a lot with with our understanding of what this is meant to meant to be.

793
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

794
01:17:18,404 --> 01:17:18,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

795
01:17:19,705 --> 01:17:22,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I know President Bears has requested the mic.

796
01:17:22,828 --> 01:17:25,730
[SPEAKER_13]: I also did have a question for Okay.

797
01:17:26,371 --> 01:17:30,695
[SPEAKER_13]: I did have a question for President Bears in by changing the first

798
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,641
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the first reference to the ordinance to a vote of the city council.

799
01:17:35,701 --> 01:17:35,901
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

800
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:43,424
[SPEAKER_13]: And then two sentences from there, it says on a shelf file, it's report with the city clerk on a date specified by ordinance.

801
01:17:44,144 --> 01:17:44,244
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

802
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:02,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Give us a second.

803
01:18:02,612 --> 01:18:02,652
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

804
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:09,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

805
01:18:42,047 --> 01:18:46,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, on President Bears' motion, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

806
01:18:46,649 --> 01:18:59,594
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears, oh, sorry.

807
01:19:02,555 --> 01:19:08,338
[SPEAKER_04]: This motion would move section 9-6 to article 2, make it section 2-11.

808
01:19:10,368 --> 01:19:21,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It would then change the words by ordinance to by vote of the City Council, both in the second sentence and the fourth sentence.

809
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:30,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we still have your second on that?

810
01:19:30,874 --> 01:19:31,154
Great.

811
01:19:33,915 --> 01:19:34,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

812
01:19:42,173 --> 01:19:42,693
[SPEAKER_15]: present bears.

813
01:19:43,754 --> 01:19:43,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

814
01:19:44,555 --> 01:19:45,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

815
01:19:45,896 --> 01:19:46,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

816
01:19:46,136 --> 01:19:48,218
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a little bizarre.

817
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:51,700
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a scrupley chair saying yes.

818
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:52,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in favor.

819
01:19:52,681 --> 01:19:53,321
[SPEAKER_13]: None opposed.

820
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:54,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

821
01:19:55,203 --> 01:19:56,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, back to the fun part.

822
01:19:57,745 --> 01:20:02,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I know President Bears, um, sent us a proposal.

823
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:04,530
[SPEAKER_13]: I recognize you.

824
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,391
[SPEAKER_13]: This would be on the on composition.

825
01:20:07,172 --> 01:20:08,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Section two dash

826
01:20:12,979 --> 01:20:16,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I make a motion actually regarding section 2-4 first?

827
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

828
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:37,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just move that we move section 2-4 to a future meeting and to discuss sections 2-4, 3-1 and 4-4 as a single conversation at a future meeting.

829
01:20:38,324 --> 01:20:39,144
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's 2-4, 3-1, 4-4?

830
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:45,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

831
01:20:45,581 --> 01:21:04,486
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears has moved to discuss, to move section 2-4 to another meeting for discussion, and to discuss it along with 3-1, 4-4, which I understand are all about compensation of the council, the mayor, and the school committee.

832
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:04,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

833
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:09,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a second on President Bears' motion?

834
01:21:20,605 --> 01:21:24,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

835
01:21:24,307 --> 01:21:26,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor, Vice President Collins.

836
01:21:30,391 --> 01:21:31,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro, did you have a question?

837
01:21:34,374 --> 01:21:34,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

838
01:21:36,055 --> 01:21:36,635
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears?

839
01:21:36,876 --> 01:21:37,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

840
01:21:37,696 --> 01:21:38,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins?

841
01:21:39,717 --> 01:21:39,938
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

842
01:21:41,098 --> 01:21:41,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro?

843
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:41,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

844
01:21:42,619 --> 01:21:43,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

845
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:43,960
Yes.

846
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:44,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair Sang?

847
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:45,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

848
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:46,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in favor, none opposed.

849
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:47,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

850
01:21:48,668 --> 01:21:53,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, back to 2-1, composition term of office eligibility.

851
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:59,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have any comments from councilors?

852
01:21:59,214 --> 01:21:59,834
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears?

853
01:22:00,575 --> 01:22:12,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chair Tsang, and just given the length of the meeting so far to get through the smaller stuff, I figured this is gonna take a while, I think.

854
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:21,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And also I think it seems to be the main point of discussion around the proposals that I put forward was around the composition of the council.

855
01:22:22,676 --> 01:22:42,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to set the frame here, the charter study committee recommended to the mayor and then through that to the council, city council composed of 11 members, eight representing each individual ward of the city and three elected at large.

856
01:22:43,857 --> 01:23:01,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And something that I discussed in my conversations with the Charter Study Committee and something that I've had a lot of conversations with the past few years has been what the composition of the council should look like.

857
01:23:04,232 --> 01:23:09,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of the proposal that I put forward tonight, which is to amend that proposal to have

858
01:23:11,336 --> 01:23:26,405
[SPEAKER_04]: to follow what the Charter Study Committee proposed for the school committee, which would be a city council of seven members, three elected at large, and four from districts, which would be composed of two boards each, stems from three factors.

859
01:23:26,586 --> 01:23:35,912
[SPEAKER_04]: One are my principles, two are the data, and three are my experience serving on the council and serving in the leadership of the council for the past three years.

860
01:23:39,638 --> 01:23:47,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've had a lot of conversation in the state and in the country about how should we elect elected officials.

861
01:23:48,842 --> 01:23:57,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're one of only actually I think three countries on a federal level that elects our legislatures by first past the post single district voting.

862
01:24:00,187 --> 01:24:07,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think one of the great advantages of the system that we have now, and I'm not advocating that we maintain an all at large system, is that everybody

863
01:24:08,804 --> 01:24:10,285
[SPEAKER_04]: faces a competitive election.

864
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:12,426
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one district.

865
01:24:12,826 --> 01:24:14,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's running against each other.

866
01:24:15,207 --> 01:24:16,408
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no sailing through.

867
01:24:16,428 --> 01:24:22,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a great New York Times piece talking about proportional representation.

868
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:26,793
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a model that the Cambridge Planning Charter uses.

869
01:24:27,373 --> 01:24:35,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see, through that model, the election of people of differing ideologies representing different bases of voters.

870
01:24:37,288 --> 01:24:41,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Another conversation that's been discussed is a multi member districts.

871
01:24:42,472 --> 01:24:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had the statewide ballot question on rank choice voting.

872
01:24:47,035 --> 01:24:53,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of those are different ways to try to elect people that is not a first pass the posting.

873
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:58,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason for that is that a first pass the post single district system tends to have

874
01:24:59,537 --> 01:25:00,798
[SPEAKER_04]: less than ideal outcomes.

875
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:13,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what is being proposed or was proposed with having a single district first past the post war districts might lead that direction here in the city as well.

876
01:25:14,554 --> 01:25:19,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I have always been a strong supporter of more localized representation.

877
01:25:20,338 --> 01:25:36,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that there are different ways to have ward representation, different ways to have district representation than just saying our only options are all at large or all ward or a hybrid where you have only at large and only ward systems.

878
01:25:37,288 --> 01:25:43,412
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the charter study committee's proposal for the school committee and the reason that I went in that direction

879
01:25:44,027 --> 01:25:46,348
[SPEAKER_04]: with my proposal is that it was already in the draft.

880
01:25:48,410 --> 01:26:03,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to have a bigger conversation about more unique and interesting opportunities and options like proportional representation or ranked choice voting or multi-member districts, but those weren't surveyed, those weren't discussed, those weren't put forward as options.

881
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:26,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I went into the product, the work product of the charter study committee itself and found something that I think met the goal of having more localized representation while also maintaining some of the benefits of the at-large system and while avoiding some of the downsides of having so many of the council seats filled by first past the post single member districts.

882
01:26:29,098 --> 01:26:30,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I proposed what I proposed.

883
01:26:32,882 --> 01:26:40,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned a few different items here in my initial memorandum representation.

884
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:47,804
[SPEAKER_04]: This does bring us to local representation very much so compared to the existing approach of all at large council.

885
01:26:50,341 --> 01:27:01,087
[SPEAKER_04]: accessibility-wise, it would be, I think, easier for voters to understand having a district Councilor, a district school committee member, and then the at-large members.

886
01:27:02,268 --> 01:27:14,695
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd have less voters to, you know, less officials to keep track of, in some senses, or not exactly knowing which side of which street they lived on means that this is their Councilor versus that Councilor.

887
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:18,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly from an efficiency perspective,

888
01:27:19,326 --> 01:27:28,155
[SPEAKER_04]: there wouldn't be a need for more Councilors, chamber renovations, the meetings being longer because more Councilors are talking.

889
01:27:28,816 --> 01:27:33,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm less married to those arguments, although I think they are just facts.

890
01:27:36,745 --> 01:27:39,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is to say that I'm not opposed to a larger council.

891
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:46,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't think that a larger council should be made up of first-past-the-post single-member districts.

892
01:27:46,715 --> 01:28:01,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the great discussion that has happened since I put these out and discussions that I had with lots of folks over the past two, three years, I want to note as well, from a representation perspective,

893
01:28:02,118 --> 01:28:10,922
[SPEAKER_04]: you would have under the ward system of having eight wards versus four districts, significantly different weighting of individuals votes.

894
01:28:11,682 --> 01:28:21,427
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a voter in ward two or ward three, where you have very, very high turnout, your vote would be much less valuable to the selection of a Councilor than a vote in ward one.

895
01:28:21,447 --> 01:28:23,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's an issue.

896
01:28:23,908 --> 01:28:28,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the district moving to the district model mediates that somewhat.

897
01:28:29,382 --> 01:28:45,309
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd also, from a representation perspective, if you look at, for example, racial demographics, there's essentially no difference in racial demographics between the Ward 6 seat and Ward 8 seats being separate and them being combined.

898
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:57,735
[SPEAKER_04]: There's somewhat of a difference in the Ward 7 seat versus combining the Wards 1 and 7 seats, but it's, I think, less than five points or maybe less than 10 points of a difference.

899
01:28:59,517 --> 01:29:09,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have talked to councillors as Councilor Scarpelli did in neighboring communities and other communities around the state that have a hybrid ward council representation.

900
01:29:10,301 --> 01:29:14,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a concern about competitiveness of running.

901
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:19,785
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a lot of uncontested elections for ward seats and

902
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:30,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I think again, that's one of the main concerns in general with first past the post single member districts is essentially you have two people running against each other.

903
01:29:30,461 --> 01:29:35,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, sometimes no one will run for that seat at all.

904
01:29:35,844 --> 01:29:39,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll have an uncontested race right now in Medford.

905
01:29:39,086 --> 01:29:48,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even remember the last time there was an uncontested race for city council, because I'm pretty sure all the elections in the past 20 years, there's been more than seven people running.

906
01:29:48,251 --> 01:29:49,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

907
01:29:52,207 --> 01:30:13,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also heard some concerns about similar to what Councilor Scarpelli raised earlier that I think he, you know, he said those were his concerns before and he feels more alleviated by them from his discussions, but around prioritizing what's happening in one eighth of the city versus the whole city.

908
01:30:16,102 --> 01:30:21,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've heard that as well as a concern from people who serve on bodies that have this type of representation.

909
01:30:22,767 --> 01:30:44,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe that this proposal that I put forward moves us significantly towards local representation of neighborhoods of the city without going down to such a small district and maintaining more of a balance between at large

910
01:30:45,015 --> 01:30:46,296
[SPEAKER_04]: and local representation.

911
01:30:47,176 --> 01:30:49,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I put this forward.

912
01:30:50,218 --> 01:30:53,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really interested to hear the thoughts of my colleagues.

913
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly I'm happy to entertain amendments.

914
01:30:57,382 --> 01:31:05,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say that the, you know, the piece of this that I'm least concerned about is a bigger council.

915
01:31:05,747 --> 01:31:07,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not against a bigger council.

916
01:31:07,308 --> 01:31:11,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I just am against a bigger council being formed exactly in this manner.

917
01:31:11,651 --> 01:31:13,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that we can have a discussion

918
01:31:14,429 --> 01:31:37,058
[SPEAKER_04]: of a model that fits the goals that all of us are seeking and fits, quite frankly, the way that most legislative bodies are elected in most of the world and most of the country, which is not through most of them being elected in first-past-the-post single-member districts.

919
01:31:37,638 --> 01:31:37,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

920
01:31:41,928 --> 01:31:43,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Bears for your comments.

921
01:31:43,929 --> 01:31:47,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I have Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Leming.

922
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:49,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Going to you, Councilor Scarpelli.

923
01:31:49,831 --> 01:31:50,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

924
01:31:51,791 --> 01:32:04,616
[SPEAKER_06]: As I, like I said, I really focused on really looking into this process because it was one of the pieces that really limited me from moving forward with the chattel review.

925
01:32:05,396 --> 01:32:07,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And now as we're seeing the

926
01:32:10,777 --> 01:32:27,087
[SPEAKER_06]: The body that has worked on this, the professionals that have worked on this, and the committee that's gone out to the city and the community and worked diligently with the community have drafted a proposal that I think is what the community is asking for, the residents are asking for.

927
01:32:27,567 --> 01:32:36,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I mentioned the key pieces that I think understanding the representation for all of our wards is so important.

928
01:32:37,116 --> 01:32:50,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when we talked about the ability for someone that's marginalized that might not have the opportunity to run at large.

929
01:32:51,294 --> 01:32:54,657
[SPEAKER_06]: having a better chance running an award, even running in the district.

930
01:32:54,697 --> 01:32:59,541
[SPEAKER_06]: So having a better representation, maybe seeing a council that looks a little different than we see today.

931
01:33:00,081 --> 01:33:03,284
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what I've heard from council, from community members.

932
01:33:03,784 --> 01:33:10,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that when we look at this and I looked across the state, I believe there's only three out of the whole state.

933
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:18,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe there's only three, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's only three that have a seven body council when you look at this format.

934
01:33:19,098 --> 01:33:24,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what you see is a council of ward representation and at-large members.

935
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:40,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's a huge involvement and openness and form of transparency, communication, and reachability to every corner of our community.

936
01:33:41,922 --> 01:33:49,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think what the Charter Review Committee has put forth with the 11 members, I think it's important.

937
01:33:49,307 --> 01:33:59,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's something that I think the, tell me if I'm wrong, but the majority of the community has said to me, and this is why I know so much about it, because I was against it.

938
01:33:59,935 --> 01:34:01,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I was against ward representation completely.

939
01:34:01,996 --> 01:34:07,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So now when you sit and talk and the understanding of every single ward, imagine telling one ward they're not represented.

940
01:34:07,841 --> 01:34:10,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but no, no, the district, but it's not the ward.

941
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:15,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what we're seeing right now because we're the divide in this community.

942
01:34:15,953 --> 01:34:17,394
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a huge divide in this community.

943
01:34:17,854 --> 01:34:22,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of those divides is people feeling that they don't, they're not listened to.

944
01:34:22,937 --> 01:34:25,499
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not, they don't have anybody that they feel they can go to.

945
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:33,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially when you see the demographic method now, we have a lot of new method residents coming in that have grown up in communities that have ward representation.

946
01:34:33,745 --> 01:34:34,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So that comfort level is gone.

947
01:34:34,925 --> 01:34:37,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've eliminated themselves of being part of that process.

948
01:34:38,397 --> 01:34:43,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're seeing so many pieces that this fits.

949
01:34:45,678 --> 01:34:52,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And changing what is put forth I think would be a frightening thought because here's the piece.

950
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:58,361
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw with the override question that this community was divided.

951
01:34:59,461 --> 01:35:05,062
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're seeing right now, what I'm hearing from both sides saying that this is something they like, it fits.

952
01:35:06,102 --> 01:35:10,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that you meet, you can really go and I think this would be something that they could support and move forward.

953
01:35:11,246 --> 01:35:21,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell you the comments that I've heard from residents saying if we go to seven, doesn't that sound like and against conspiracy theory but unfortunately this community runs on.

954
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:27,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't this sound like it's just an organization wanting to keep the numbers down so they can control this council?

955
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:29,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not saying that it is.

956
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:32,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying that this is the perception that goes out.

957
01:35:33,347 --> 01:35:39,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where, when it comes down to a vote of charter change, charter review, and a vote, this is where we won't get the support.

958
01:35:40,491 --> 01:35:42,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, again, I say this publicly.

959
01:35:43,192 --> 01:35:44,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe in that.

960
01:35:44,593 --> 01:35:47,875
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are the questions that have been brought up that said, when we go to the vote,

961
01:35:48,991 --> 01:35:59,476
[SPEAKER_06]: let's give the city what they've been asking for, what the professionals have brought forward, what the committee that has worked so hard to go to every corner of the city and draft this.

962
01:36:01,497 --> 01:36:03,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that's very important.

963
01:36:04,898 --> 01:36:15,523
[SPEAKER_06]: When we look at the different compensation piece, I know we've held that off and we're gonna revisit that again, but I've listened to some community members that had said, you know what?

964
01:36:17,143 --> 01:36:23,105
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in fiscal crisis, we're having financial difficulties in Medford, even with 11 people, how would you correct it and say, well, you know what?

965
01:36:23,525 --> 01:36:29,046
[SPEAKER_06]: By moving toward representation, your schedule isn't as busy.

966
01:36:29,126 --> 01:36:32,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not reaching out to every corner of the city.

967
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:38,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe the compensation could be lowered because it would be less work in theory.

968
01:36:38,549 --> 01:36:42,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, there's so many pieces that you look at this and say, well, this is, it fits.

969
01:36:44,675 --> 01:36:51,219
[SPEAKER_06]: because ultimately what we want is we want this community to vote for it and support it and move forward to change what we need in our community.

970
01:36:51,699 --> 01:36:53,700
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a piece that I think is very important.

971
01:36:54,301 --> 01:37:05,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've said it a thousand times, and every member here, I've heard it and I've seen it on the campaign trail, that really having a representation of a more diverse council, right?

972
01:37:08,309 --> 01:37:13,812
[SPEAKER_06]: What could support a more diverse council but getting people that are marginalized, giving them the opportunity

973
01:37:14,467 --> 01:37:21,110
[SPEAKER_06]: to really control the opportunity to win a seat.

974
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:25,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a bigger district, not a bigger community at large, but looking at a ward.

975
01:37:26,512 --> 01:37:28,032
[SPEAKER_06]: That's achievable for everybody.

976
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:39,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know I joked with Councilor Beaz earlier, but we're hearing it, you know, you wouldn't really have in our revolutions text Councilor Scarpelli.

977
01:37:41,263 --> 01:37:43,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get an email that they asked if I can read it.

978
01:37:43,826 --> 01:37:58,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is something that our revolution members put forth that many people voted for them because of this and that's what was said was our revolution metric advocates for transitions methods current at large electoral system.

979
01:37:59,074 --> 01:38:00,994
[SPEAKER_06]: to award-based representation model.

980
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:11,397
[SPEAKER_06]: This change aims to ensure that each neighborhood has direct representation and the city government promoting equitable participation and addressing the unique needs of diverse communities.

981
01:38:11,937 --> 01:38:25,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And their 2023-24 method people platform, ORM, our revolution method, emphasizes the importance of the city charter reform to implement ward representation, therefore enhancing the inclusivity,

982
01:38:28,552 --> 01:38:31,314
[SPEAKER_06]: inclusivity and responsiveness of local governance.

983
01:38:32,395 --> 01:38:35,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So I remind my colleagues that this is what you ran on.

984
01:38:35,117 --> 01:38:36,658
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your platform that you ran on.

985
01:38:37,699 --> 01:38:42,182
[SPEAKER_06]: And to come in today, this is what leaves the city divided.

986
01:38:42,242 --> 01:38:46,485
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what then comes in and says, you know what, then I know this committee did great.

987
01:38:46,726 --> 01:38:48,347
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to see some change, but you know what?

988
01:38:49,311 --> 01:38:51,132
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems disingenuous, to be honest with you.

989
01:38:51,513 --> 01:38:52,713
[SPEAKER_06]: So they sit back and say, what?

990
01:38:52,753 --> 01:38:53,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not gonna vote for it.

991
01:38:53,934 --> 01:39:00,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm gonna tell my families that are saying, well, instead of voting for the change of charter, why jeopardize this with something that works?

992
01:39:01,099 --> 01:39:06,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe the call in Senate can prove me wrong, but there's a reason why we do 11, right?

993
01:39:07,023 --> 01:39:11,826
[SPEAKER_06]: There's eight members, every ward is represented, and then the three at large.

994
01:39:12,807 --> 01:39:16,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And correct me if I'm wrong, the majority, if not,

995
01:39:17,988 --> 01:39:25,490
[SPEAKER_06]: most of the state that has the ward representation has this form, correct?

996
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:33,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like I said, I thought there's only three that have such a limited district process.

997
01:39:34,732 --> 01:39:45,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and again, I urge my colleagues to follow the advice of the professionals, follow the advice of the people that have been in the streets in Medford, not nationally,

998
01:39:46,611 --> 01:39:55,701
[SPEAKER_06]: not different parts of the country, but in Medford, what they've done for their work to reach every corner of Medford that came out and said, let's do this.

999
01:39:56,922 --> 01:40:00,646
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that I feel strongly about, and I think that we should support this and leave it as it is.

1000
01:40:01,627 --> 01:40:05,591
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Mr. President, I mean, Mr. Chairperson.

1001
01:40:16,252 --> 01:40:16,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1002
01:40:17,253 --> 01:40:19,075
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to organize my thoughts.

1003
01:40:19,235 --> 01:40:21,817
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wrote some stuff down that I wanted to talk about.

1004
01:40:22,237 --> 01:40:25,660
[SPEAKER_18]: I've changed my mind back and forth on this issue a number of times.

1005
01:40:27,761 --> 01:40:34,046
[SPEAKER_18]: When I was running for office, one of my primary issues was word-based representation.

1006
01:40:34,086 --> 01:40:38,810
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's really, really difficult for a new candidate to run for office across the whole city.

1007
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:40,451
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really expensive.

1008
01:40:40,751 --> 01:40:42,713
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really time consuming.

1009
01:40:43,253 --> 01:40:44,354
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's hard when you have a job.

1010
01:40:44,414 --> 01:40:45,515
[SPEAKER_18]: It's hard when you have a family.

1011
01:40:46,387 --> 01:40:54,212
[SPEAKER_18]: to run for office for the first time in a city of 60,000 residents when you've never done it before.

1012
01:40:54,232 --> 01:41:00,757
[SPEAKER_18]: It was very difficult to do.

1013
01:41:00,777 --> 01:41:06,060
[SPEAKER_18]: I still believe that it would be easier to run in one ward than it would across the whole city.

1014
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,182
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would also be easier to run in two wards.

1015
01:41:09,262 --> 01:41:10,143
[SPEAKER_18]: All of that being said,

1016
01:41:11,437 --> 01:41:24,663
[SPEAKER_18]: The more I've looked at it and talked to residents and talked to members of the Charter Study Committee, it's becoming more clear to me that

1017
01:41:30,987 --> 01:41:43,020
[SPEAKER_18]: It's become clear to me that the work of the study committee has shown that the residents and the emails that I'm getting and the conversations that I'm having are telling me that the residents are interested in word based representation and that

1018
01:41:44,423 --> 01:41:56,125
[SPEAKER_18]: this would increase the number of city councillors significantly and would make our meetings which are already much too long, prohibitively too long, which is also a barrier for people running for office.

1019
01:41:56,565 --> 01:41:58,365
[SPEAKER_18]: These meetings are a problem.

1020
01:41:58,385 --> 01:42:12,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Um and with 11 city councillors, they will be Way too long, and that is something else we will have to talk about, which is a rules change, which we have tried to implement and It hasn't changed very much.

1021
01:42:13,475 --> 01:42:21,661
[SPEAKER_18]: These are things, these are all things to talk about, but if we want to make these roles accessible to our residents, all of these things need to be talked about together.

1022
01:42:23,122 --> 01:42:24,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford is an outlier in a few ways.

1023
01:42:25,104 --> 01:42:27,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe one of the ways is that our city council is small.

1024
01:42:27,246 --> 01:42:31,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Another one of the ways is that we do public participation on every agenda item.

1025
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:36,813
[SPEAKER_18]: When you do public participation on every agenda item, it makes your meetings very long.

1026
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:41,856
[SPEAKER_18]: That means that we are up in here until 11, 12, 1 in the morning.

1027
01:42:41,876 --> 01:42:43,897
[SPEAKER_18]: I have kids.

1028
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:45,018
[SPEAKER_18]: I have another job.

1029
01:42:45,599 --> 01:42:46,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody else has another job.

1030
01:42:47,781 --> 01:42:48,862
[SPEAKER_18]: Many of us have kids.

1031
01:42:50,483 --> 01:42:51,544
[SPEAKER_18]: We have things going on.

1032
01:42:51,644 --> 01:42:54,066
[SPEAKER_18]: We have obligations at home.

1033
01:42:54,687 --> 01:43:02,374
[SPEAKER_18]: So if there are 11 of us with no restrictions on city councilors talking and no limit to the time that we're here,

1034
01:43:04,401 --> 01:43:07,063
[SPEAKER_18]: This is also a barrier to people running for office.

1035
01:43:07,644 --> 01:43:23,037
[SPEAKER_18]: So when we talk about expanding the opportunities for people to be involved in their city government, we have to really talk about the actual barriers that people face.

1036
01:43:24,868 --> 01:43:39,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, in order to increase diversity in our elected offices, we're not going to go to somebody's door in the ward where we know it's more diverse and knock on the doors, the people of color and the women and the queer people and say, Hey, we need you.

1037
01:43:39,342 --> 01:43:40,303
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to come do this.

1038
01:43:41,276 --> 01:43:46,961
[SPEAKER_18]: job that's really difficult, you have to stay up really late and get abused by the public.

1039
01:43:47,121 --> 01:43:48,922
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to do it because that's your job.

1040
01:43:49,863 --> 01:43:51,545
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not fair to do that to people.

1041
01:43:51,685 --> 01:43:57,990
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not fair to ask that of people without protecting, to some degree, people that are serving in these roles.

1042
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:07,758
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think if we really care about having people come and be representatives and be involved in local government,

1043
01:44:08,921 --> 01:44:30,666
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about much more than just what I think the Charter Study Committee and I also, when I was running as a candidate, came in with what we all did with a pure heart saying, let's open up this opportunity, which I still think that we probably should do.

1044
01:44:30,686 --> 01:44:36,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Is our pure heartedness was to say, let's make this easier.

1045
01:44:37,948 --> 01:44:40,270
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's also make it better.

1046
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:43,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's also pass the ordinances that make this a welcoming place.

1047
01:44:43,912 --> 01:44:55,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's also make everything about City Hall accessible and genuinely good and safe for everyone, all of it together.

1048
01:44:55,401 --> 01:45:03,087
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't happen just with one element falling into place, but with all of these elements coming in together at the same time.

1049
01:45:08,118 --> 01:45:11,500
[SPEAKER_18]: I keep going back and forth because I feel very conflicted about it.

1050
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:21,985
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I will probably decide to support word-based representation based on the communications that I've had with people this week and last week.

1051
01:45:22,226 --> 01:45:33,272
[SPEAKER_18]: But I would have a lot of thoughts about what would have to go along with that in order to make it feasible in my mind.

1052
01:45:36,589 --> 01:45:44,953
[SPEAKER_18]: I respect that this came from research and surveys and communications with the public.

1053
01:45:45,313 --> 01:45:49,015
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

1054
01:45:49,035 --> 01:45:49,575
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand that.

1055
01:46:01,736 --> 01:46:02,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1056
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:26,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also just suggest as a potential compromise here, and I understand that this option wasn't really investigated too much by the Charter Study Committee, but having a 5-4 system, five at large, four district based as a possible in between option.

1057
01:46:26,968 --> 01:46:29,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't make a motion for that, but I

1058
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:32,310
[SPEAKER_05]: think it does.

1059
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:48,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that would address some of the concerns with some of the words being too small and also expand the council, which I hear which I think a lot of residents have really been asking for.

1060
01:46:48,754 --> 01:46:54,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I do agree with my colleagues on some of the

1061
01:46:55,708 --> 01:46:58,729
[SPEAKER_05]: issues with expanding the council, namely the length of meetings.

1062
01:46:59,029 --> 01:47:19,513
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would support a change to the council rules limiting individual councilor speaking times that would only go into effect after the expansion of the council, if that were the decision that this body ended up making.

1063
01:47:19,553 --> 01:47:19,953
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be

1064
01:47:21,249 --> 01:47:24,670
[SPEAKER_05]: that those rules wouldn't necessarily go into the charter itself.

1065
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:39,052
[SPEAKER_05]: But I strongly believe that it would help to make meetings more efficient and keep a keep a cap on the time that these meetings end up going to.

1066
01:47:39,633 --> 01:47:39,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1067
01:47:41,793 --> 01:47:42,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

1068
01:47:43,773 --> 01:47:44,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Callahan.

1069
01:47:44,553 --> 01:47:46,614
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1070
01:47:47,214 --> 01:47:47,314
[SPEAKER_26]: Um,

1071
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:58,635
[SPEAKER_26]: So I definitely am in favor of having a hybrid system that has some wards or districts and some at large.

1072
01:48:02,416 --> 01:48:08,659
[SPEAKER_26]: To me, whether it is four districts, eight wards, each of our wards has two parts, that would be 16.

1073
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:15,602
[SPEAKER_26]: That to me is not as much of the question in terms of

1074
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:18,056
[SPEAKER_26]: do we have boards or districts?

1075
01:48:18,317 --> 01:48:20,217
[SPEAKER_26]: If we have four districts, we have eight wards.

1076
01:48:20,257 --> 01:48:30,781
[SPEAKER_26]: To me, we are still using, like forming these more local elected offices, which I am in favor of.

1077
01:48:32,721 --> 01:48:40,684
[SPEAKER_26]: I do definitely appreciate a lot of what President Bears has said about first past the post, single district.

1078
01:48:41,084 --> 01:48:42,725
[SPEAKER_26]: Those genuinely are,

1079
01:48:44,971 --> 01:48:52,213
[SPEAKER_26]: not the greatest way to elect people, not necessarily the best representation of democracy.

1080
01:48:53,474 --> 01:49:04,037
[SPEAKER_26]: They also lead to long incumbencies because it is far more difficult to oust an incumbent.

1081
01:49:06,558 --> 01:49:08,079
[SPEAKER_26]: I was very curious.

1082
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:10,779
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that in Massachusetts, we do

1083
01:49:12,715 --> 01:49:24,022
[SPEAKER_26]: We are a little bit of an outlier currently, especially with seven at large, but also in terms of the number of city councilors that we have for the size of our population.

1084
01:49:24,802 --> 01:49:28,625
[SPEAKER_26]: And I was really curious to look outside of Massachusetts.

1085
01:49:29,325 --> 01:49:30,746
[SPEAKER_26]: And if I could share my screen.

1086
01:49:30,766 --> 01:49:38,451
[SPEAKER_13]: That might have to be from the clerk.

1087
01:49:40,953 --> 01:49:41,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there we go.

1088
01:49:42,077 --> 01:49:43,258
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1089
01:49:43,418 --> 01:49:45,820
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry that this is so small.

1090
01:49:46,661 --> 01:49:50,544
[SPEAKER_26]: And this should only be, hang on.

1091
01:49:53,406 --> 01:49:54,788
[SPEAKER_26]: I only wanna share that one.

1092
01:49:54,828 --> 01:49:55,889
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me see if I can do that.

1093
01:50:00,613 --> 01:50:02,214
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the one I picked, but it didn't, oh, I see.

1094
01:50:02,374 --> 01:50:02,994
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, okay, great.

1095
01:50:12,922 --> 01:50:35,588
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, so what I did was I went ahead and I looked at other states and other cities, and I mean, I literally just went to Chattopiti, and I asked Chattopiti, please give me 10 cities in New England that are around 60,000 population.

1096
01:50:35,668 --> 01:50:37,449
[SPEAKER_26]: And I said, please give me 10 cities in the South.

1097
01:50:37,829 --> 01:50:41,090
[SPEAKER_26]: I said, please give me 10 cities in the West, 10 cities in the Midwest, and I just,

1098
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:47,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, you know, there was no picking of which cities these were.

1099
01:50:47,633 --> 01:50:50,715
[SPEAKER_26]: These are, I believe, a quite random sampling.

1100
01:50:52,076 --> 01:50:54,497
[SPEAKER_26]: And they're all, you know, somewhere around 60,000.

1101
01:50:55,378 --> 01:51:09,346
[SPEAKER_26]: And I looked just to have an understanding of other states and other cities that aren't Massachusetts, and how many city councilors they have per population.

1102
01:51:10,047 --> 01:51:11,788
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's a range.

1103
01:51:12,783 --> 01:51:18,906
[SPEAKER_26]: I think population per city council ranges from about 4,000 to about 15,000.

1104
01:51:19,347 --> 01:51:24,449
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a lot of, you know, there's a big range.

1105
01:51:24,469 --> 01:51:29,732
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a large, there's wards or districts, and there's a lot of hybrid.

1106
01:51:30,312 --> 01:51:32,373
[SPEAKER_26]: There are a few that are purely wards.

1107
01:51:33,474 --> 01:51:39,277
[SPEAKER_26]: And what I thought was interesting is that at the number seven, and this has, I think it ended up with 48,

1108
01:51:41,589 --> 01:51:43,931
[SPEAKER_26]: because there was one that was 99,000, I got rid of that one.

1109
01:51:45,572 --> 01:51:55,239
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's 48 listed here and we just so happen in population per city councilor to rank 24th, which is exactly in the center.

1110
01:51:55,839 --> 01:52:00,923
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, this is a pretty random sampling of cities that are close to 60,000.

1111
01:52:02,084 --> 01:52:06,247
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just wanted to sort of provide that as what I think is

1112
01:52:07,621 --> 01:52:11,745
[SPEAKER_26]: know, looking, it includes some in Massachusetts as well.

1113
01:52:12,245 --> 01:52:19,132
[SPEAKER_26]: And Massachusetts does tend to have far larger city councils per population than other states.

1114
01:52:21,033 --> 01:52:28,801
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe we want to be more like other cities, maybe we think that other states and cities in the country also understand how to do a democracy.

1115
01:52:30,182 --> 01:52:31,143
[SPEAKER_26]: I personally don't

1116
01:52:32,045 --> 01:52:33,226
[SPEAKER_26]: have an opinion either way.

1117
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:36,208
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think that Massachusetts is necessary.

1118
01:52:36,248 --> 01:52:38,230
[SPEAKER_26]: The way we do things is necessarily better.

1119
01:52:38,270 --> 01:52:40,611
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think the way other states do it is necessarily better.

1120
01:52:41,312 --> 01:52:54,102
[SPEAKER_26]: But I just thought it was interesting to kind of take a look at a random sampling of cities across the country that have approximately our population and what their size of city council is and also what their sort of composition is.

1121
01:52:54,662 --> 01:52:55,443
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just wanted to provide that.

1122
01:52:55,523 --> 01:52:55,723
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

1123
01:52:57,695 --> 01:52:58,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1124
01:52:59,877 --> 01:53:06,723
[SPEAKER_13]: In the order I saw, President Bears, Vice President Collins, and then Councilor Scarpelli.

1125
01:53:09,052 --> 01:53:14,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and I appreciate that information as well.

1126
01:53:14,355 --> 01:53:23,459
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to see, and two of the examples I saw in there were Revere and Weymouth, and you had a much more balanced distribution of at-large and district Councilors.

1127
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:33,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Weymouth, I saw in there six, I believe six district five at-large, or maybe it was six at-large, five district, but again, right.

1128
01:53:33,544 --> 01:53:35,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, district, not ward.

1129
01:53:37,054 --> 01:53:42,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make a point that this is local representation, the proposal that I put forward.

1130
01:53:44,861 --> 01:53:54,290
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a survey that went out that asked about one way that that could look, and people said we'd like a hybrid between local representation and an at-large.

1131
01:53:55,691 --> 01:54:02,517
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't ask about a number of other ways that that could have been formulated, and we don't know what the survey would have said.

1132
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:09,134
[SPEAKER_04]: other than to say that the survey said they want a hybrid of more local representation and at large representation.

1133
01:54:10,034 --> 01:54:14,777
[SPEAKER_04]: People did not want to stay at all at large, by and large, although I think some percentage did.

1134
01:54:15,438 --> 01:54:18,760
[SPEAKER_04]: People did not want all local representation.

1135
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:20,261
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted some form in the middle.

1136
01:54:21,722 --> 01:54:23,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And this proposal maintains that.

1137
01:54:25,364 --> 01:54:31,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it, I've seen a bunch of people who are very anti our revolution, Medford, who say we should stay at all at large.

1138
01:54:32,968 --> 01:54:39,953
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've seen a number of people who feel differently about that from different political persuasions.

1139
01:54:39,993 --> 01:54:44,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this is about politics in the most base sense.

1140
01:54:45,377 --> 01:54:47,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people have a lot of different opinions about how this should look.

1141
01:54:48,460 --> 01:55:00,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, my principle that I have said since I started running, a principle of the Our Revolution Mentored Platform was more local representation and not just having at large representation.

1142
01:55:00,889 --> 01:55:02,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And I stand fully with that.

1143
01:55:05,063 --> 01:55:09,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, another one was about more diversity.

1144
01:55:10,325 --> 01:55:21,908
[SPEAKER_04]: The demographics difference between the ward, going to all eight and doing four districts was not really statistically significant demographic difference in that makeup.

1145
01:55:24,549 --> 01:55:26,750
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of a five at large four district,

1146
01:55:27,855 --> 01:55:47,379
[SPEAKER_04]: fine with that, too, if making the priority being a larger council, which I know the Charter Study Committee noted, and Chair McDonald has noted online, that having a larger council would make more sense in terms of our comparable communities in Massachusetts.

1147
01:55:47,619 --> 01:55:48,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not against that.

1148
01:55:49,299 --> 01:55:53,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I just proposed what was proposed for the school committee in the Charter Study Committee's recommendation.

1149
01:55:54,481 --> 01:56:18,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And my main concern remains having more of a balance than three to eight of essentially a giant multi-member district for three councilors, which is a more fair way of electing people, and eight single district first past the post elections, which may in fact countervail our priorities for more diversity and more representation if we end up with

1150
01:56:19,988 --> 01:56:30,774
[SPEAKER_04]: people incumbents winning those elections and sitting in those seats for 20 years unchallenged because that happens a lot in communities that have a lot of small districts.

1151
01:56:31,454 --> 01:56:35,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I just want to note the other point that I made earlier.

1152
01:56:36,851 --> 01:56:46,774
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have a bunch of small districts, given the traditional turnout in this community, we're devaluing certain votes and highly more valuing other votes in the city.

1153
01:56:47,194 --> 01:56:55,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the district model proposed, whether it's three at large and four district or five at large and four district, it's a better balance between the two.

1154
01:56:56,476 --> 01:57:03,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It avoids some of the pitfalls of having votes weighted so differently against each other.

1155
01:57:05,888 --> 01:57:08,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think it would serve the community better.

1156
01:57:08,071 --> 01:57:09,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I propose this.

1157
01:57:09,132 --> 01:57:13,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my basic principle of why I propose literally everything I ever do here.

1158
01:57:13,318 --> 01:57:18,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So to anyone who may question that for whatever purpose, you're wrong.

1159
01:57:19,265 --> 01:57:19,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1160
01:57:22,209 --> 01:57:24,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli, give me a sec.

1161
01:57:31,802 --> 01:57:33,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Councilor Collins.

1162
01:57:33,925 --> 01:57:34,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry, sorry.

1163
01:57:34,826 --> 01:57:35,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

1164
01:57:39,066 --> 01:57:40,907
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chair Sine, I appreciate that.

1165
01:57:42,469 --> 01:57:44,490
[SPEAKER_24]: I really appreciate the discussion on this.

1166
01:57:45,631 --> 01:57:56,179
[SPEAKER_24]: So far, I know that this is, you know, we come to this discussion after months of work and outreach and diligence and research by the members of the Charter Study Committee and the Collins Center.

1167
01:57:56,440 --> 01:58:01,323
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want to, again, state how much I appreciate all of that hard work and that collaboration so far.

1168
01:58:06,761 --> 01:58:12,383
[SPEAKER_24]: So my thoughts on this issue, again, going to restate some of what was already said by my fellow Councilors.

1169
01:58:13,223 --> 01:58:23,186
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course, we could see from the data that respondents who did respond to the survey favored ward-based representation when compared to all at large.

1170
01:58:24,346 --> 01:58:30,129
[SPEAKER_24]: I do think that it is significant that district based and other models were not given as options for comparison.

1171
01:58:31,349 --> 01:58:32,369
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not a criticism.

1172
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:45,335
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just simply that I don't think that that means that this council should have this discussion as though those options are not also on the table because we have a responsibility to do our due diligence and make amendments or approve.

1173
01:58:46,095 --> 01:58:51,759
[SPEAKER_24]: or approve the proposal based on what we think will be best for the long-term future of this community.

1174
01:58:54,021 --> 01:59:06,430
[SPEAKER_24]: My bottom line is I think that the proposed amendment regarding composition still represents a very, very big improvement towards more localized representation, making representation much more localized than it has been in a very, very long time, perhaps ever.

1175
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:07,991
[SPEAKER_24]: I know

1176
01:59:11,504 --> 01:59:20,133
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we all know, we all concur that running in a smaller pool in some ways reduces the barriers to running for office, especially financially.

1177
01:59:20,153 --> 01:59:21,194
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to fundraise less.

1178
01:59:21,455 --> 01:59:22,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Fundraising is very difficult.

1179
01:59:24,298 --> 01:59:28,462
[SPEAKER_24]: But I don't think that we should discuss this as if that is the whole story.

1180
01:59:30,004 --> 01:59:35,508
[SPEAKER_24]: to improving representation and making representation more proportional to demographics.

1181
01:59:36,389 --> 01:59:39,131
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think that ward-based representation is a panacea.

1182
01:59:40,151 --> 01:59:45,175
[SPEAKER_24]: I certainly don't think that it's a panacea for making marginalized populations more equitably represented.

1183
01:59:45,195 --> 01:59:50,379
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that for us to pursue that as though it's a silver bullet,

1184
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:57,175
[SPEAKER_24]: would be a misguided reason to pursue a ward-based representation.

1185
01:59:57,636 --> 02:00:04,063
[SPEAKER_24]: Running is inherently difficult for millions of reasons, and I do believe that it will take decades or more to truly equalize the playing field.

1186
02:00:04,843 --> 02:00:09,448
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think my bottom line on this is that wards do not deserve simple representation full stop.

1187
02:00:10,289 --> 02:00:14,293
[SPEAKER_24]: What wards deserve is compelling and competitive elections each and every time.

1188
02:00:15,434 --> 02:00:30,465
[SPEAKER_24]: And I have concerns that the proposal that we're currently looking at from the Charter Study Committee, I'm very concerned that those elections would not result in compelling and competitive elections each and every time.

1189
02:00:30,966 --> 02:00:37,931
[SPEAKER_24]: My research has indicated to me that in quite small wards like we have in Medford, the pool of candidates tends to be very small.

1190
02:00:38,872 --> 02:00:41,574
[SPEAKER_24]: It's very common for incumbents to go unchallenged.

1191
02:00:42,454 --> 02:01:02,100
[SPEAKER_24]: And for incumbents, when they do decide that they want to retire from those elected positions, to privately appoint a successor, put off their announcement until the last moment, which all but ensures that other challenges do not have the time to jump in the race and have a real shot at participating in that competitive election.

1192
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:03,581
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't think that that is democratic.

1193
02:01:03,641 --> 02:01:10,943
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think that that is our shared goal for more competitive and more locally representative offices.

1194
02:01:13,655 --> 02:01:19,179
[SPEAKER_24]: Lastly, I'll just say, you know, I know that this is this is a big deal because this is the guiding document for the city.

1195
02:01:19,719 --> 02:01:28,305
[SPEAKER_24]: And hopefully I am really confident that we will arrive at a document that all of us can feel, you know, like any product of compromise that we can all feel a little bit good about and a little bit wistful about.

1196
02:01:29,506 --> 02:01:39,893
[SPEAKER_24]: But as city councilors, it is our responsibility to apply our perspective and our good faith opinions to this process, even in perhaps especially when it's unpopular.

1197
02:01:41,434 --> 02:01:41,995
[SPEAKER_24]: It's certainly

1198
02:01:44,083 --> 02:01:58,889
[SPEAKER_24]: It's certainly more politically expedient to do what is popular, but our job is to research and advance what we think would be best for the community in the long run, regardless of the impact on us as individual electeds and individual future candidates.

1199
02:01:59,129 --> 02:02:01,851
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the reason for my opinion on this matter.

1200
02:02:03,211 --> 02:02:03,471
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1201
02:02:05,832 --> 02:02:07,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Collins.

1202
02:02:07,433 --> 02:02:12,155
[SPEAKER_13]: I got Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Callahan, Councilor Lazzaro.

1203
02:02:14,275 --> 02:02:15,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1204
02:02:15,877 --> 02:02:33,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I look at this presentation as something very important for the goal of this initiative being strong enough that the voters will pass and support what we bring forth.

1205
02:02:34,433 --> 02:02:41,539
[SPEAKER_06]: What we've done is we've had the opportunity for a group of people to go out and get the information from the people.

1206
02:02:42,505 --> 02:02:48,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we brought in the professionals from the Collins Center to support and guide.

1207
02:02:49,509 --> 02:02:51,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what's come out.

1208
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:56,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard some of my colleagues look at this, and I've got to be very honest with you.

1209
02:02:57,252 --> 02:03:01,475
[SPEAKER_06]: We say it's not political, but I hear a lot of double talk.

1210
02:03:01,495 --> 02:03:06,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually sitting back shocked that I'm saying, I can't believe that I'm saying what I'm saying.

1211
02:03:06,977 --> 02:03:09,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hearing this from the people on your own platform

1212
02:03:10,908 --> 02:03:21,954
[SPEAKER_06]: that you've said, quote unquote, like directly, that the importance of a city charter reform is implementing award representation.

1213
02:03:24,035 --> 02:03:30,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just confused because it seems like a lot of you are backpedaling for the platform that you were elected to.

1214
02:03:30,778 --> 02:03:37,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, when it fit that dialogue, you've also said, well, these are the people that I knocked on their doors.

1215
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:41,144
[SPEAKER_06]: And those people, I have to support them.

1216
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:47,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to push that agenda through, even though sometimes it's not best for the whole community, but these are the people that helped you.

1217
02:03:47,392 --> 02:03:48,654
[SPEAKER_06]: You've said it and elected you.

1218
02:03:49,014 --> 02:03:52,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, maybe you could say it's not true, but I'll say it over and over again.

1219
02:03:52,679 --> 02:03:55,323
[SPEAKER_06]: The power of video is amazing.

1220
02:03:57,396 --> 02:03:58,657
[SPEAKER_06]: These are things you've said and done.

1221
02:03:58,697 --> 02:03:59,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't pull this up.

1222
02:03:59,418 --> 02:04:09,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a member of the revolution send this to me who didn't want to jeopardize their name or their friendship with some of you that said that they're very difficult to see this.

1223
02:04:10,566 --> 02:04:17,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some counsel saying that the difficult about this is really running the meeting and being organized.

1224
02:04:18,192 --> 02:04:19,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not the charter.

1225
02:04:20,137 --> 02:04:22,477
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our city council rules.

1226
02:04:23,098 --> 02:04:24,338
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our policies we can change.

1227
02:04:24,618 --> 02:04:43,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you one, and I can go to the meeting video as well, that when the council voted five to two to eliminate meetings every Tuesday night, and Councilor Caraviello and myself voted against it, the councilor that's here tonight mentioned that if we see it's not working, then we'll go back to the every Tuesday meeting.

1228
02:04:43,481 --> 02:04:46,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I hear that as a problem, because the meetings are running longer.

1229
02:04:47,334 --> 02:04:53,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems like the message is being muddied, or it's taking too long.

1230
02:04:53,499 --> 02:04:55,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a city council rule.

1231
02:04:55,661 --> 02:04:57,042
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a charter rule.

1232
02:04:58,403 --> 02:05:06,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard a councilor tonight talk about, well, imagine this, some of the wards are too small, so they don't need representation.

1233
02:05:07,551 --> 02:05:07,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1234
02:05:09,132 --> 02:05:16,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a fellow councilor said that there are some of the wards, we could play it back, but some of the wards are so small,

1235
02:05:16,998 --> 02:05:21,840
[SPEAKER_06]: that we maybe might not need ward representation in such small wards.

1236
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:23,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote it by word.

1237
02:05:24,441 --> 02:05:30,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you hear, we're looking from the improvement, it's better than what we have.

1238
02:05:31,083 --> 02:05:32,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hearing council say it's better what we have.

1239
02:05:33,184 --> 02:05:34,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what we're here to do?

1240
02:05:34,645 --> 02:05:38,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to get better or fix what's been wrong here.

1241
02:05:39,927 --> 02:05:43,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is coming from a place where I was against it.

1242
02:05:44,356 --> 02:05:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I feel like I'm standing on an island saying, am I hearing myself?

1243
02:05:50,359 --> 02:05:53,921
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been praising Mrs. McDonald and her group and how hard they've been.

1244
02:05:54,821 --> 02:05:58,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've gone, they went out and talked to Medford residents.

1245
02:05:58,223 --> 02:05:59,804
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to see Medford results.

1246
02:06:00,564 --> 02:06:01,424
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to see this.

1247
02:06:02,405 --> 02:06:04,806
[SPEAKER_06]: The professionals at Collins Center said, this is what works.

1248
02:06:05,787 --> 02:06:11,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have Councilors bringing up numbers from Wyoming and California showing us numbers.

1249
02:06:13,233 --> 02:06:13,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

1250
02:06:14,593 --> 02:06:16,414
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know their breakdown.

1251
02:06:17,614 --> 02:06:19,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm worried about Medford, Massachusetts.

1252
02:06:19,755 --> 02:06:31,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I gather, there are only three communities in the state of Massachusetts with this form of government that only look at district representation or such a small representation.

1253
02:06:32,259 --> 02:06:39,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the biggest piece that we've said over and over again, and it sounds like because it doesn't fit the narrative, we're avoiding it.

1254
02:06:40,901 --> 02:06:44,282
[SPEAKER_06]: This will give us a more diverse community council.

1255
02:06:44,802 --> 02:06:45,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it will.

1256
02:06:46,943 --> 02:06:48,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have a slow turnout.

1257
02:06:48,863 --> 02:06:51,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, imagine if we have an award representation.

1258
02:06:53,224 --> 02:06:55,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we seen, maybe the Collins Center can help us.

1259
02:06:56,205 --> 02:07:06,068
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see organizations go from at large to award representations, I'm assuming that voter turnout will be larger because now,

1260
02:07:07,358 --> 02:07:11,260
[SPEAKER_06]: you have people that are identifying certain groups and certain people that will then run.

1261
02:07:12,181 --> 02:07:29,252
[SPEAKER_06]: With the ward representation being that you don't have to encompass yourself throughout the whole community, time-wise, or raise enough money to run at large, we're giving our, or even a district, we're giving our residents an opportunity to be part of this great option and be a voice.

1262
02:07:30,913 --> 02:07:34,315
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know it sounds critical and maybe I'm attacking, but

1263
02:07:35,222 --> 02:07:39,205
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't anything that my fellow councils haven't said in meetings.

1264
02:07:40,046 --> 02:07:44,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And here I am coming back and saying, am I in a bizarro world?

1265
02:07:45,751 --> 02:07:46,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll say this again.

1266
02:07:47,412 --> 02:07:56,100
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to pass a piece of legislation here that will go out that the city is gonna vote on.

1267
02:07:57,901 --> 02:07:59,502
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that's popular.

1268
02:08:00,043 --> 02:08:03,506
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that everybody I talked to on both sides, it didn't matter.

1269
02:08:06,049 --> 02:08:07,789
[SPEAKER_06]: They appreciate the ward representation.

1270
02:08:07,809 --> 02:08:10,230
[SPEAKER_06]: They appreciate that all eight wards will be represented.

1271
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:18,232
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something they can go to the election booth in November and vote in support.

1272
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:28,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would we now finally get to the finish line and try to honestly look like you're trying to control it?

1273
02:08:28,654 --> 02:08:29,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what it sounds like.

1274
02:08:29,674 --> 02:08:30,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, this is what it sounds like.

1275
02:08:31,214 --> 02:08:33,795
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like you want seven people so you can control it.

1276
02:08:34,602 --> 02:08:38,304
[SPEAKER_06]: because when you open it to 11 people, maybe you don't, you lose the majority.

1277
02:08:41,226 --> 02:08:44,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the disrespect that happens time and time with this council.

1278
02:08:45,369 --> 02:08:51,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, there are things that I don't, I don't like my fellow council say, but I would never disrespect and openly laugh like that.

1279
02:08:52,053 --> 02:08:52,873
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we have.

1280
02:08:53,194 --> 02:08:59,297
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we have at this council day after evening after evening when, when my fellow council is the chair of this meeting.

1281
02:08:59,698 --> 02:09:00,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So again,

1282
02:09:00,896 --> 02:09:03,336
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't anything that I made up.

1283
02:09:03,476 --> 02:09:07,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I just explained what my fellow Councilors just said.

1284
02:09:08,337 --> 02:09:10,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I just reiterated what my fellow Councilors have said in the past.

1285
02:09:11,778 --> 02:09:21,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I just read a passage from the people's platform of our revolution that this council all ran on a slate, that they preached and ran on ward representation.

1286
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:22,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't make this up.

1287
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:28,301
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know you're angry because it doesn't fit what you just presented.

1288
02:09:31,090 --> 02:09:36,293
[SPEAKER_06]: and it might not go your way, but let's look at the big picture.

1289
02:09:36,393 --> 02:09:38,194
[SPEAKER_06]: We want this passed now.

1290
02:09:39,575 --> 02:09:52,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And as one council that understands, and you look at the full picture now and do your homework and understand it and really not be angry at what I've lived through and say, have an open mind and look at it.

1291
02:09:53,384 --> 02:09:54,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had that open mind.

1292
02:09:54,404 --> 02:09:55,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It's allowed me to talk to a lot of people.

1293
02:09:57,927 --> 02:10:05,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And the eight wards being represented with the three out loud members is something that I would support.

1294
02:10:05,633 --> 02:10:08,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that the professionals from the call center support.

1295
02:10:09,275 --> 02:10:14,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's what the people that have gone meeting after meeting throughout the whole community.

1296
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:20,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know because they've called me a thousand times getting input from neighbors.

1297
02:10:24,448 --> 02:10:29,311
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about let the people speak, I think the people, it was clear, it's right here.

1298
02:10:30,192 --> 02:10:52,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this is being put forth by a Councilor for truly, I'll be honest with you, I don't see the weight in your presentation of why seven or district representation has been more beneficial than a true ward representation of all of our whole community.

1299
02:10:52,745 --> 02:10:53,906
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1300
02:10:56,435 --> 02:11:01,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Before I move to Councilor Callahan, I see a lot more hands raised here.

1301
02:11:01,457 --> 02:11:05,338
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to correct the record on some things.

1302
02:11:05,398 --> 02:11:08,059
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not saying I agree or disagree with this proposal.

1303
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:10,239
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still considering different perspectives.

1304
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:16,961
[SPEAKER_13]: On the quote from the Medford People's Platform, I could not actually find that exact quote.

1305
02:11:17,061 --> 02:11:22,103
[SPEAKER_13]: What I did find instead was, we commit to implementing a city charter review process to change and expand the way

1306
02:11:22,463 --> 02:11:27,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford elected officials to ward representation instead of just at-large seats.

1307
02:11:27,465 --> 02:11:34,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's important not to leave out that last operative clause.

1308
02:11:34,088 --> 02:11:46,253
[SPEAKER_13]: There are things said about what councilor said, what I do think there is a difference between saying that board representation is not the best way to serve a district, which is what I think the councilor was saying instead of that

1309
02:11:47,803 --> 02:11:49,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Ward doesn't deserve representation.

1310
02:11:50,186 --> 02:11:51,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are two very different statements.

1311
02:11:52,729 --> 02:12:06,964
[SPEAKER_13]: With regards to the meeting times, I did actually do, I looked at the data about it, and when you take the meetings since 2020 that are more substantive rather than procedural,

1312
02:12:10,118 --> 02:12:14,860
[SPEAKER_13]: are actually, after we went bi-weekly, our meeting lengths are pretty much exactly the same.

1313
02:12:16,321 --> 02:12:20,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Only six minutes longer on average under the bi-weekly system.

1314
02:12:20,543 --> 02:12:24,484
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's not a lot of difference there.

1315
02:12:24,544 --> 02:12:30,187
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe the call-in center is here to answer our questions and not to advocate for any particular policy or choice.

1316
02:12:30,967 --> 02:12:34,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Although we do have members of the Charter Study Committee who are here to do that.

1317
02:12:36,730 --> 02:12:39,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Callahan, Lazzaro, and then

1318
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:43,732
[SPEAKER_13]: saw President Bears and then Councilor Collins.

1319
02:12:46,453 --> 02:12:48,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I understand that there are people here for public comment.

1320
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:50,515
[SPEAKER_13]: We will get to that.

1321
02:12:50,535 --> 02:12:52,096
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1322
02:12:52,596 --> 02:12:58,039
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to note first that I independently also

1323
02:13:00,312 --> 02:13:06,075
[SPEAKER_26]: came up with a thought of what Councilor Leming suggested, which was for the four districts plus five at large.

1324
02:13:06,115 --> 02:13:09,617
[SPEAKER_26]: So I thought it was amusing that you independently came up with that idea.

1325
02:13:09,637 --> 02:13:15,920
[SPEAKER_26]: I also am fine with a larger city council.

1326
02:13:16,641 --> 02:13:24,485
[SPEAKER_26]: And then I just wanted to say that I'm not on this committee, and I so appreciate the opportunity to be here.

1327
02:13:25,526 --> 02:13:26,987
[SPEAKER_26]: I will not be able to vote today.

1328
02:13:27,007 --> 02:13:31,731
[SPEAKER_26]: I do actually have another appointment, and so I will be leaving.

1329
02:13:31,971 --> 02:13:41,719
[SPEAKER_26]: But thank you all so much for your incredibly thoughtful comments and proposals.

1330
02:13:43,241 --> 02:13:52,949
[SPEAKER_26]: I, for one, genuinely believe that everyone here is doing their absolute best to come up with

1331
02:13:54,242 --> 02:13:57,264
[SPEAKER_26]: what is going to be the best for Medford.

1332
02:13:58,544 --> 02:13:59,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Not slightly better.

1333
02:14:01,085 --> 02:14:06,168
[SPEAKER_26]: I think there are, I think we should listen to what councilors say.

1334
02:14:06,948 --> 02:14:09,470
[SPEAKER_26]: We should take what they say as what they mean.

1335
02:14:11,031 --> 02:14:17,654
[SPEAKER_26]: And I certainly, when I do have an opportunity to vote in the city council meeting,

1336
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:27,803
[SPEAKER_26]: I will be voting for the thing that I believe is the best possible charter that we can have for the best representation in the city of Medford.

1337
02:14:27,883 --> 02:14:28,323
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much.

1338
02:14:34,084 --> 02:14:35,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1339
02:14:35,085 --> 02:14:37,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Now recognizing Councilor Lazzaro.

1340
02:14:39,506 --> 02:14:39,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1341
02:14:40,006 --> 02:14:44,527
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to, as a point of information, correct something that was said earlier.

1342
02:14:44,907 --> 02:14:46,668
[SPEAKER_18]: It may have been missed because

1343
02:14:49,325 --> 02:14:58,170
[SPEAKER_18]: One of my colleagues got up and walked around while I was talking, but I was trying to address some of the nuance to this.

1344
02:14:58,190 --> 02:15:14,020
[SPEAKER_18]: I like ward representation and I will be voting for ward representation, but it is nuanced and complicated and it doesn't automatically equal a more diverse council and it doesn't automatically mean

1345
02:15:16,379 --> 02:15:17,620
[SPEAKER_18]: that everything is solved.

1346
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:21,744
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that it will require a lot of work from all of us.

1347
02:15:22,625 --> 02:15:24,346
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is what I was trying to communicate.

1348
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:29,531
[SPEAKER_18]: I will be I think I will be voting for it.

1349
02:15:29,992 --> 02:15:36,458
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just I think that we deserve our that our residents deserve

1350
02:15:37,641 --> 02:15:39,363
[SPEAKER_18]: and open and honest discussion of the nuance.

1351
02:15:40,204 --> 02:15:53,000
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't begrudge the Charter Study Committee for not presenting the public with like 14 different options for ways to organize government that are not commonly done in America.

1352
02:15:54,487 --> 02:15:57,589
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would have been great if we could have tried that.

1353
02:15:58,450 --> 02:16:00,772
[SPEAKER_18]: But I also think that it's rational to not.

1354
02:16:01,873 --> 02:16:03,835
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is what we have.

1355
02:16:04,375 --> 02:16:13,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing I want to draw attention to is that there is a section of the charter draft that we have, which is Article 9, the general provisions 9.1

1356
02:16:14,428 --> 02:16:15,708
[SPEAKER_18]: mentions charter changes.

1357
02:16:16,208 --> 02:16:21,990
[SPEAKER_18]: This charter may be replaced, revised, or amended in accordance with any procedure made available under the state constitution or by the general laws.

1358
02:16:22,110 --> 02:16:25,650
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's another section about periodic review of the charter that mentions every 10 years.

1359
02:16:26,131 --> 02:16:27,131
[SPEAKER_18]: You can go back and review it.

1360
02:16:27,211 --> 02:16:32,292
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think it's necessary that we wait 40 years in between reviewing the charter.

1361
02:16:33,952 --> 02:16:35,713
[SPEAKER_18]: We can try something.

1362
02:16:36,633 --> 02:16:37,353
[SPEAKER_18]: We can review it.

1363
02:16:37,513 --> 02:16:39,013
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be reviewed every 10 years.

1364
02:16:40,253 --> 02:16:41,834
[SPEAKER_18]: This draft says,

1365
02:16:42,981 --> 02:16:56,206
[SPEAKER_18]: review it every 10 years and every 10 years thereafter, like after 10 years and 10 years thereafter, if it's not, if there's something that happens that occurs with a model that we try, it can be reviewed and changed, it's written in.

1366
02:16:56,226 --> 02:17:00,887
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that is much better than what happened the last time around and

1367
02:17:05,553 --> 02:17:14,597
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we have observed in this country some of the drawbacks to a lot of the models for government that we've tried.

1368
02:17:15,538 --> 02:17:21,701
[SPEAKER_18]: There are obviously a lot of problems with elections in this country, a lot of problems with our legislative bodies.

1369
02:17:23,942 --> 02:17:26,503
[SPEAKER_18]: And it can be really frustrating.

1370
02:17:26,823 --> 02:17:34,247
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not sure that we can solve all of the issues right now in Medford, but I

1371
02:17:35,246 --> 02:17:48,792
[SPEAKER_18]: What I feel I've been presented with is a clear preference from the public for what was offered by the Charter Study Committee in this respect.

1372
02:17:52,953 --> 02:17:58,956
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree that the district option is a greater recommendation

1373
02:18:01,615 --> 02:18:05,497
[SPEAKER_18]: opportunity for representation than what we have right now.

1374
02:18:06,417 --> 02:18:19,724
[SPEAKER_18]: But since every communication I've received from a member of the public, almost every communication I've received has said, I would like to see eight ward based Councilors plus three at large.

1375
02:18:20,764 --> 02:18:24,046
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's what I have to say that I will support.

1376
02:18:27,988 --> 02:18:28,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1377
02:18:30,209 --> 02:18:30,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1378
02:18:30,749 --> 02:18:34,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro, I think I have President Bears and then Vice President Collins.

1379
02:18:36,973 --> 02:18:37,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1380
02:18:37,433 --> 02:18:38,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to be very clear.

1381
02:18:39,254 --> 02:18:44,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not worried about the politics or the elections of any of these models.

1382
02:18:46,378 --> 02:18:57,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm quite frankly, really sick of the politicization and the putting words in people's mouth that happens on this council by my colleague.

1383
02:19:00,323 --> 02:19:05,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're having a discussion about what is a model that would work best for the community?

1384
02:19:07,827 --> 02:19:12,410
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we think gets us the best long-term outcomes in terms of good governance for this community?

1385
02:19:13,410 --> 02:19:14,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about winning an election.

1386
02:19:14,871 --> 02:19:16,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's gonna win this election?

1387
02:19:16,032 --> 02:19:17,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's gonna win that election?

1388
02:19:18,133 --> 02:19:21,935
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about saying that Matt thinks some words don't matter when he never said that.

1389
02:19:22,896 --> 02:19:28,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about, you know, you're quoting a platform I helped to write.

1390
02:19:29,585 --> 02:19:29,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1391
02:19:30,225 --> 02:19:31,926
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're not quoting it in good faith.

1392
02:19:32,867 --> 02:19:34,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, I understand what's under you.

1393
02:19:34,367 --> 02:19:34,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read it.

1394
02:19:34,928 --> 02:19:35,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote it.

1395
02:19:35,648 --> 02:19:36,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped to write it.

1396
02:19:37,009 --> 02:19:37,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.

1397
02:19:37,789 --> 02:19:42,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And it said, this is a version of word representation.

1398
02:19:43,712 --> 02:19:46,994
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a version of word representation that will be the school committee will have.

1399
02:19:48,074 --> 02:19:49,035
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm proposing.

1400
02:19:50,172 --> 02:20:06,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And I laugh when I laugh because the absurdity of completely misreading and misstating what I've said and what other Councilors have said and what has been written down is just beyond the pale of having a respectful dialogue in this body.

1401
02:20:07,158 --> 02:20:09,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I support a new charter.

1402
02:20:10,219 --> 02:20:17,701
[SPEAKER_04]: If this discussion goes the way it seems like it's going, I support a new charter, but the way that it had to get here and the fact that

1403
02:20:18,252 --> 02:20:26,862
[SPEAKER_04]: the things that had to be brought up to try to spin it and tweak it and turn it in that way is just so beyond disappointing and beyond frustrating.

1404
02:20:27,422 --> 02:20:33,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, the data, who cares, right?

1405
02:20:33,829 --> 02:20:36,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, who cares about data?

1406
02:20:36,753 --> 02:20:37,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I care about data.

1407
02:20:39,306 --> 02:20:48,914
[SPEAKER_04]: and the data shows that we would be on the very small end, not just of Massachusetts, but of the country in terms of if we go to word-based representation, Councilors per population.

1408
02:20:50,276 --> 02:20:51,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's an important data point.

1409
02:20:52,758 --> 02:21:03,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the data point that's been raised about the fact that it, whether it's district or ward, doesn't affect the racial demographics of the districts, but does affect the fact that you might end up with

1410
02:21:04,727 --> 02:21:18,499
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you know, long term incumbencies in very small districts or some people winning award seat with 2500 votes and some people winning award seat with 750 votes and then saying, so does that mean that some voters matter less than some voters matter more?

1411
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,541
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a data point.

1412
02:21:22,082 --> 02:21:27,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very confident in the ability of everyone here to win elections because we've done it many times.

1413
02:21:28,648 --> 02:21:29,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could have

1414
02:21:30,308 --> 02:21:33,850
[SPEAKER_04]: and all at large model and win elections and all ward model and win elections.

1415
02:21:34,371 --> 02:21:40,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just can't stand when the words are being put in our mouth.

1416
02:21:40,535 --> 02:21:43,216
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just really frustrating.

1417
02:21:43,477 --> 02:21:48,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that we talked about was, do we want to fix what's been wrong or do we want to make things better?

1418
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:50,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to make things worse.

1419
02:21:51,822 --> 02:21:59,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason that I put this forward is that I in good faith think that there's a way that the way that this is written out makes things worse.

1420
02:22:00,251 --> 02:22:04,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I would support a 15-person city council with seven at-large and eight wards.

1421
02:22:05,475 --> 02:22:08,597
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ward representation and an even number of at-large seats.

1422
02:22:09,758 --> 02:22:27,712
[SPEAKER_04]: My biggest concern is having a ward-based representation of all eight wards as individual wards with only three at-large city councilors brings in some of the worst practices of elected government in this country and in the state and ruins and takes out some of the best.

1423
02:22:29,672 --> 02:22:30,513
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my issue.

1424
02:22:30,773 --> 02:22:34,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I think more balance between those two things is a good thing.

1425
02:22:35,877 --> 02:22:45,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think at this point that this is going to be well considered, but I'd be willing to do another survey with a few more models and see what people actually support.

1426
02:22:45,123 --> 02:22:46,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I don't think we really know.

1427
02:22:46,945 --> 02:22:51,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think we've had a conversation about all of the costs and benefits of making these choices.

1428
02:22:53,209 --> 02:22:56,432
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I put forward what I put forward for no other reason.

1429
02:22:57,533 --> 02:22:59,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really, really resent

1430
02:23:00,097 --> 02:23:01,618
[SPEAKER_04]: the implication to the contrary.

1431
02:23:01,998 --> 02:23:09,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think quite frankly, that bringing all of the politics into this is what poisoned it and will poison it in either direction.

1432
02:23:10,562 --> 02:23:22,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really hope that that's something we can get away from on this council as it continues under this form or any other form, because

1433
02:23:23,888 --> 02:23:26,650
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good faith conversation based on data and principles.

1434
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we bring in all this other stuff that nobody brought up except to malign their colleagues, it just leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.

1435
02:23:36,998 --> 02:23:37,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1436
02:23:39,399 --> 02:23:42,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor, Vice President Collins, and then Councilor Scarbell.

1437
02:23:44,623 --> 02:23:45,684
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chair Tseng.

1438
02:23:45,704 --> 02:23:47,445
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate that.

1439
02:23:47,565 --> 02:23:52,249
[SPEAKER_24]: I have some comments that I wanna add, and then I'm going to also make a motion at the end.

1440
02:23:54,148 --> 02:24:00,790
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I would love to get back to a place where this conversation is productive and civil, like it was at the beginning of the meeting.

1441
02:24:01,010 --> 02:24:08,272
[SPEAKER_24]: But first, I do have to say, I find it a little rich that one Councilor will start the meeting talking about maturing and being open minded.

1442
02:24:08,312 --> 02:24:15,654
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the instant that their colleagues start to disagree with them, the conversation turns to personal attacks and blaming colleagues for rending the city apart.

1443
02:24:16,114 --> 02:24:19,075
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wish that we could have civil and productive conversations about this.

1444
02:24:19,895 --> 02:24:21,176
[SPEAKER_24]: and I don't think that's productive.

1445
02:24:21,857 --> 02:24:26,100
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm really respectful to the conversation at all, not after all of the work that has been put into this topic.

1446
02:24:27,441 --> 02:24:29,863
[SPEAKER_24]: No one said that some wards do not need representation.

1447
02:24:29,883 --> 02:24:46,836
[SPEAKER_24]: What was said, not by me, is that some wards are so low turnout and some wards are so high turnout that it would create a huge disparity in some residents' votes among others, counting some very, very highly, and other votes would matter much less numerically, and that's not fair.

1448
02:24:47,657 --> 02:24:51,379
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think that we should be trading one form of unrepresentativeness for another.

1449
02:24:51,399 --> 02:24:59,522
[SPEAKER_24]: And if we're going to, I at least think that we should be able to acknowledge it and acknowledge that it matters and talk about potential mitigating solutions.

1450
02:25:02,244 --> 02:25:15,850
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope that people will take it to heart that I am willing to potentially disagree with people with whom I share values because I have honest concerns about the current charter provisions as proposed, and I am willing to face criticism over that.

1451
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:27,700
[SPEAKER_24]: I simply think that we should prioritize genuine representation and genuine efficacy over well-intentioned, but I think less effective, appearances of representation.

1452
02:25:27,860 --> 02:25:30,722
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't think that we can accomplish that by simply adding numbers to the council.

1453
02:25:31,523 --> 02:25:37,769
[SPEAKER_24]: And for reasons that have already been stated by me and by others, I don't think that the simple ward-based system is the best way of doing that.

1454
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:45,862
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that we have received a lot of feedback about the award-based versus all-at-large options.

1455
02:25:45,942 --> 02:25:53,125
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, I think that we need to consider that these were the only two options presented in the survey, and we should consider those data points in the context of that.

1456
02:25:53,145 --> 02:25:56,086
[SPEAKER_24]: There weren't other data points on the table or on the survey.

1457
02:25:58,537 --> 02:26:22,125
[SPEAKER_24]: Something that guides all of my decisions on the council is knowing that people, all people, myself included, it's human nature to overly weight feedback that is visible to us, like opinions that we happen to have heard, people that we happen to have heard from, and forget that other opinions that we happen to happen to have heard, that we didn't ask for, that are not as visible, that didn't hear about a survey, that don't have opportunities to come to city council meetings.

1458
02:26:22,885 --> 02:26:26,086
[SPEAKER_24]: It's human nature to overweight the information that we have heard.

1459
02:26:26,946 --> 02:26:30,209
[SPEAKER_24]: and kind of forget that other information exists.

1460
02:26:30,849 --> 02:26:44,800
[SPEAKER_24]: I bring this up not just because for me it is a really useful reminder when I'm making any decision on the City Council, but also because I think it's incredibly relevant to this project, because the work of the City Charter, especially talking about composition,

1461
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:56,991
[SPEAKER_24]: is about better representation for those people in the community who are not as visible, who don't have access to our normal communication channels, who don't know how to get in contact with their city councilors, who do not vote.

1462
02:26:58,932 --> 02:27:05,618
[SPEAKER_24]: To me, that is the goal of this section of the city charter, is try to get better at that exact mechanism.

1463
02:27:06,670 --> 02:27:19,137
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe that a district model is our best option for lifting up and better representing people who are currently underrepresented, even in light of the feedback that we have seen, which was based on the two options presented in the survey.

1464
02:27:19,157 --> 02:27:24,520
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think it's very relevant that this is a project that has been worked on by people who are highly involved.

1465
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:34,625
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's our job to approve a product that will work the best and the most fairly for people who are already highly involved and for people who have not been able to be highly involved, for people who are underrepresented.

1466
02:27:36,915 --> 02:27:41,429
[SPEAKER_24]: All that being said, I do think that this is a good moment for compromise.

1467
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:43,054
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that a lot of good points have been made.

1468
02:27:45,817 --> 02:27:49,598
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been very clear that I think that the district-based model makes the most sense.

1469
02:27:49,618 --> 02:27:51,758
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm also not opposed to a larger council, not at all.

1470
02:27:54,159 --> 02:27:55,999
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not my preference, but I'm not opposed to it.

1471
02:27:56,959 --> 02:28:04,901
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming earlier entertained the idea of sticking with four district councilors, but expanding the number to five at-large councilors.

1472
02:28:05,781 --> 02:28:15,383
[SPEAKER_24]: I would be happy to offer that in the form of a motion to President Bierer's proposed amendments if he is willing to accept it as a friendly amendment.

1473
02:28:16,183 --> 02:28:16,503
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1474
02:28:18,244 --> 02:28:22,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, and then Councilor Bears.

1475
02:28:25,185 --> 02:28:33,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Chair, to my colleague that referenced the Council that got up and walked out while she was speaking, I want to apologize.

1476
02:28:33,187 --> 02:28:39,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been sick, so I ran out of water and I felt a little faint, so I had to go get water.

1477
02:28:40,270 --> 02:28:44,811
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize if I disrespected any member of the council to get water.

1478
02:28:44,871 --> 02:28:45,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize for that.

1479
02:28:47,412 --> 02:28:54,314
[SPEAKER_06]: For my colleagues that seem to be offended that I'm bringing politics into politics, sorry.

1480
02:28:55,514 --> 02:28:59,175
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't align with you.

1481
02:28:59,755 --> 02:29:03,396
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a slate of six that vote in tow.

1482
02:29:03,456 --> 02:29:06,057
[SPEAKER_06]: You usually vote in tow, but you all vote together.

1483
02:29:06,975 --> 02:29:07,756
[SPEAKER_06]: on your agendas.

1484
02:29:08,276 --> 02:29:09,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's known.

1485
02:29:09,137 --> 02:29:10,878
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nothing that's a secret.

1486
02:29:10,918 --> 02:29:12,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to attack anybody.

1487
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:23,668
[SPEAKER_06]: But my position as a city councilor is to be the voice that people call or express a concern or the way they feel or they want to be represented.

1488
02:29:24,689 --> 02:29:28,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I bring a topic forward, if it hurts your feelings, I'll do respect.

1489
02:29:29,332 --> 02:29:30,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1490
02:29:31,794 --> 02:29:36,538
[SPEAKER_06]: My goal is to make sure that everybody's view is represented.

1491
02:29:38,140 --> 02:29:45,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know my council colleagues are upset or feel hurt or the reason that I disrespected them.

1492
02:29:47,446 --> 02:29:58,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just sharing what has been brought to my attention by constituents that I'm expressing it night after night, because it seems like I'm the only one because some people just aren't listening.

1493
02:30:00,315 --> 02:30:03,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is why our community is in flux right now.

1494
02:30:03,978 --> 02:30:05,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we look at this situation right now,

1495
02:30:06,866 --> 02:30:19,693
[SPEAKER_06]: where we are right now, the council brought up some changes and supported it, some with facts, some with his own beliefs, his belief system, which I respect.

1496
02:30:20,233 --> 02:30:21,213
[SPEAKER_06]: That's his belief system.

1497
02:30:22,574 --> 02:30:25,396
[SPEAKER_06]: That's his due diligence looking forward in his decision.

1498
02:30:25,816 --> 02:30:35,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself, I looked at it totally opposite, but I will not, I will not apologize to share

1499
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:41,263
[SPEAKER_06]: what has been asked of me by constituents, maybe constituents that don't even vote for me.

1500
02:30:44,825 --> 02:31:03,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So my personal opinion and my motion is we stay with the original presentation by the Charter Review Committee with the 11 representatives, eight board, three at large, and again,

1501
02:31:04,588 --> 02:31:11,910
[SPEAKER_06]: we can look back at this tape and listen to what everybody has said and what I expressed from what they said.

1502
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:14,691
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't made up.

1503
02:31:14,831 --> 02:31:18,372
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't a dialogue to make this like some kind of a clown show.

1504
02:31:20,012 --> 02:31:24,714
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an expression of one council's view in comparison to six others.

1505
02:31:27,074 --> 02:31:28,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will not apologize for that.

1506
02:31:30,756 --> 02:31:32,036
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, my friends,

1507
02:31:33,452 --> 02:31:34,573
[SPEAKER_06]: This is politics.

1508
02:31:35,794 --> 02:31:43,299
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't, hey, kumbaya, let's all sit together and say, let's all do this, let's run together and let's have one vision and make Medford what we believe in.

1509
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:45,261
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because that's not how it works.

1510
02:31:45,681 --> 02:31:49,064
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very different complex world we live in in Medford.

1511
02:31:50,225 --> 02:31:55,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing that people come back for over and over again is they feel that this council isn't listening.

1512
02:31:58,651 --> 02:31:59,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I'm saying is,

1513
02:32:00,758 --> 02:32:10,667
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a committee that's worked their tails off months after months, night after night, getting the information that presented to the professionals and that presented to us.

1514
02:32:13,949 --> 02:32:28,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I'm saying is the belief of a council making a change and my beliefs from what I've heard from constituents or my personal belief and understanding is that the ward representation of all eight wards are represented.

1515
02:32:33,297 --> 02:32:35,498
[SPEAKER_06]: and to throw in pieces like, well, you know what?

1516
02:32:36,358 --> 02:32:42,281
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be there forever, or not enough people will come out in that ward, 2,500 people.

1517
02:32:44,502 --> 02:32:45,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way of the world.

1518
02:32:45,963 --> 02:32:47,263
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we work through things.

1519
02:32:48,344 --> 02:32:51,225
[SPEAKER_06]: To say that we won't have enough people, not enough people come out and vote.

1520
02:32:51,445 --> 02:32:54,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe these are the changes that will bring our constituents out to vote.

1521
02:32:54,866 --> 02:32:56,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Make them feel like they're part of the solution.

1522
02:32:57,247 --> 02:32:58,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Have them feel vested.

1523
02:32:59,168 --> 02:33:00,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Make them feel part of the community.

1524
02:33:05,170 --> 02:33:09,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, thank you for allowing me to speak.

1525
02:33:12,656 --> 02:33:15,318
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears and then Vice President Collins.

1526
02:33:15,698 --> 02:33:18,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1527
02:33:19,661 --> 02:33:25,125
[SPEAKER_04]: No one is asking my colleague to apologize for what he believes or for his position on this.

1528
02:33:27,747 --> 02:33:33,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Specific things were said that were then mischaracterized to make a point.

1529
02:33:34,871 --> 02:33:41,856
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't take your words and then say, oh, you actually said this other thing that you didn't say.

1530
02:33:43,017 --> 02:33:46,059
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing that frustrates me here.

1531
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:49,181
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why, I mean, I didn't say that.

1532
02:33:49,702 --> 02:33:53,925
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about anything like that.

1533
02:33:53,985 --> 02:33:58,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you should believe what you should believe or be able to say, Councilor Scarpelli.

1534
02:34:00,983 --> 02:34:08,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that saying that another member of this council said that some words don't matter when he didn't say that is just beyond the pale.

1535
02:34:13,191 --> 02:34:19,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to say that we have a statutory role in this process as members of the city council.

1536
02:34:21,937 --> 02:34:29,022
[SPEAKER_04]: There were many times I can think of many votes and I appreciate that councilor Scarpelli's mind has changed on this matter.

1537
02:34:29,488 --> 02:34:34,392
[SPEAKER_04]: where a lot of people came up to this podium and said, we think this is what's best for the community to have a charter change.

1538
02:34:34,813 --> 02:34:36,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a charter review process.

1539
02:34:36,194 --> 02:34:41,219
[SPEAKER_04]: We need this council to pass a home rule petition so that we can elect a charter commission and do a charter change.

1540
02:34:41,739 --> 02:34:48,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of those voices didn't change that mind of that council or other Councilors who voted against it for multiple terms.

1541
02:34:51,148 --> 02:34:52,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to say that

1542
02:34:54,793 --> 02:34:59,797
[SPEAKER_04]: You've heard of multiple differing opinions from the six people who supposedly all believe the same thing tonight.

1543
02:35:01,399 --> 02:35:03,500
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't obviously believe the same thing.

1544
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:05,842
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all said, we believe in different pieces of this.

1545
02:35:07,123 --> 02:35:08,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I'm talking about.

1546
02:35:08,665 --> 02:35:11,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about, I'm sorry for bringing politics into politics.

1547
02:35:11,527 --> 02:35:12,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course this is politics.

1548
02:35:12,888 --> 02:35:23,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about misrepresenting the information and the facts on the matter and the things that people say to score political points, to try to make something seem like what it isn't.

1549
02:35:24,788 --> 02:35:30,672
[SPEAKER_04]: because that may serve some sort of purpose, or it may advantage your position, or maybe you'll end up getting the result that you want.

1550
02:35:31,212 --> 02:35:32,453
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something that I do.

1551
02:35:35,155 --> 02:35:36,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We can go back and look at the tape.

1552
02:35:36,676 --> 02:35:51,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very, very, very consistent in saying that I do, I say what I think should happen, and I try to represent those values and those principles based on the facts and the information that I have at hand.

1553
02:35:56,516 --> 02:35:59,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I did want to ask the Collins Center a question about what

1554
02:36:02,952 --> 02:36:12,956
[SPEAKER_04]: it looks like in terms of the competitiveness of elections in districts where you have, in cities or other communities in Massachusetts where you have systems like this.

1555
02:36:13,596 --> 02:36:26,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see that having, or do you have any data to talk about what it looks like, how many races go uncontested in ward seats versus an all-at-large model?

1556
02:36:28,351 --> 02:36:33,352
[SPEAKER_04]: how long incumbent terms are in models like this versus models where there's more competitive elections.

1557
02:36:34,513 --> 02:36:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have that data available to you?

1558
02:36:36,213 --> 02:36:50,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, if members of the Charter Study Committee would like to talk about discussions that may have happened in the Charter Study Committee around what this model would mean for competitive elections, incumbency, et cetera.

1559
02:36:52,877 --> 02:36:54,878
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't collect electoral information.

1560
02:36:56,020 --> 02:36:56,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1561
02:36:56,520 --> 02:36:58,541
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't collect electoral information.

1562
02:36:58,741 --> 02:36:59,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1563
02:36:59,221 --> 02:37:03,182
[SPEAKER_04]: So competitiveness of the different models wasn't considered as part of the discussion.

1564
02:37:03,202 --> 02:37:06,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1565
02:37:06,603 --> 02:37:07,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And not that I recall.

1566
02:37:08,223 --> 02:37:10,924
[SPEAKER_16]: I can only speak from my personal experience.

1567
02:37:11,044 --> 02:37:12,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be happy to hear personal experience.

1568
02:37:13,085 --> 02:37:22,067
[SPEAKER_16]: I was a seven term Alderman became city council, um, until I decided not to run.

1569
02:37:23,177 --> 02:37:26,519
[SPEAKER_16]: of the six times I ran for re-election, three times I had appointments.

1570
02:37:27,219 --> 02:37:28,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So about half the time.

1571
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:29,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1572
02:37:30,121 --> 02:37:32,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I talked to my colleagues in Somerville.

1573
02:37:32,622 --> 02:37:33,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to my colleagues in Malden.

1574
02:37:34,063 --> 02:37:35,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to my colleagues in Everett.

1575
02:37:36,184 --> 02:37:37,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And were you in a ward-based seat?

1576
02:37:38,085 --> 02:37:39,206
[SPEAKER_16]: I was in a ward.

1577
02:37:39,486 --> 02:37:39,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1578
02:37:40,066 --> 02:37:42,227
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of ward-based seats go uncontested.

1579
02:37:42,988 --> 02:37:46,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Under the current model of the city council, no one ever goes uncontested.

1580
02:37:49,111 --> 02:37:50,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the facts.

1581
02:37:50,912 --> 02:37:52,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying let's stay at all at large.

1582
02:37:53,173 --> 02:37:54,094
[SPEAKER_04]: The people don't want that.

1583
02:37:55,055 --> 02:37:57,718
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm hearing that we don't have data on competitiveness.

1584
02:37:57,778 --> 02:37:59,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't discuss competitiveness.

1585
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:05,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think having competitive elections where the people in office are challenged to maintain their seats.

1586
02:38:06,392 --> 02:38:10,896
[SPEAKER_04]: is essential and that we should have a form and a structure of democracy that encourages that.

1587
02:38:11,396 --> 02:38:18,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that if we're going to move in a direction where there's going to be potentially more uncompetitive elections, that we need a balance there.

1588
02:38:18,643 --> 02:38:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think saying that we're going to have a model where eight of the seats may often be uncontested or at least uncontested half the time, and only three of the seats would be contested more regularly is not a good balance for the competitiveness of elections.

1589
02:38:32,174 --> 02:38:34,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the questions that I would like to see

1590
02:38:34,955 --> 02:38:43,877
[SPEAKER_04]: looked at more or for us to have a discussion here about looking at a model that has a little more balance considering that we didn't consider those questions and we don't have the answers in front of us.

1591
02:38:46,457 --> 02:38:49,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna be challenged, run against me.

1592
02:38:51,058 --> 02:38:52,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this is a model that encourages that.

1593
02:38:54,679 --> 02:38:55,959
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I put this forward.

1594
02:38:56,359 --> 02:38:56,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1595
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:00,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins.

1596
02:39:03,792 --> 02:39:05,313
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chair Tseng.

1597
02:39:06,233 --> 02:39:06,813
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate that.

1598
02:39:06,833 --> 02:39:08,594
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate those comments from President Bears.

1599
02:39:08,634 --> 02:39:10,555
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that gets right to the heart of the issue as I see it.

1600
02:39:12,436 --> 02:39:14,197
[SPEAKER_24]: One last point on this through the chair.

1601
02:39:18,215 --> 02:39:31,779
[SPEAKER_24]: If my fellow councilors' opinions earlier were in good faith about outcomes and not about politicking and taking shots to make perceived opponents look bad, I think that then he would be sticking to the substance at hand and not derailing this conversation.

1602
02:39:32,419 --> 02:39:40,202
[SPEAKER_24]: With lies about us voting in lockstep and other false narratives, I also encourage people to run the tape or look at our duly promulgated council records.

1603
02:39:41,202 --> 02:39:50,087
[SPEAKER_24]: And people will find that the Councilors on this body who share an endorsement just disagree with each other all the time, which I believe is how it should be.

1604
02:39:50,107 --> 02:39:52,968
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate the discussion so far.

1605
02:39:53,649 --> 02:40:04,635
[SPEAKER_24]: I have made a motion that the five district Councilors and five at large Councilors be considered as part of President Bear's amendment.

1606
02:40:04,655 --> 02:40:09,958
[SPEAKER_24]: I would request that we move on to public comment and then take votes on motions.

1607
02:40:10,338 --> 02:40:10,598
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1608
02:40:12,264 --> 02:40:17,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins, just to clarify, do you mean four districts and five at large?

1609
02:40:17,588 --> 02:40:18,649
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, that is what I meant to say.

1610
02:40:18,709 --> 02:40:19,010
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1611
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:20,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1612
02:40:20,951 --> 02:40:23,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to move to public comment.

1613
02:40:23,414 --> 02:40:32,402
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have a number of questions for the Collins Center, especially the members of the Charter Study Committee, who I think it's important to hear from.

1614
02:40:33,222 --> 02:40:33,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes?

1615
02:40:36,085 --> 02:40:36,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

1616
02:40:40,234 --> 02:40:52,178
[SPEAKER_13]: In, I know a big goal behind going to a hybrid system, word representation system is this idea, this, you know, desire to get a more diverse city council.

1617
02:40:54,999 --> 02:41:09,363
[SPEAKER_13]: In my research into word representation, into different types of representation, there's a big change, a shift in terms of how diversity is viewed as a result of making these structural changes.

1618
02:41:10,776 --> 02:41:13,954
[SPEAKER_13]: I think pretty much everyone agrees that at large.

1619
02:41:14,795 --> 02:41:23,743
[SPEAKER_13]: An all-at-large system is not good for diversity because it dilutes the votes of minority groups.

1620
02:41:24,704 --> 02:41:27,726
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've seen municipalities across the state be challenged for that.

1621
02:41:28,967 --> 02:41:42,299
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's also been a rising concern, and this is based on research in the American Political Science Review in the law of, I think it's politics, economics, and organization, where

1622
02:41:43,584 --> 02:41:47,591
[SPEAKER_13]: people are worried that creating smaller districts.

1623
02:41:48,751 --> 02:42:03,236
[SPEAKER_13]: districts that tend to be majority and minority actually cuts against racial equity in that it makes fewer politicians responsible for or accountable to minority voters.

1624
02:42:04,456 --> 02:42:15,100
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was wondering if this is something that the Charter Study Committee discussed in its consideration of diversity, especially with regards to race.

1625
02:42:19,815 --> 02:42:20,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1626
02:42:22,721 --> 02:42:25,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Chair McDonald did answer the question.

1627
02:42:25,666 --> 02:42:26,047
[SPEAKER_13]: She said no.

1628
02:42:29,048 --> 02:42:45,372
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a concern to me because it is what political scientists now, I think, have found to be the main mover in terms of racial justice is voters' accountability, or politicians' accountability to voters.

1629
02:42:45,412 --> 02:42:54,235
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is something I do want to consider strongly in my consideration of the different options that we have here at the table.

1630
02:42:56,665 --> 02:43:03,603
[SPEAKER_13]: And one unseen strength of the alternative proposal, which I do have my questions about too,

1631
02:43:06,169 --> 02:43:17,491
[SPEAKER_13]: is that you keep the racial proportions quite similar comparing, for example, the historically black community in West Medford in Ward 6.

1632
02:43:18,091 --> 02:43:26,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Combining it with Ward 8 doesn't change the percentage much at all, and it makes an elected more accountable to those voters.

1633
02:43:26,873 --> 02:43:30,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Similarly, in Ward 7, there is more of a difference.

1634
02:43:30,154 --> 02:43:34,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am slightly more concerned about that one, but it does make

1635
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:40,986
[SPEAKER_13]: the Councilor serving Ward 1 also accountable to minority voters as well.

1636
02:43:43,409 --> 02:43:47,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I did actually, I had some open-ended questions about the survey as well.

1637
02:43:47,313 --> 02:43:57,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you, Chair McDonald, since you know the survey process better than I do, help run me through a little bit of what that process was like and what the results were?

1638
02:44:03,576 --> 02:44:05,459
[SPEAKER_22]: You mean the process of creating the survey?

1639
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:07,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, both.

1640
02:44:07,762 --> 02:44:12,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Both creating the survey, but mostly the results and what you got from the results.

1641
02:44:14,054 --> 02:44:21,019
[SPEAKER_22]: The feedback we got was that we wanted the survey to be accessible, so not too complicated.

1642
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:30,906
[SPEAKER_22]: We asked about major questions that voters are most concerned about, which is the composition, term limits, things like that.

1643
02:44:33,408 --> 02:44:35,309
[SPEAKER_22]: The results are all in the final report.

1644
02:44:35,589 --> 02:44:40,073
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, I can get them, but you all have them, right?

1645
02:44:41,551 --> 02:44:47,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I think broad strokes, I'm familiar with the policy recommendations of the survey results.

1646
02:44:48,073 --> 02:44:53,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you remind me about the composition, what questions were asked, if you have that off the top of your mind?

1647
02:44:55,175 --> 02:44:58,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether, for council, you're talking about?

1648
02:44:58,115 --> 02:45:00,216
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, for city council.

1649
02:45:01,516 --> 02:45:04,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether to remain all at large?

1650
02:45:06,810 --> 02:45:10,634
[SPEAKER_22]: to be ward-based, hybrid-based.

1651
02:45:10,654 --> 02:45:16,160
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we can't be all ward-based, because we only have eight exclusively ward-based, because we only have eight wards.

1652
02:45:17,161 --> 02:45:19,103
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's not really an option on the table.

1653
02:45:19,604 --> 02:45:19,964
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

1654
02:45:21,786 --> 02:45:22,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for clarifying that.

1655
02:45:23,728 --> 02:45:27,872
[SPEAKER_13]: So we didn't ask about the district system or?

1656
02:45:28,153 --> 02:45:29,254
[SPEAKER_22]: The combining of the wards?

1657
02:45:29,809 --> 02:45:47,547
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, combining of words or... No, that was something that came up in the discussions about the school committee to address the challenges of making school committee, applying word representation to the school committee, because that would have increased the body size.

1658
02:45:47,567 --> 02:45:48,348
[SPEAKER_22]: I see.

1659
02:45:48,468 --> 02:45:51,831
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that's how that came up.

1660
02:45:53,602 --> 02:46:04,209
[SPEAKER_13]: One point I do find compelling is this idea that we should mix, standardize both sets, the city council and the school committee to use a similar election system.

1661
02:46:04,509 --> 02:46:19,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm worried that, I mean, I think something big I hear when I knock on the doors of people who don't necessarily turn out in local elections is just general confusion with how local elections work, who's voting for who,

1662
02:46:20,578 --> 02:46:21,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Who, you know, who's up.

1663
02:46:22,721 --> 02:46:30,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, could you explain to me the reasoning behind making city council and school committee, like the compositions different.

1664
02:46:31,111 --> 02:46:31,712
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it's.

1665
02:46:32,854 --> 02:46:39,458
[SPEAKER_22]: very common cities all over the state have a different composition for city council and school committee.

1666
02:46:39,518 --> 02:46:43,400
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think voters can figure it out.

1667
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:47,542
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, they do in most other cities or many other cities.

1668
02:46:49,624 --> 02:46:57,348
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I think this is laid out in the final report, but I don't think we saw a call to increase the size of the school committee.

1669
02:46:59,075 --> 02:47:07,278
[SPEAKER_22]: But we also recognize that the community still wanted board representation for the school committee.

1670
02:47:07,858 --> 02:47:11,480
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually was not on the school committee subcommittee.

1671
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:16,642
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think when you have that discussion, maybe Paulette Van der Kloot would participate.

1672
02:47:16,762 --> 02:47:19,783
[SPEAKER_22]: She chaired that subcommittee and they had extensive discussions.

1673
02:47:19,883 --> 02:47:22,504
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would actually prefer to let her speak more about that.

1674
02:47:22,544 --> 02:47:25,685
[SPEAKER_22]: I can tell you in general, because obviously they came back to the full committee.

1675
02:47:26,979 --> 02:47:37,088
[SPEAKER_22]: And we then discussed it, so I can tell you more in general, but if you want more specifics of how they reached that, she did give you a more detailed answer.

1676
02:47:37,829 --> 02:47:54,363
[SPEAKER_22]: But that was the gist of it, was trying to incorporate ward representation without necessarily increasing it to a body of 11, which we felt was appropriate for council, but not for school committee.

1677
02:47:55,245 --> 02:47:56,305
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Ms.

1678
02:47:56,345 --> 02:48:00,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot is on the Zoom, but I know we also, Ms.

1679
02:48:00,347 --> 02:48:02,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot, I see your hand raised, Mr. Clerk, if you can.

1680
02:48:16,433 --> 02:48:18,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng, did you want me to go ahead to address that?

1681
02:48:19,893 --> 02:48:20,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, very briefly.

1682
02:48:20,854 --> 02:48:26,518
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we're covering this on a different day, but I was just wondering about the mismatch.

1683
02:48:27,899 --> 02:48:32,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think we certainly considered all the different options.

1684
02:48:32,783 --> 02:48:43,192
[SPEAKER_10]: We were concerned that not everybody, you know, if we looked over historically at where school committee members, what

1685
02:48:43,992 --> 02:49:05,383
[SPEAKER_10]: uh wards they had lived in and we we were concerned in and and the way that our particular uh city there um we don't have a school in each ward so we were looking at school placements and how that worked and it it doesn't really correspond in any way and we were concerned i mean um

1686
02:49:06,377 --> 02:49:10,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes there aren't that many people interested in running for school committee.

1687
02:49:11,265 --> 02:49:12,607
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very taxing job.

1688
02:49:14,049 --> 02:49:15,071
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a long time.

1689
02:49:16,502 --> 02:49:20,164
[SPEAKER_10]: In the past, the stipends were always considerably lower.

1690
02:49:20,364 --> 02:49:25,606
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want someone running for position just because they want to collect the stipend.

1691
02:49:26,246 --> 02:49:39,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And so after we discussed all of the different options, and then we started trying to say, well, if we were doing ward representation, what would happen if we had wards where no one wanted to be on the school committee?

1692
02:49:40,931 --> 02:49:42,952
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were concerned about that.

1693
02:49:44,535 --> 02:50:04,011
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, after many different looking at this, this to us seemed to be an opportunity to certainly increase representation from different districts in the city, but also minimize other potential problems.

1694
02:50:06,953 --> 02:50:07,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

1695
02:50:08,814 --> 02:50:09,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Barracud.

1696
02:50:09,395 --> 02:50:10,796
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you for your service to the city.

1697
02:50:10,816 --> 02:50:11,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1698
02:50:12,348 --> 02:50:13,409
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always a joy seeing you.

1699
02:50:15,471 --> 02:50:17,152
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a helpful explanation.

1700
02:50:18,293 --> 02:50:21,536
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know you all looked at data about this.

1701
02:50:21,597 --> 02:50:24,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if the call-in center is more to contribute about this.

1702
02:50:24,479 --> 02:50:30,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there usually a big gulf between the number of candidates who run for city council and school committee?

1703
02:50:32,927 --> 02:50:33,087
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1704
02:50:35,667 --> 02:50:38,389
[SPEAKER_22]: they don't collect that information.

1705
02:50:39,089 --> 02:50:46,394
[SPEAKER_22]: I do just want to say that the discussion about competitiveness, we didn't look at that.

1706
02:50:46,434 --> 02:50:50,878
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not, but what we did look at was representation of the wards.

1707
02:50:51,778 --> 02:50:58,463
[SPEAKER_22]: And we looked back to 2005 and found that two wards in the city had no Councilor from those wards.

1708
02:51:02,528 --> 02:51:10,976
[SPEAKER_22]: So they had zero representation and that two wards that those were words one and four and two words two and three had disproportionate representation.

1709
02:51:10,996 --> 02:51:18,363
[SPEAKER_22]: And in terms of the competitiveness, you know, like I said, we didn't look at that we didn't research it, but.

1710
02:51:19,364 --> 02:51:30,049
[SPEAKER_22]: I can say anecdotally that in my approximately 30 years living in Medford, I've never seen an incumbent city councilor lose an election, and I wouldn't call that competitive.

1711
02:51:30,329 --> 02:51:32,129
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanted to say that.

1712
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:33,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1713
02:51:34,671 --> 02:51:35,811
[SPEAKER_13]: That's helpful, too.

1714
02:51:36,871 --> 02:51:44,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Quickly, going back to the survey, I am curious about, because I used to work in survey research and public opinion polling,

1715
02:51:46,217 --> 02:51:57,717
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm curious if you know the demographics or have that information, percentage like renter, homeowner, racial breakdown, income, anything like that.

1716
02:51:58,583 --> 02:52:01,605
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we did some of those, and they should be in the final report.

1717
02:52:02,726 --> 02:52:10,551
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of the graphics didn't transition well, and so there's actually a new version on the website, I think, with better graphics that you can check.

1718
02:52:10,631 --> 02:52:12,813
[SPEAKER_22]: But Jean Zotter worked on that a lot.

1719
02:52:13,894 --> 02:52:17,616
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you wanted more details on that, you could speak.

1720
02:52:17,716 --> 02:52:26,202
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if she's on Zoom, but she collected a lot of that information and presented it.

1721
02:52:28,853 --> 02:52:30,214
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I saw Jean earlier.

1722
02:52:30,294 --> 02:52:30,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yep.

1723
02:52:31,015 --> 02:52:32,496
[SPEAKER_13]: I see Jean's hands raised.

1724
02:52:32,656 --> 02:52:32,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Good.

1725
02:52:40,443 --> 02:52:41,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, everybody.

1726
02:52:42,825 --> 02:52:46,828
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying... Good to see everyone.

1727
02:52:48,690 --> 02:52:50,151
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying to look in the report.

1728
02:52:50,211 --> 02:52:54,515
[SPEAKER_20]: I think, Justin, your question was about the demographics of the survey respondents.

1729
02:52:55,432 --> 02:52:56,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, that's correct.

1730
02:52:57,092 --> 02:53:06,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to know what the breakdown was in terms of things like homeowner, renter, income, et cetera.

1731
02:53:06,274 --> 02:53:16,136
[SPEAKER_20]: So not everybody gave us demographic information, but those that did tended to be older.

1732
02:53:16,296 --> 02:53:24,318
[SPEAKER_20]: So 45 years or older, that was approximately 54%, which is higher than the city overall.

1733
02:53:26,115 --> 02:53:30,582
[SPEAKER_20]: 81% were homeowners, which is higher than the city overall, which is around 53%.

1734
02:53:31,664 --> 02:53:36,552
[SPEAKER_20]: 52% were female, which is similar to our city demographics.

1735
02:53:36,572 --> 02:53:38,054
[SPEAKER_20]: 79% were white.

1736
02:53:40,859 --> 02:53:44,683
[SPEAKER_20]: which is higher than the city overall, which is around 70% white now.

1737
02:53:45,864 --> 02:53:51,530
[SPEAKER_20]: And 74% were non-Hispanic, which is higher than the city overall.

1738
02:53:51,550 --> 02:54:02,661
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was skewed a little bit towards probably people who have more income, are a little older, whiter and non-Hispanic.

1739
02:54:05,612 --> 02:54:21,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Jean, if you don't mind, if I could just add that one of the reasons, as she mentioned, not everybody gave demographic information, but one of the reasons we chose to collect it was so that we could try to do outreach to populations that we didn't get as many responses from.

1740
02:54:21,538 --> 02:54:27,460
[SPEAKER_22]: And Jean was an amazing organizer of listening sessions around the city.

1741
02:54:27,700 --> 02:54:31,722
[SPEAKER_22]: And we tried to go and we, I mean, it's all in the final report.

1742
02:54:31,902 --> 02:54:34,603
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can sort of see, but I just wanted to add that.

1743
02:54:35,023 --> 02:54:35,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, thanks, Melba.

1744
02:54:36,203 --> 02:54:36,584
[SPEAKER_20]: We did.

1745
02:54:36,664 --> 02:54:40,705
[SPEAKER_20]: We held 15 listening sessions across the city.

1746
02:54:40,725 --> 02:54:47,887
[SPEAKER_20]: We had discussions, so it wasn't meant to be reaching a ton of people.

1747
02:54:47,947 --> 02:54:50,268
[SPEAKER_20]: It was more to have discussions with smaller groups of people.

1748
02:54:50,328 --> 02:54:54,369
[SPEAKER_20]: So 91 residents met with us.

1749
02:54:54,629 --> 02:54:59,211
[SPEAKER_20]: We had 11 in person and several virtual.

1750
02:54:59,231 --> 02:55:03,712
[SPEAKER_20]: A couple of them, we offered interpretations in Spanish and Haitian Creole.

1751
02:55:05,138 --> 02:55:06,820
[SPEAKER_20]: One, we had an ASL interpreter.

1752
02:55:07,360 --> 02:55:16,666
[SPEAKER_20]: We tried to reach groups that we weren't seeing in the survey, and that was very helpful and informed our recommendations.

1753
02:55:19,168 --> 02:55:19,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1754
02:55:19,768 --> 02:55:21,049
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's helpful information.

1755
02:55:21,069 --> 02:55:27,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the outreach that the committee has done to reach groups that weren't represented in the survey.

1756
02:55:27,193 --> 02:55:29,675
[SPEAKER_13]: I just also, you know,

1757
02:55:31,119 --> 02:55:46,165
[SPEAKER_13]: As someone who's into polling, I want us to be careful with how we're assessing the data as well, especially given that the homeowner to renter ratio is so far off from what the city ratio is, which is 53% to 47% instead of what seemed like 80% to 20%.

1758
02:55:46,205 --> 02:55:47,926
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's just to help me understand.

1759
02:55:47,946 --> 02:55:48,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you outline for me a bit

1760
02:55:59,052 --> 02:56:10,961
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we talked about in our interview a very long time ago, the idea of exploring different types of electoral systems, so multi-member districts, proportional representation, rank choice, and all of that.

1761
02:56:11,502 --> 02:56:18,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you help us understand as a council where those conversations went and why those weren't chosen?

1762
02:56:23,456 --> 02:56:28,957
[SPEAKER_22]: We wanted the charter to succeed with the voters and at the state house.

1763
02:56:30,397 --> 02:56:35,178
[SPEAKER_22]: So we didn't necessarily look at alternatives that aren't used.

1764
02:56:36,339 --> 02:56:38,939
[SPEAKER_22]: Ranked choice voting did come up.

1765
02:56:41,300 --> 02:56:52,282
[SPEAKER_22]: That is something that we believed would see a hurdle at the state house, especially because Medford during the state question

1766
02:56:53,690 --> 02:56:56,213
[SPEAKER_22]: voted for ranked choice voting only with a small majority.

1767
02:56:57,014 --> 02:57:04,242
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think, you know, the success of the charter, the ultimate success of the charter was a consideration for us.

1768
02:57:05,343 --> 02:57:05,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1769
02:57:06,883 --> 02:57:17,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I know Councilor Call, or Councilor Callahan brought up the spreadsheet with comparing us to different municipalities around the country.

1770
02:57:17,812 --> 02:57:25,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think a question that comes into my mind is just, what is, why are we choosing one over the other, right?

1771
02:57:26,259 --> 02:57:31,323
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have a bigger data set, it seems to make sense to, to hew to that, but

1772
02:57:32,323 --> 02:57:39,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there much consideration of different municipalities of similar size in different states?

1773
02:57:40,789 --> 02:57:44,291
[SPEAKER_13]: And is there a reason why Massachusetts was the standard?

1774
02:57:46,193 --> 02:57:46,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you just repeat?

1775
02:57:47,053 --> 02:57:49,315
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure I cut that.

1776
02:57:49,715 --> 02:58:01,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Callaghan showed earlier the spreadsheet of different states, right, and of some in our state with the calculations of councillors per capita.

1777
02:58:01,716 --> 02:58:01,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1778
02:58:02,917 --> 02:58:05,979
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm curious.

1779
02:58:06,119 --> 02:58:09,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that data considered in the committee's study of?

1780
02:58:10,401 --> 02:58:14,744
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we had a spreadsheet of cities in Massachusetts.

1781
02:58:15,064 --> 02:58:16,425
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't look at other states.

1782
02:58:17,306 --> 02:58:22,689
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know what the interaction of municipal governments with state government is in those states.

1783
02:58:23,890 --> 02:58:26,491
[SPEAKER_22]: There's just so many other factors that could come into play.

1784
02:58:26,571 --> 02:58:29,273
[SPEAKER_22]: So we stuck to Massachusetts.

1785
02:58:31,390 --> 02:58:31,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1786
02:58:32,671 --> 02:58:33,752
[SPEAKER_13]: That's helpful to know.

1787
02:58:37,074 --> 02:58:46,801
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that more or less, I have questions for President Bears, but I suspect in the public comment period, there are gonna be questions about that proposal as well.

1788
02:58:47,181 --> 02:58:50,503
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to get to public comment first.

1789
02:58:52,144 --> 02:58:54,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, President Bears has some questions.

1790
02:58:55,246 --> 02:58:55,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1791
02:58:56,367 --> 02:58:59,870
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I just wanted to state that some of the concerns that

1792
02:59:01,058 --> 02:59:05,500
[SPEAKER_04]: former member Van der Kloot raised are exactly the reasons that I have concerns about the model.

1793
02:59:06,001 --> 02:59:10,343
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have just two questions for you, Chair McDonald, if I may.

1794
02:59:14,345 --> 02:59:20,988
[SPEAKER_04]: In your research from past elections, did you find any council election that went uncontested?

1795
02:59:25,070 --> 02:59:26,091
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe not.

1796
02:59:28,127 --> 02:59:34,089
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I don't have it in front of me, so I can't say 100%, but I don't think we did.

1797
02:59:34,109 --> 02:59:35,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1798
02:59:36,891 --> 02:59:49,276
[SPEAKER_22]: To be honest, I mean, just there is a graph in the final report that represents the number of Councilors who ran from each ward and then who won.

1799
02:59:49,596 --> 02:59:53,577
[SPEAKER_22]: So there is information about that in the final report.

1800
02:59:53,737 --> 02:59:54,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1801
02:59:55,909 --> 03:00:08,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, just given the discussion that we've had tonight and given the discussions that I've been having, would you or leadership of the Charter Study Committee or in partnership with us and the mayor

1802
03:00:09,862 --> 03:00:23,413
[SPEAKER_04]: be willing to survey specific options for hybrid representation at this point so that we could determine more specifically what the intent of the people who was surveyed with about the different options that have been proposed?

1803
03:00:23,713 --> 03:00:25,574
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that would be my decision.

1804
03:00:25,935 --> 03:00:31,179
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, I think that would have to be between you and the mayor.

1805
03:00:31,199 --> 03:00:34,742
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, I mean, you know,

1806
03:00:36,963 --> 03:00:42,485
[SPEAKER_22]: We've officially finished our work, so I don't know.

1807
03:00:42,585 --> 03:00:44,046
[SPEAKER_22]: I just don't feel like I can answer that.

1808
03:00:46,327 --> 03:00:50,248
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were to move in that direction, would you be open to being consulted in the process?

1809
03:00:51,629 --> 03:00:52,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Possibly.

1810
03:00:52,129 --> 03:00:52,989
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1811
03:00:53,170 --> 03:00:55,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think we actually mostly agree on this.

1812
03:00:55,290 --> 03:01:01,573
[SPEAKER_04]: We all agree on a hybrid model of some at large and some local representation, and I think we've spent

1813
03:01:02,750 --> 03:01:08,014
[SPEAKER_04]: 90 minutes plus, two hours, and maybe even longer than that, arguing about the specifics of it.

1814
03:01:08,194 --> 03:01:14,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't actually have a lot of data beyond the fact that people want a hybrid form of government.

1815
03:01:15,618 --> 03:01:23,523
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might behoove us to try to do a scientific poll to actually ask—give people specific options about what that could look like.

1816
03:01:23,543 --> 03:01:27,205
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, are you referring to multi—I mean, the—

1817
03:01:31,068 --> 03:01:32,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, it's getting late.

1818
03:01:32,349 --> 03:01:34,310
[SPEAKER_22]: The options you talked about before.

1819
03:01:34,330 --> 03:01:37,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Not proportional, not rank choice, none of that.

1820
03:01:37,353 --> 03:01:39,474
[SPEAKER_22]: So what are you talking about exactly?

1821
03:01:39,814 --> 03:01:43,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the district versus board.

1822
03:01:43,757 --> 03:01:45,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Just simply district versus.

1823
03:01:45,438 --> 03:01:48,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to consult on what we would specifically ask.

1824
03:01:48,140 --> 03:01:48,501
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1825
03:01:48,741 --> 03:01:52,504
[SPEAKER_04]: But it just seems to me that we basically all agree that there should be

1826
03:01:53,362 --> 03:02:04,926
[SPEAKER_04]: a hybrid model where there's some level of local representation and some level of at-large representation, but that beyond that specific question, the residents weren't asked about different models that that could look like.

1827
03:02:05,446 --> 03:02:14,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be frank, and I understand that some people disagree with this, the Charter Study Committee chose two different options for the two different legislative bodies of the city.

1828
03:02:14,169 --> 03:02:15,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And so

1829
03:02:17,329 --> 03:02:18,849
[SPEAKER_22]: But we explained why.

1830
03:02:19,490 --> 03:02:25,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why you felt, why this committee's recommendations felt that they could be considered differently.

1831
03:02:25,091 --> 03:02:32,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that the reason that I put forward what I proposed is because I saw what you guys wrote for that school committee.

1832
03:02:32,053 --> 03:02:38,575
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we wouldn't be the only city that has this configuration with a different configuration for school committee.

1833
03:02:38,695 --> 03:02:42,596
[SPEAKER_22]: Lowell, for instance, has an exact, you know, they have eight wards.

1834
03:02:43,296 --> 03:02:51,902
[SPEAKER_22]: They have 11 ward Councilors, one from each ward, three at large, and then their school committee is broke down with districts at large.

1835
03:02:52,482 --> 03:02:54,343
[SPEAKER_22]: And they have a seven-member school committee as well.

1836
03:02:54,743 --> 03:02:58,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a bunch of different configurations across a bunch of different cities.

1837
03:02:58,446 --> 03:02:58,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1838
03:02:58,846 --> 03:03:00,527
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just saying it's not unheard of.

1839
03:03:00,567 --> 03:03:02,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not suggesting it's unheard of.

1840
03:03:02,548 --> 03:03:06,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just suggesting that—I'll leave it at that.

1841
03:03:07,191 --> 03:03:10,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could get more information about the specifics and ask the voters, because I

1842
03:03:14,963 --> 03:03:28,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think there are some pitfalls that have been for the school committee correctly identified in the formation of the composition of the school committee that I'm very concerned would be very similar for the council if composed differently.

1843
03:03:28,567 --> 03:03:32,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's worth trying to have a deeper answer to that question.

1844
03:03:32,808 --> 03:03:35,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might propose that.

1845
03:03:36,645 --> 03:03:37,586
[SPEAKER_04]: path forward, but.

1846
03:03:38,226 --> 03:03:40,047
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, there are timelines also.

1847
03:03:41,328 --> 03:03:44,589
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's something to consider as well.

1848
03:03:44,870 --> 03:03:45,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1849
03:03:45,790 --> 03:03:46,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1850
03:03:46,651 --> 03:03:56,216
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my understanding that Daniel Bullocka, who was on the, Danielle, who was on the CSC has a comment about that question.

1851
03:03:57,136 --> 03:03:57,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Bares.

1852
03:03:58,937 --> 03:03:59,438
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears.

1853
03:04:06,747 --> 03:04:07,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle, give us one second.

1854
03:04:11,555 --> 03:04:12,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there we go.

1855
03:04:14,658 --> 03:04:30,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I don't want to speak for the whole committee, but the way that I think about the difference is that I liked Paulette's proposal because it fits nicely in with the way that I think about school districts for the elementary level.

1856
03:04:30,071 --> 03:04:40,160
[SPEAKER_19]: And those folks representing those different districts, I'm not sure if that's exactly how it works out in the wards, but that made a lot of sense to me.

1857
03:04:41,841 --> 03:04:49,505
[SPEAKER_19]: I do appreciate like everyone like everyone's thoughtfulness about how both of these models would have their benefits and and maybe their risks.

1858
03:04:50,446 --> 03:04:59,511
[SPEAKER_19]: I see like having the two different models being a way to try this out and I think councilor Azar said this earlier is like we're also hopefully committing to a regular review of the charter.

1859
03:04:59,531 --> 03:05:09,156
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that an incumbent in a two ward district versus a one ward district I don't see the competition being very different.

1860
03:05:09,476 --> 03:05:10,357
[SPEAKER_19]: I also think that

1861
03:05:11,957 --> 03:05:20,061
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you know, I think, you know, we don't know how this will work out and I think, increasing the size and increasing the, the number of, or like, you know, going toward representation.

1862
03:05:21,662 --> 03:05:30,166
[SPEAKER_19]: In my mind, would, would help in, in, not just racial diversity representation but economic as we talked about but.

1863
03:05:33,070 --> 03:05:50,412
[SPEAKER_19]: I also think that there's a lot of competition in Medford when it comes to ideas like we see that in this meeting today we see them in all these meetings where like I, I just have a hard time thinking that with the way that we see like people running for or people running against those people that like there aren't going to be people running against.

1864
03:05:51,393 --> 03:05:53,254
[SPEAKER_19]: people in current seats.

1865
03:05:53,735 --> 03:05:57,739
[SPEAKER_19]: I also think that there's a different way of approaching that, which is to address their term limits.

1866
03:05:57,759 --> 03:06:05,186
[SPEAKER_19]: So, we wouldn't have to worry about somebody being in a city council seat until they decide to retire if we decided on different term limits.

1867
03:06:06,268 --> 03:06:12,814
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, I think that it sounds like everybody here is considering moving towards this more representative system.

1868
03:06:13,235 --> 03:06:13,755
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that

1869
03:06:15,506 --> 03:06:23,537
[SPEAKER_19]: This was one of the more important elements of the charter review to me was moving to a more, to me, the most representative that we could be.

1870
03:06:23,577 --> 03:06:26,380
[SPEAKER_19]: And I still do think that what we proposed is that.

1871
03:06:27,963 --> 03:06:28,944
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, thanks for listening.

1872
03:06:29,284 --> 03:06:30,125
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's all I have to say.

1873
03:06:31,427 --> 03:06:32,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Danielle.

1874
03:06:34,687 --> 03:06:34,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1875
03:06:35,888 --> 03:06:41,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I realized that I have two quick questions for the committee members who are here.

1876
03:06:43,012 --> 03:06:46,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there much conversation about the prospect of gerrymandering?

1877
03:06:47,294 --> 03:06:48,095
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, of what?

1878
03:06:48,355 --> 03:06:50,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Of gerrymandering wards.

1879
03:06:51,597 --> 03:06:56,179
[SPEAKER_13]: I know in 2020 it was different because of the pandemic, but normally

1880
03:06:57,965 --> 03:07:04,168
[SPEAKER_13]: wards are drawn at the local level, the maps move up to the national level, is my understanding of things.

1881
03:07:04,268 --> 03:07:11,372
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know in 2020, this council did entertain three different maps to draw the wards.

1882
03:07:18,116 --> 03:07:19,216
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the census data.

1883
03:07:19,917 --> 03:07:21,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's based on census data, yeah.

1884
03:07:22,546 --> 03:07:30,812
[SPEAKER_13]: I know a big concern at every level with these districts is the idea that we might gerrymander.

1885
03:07:31,272 --> 03:07:42,639
[SPEAKER_13]: I think to me, an unspoken, something that we haven't brought up with alternative proposal on the table here is that we do have districts that are harder to gerrymander.

1886
03:07:44,281 --> 03:07:50,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am slightly worried that with smaller districts, with a greater number of districts, we'd be able to

1887
03:07:52,343 --> 03:07:55,025
[SPEAKER_13]: or politicians are more likely to gerrymander those districts?

1888
03:07:55,665 --> 03:08:02,691
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel like that's a question for the Pollen Center, because they have more knowledge about that in general.

1889
03:08:04,432 --> 03:08:04,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1890
03:08:06,154 --> 03:08:13,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, gerrymandering is something you would look at on a case-by-case basis.

1891
03:08:14,200 --> 03:08:16,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody would have to challenge gerrymandering.

1892
03:08:16,923 --> 03:08:19,665
[SPEAKER_16]: First, initially, just think about the process.

1893
03:08:20,941 --> 03:08:23,022
[SPEAKER_16]: The federal census comes out every 10 years.

1894
03:08:24,423 --> 03:08:26,105
[SPEAKER_16]: The city gets the data.

1895
03:08:28,286 --> 03:08:42,636
[SPEAKER_16]: What I've seen is the city clerk ends up drawing up a map of the new wards because the ward lines will change based on where population has shifted within the city.

1896
03:08:43,337 --> 03:08:48,200
[SPEAKER_16]: And then that map will come to you or a variety of maps showing that.

1897
03:08:48,998 --> 03:09:02,044
[SPEAKER_16]: So at that point, this body, however it constituted, would look at it and make a decision as to which map best represents the residents of the city.

1898
03:09:03,284 --> 03:09:10,607
[SPEAKER_16]: And in doing so, ideally, you would approve a map that is not gerrymandered.

1899
03:09:11,808 --> 03:09:14,469
[SPEAKER_16]: And if it is, then it would be subject to challenge.

1900
03:09:15,889 --> 03:09:16,029
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

1901
03:09:21,073 --> 03:09:23,094
[SPEAKER_16]: it would go to the Secretary of State as well.

1902
03:09:23,174 --> 03:09:24,834
[SPEAKER_16]: They would look at it.

1903
03:09:26,514 --> 03:09:47,680
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing else, if I can add one thing, based on everything I've heard tonight, and Mr. McDonald touched on it, is you're on a timeline to try to get this on the ballot for November, and you will need to get this

1904
03:09:49,002 --> 03:09:55,487
[SPEAKER_16]: through the legislature, which means you're gonna have to work with your state delegation, and they're gonna have to shepherd it through.

1905
03:09:56,687 --> 03:10:16,041
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you're going to create anything that the legislature hasn't seen before, or is not consistent with what they usually see, I would suggest you take that under consideration.

1906
03:10:18,307 --> 03:10:23,392
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not making any predictions as to what the legislature would do with any, excuse me, with anything.

1907
03:10:23,572 --> 03:10:24,933
[SPEAKER_16]: My voice is changing apparently.

1908
03:10:26,795 --> 03:10:37,966
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I'm sure you all have the practical wisdom of realizing what can happen when somebody gets to the legislature that they're not used to seeing.

1909
03:10:38,206 --> 03:10:41,769
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, that's kind of just a word to the wise.

1910
03:10:42,904 --> 03:10:43,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1911
03:10:43,984 --> 03:10:54,567
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I, yeah, I was just gonna say state representatives have offered to me to remain in contact about ideas that we might have as a city council too.

1912
03:10:54,667 --> 03:10:55,147
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears.

1913
03:10:56,208 --> 03:11:09,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to follow up on that, would you consider if we were to adopt the three at large for district or five at large for district for the council for that to be unusual for the legislature to see?

1914
03:11:14,517 --> 03:11:20,019
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have statistics on what they've seen across the state as far as that goes.

1915
03:11:20,739 --> 03:11:28,861
[SPEAKER_16]: I think to the extent there was some discussion about having, as I understood what was being discussed, more than one representative, like a district with two.

1916
03:11:29,341 --> 03:11:32,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, multi-member district or proportional representation.

1917
03:11:32,602 --> 03:11:40,764
[SPEAKER_16]: That, it's my understanding, only exists in two communities right now in Massachusetts, one of which is looking to change its form of government.

1918
03:11:41,024 --> 03:11:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think we're considering that at this point.

1919
03:11:43,702 --> 03:11:45,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think we're considering those options.

1920
03:11:57,657 --> 03:12:01,339
[SPEAKER_13]: One more question for the members of the Charter Study Committee.

1921
03:12:02,400 --> 03:12:17,068
[SPEAKER_13]: A big discourse that in Medford for a while about moving towards a ward representation system is the studied, there are a lot of studies about how ward Councilors can oftentimes

1922
03:12:17,782 --> 03:12:28,356
[SPEAKER_13]: putting it more ugly, become thieves of little fiefdoms, and determine how the success or failure of development projects in their neighborhood.

1923
03:12:30,358 --> 03:12:31,740
[SPEAKER_13]: There's, I believe, a 20%

1924
03:12:33,655 --> 03:12:45,600
[SPEAKER_13]: correlation with regards to 20% fewer projects being approved, permits being approved in ward-based systems.

1925
03:12:46,480 --> 03:12:50,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I was wondering what kind of conversations the committee had about that.

1926
03:12:50,842 --> 03:12:56,725
[SPEAKER_22]: We did look at that and we asked, we looked for the research and we asked the Collins Center and we only found

1927
03:12:57,980 --> 03:12:58,661
[SPEAKER_22]: one study.

1928
03:13:00,121 --> 03:13:05,105
[SPEAKER_22]: If there are more, we didn't find them and we couldn't, the Collins Center didn't know of any either.

1929
03:13:05,905 --> 03:13:26,518
[SPEAKER_22]: And we also mentioned that in the final report that that was the finding that you quoted, but there were also caveats, which included that it was a, it was mostly looked at towns and that more study would be warranted for the kind of

1930
03:13:28,206 --> 03:13:39,713
[SPEAKER_22]: area, areas like Medford cities, and also that he didn't, the author didn't consider potential benefits of ward representation, including increased diversity.

1931
03:13:40,874 --> 03:13:50,799
[SPEAKER_22]: So it just didn't, it was one study, looked at one thing, and it wasn't a really broad, there wasn't much broad agreement on that.

1932
03:13:52,443 --> 03:14:03,612
[SPEAKER_22]: and the issues of representation and the potentiality for increased diversity, more accessibility to running for office were just more compelling to us.

1933
03:14:05,194 --> 03:14:06,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for that summary.

1934
03:14:08,556 --> 03:14:17,664
[SPEAKER_13]: If no one has, if no other Councilors have any questions for the call center or for the members of the CSC, I'd like to move to public comments.

1935
03:14:17,804 --> 03:14:19,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there are folks here who've been here for a while.

1936
03:14:20,733 --> 03:14:23,635
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're in person, please line up behind the microphone.

1937
03:14:23,775 --> 03:14:25,236
[SPEAKER_13]: I see some hands on Zoom as well.

1938
03:14:25,936 --> 03:14:27,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Gervino, you've been standing for a while.

1939
03:14:31,580 --> 03:14:31,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1940
03:14:31,960 --> 03:14:35,703
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good to have the opportunity to speak.

1941
03:14:36,387 --> 03:14:38,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask for your name and address?

1942
03:14:39,008 --> 03:14:42,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Ron Giovino, 326 East Porter Road, Medford, Mass.

1943
03:14:42,770 --> 03:14:50,593
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the opportunity to be part of this forum, to be able to talk to the public on this very important issue.

1944
03:14:50,633 --> 03:14:54,274
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this is one of the most important pieces of our work.

1945
03:14:54,795 --> 03:15:05,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I was a member of the Charter Study Review from the beginning, participating in both the Ward Representation Subcommittee and the School Committee Subcommittee.

1946
03:15:05,863 --> 03:15:13,606
[SPEAKER_14]: along with many listening sessions, ice cream at Wright's Pond, interviews, and of course, all our meetings.

1947
03:15:14,667 --> 03:15:34,916
[SPEAKER_14]: I do wanna say publicly that without the leadership of our chairperson, Milbaugh McDonald, who kept us in line, kept us with the one theme of creating a faceless, apolitical document, a living document that would be able to be changed in the best interest of the city.

1948
03:15:36,232 --> 03:15:40,733
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't take this ward representation piece lightly.

1949
03:15:41,613 --> 03:15:45,034
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, I can break it down into very simple terms.

1950
03:15:46,714 --> 03:15:52,095
[SPEAKER_14]: We want our neighbors to feel like they have a neighbor at this council.

1951
03:15:52,675 --> 03:15:54,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what it comes down to.

1952
03:15:55,556 --> 03:16:00,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Every one of you who represent the city also live in the city.

1953
03:16:01,882 --> 03:16:07,726
[SPEAKER_14]: and you go downstairs and you go get your car, and you see four neighbors who have access to you.

1954
03:16:08,466 --> 03:16:18,553
[SPEAKER_14]: There are parts of this community that don't have access, and that's what we wanted to give them, access to talk to somebody in their neighborhood.

1955
03:16:19,753 --> 03:16:26,718
[SPEAKER_14]: And for me, and I can only speak for me, that was the theme, to give each one of those neighborhoods

1956
03:16:27,352 --> 03:16:42,005
[SPEAKER_14]: slash wards that ability to not only have someone to go to like you know their Salem street discussion St Clair discussion tops discussion, who do I call I don't know you, who do I call.

1957
03:16:43,029 --> 03:16:47,410
[SPEAKER_14]: And they'd know, Ward 3 rep, Jim Jones, that's who I need to call.

1958
03:16:48,070 --> 03:16:54,271
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jim Jones also knew that those folks that were talking to him, that were keeping him in office for the next term.

1959
03:16:54,591 --> 03:16:59,972
[SPEAKER_14]: So there was a natural togetherness that represented them in the city.

1960
03:17:00,332 --> 03:17:01,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And everybody deserves that.

1961
03:17:02,113 --> 03:17:04,853
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we know, that doesn't happen, it hasn't.

1962
03:17:04,873 --> 03:17:08,194
[SPEAKER_14]: 2005, there's some wards that have zero representation.

1963
03:17:08,957 --> 03:17:10,278
[SPEAKER_14]: And we thought that was not right.

1964
03:17:10,838 --> 03:17:19,621
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing that an assumption that all we're doing is putting one of 11 people on a city council for the entire city.

1965
03:17:20,381 --> 03:17:22,722
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not giving ward reps powers.

1966
03:17:23,262 --> 03:17:24,723
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no superpower.

1967
03:17:25,243 --> 03:17:30,125
[SPEAKER_14]: All you are is one of 11 votes, nothing more, nothing less.

1968
03:17:31,680 --> 03:17:40,107
[SPEAKER_14]: And to assume that you all live in your neighborhood, do you make Cherry Street your priority when you're up here making laws?

1969
03:17:40,188 --> 03:17:41,088
[SPEAKER_14]: No, of course not.

1970
03:17:41,869 --> 03:17:44,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what we expect from our ward representation.

1971
03:17:45,152 --> 03:17:47,094
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why we think it's very important.

1972
03:17:48,195 --> 03:17:57,583
[SPEAKER_14]: The district discussion that happened with the school committee, and when I'm here talking about the school committee, there's a thousand other reasons why we went district.

1973
03:17:58,764 --> 03:18:05,028
[SPEAKER_14]: not the least which is some folks have children in schools in different wards.

1974
03:18:05,928 --> 03:18:07,329
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a lot to that.

1975
03:18:07,709 --> 03:18:09,390
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll talk about that when that comes up.

1976
03:18:10,431 --> 03:18:21,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what we have to look at is exactly everybody who's voting should have someone they know here.

1977
03:18:22,970 --> 03:18:29,716
[SPEAKER_14]: who is at least not voting for them, not doing things specific to them, but talking to them both ways.

1978
03:18:30,376 --> 03:18:35,621
[SPEAKER_14]: I can talk to my ward two rep, the ward two rep can come to me and share information.

1979
03:18:36,481 --> 03:18:37,502
[SPEAKER_14]: It just makes sense.

1980
03:18:38,083 --> 03:18:43,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to 11, just one out of 11, it just made too much sense.

1981
03:18:45,609 --> 03:18:48,651
[SPEAKER_14]: The discussion about open wards,

1982
03:18:49,447 --> 03:18:53,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we believe that this is such a positive change in the city.

1983
03:18:54,552 --> 03:19:08,104
[SPEAKER_14]: It is going to foster a new generation of new people who don't have to worry about raising $20,000 to come here, who don't have to go to parts of the city they're just unfamiliar with.

1984
03:19:08,764 --> 03:19:10,006
[SPEAKER_14]: They can sit at church.

1985
03:19:10,146 --> 03:19:11,647
[SPEAKER_14]: They could sit in a community center.

1986
03:19:11,667 --> 03:19:14,369
[SPEAKER_14]: They could sit at a basketball game and say, hey, Jim, why don't you run?

1987
03:19:15,317 --> 03:19:19,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And that guy gets to run and he gets to come up here and do great things for the city.

1988
03:19:19,640 --> 03:19:20,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Those folks are not around.

1989
03:19:21,722 --> 03:19:22,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are they?

1990
03:19:23,443 --> 03:19:24,944
[SPEAKER_14]: This gives them that opportunity.

1991
03:19:25,324 --> 03:19:31,388
[SPEAKER_14]: So my message that I wanna share, and again, I'm not speaking for the committee.

1992
03:19:31,428 --> 03:19:38,093
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm speaking for somebody who was here for two years, listening to my fellow committee people and understanding what the goal was.

1993
03:19:38,133 --> 03:19:41,756
[SPEAKER_14]: And the goal is to foster representation to everybody.

1994
03:19:42,136 --> 03:19:43,217
[SPEAKER_14]: So everybody knows.

1995
03:19:44,170 --> 03:19:47,812
[SPEAKER_14]: that if there's something going on in my community, I know somebody on the council.

1996
03:19:49,192 --> 03:19:56,135
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that we have to not talk about the negatives of money and other things.

1997
03:19:56,195 --> 03:20:03,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just assume that this is a new opportunity for new, fresh ideas and new people to come in and win for the city.

1998
03:20:03,939 --> 03:20:06,000
[SPEAKER_14]: And instead of looking at Wyoming or Alaska

1999
03:20:07,588 --> 03:20:10,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Do what I did, call Gary Christensen over in Malden.

2000
03:20:10,870 --> 03:20:13,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Let him tell you what the ward system over in Malden does.

2001
03:20:13,312 --> 03:20:14,693
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to go far.

2002
03:20:15,233 --> 03:20:16,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Go have lunch with Gary, he'll tell you.

2003
03:20:16,874 --> 03:20:18,815
[SPEAKER_14]: He tells you a lot.

2004
03:20:18,855 --> 03:20:22,658
[SPEAKER_14]: He tells me why he doesn't want to be the president of the school committee.

2005
03:20:23,558 --> 03:20:25,920
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a great mayor who has some great ideas.

2006
03:20:26,320 --> 03:20:29,162
[SPEAKER_14]: And so instead of, let's just talk about the people here.

2007
03:20:29,582 --> 03:20:33,465
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, two purposes.

2008
03:20:33,985 --> 03:20:35,066
[SPEAKER_14]: One is that districts

2009
03:20:35,766 --> 03:20:36,907
[SPEAKER_14]: don't accomplish that goal.

2010
03:20:37,567 --> 03:20:44,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Districts still leave a hole for four people, four wards to not have any representation, still leaves that opportunity.

2011
03:20:44,751 --> 03:20:50,215
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're combining eight to four, that means four wards can still go with zero representation.

2012
03:20:50,935 --> 03:20:51,776
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't like that.

2013
03:20:53,437 --> 03:20:53,857
[SPEAKER_14]: The eight

2014
03:20:54,918 --> 03:20:57,520
[SPEAKER_14]: One to each ward satisfies that.

2015
03:20:57,640 --> 03:21:06,226
[SPEAKER_14]: And trust me, being here for 66 years, I have a pretty good idea that when people in Bedford see need, they step up and do it.

2016
03:21:06,787 --> 03:21:07,767
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it's even 20 people,

2017
03:21:09,108 --> 03:21:11,229
[SPEAKER_14]: that start a drive in a community.

2018
03:21:11,529 --> 03:21:12,709
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's what we're all about.

2019
03:21:13,089 --> 03:21:14,229
[SPEAKER_14]: And you guys are all safe.

2020
03:21:14,269 --> 03:21:15,229
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't about you.

2021
03:21:15,650 --> 03:21:22,031
[SPEAKER_14]: This is about the living document 20 years from now that's been reviewed three or four times and changed.

2022
03:21:22,531 --> 03:21:23,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's give this one a chance.

2023
03:21:24,052 --> 03:21:25,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the people are excited about it.

2024
03:21:26,032 --> 03:21:29,453
[SPEAKER_14]: They were eating ice cream and talking about ward representation two years ago.

2025
03:21:30,113 --> 03:21:33,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they formulated opinions, and another survey is just going to tell you that.

2026
03:21:34,475 --> 03:21:52,644
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm talking to the folks at home, because ultimately they're the ones who make the decision on where the city goes, and its charter, I appreciate your time, and I appreciate Milva, and all the other members of the committee who really worked very hard, not for their any political purpose, but to make the city better.

2027
03:21:52,744 --> 03:21:53,464
[SPEAKER_14]: So, thank you.

2028
03:21:57,714 --> 03:21:58,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2029
03:21:58,635 --> 03:21:59,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to Zoom.

2030
03:22:00,016 --> 03:22:01,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I see Paul Geraghty.

2031
03:22:02,737 --> 03:22:06,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record when you're unmuted, please.

2032
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:06,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2033
03:22:06,980 --> 03:22:21,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, my name is Paul Geraghty, 40 Cedar Road here in Bedford.

2034
03:22:21,569 --> 03:22:26,052
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate the work of the Charter Committee and I do appreciate the

2035
03:22:26,935 --> 03:22:31,598
[SPEAKER_21]: amount of thought and diligence being given to this subject matter by the City Council.

2036
03:22:32,179 --> 03:22:36,882
[SPEAKER_21]: But in listening to the discussion tonight, I'm coming away with two thoughts.

2037
03:22:37,102 --> 03:22:53,394
[SPEAKER_21]: One, is the weight of the committee's thinking to have competitive races, is the weight of the committee come away with the best policymaking decision structure possible?

2038
03:22:54,535 --> 03:22:54,655
[SPEAKER_21]: And

2039
03:22:55,839 --> 03:23:04,884
[SPEAKER_21]: As Ron Givino said previously, I really do believe that innovation and good decisions come from the most unexpected places.

2040
03:23:05,804 --> 03:23:12,167
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel that the more voices that are in the conversation, the better the final outcome can be.

2041
03:23:12,267 --> 03:23:23,213
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, I'm hearing, you know, do we want to have competitive races or do we want to have good real-time policymaking process?

2042
03:23:23,885 --> 03:23:27,727
[SPEAKER_21]: In my opinion, I think going to the ward representation is the way to go.

2043
03:23:28,447 --> 03:23:35,571
[SPEAKER_21]: And we do have the safeguard that in time we can go back via the charter to say, well, we made a mistake.

2044
03:23:36,171 --> 03:23:37,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go back, rethink it and change it.

2045
03:23:38,372 --> 03:23:38,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2046
03:23:43,735 --> 03:23:44,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2047
03:23:44,335 --> 03:23:47,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Going in person, name and address for the record.

2048
03:23:47,457 --> 03:23:47,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

2049
03:23:51,519 --> 03:23:53,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.

2050
03:23:55,922 --> 03:23:59,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to start by saying I am opposed to the amendment.

2051
03:23:59,225 --> 03:24:05,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally support the ward-based representation as written in the proposed charter by the Charter Review Committee.

2052
03:24:08,192 --> 03:24:16,258
[SPEAKER_08]: So many things I wanted to say, but after waiting three and a half hours as a community member, it's hard now to put my thoughts together.

2053
03:24:18,360 --> 03:24:26,439
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I wanted to start by saying is someone who's been pretty engaged and involved in Medford politics for a number of years now.

2054
03:24:30,922 --> 03:24:36,705
[SPEAKER_08]: There has been a lot of talk about ward representation going on again for a number of years.

2055
03:24:37,366 --> 03:24:48,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was the only model I ever heard of from anyone in the community or any of the other elected officials that I worked with or had any other engagement with.

2056
03:24:49,193 --> 03:24:57,518
[SPEAKER_08]: There was constant talk of ward representation, of the value of ward representation, of the fact that we have a lot of people in this community

2057
03:24:58,138 --> 03:25:13,822
[SPEAKER_08]: who are not engaged, who are, don't feel connected to our elected officials or our government in general, policymaking, things that affect them.

2058
03:25:17,543 --> 03:25:24,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So I see that as one of the values or one of the major value of potentially of ward representation.

2059
03:25:25,901 --> 03:25:30,663
[SPEAKER_08]: if you know that there's someone that you, a face you recognize.

2060
03:25:31,064 --> 03:25:33,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone said this, so I don't need to keep reiterating it.

2061
03:25:33,625 --> 03:25:39,247
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, that sense of connection seems to be a big thing that's being talked about everywhere right now across the country.

2062
03:25:39,608 --> 03:25:50,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And anything we can do to build up that sense of connection so that we can get more people involved in what's going on, we have a serious lack of civic engagement everywhere.

2063
03:25:51,093 --> 03:25:54,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So why we wouldn't be looking for better ways to try

2064
03:25:55,275 --> 03:25:58,238
[SPEAKER_08]: to get people more involved, I'm really not understanding.

2065
03:26:02,542 --> 03:26:06,466
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've lost my train of thought.

2066
03:26:10,350 --> 03:26:17,437
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that concerns me about the presentation of this amendment,

2067
03:26:21,437 --> 03:26:37,344
[SPEAKER_08]: is the potential for a conflict of interest when City Council is getting involved in such a way of what feels to me personally like almost dismissive of the work that we as a community charged this group with doing.

2068
03:26:38,665 --> 03:26:49,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I read a blog post from Councilor Leming and also saw him speak at one of the Charter Review Committee meetings where he commented on that and said, you know,

2069
03:26:51,157 --> 03:27:11,060
[SPEAKER_08]: If there were to be a conflict between what something that the Charter Committee recommended and a major conflict with what the City Council felt was appropriate, that really there should be deference given to what the Charter Committee, the conclusions they came to.

2070
03:27:11,540 --> 03:27:15,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if they were charged with doing this, they've been doing this for two years.

2071
03:27:16,621 --> 03:27:18,902
[SPEAKER_08]: They have become our local experts on this.

2072
03:27:21,382 --> 03:27:36,668
[SPEAKER_08]: they've consulted, they've got data, I was gonna use a perm, they've got tons of data on their website for anyone who wants to look and see why they reached these conclusions and what information they used to come to these conclusions.

2073
03:27:40,609 --> 03:27:47,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm concerned and troubled by the fact that I'm seeing a city council who now, you know, is suggesting

2074
03:27:49,990 --> 03:28:03,581
[SPEAKER_08]: that perhaps their experience should count for more than what the charter committee came to the conclusion after their many months of this.

2075
03:28:03,601 --> 03:28:09,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really hope you guys will truly consider the fact that this does seem to be what the community wanted.

2076
03:28:10,306 --> 03:28:13,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, there could be many other models that could be looked at.

2077
03:28:13,468 --> 03:28:18,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it was thoroughly and clearly explained why they didn't choose to look at those other models.

2078
03:28:20,955 --> 03:28:27,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I really hope that we will go toward representation because I think that's what has been talked about.

2079
03:28:27,939 --> 03:28:29,099
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what people wanted.

2080
03:28:29,500 --> 03:28:32,021
[SPEAKER_08]: People wanted to have the ability to have more connection.

2081
03:28:32,401 --> 03:28:49,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I can personally speak as someone who ran to say that running a citywide election definitely is an expense in resources, time, money that would be different if we had some people running for those who would be able to run a ward based, which one would expect.

2082
03:28:51,368 --> 03:28:54,209
[SPEAKER_08]: would bring more people willing to run.

2083
03:28:56,170 --> 03:29:00,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I think we don't know.

2084
03:29:00,772 --> 03:29:03,473
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know how ward-based will work in our community.

2085
03:29:04,033 --> 03:29:13,837
[SPEAKER_08]: We do know that up to this point, a model that's not ward-based has led to some real disparities both in

2086
03:29:16,373 --> 03:29:24,876
[SPEAKER_08]: the number in disparities between wards and people who will run, people who end up in office.

2087
03:29:26,317 --> 03:29:31,199
[SPEAKER_08]: We also know that we see fairly low voter turnout by wards.

2088
03:29:32,460 --> 03:29:37,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's the gist of what I wanted to say.

2089
03:29:37,742 --> 03:29:38,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2090
03:29:40,023 --> 03:29:40,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2091
03:29:40,683 --> 03:29:42,144
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanted to clarify that.

2092
03:29:43,663 --> 03:29:49,784
[SPEAKER_13]: I think most members of this committee have expressed their gratitude to the Charter Study Committee.

2093
03:29:50,944 --> 03:30:03,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I know members of this committee have also said that all in all, this is a great work, but it is our job, our statutory job to scrutinize and ask questions.

2094
03:30:03,486 --> 03:30:11,248
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if you look at the questions, at least I've been asking, I've been trying to get an understanding of what have I not seen in the final report?

2095
03:30:12,208 --> 03:30:15,373
[SPEAKER_13]: in trying to understand the thinking behind the proposal at hand.

2096
03:30:16,355 --> 03:30:20,341
[SPEAKER_13]: I see John Moresky on Zoom.

2097
03:30:21,943 --> 03:30:25,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please, once we have you unmuted.

2098
03:30:33,725 --> 03:30:36,167
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm John Moreshi, I live at 26 Sherman Court.

2099
03:30:37,368 --> 03:30:45,116
[SPEAKER_25]: And full disclosure, I was a member of the Charter Committee until a combination of a new job and a new baby made it just too hard for me to keep up.

2100
03:30:47,037 --> 03:30:48,639
[SPEAKER_25]: That being said, I'm only speaking for myself.

2101
03:30:48,699 --> 03:30:51,702
[SPEAKER_25]: I haven't spoken to the committee about this and my views are my own.

2102
03:30:54,349 --> 03:31:00,912
[SPEAKER_25]: To start, I've spent my life in public service, and I've had to push back against cynicism from family, friends, even coworkers.

2103
03:31:01,612 --> 03:31:09,676
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not cynical about public service or public servants, but this amendment does make me feel a little cynical, and that hasn't changed the whole time I've been watching the debate.

2104
03:31:09,696 --> 03:31:19,140
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not trying to cast dispersions on actual intent, but the appearance, I think, is the elevation of self-interest by the council over broad public interest.

2105
03:31:19,640 --> 03:31:21,421
[SPEAKER_25]: And intended or not, I think that's the result.

2106
03:31:22,916 --> 03:31:25,698
[SPEAKER_25]: There's no perfect system, including the proposed system.

2107
03:31:26,779 --> 03:31:29,961
[SPEAKER_25]: And I wanna echo Milva regarding competitiveness in our current system.

2108
03:31:30,582 --> 03:31:35,185
[SPEAKER_25]: Turnout in municipal elections is low, and wards like mine, Ward 1, are unrepresented already.

2109
03:31:35,926 --> 03:31:39,789
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm skeptical we're actually losing much by going with the committee's recommendation on that front.

2110
03:31:40,569 --> 03:31:43,251
[SPEAKER_25]: And to echo Ron, representation by neighborhood is crucial.

2111
03:31:43,431 --> 03:31:46,774
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a crucial value in this change, and we shouldn't lose sight of that.

2112
03:31:47,494 --> 03:31:52,078
[SPEAKER_25]: Elevating one definition of competitiveness as a value above all others will miss the mark.

2113
03:31:54,090 --> 03:32:03,356
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think ultimately the real tell here is that there aren't efforts in cities with a ward at-large hybrid structure to change that structure, as far as I'm aware.

2114
03:32:04,056 --> 03:32:06,958
[SPEAKER_25]: So whatever problems exist with that structure, they don't outweigh it.

2115
03:32:07,839 --> 03:32:09,239
[SPEAKER_25]: Are wards a perfect unit to use?

2116
03:32:09,319 --> 03:32:09,900
[SPEAKER_25]: Absolutely not.

2117
03:32:10,320 --> 03:32:11,801
[SPEAKER_25]: But there's no perfect line to draw.

2118
03:32:12,561 --> 03:32:14,823
[SPEAKER_25]: Wards are an existing unit of government in Massachusetts.

2119
03:32:15,063 --> 03:32:15,703
[SPEAKER_25]: People know them.

2120
03:32:16,064 --> 03:32:17,144
[SPEAKER_25]: It's logical to use them.

2121
03:32:17,705 --> 03:32:19,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Why add another layer of complexity with districts?

2122
03:32:22,435 --> 03:32:27,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Bears mentioned the vast majority of bodies don't have ward elections, and Councilor Callahan looked at other states.

2123
03:32:27,616 --> 03:32:31,077
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm very skeptical of the utility of these comparisons, as was noted earlier.

2124
03:32:32,277 --> 03:32:36,038
[SPEAKER_25]: Government structure is so different in other places, county government most immediately.

2125
03:32:37,398 --> 03:32:43,279
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would just say we know what communities like ours do, communities with our issues and concerns and state and county structure.

2126
03:32:43,800 --> 03:32:45,240
[SPEAKER_25]: They do what the Charter Committee recommended.

2127
03:32:46,180 --> 03:32:46,940
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing is perfect.

2128
03:32:47,340 --> 03:32:48,100
[SPEAKER_25]: There is no best.

2129
03:32:48,501 --> 03:32:50,401
[SPEAKER_25]: We could debate or survey forever.

2130
03:32:51,375 --> 03:32:53,476
[SPEAKER_25]: We know this model works in communities like ours.

2131
03:32:53,997 --> 03:32:58,019
[SPEAKER_25]: We know people want it, and I'm confident that it is better than what the city is doing now.

2132
03:32:58,779 --> 03:33:02,782
[SPEAKER_25]: So I hope this amendment is not adopted, and the Charter Committee's recommendations are successful.

2133
03:33:03,522 --> 03:33:09,466
[SPEAKER_25]: And one thing I have to add, because it came up a few times, the solution to long meetings cannot be less representation.

2134
03:33:10,306 --> 03:33:10,866
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

2135
03:33:10,886 --> 03:33:16,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Going in person now.

2136
03:33:16,290 --> 03:33:18,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

2137
03:33:21,108 --> 03:33:23,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

2138
03:33:25,571 --> 03:33:32,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, thank you to members of this committee and to the Charter Study Committee.

2139
03:33:32,516 --> 03:33:39,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do want to say not so much to member Eunice Brown, who commented on Facebook on December 17.

2140
03:33:40,381 --> 03:33:42,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Zach and Matt are big effing pricks.

2141
03:33:42,902 --> 03:33:45,304
[SPEAKER_03]: If Zach turned up dead, I would not mind a bit.

2142
03:33:46,145 --> 03:33:48,426
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do not want to thank that person.

2143
03:33:50,677 --> 03:33:53,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a lot of thoughts on what's being discussed tonight.

2144
03:33:56,461 --> 03:34:06,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that a big piece of this is, let's put it in a maybe odd way, meaningful granularity of representation.

2145
03:34:07,848 --> 03:34:17,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of cities, or at least some cities in the state, that use a district model, including Boston and Lowell, to my knowledge.

2146
03:34:20,159 --> 03:34:22,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems to work in those places.

2147
03:34:22,843 --> 03:34:24,645
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as though there's no precedent for this.

2148
03:34:24,665 --> 03:34:33,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I am particularly concerned about, and just a moment, please.

2149
03:34:37,255 --> 03:34:44,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Wards 7 and 4 in particular, Ward 7, I did some math the other night.

2150
03:34:45,920 --> 03:34:50,383
[SPEAKER_03]: In the last municipal race, only 740 people voted in that ward.

2151
03:34:50,903 --> 03:34:53,504
[SPEAKER_03]: In contrast to Ward 6, where there were 2,319 voters.

2152
03:34:58,147 --> 03:35:08,437
[SPEAKER_03]: To put it straight, the weighting of a vote in seven versus six, it's a factor of about three, right?

2153
03:35:09,778 --> 03:35:18,345
[SPEAKER_03]: This means that people in some places will have significantly heavier weighted, more heavily weighted votes than in others.

2154
03:35:19,526 --> 03:35:20,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Ward one,

2155
03:35:20,772 --> 03:35:29,196
[SPEAKER_03]: only 1,342 voters in the last muni versus ward three, where there were 2,607.

2156
03:35:29,236 --> 03:35:34,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is a factor of two.

2157
03:35:34,778 --> 03:35:42,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that combining these boards into districts helps to make up for some of this.

2158
03:35:42,862 --> 03:35:48,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this hasn't really been discussed concretely tonight, but it is a concern of mine that like,

2159
03:35:49,015 --> 03:35:58,966
[SPEAKER_03]: We are actually talking about constructing a system that will or would give people votes that are significantly more meaningful than other people's.

2160
03:35:59,607 --> 03:36:05,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And just for a little perspective, in Ward 4, where I do live, I live in, I believe it's 4-2.

2161
03:36:08,237 --> 03:36:09,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody correct me if I'm wrong here, please.

2162
03:36:10,598 --> 03:36:18,681
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, the other precinct in the district is occupied mostly by Tufts University has a high population because of the student body of Tufts University.

2163
03:36:19,861 --> 03:36:27,784
[SPEAKER_03]: The students at Tufts University do not typically participate in municipal races.

2164
03:36:28,204 --> 03:36:31,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we're dealing with, you know, I think,

2165
03:36:32,538 --> 03:36:35,759
[SPEAKER_03]: an issue that is, to some extent, going to be built in here.

2166
03:36:35,799 --> 03:36:42,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think there's a way to reconcile that issue, given how votes are apportioned.

2167
03:36:43,500 --> 03:36:55,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Apart from the district model, which has been proposed, I think that there is some kind of law of, I don't know if it's exactly the law of averages, but basically evening out these discrepancies.

2168
03:36:55,583 --> 03:36:56,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I also,

2169
03:37:02,722 --> 03:37:10,008
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, want to make the point that I think it's sort of peculiar that we would have two bodies, the school committee and the city council.

2170
03:37:10,889 --> 03:37:19,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And this point's been made before, but two bodies that are essentially representing the same population in essentially the same way.

2171
03:37:20,273 --> 03:37:23,234
[SPEAKER_03]: and then structure them into distinct ways.

2172
03:37:24,494 --> 03:37:27,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that these should, you know, have identical compositions.

2173
03:37:28,514 --> 03:37:30,595
[SPEAKER_03]: If possible, I think that's a lot easier for voters.

2174
03:37:30,635 --> 03:37:31,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a lot easier for people.

2175
03:37:32,675 --> 03:37:38,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like there have been arguments made for why one is like legitimate, but not the other.

2176
03:37:38,916 --> 03:37:49,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think just lastly, I'd like to end on the point that, you know, we're fixating, I think a lot on the semantics of what a ward is,

2177
03:37:51,618 --> 03:38:10,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's a point here to the point of like meaningful granularity right, we want a unit I think that is small enough so that people feel like they can know you know who their representative is in a more meaningful way, while also, you know, not making that unit so small that we have these like

2178
03:38:10,967 --> 03:38:14,949
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, multiple districts that are sort of these edge cases here.

2179
03:38:16,170 --> 03:38:20,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's, I've named two particularly small districts.

2180
03:38:20,373 --> 03:38:22,414
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be two out of eight.

2181
03:38:22,454 --> 03:38:25,956
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a quarter of these seats that would be, you know,

2182
03:38:27,612 --> 03:38:28,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I think too small.

2183
03:38:30,595 --> 03:38:34,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's my piece.

2184
03:38:34,478 --> 03:38:47,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, I'll just end on the fact that I think that the city, and not just the Charter Study Committee, but broadly, ought to take a more scientific approach to polling and getting information from the public.

2185
03:38:47,891 --> 03:38:52,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these ad hoc surveys that go out to personal networks are not a,

2186
03:38:54,076 --> 03:38:56,437
[SPEAKER_03]: not a tool of good policymaking.

2187
03:38:56,457 --> 03:39:13,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there are, you know, meaningful and meaningful ways to survey the public that do a better job of getting, you know, input across the population and not from like, you know, biases based off of like who's plugged in enough.

2188
03:39:13,764 --> 03:39:14,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your time.

2189
03:39:19,346 --> 03:39:19,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2190
03:39:21,093 --> 03:39:24,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving back to Zoom, Paulette Van der Kloot.

2191
03:39:26,315 --> 03:39:33,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the clerk still has to let you, yeah, there we go.

2192
03:39:33,419 --> 03:39:34,279
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go, thank you.

2193
03:39:35,680 --> 03:39:47,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng, I just wanted to come back for just a second to say I became a little nervous as I was listening to the discussion that all of a sudden the comparison was to what the school committee subcommittee proposed.

2194
03:39:48,152 --> 03:39:51,013
[SPEAKER_10]: in our particular part of the school committee.

2195
03:39:51,754 --> 03:39:56,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is different than what was proposed for city Councilors.

2196
03:39:57,696 --> 03:40:06,860
[SPEAKER_10]: That was because we did see that there was different roles and really in some ways different populations.

2197
03:40:08,513 --> 03:40:24,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to say that I came slowly toward representation, but ultimately voted and supported it because as a member of the committee, and having attended many of the information sessions,

2198
03:40:24,743 --> 03:40:42,138
[SPEAKER_10]: and listening to people and talking to people in other communities, as well as having the discussions that we'll talk more about in terms specifically about the school committee, I heard from our citizens a great interest in having ward representation.

2199
03:40:43,578 --> 03:40:55,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, and as I served on the committee, you know, you could go nuts doing this because there's always one more thing you can do and one more thing and make it better.

2200
03:40:55,062 --> 03:41:04,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And I absolutely believe that we're really all interested here in trying to come up with a good, positive solution.

2201
03:41:05,005 --> 03:41:07,886
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all understand that it's really time.

2202
03:41:09,226 --> 03:41:09,767
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's, you know,

2203
03:41:11,637 --> 03:41:22,606
[SPEAKER_10]: the weighing between how much do we go back to the drawing board and do another something and another something and how much we move is, you know, the question is there.

2204
03:41:24,067 --> 03:41:40,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to let the committee know that I came to appreciate ward representation, even though as someone who had ran and served our city for a long time, I loved representing the whole city, but there was much to be said for those other discussions and I don't want

2205
03:41:40,581 --> 03:41:53,247
[SPEAKER_10]: the fact that we chose something different to put forward to you for the school committee to hamper the discussion or make anybody think that I was not a proponent for what the committee put forth overall.

2206
03:41:56,289 --> 03:41:56,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2207
03:41:58,450 --> 03:41:58,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2208
03:42:00,731 --> 03:42:04,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Going back in person, name and address for the record, please.

2209
03:42:06,535 --> 03:42:09,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Anne Haggerty, 11 Sagamore Park.

2210
03:42:09,796 --> 03:42:18,518
[SPEAKER_09]: First, thank you very much to the Charter Review Committee, the Collins Center staff, and the City Council for putting this out and really evaluating it.

2211
03:42:18,558 --> 03:42:26,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you all have good goals in mind, and I appreciate what everybody has added to the conversation.

2212
03:42:26,972 --> 03:42:29,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Denver does have a voter participation problem.

2213
03:42:29,997 --> 03:42:30,597
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not alone.

2214
03:42:30,658 --> 03:42:32,460
[SPEAKER_09]: The state does and the country does.

2215
03:42:33,381 --> 03:42:35,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think there's a lot of reasons for that.

2216
03:42:35,965 --> 03:42:37,447
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lack of information available.

2217
03:42:37,587 --> 03:42:42,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Fortunately, I'm hearing some news about a potential digital newspaper that might come out.

2218
03:42:43,518 --> 03:42:45,159
[SPEAKER_09]: making candidates available.

2219
03:42:45,179 --> 03:42:48,661
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always been hard to find who's running and what do they stand for.

2220
03:42:49,922 --> 03:42:51,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently, it's been hard to find that.

2221
03:42:51,883 --> 03:42:56,866
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of developing that as a mechanism to learn more about people, I think would be great.

2222
03:42:57,947 --> 03:42:59,988
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of questions.

2223
03:43:00,028 --> 03:43:06,471
[SPEAKER_09]: The data referenced, I think Zach, you referenced some data about districts being similarly made up.

2224
03:43:06,892 --> 03:43:11,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that available on like six and eight are similar in structure?

2225
03:43:13,038 --> 03:43:13,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

2226
03:43:15,877 --> 03:43:16,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I can answer that question.

2227
03:43:16,818 --> 03:43:17,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2228
03:43:17,298 --> 03:43:18,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the question should go to the chair.

2229
03:43:18,518 --> 03:43:18,999
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

2230
03:43:19,119 --> 03:43:20,540
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can also answer that question for you.

2231
03:43:20,560 --> 03:43:22,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's all census data.

2232
03:43:23,221 --> 03:43:27,883
[SPEAKER_13]: The most easy way to play around with the data is on a website called Dave's Redistricting.

2233
03:43:28,424 --> 03:43:29,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave's Redistricting?

2234
03:43:29,224 --> 03:43:31,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Dave, like the name, Dave's Redistricting.

2235
03:43:32,466 --> 03:43:32,606
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

2236
03:43:32,946 --> 03:43:38,629
[SPEAKER_13]: They have the city broken up by precinct, by ward, by census block as well.

2237
03:43:38,969 --> 03:43:43,632
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can piece together a map, and you can use that to look at the data.

2238
03:43:44,612 --> 03:43:45,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I like looking at data.

2239
03:43:46,814 --> 03:43:59,981
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing I wasn't clear on, if there was a hybrid district and at-large camp election, how did people, or even with the ward-based ones, how does it work?

2240
03:44:01,082 --> 03:44:12,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Do candidates run specifically for a ward or at-large seat, or do the at-large seats get filled with the next highest from the ward-based?

2241
03:44:12,921 --> 03:44:15,703
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they would run for separate seats.

2242
03:44:15,903 --> 03:44:19,745
[SPEAKER_13]: So a candidate running for an at-large seat would only be in that election.

2243
03:44:20,266 --> 03:44:27,170
[SPEAKER_13]: And a candidate running for a ward-based seat or a district-based seat, whatever it may be, is only running for that election.

2244
03:44:27,250 --> 03:44:27,710
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, great.

2245
03:44:28,971 --> 03:44:34,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the turnout is different from ward to ward, as noted by the previous person speaking.

2246
03:44:35,855 --> 03:44:36,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Interestingly,

2247
03:44:37,336 --> 03:44:49,525
[SPEAKER_09]: two of the wards that were mentioned with the lower turnout, which would give it a higher weight, if you would, don't have any representatives on the City Committee right now, City Council.

2248
03:44:49,605 --> 03:44:53,828
[SPEAKER_09]: So Ward 1 and 7 are not represented, right, if I'm correct?

2249
03:44:54,309 --> 03:44:57,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm in favor of expanding

2250
03:44:58,612 --> 03:45:15,505
[SPEAKER_09]: the number of voices that are contributing to the discussion, to get more diversity, to get better ideas, and also to have a ripple effect and kind of hopefully energize the community to get involved, to start voting, to run for office.

2251
03:45:17,726 --> 03:45:19,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm afraid we're kind of predicting

2252
03:45:20,614 --> 03:45:23,276
[SPEAKER_09]: outcomes that may or may not happen.

2253
03:45:23,397 --> 03:45:26,679
[SPEAKER_09]: If somebody runs unopposed, we don't really know.

2254
03:45:27,120 --> 03:45:30,062
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was wondering if it was possible to—it was great.

2255
03:45:30,163 --> 03:45:39,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I love what Emily—Councilor Lazzaro pointed out about being able to reevaluate the charter after 10 years, I think.

2256
03:45:39,851 --> 03:45:40,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Could that be done sooner?

2257
03:45:41,012 --> 03:45:43,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, could you—could we come to one

2258
03:45:44,644 --> 03:45:51,968
[SPEAKER_09]: framework and see how it works, and then reevaluate it in less than 10 years if it's not working?

2259
03:45:52,868 --> 03:45:56,870
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the Collins Center might be the best people to answer this question.

2260
03:45:56,890 --> 03:46:02,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, from my own perspective, we all know how long it took us to get to this point, too.

2261
03:46:02,252 --> 03:46:06,895
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, from a legal perspective.

2262
03:46:09,536 --> 03:46:10,757
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't offer legal opinions.

2263
03:46:14,138 --> 03:46:15,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to take it?

2264
03:46:15,259 --> 03:46:15,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2265
03:46:17,180 --> 03:46:25,627
[SPEAKER_02]: The charter provision that guarantees a 10-year review is simply that, that you do a 10-year review.

2266
03:46:26,068 --> 03:46:32,873
[SPEAKER_02]: You can open the charter at any time to a proposed amendment.

2267
03:46:33,013 --> 03:46:36,516
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in Chapter 43B, Section 10.

2268
03:46:38,647 --> 03:46:45,550
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the proposed amendment process, is that process similar to what happened this time around, or is that?

2269
03:46:45,851 --> 03:46:46,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it will look the same.

2270
03:46:46,971 --> 03:46:49,953
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a special act, you can only amend by a special act.

2271
03:46:51,070 --> 03:46:58,852
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'd have to go, we go through the whole charter study committee process or, or the, I know there's another process.

2272
03:46:59,332 --> 03:47:02,153
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hold your own hearings and make your own decision.

2273
03:47:02,413 --> 03:47:03,993
[SPEAKER_02]: That's optional.

2274
03:47:04,733 --> 03:47:05,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2275
03:47:06,834 --> 03:47:09,455
[SPEAKER_16]: And the mayor and then you'd send it into the legislature.

2276
03:47:09,735 --> 03:47:11,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Like any other special act, the homework petition.

2277
03:47:12,475 --> 03:47:18,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it common for city councils to review their city charter with in less than 10 years spans?

2278
03:47:20,386 --> 03:47:22,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fairly rare, but it has been done.

2279
03:47:23,307 --> 03:47:23,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2280
03:47:23,688 --> 03:47:25,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that answer your questions?

2281
03:47:26,329 --> 03:47:27,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2282
03:47:27,150 --> 03:47:27,270
Thanks.

2283
03:47:27,590 --> 03:47:28,530
Thank you guys very much.

2284
03:47:30,011 --> 03:47:30,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, President Bears.

2285
03:47:32,953 --> 03:47:33,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, give me a second.

2286
03:47:34,474 --> 03:47:37,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that amendment also then go to a referendum?

2287
03:47:39,377 --> 03:47:42,438
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a change in composition of the council, yes.

2288
03:47:42,999 --> 03:47:45,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It couldn't take effect without voter approval.

2289
03:47:45,420 --> 03:47:45,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2290
03:47:45,980 --> 03:47:47,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Wanted to make sure that was true.

2291
03:47:48,282 --> 03:47:48,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2292
03:47:50,193 --> 03:47:51,515
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to Zoom.

2293
03:47:51,676 --> 03:47:53,659
[SPEAKER_13]: I see Gene Zotter next.

2294
03:47:54,820 --> 03:47:58,226
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to just put the record once we get you unmuted.

2295
03:48:08,963 --> 03:48:11,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Jean Zotter, 36 Saunders Street.

2296
03:48:12,705 --> 03:48:17,107
[SPEAKER_20]: I was also a member on the Charter Study Committee.

2297
03:48:17,127 --> 03:48:31,594
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to thank the city council for their thorough and thoughtful consideration of our report and the thought that you're putting into the makeup of city council.

2298
03:48:33,555 --> 03:48:37,217
[SPEAKER_20]: I just I wanted to say why I voted for ward representation.

2299
03:48:37,257 --> 03:48:53,825
[SPEAKER_20]: This is just from me and not representative of the whole committee is I was very committed to ensuring our city council was more representative of the racial and ethnic diversity we have in the city.

2300
03:48:53,845 --> 03:48:55,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford in 2010 was 78% white.

2301
03:49:00,038 --> 03:49:05,601
[SPEAKER_20]: It is now 68% white and we seem to be on a trend where we are becoming more diverse.

2302
03:49:08,083 --> 03:49:14,186
[SPEAKER_20]: And we do have one ward, Ward 7, that is minority majority.

2303
03:49:14,906 --> 03:49:17,467
[SPEAKER_20]: based on the 2020 census data.

2304
03:49:19,308 --> 03:49:36,817
[SPEAKER_20]: And so if you do go down the route of not going with the ward representation, but some other configuration, I would urge you to maybe not just adopt what the school committee did, but to look at the wards and ensure that you're

2305
03:49:39,778 --> 03:49:45,403
[SPEAKER_20]: not diluting what could have been maybe a minority majority ward.

2306
03:49:45,423 --> 03:49:55,272
[SPEAKER_20]: The other reason I voted for ward representation and not some other configuration is I was, I really want to see Medford have a full charter.

2307
03:49:55,292 --> 03:50:00,156
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really hard as a resident to know how our government is made up.

2308
03:50:00,877 --> 03:50:05,300
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been four years since we've had a charter review, charter revision.

2309
03:50:06,060 --> 03:50:13,605
[SPEAKER_20]: And we were advised by the Collins Center that if we did something different like that, that it might get held up and might not pass through the legislature.

2310
03:50:13,625 --> 03:50:14,506
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was the other reason.

2311
03:50:15,046 --> 03:50:17,327
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for your time and your thoughtful consideration.

2312
03:50:20,429 --> 03:50:21,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Jean.

2313
03:50:21,090 --> 03:50:24,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have any more people in person wishing to comment?

2314
03:50:24,132 --> 03:50:25,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

2315
03:50:25,993 --> 03:50:26,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2316
03:50:29,247 --> 03:50:31,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Glenn Dixon, 61 Monument Street.

2317
03:50:32,169 --> 03:50:33,811
[SPEAKER_01]: My views are my own, not my wife's.

2318
03:50:38,654 --> 03:50:46,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make a couple of points, which Gene briefly outlined, but I want to emphasize it.

2319
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:48,921
[SPEAKER_01]: The districts that you're talking about

2320
03:50:50,028 --> 03:50:52,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm for the ward representation also.

2321
03:50:52,250 --> 03:51:04,322
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you went with those districts, those districts were drawn around where schools are, not around how it's going to best represent the city in terms of a city council.

2322
03:51:04,442 --> 03:51:08,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really make sense to use those districts.

2323
03:51:08,806 --> 03:51:11,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you get into the problem if you have different districts

2324
03:51:13,466 --> 03:51:20,691
[SPEAKER_01]: designed around what's best for the city council as opposed to schools, then you're getting into even a more confusing situation.

2325
03:51:23,072 --> 03:51:24,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one point.

2326
03:51:24,233 --> 03:51:36,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other point that I would like to make is somebody else briefly touched on it also is that it is inherently a conflict of interest for you to be changing this part of the charter.

2327
03:51:36,680 --> 03:51:41,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you feel like you're being totally objective and doing what's best for the city,

2328
03:51:44,243 --> 03:51:53,425
[SPEAKER_01]: the perception is that, and the reality is, do you have an interest in this?

2329
03:51:53,965 --> 03:52:00,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So the perception of the city is not gonna be the same as, no matter what you proclaim, there's gonna be doubts.

2330
03:52:01,787 --> 03:52:12,369
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, certain things in the charter which affect the city council, its power, its salaries,

2331
03:52:13,852 --> 03:52:18,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things should be left alone, in my opinion, because the

2332
03:52:21,892 --> 03:52:25,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Committee was made up of a wide range of views.

2333
03:52:26,413 --> 03:52:27,613
[SPEAKER_01]: They spent a lot of time.

2334
03:52:27,913 --> 03:52:28,794
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought about this.

2335
03:52:28,974 --> 03:52:38,756
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have any personal stake in whether they're going to get elected or not, or their slate is going to get elected, whatever.

2336
03:52:39,856 --> 03:52:44,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So the perception, no matter what you say, is going to be that.

2337
03:52:44,277 --> 03:52:51,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And in most parts of government, I know the Supreme Court, if there's a perception that someone in the Supreme Court

2338
03:52:52,479 --> 03:52:56,441
[SPEAKER_01]: has a conflict of interest, they're supposed to stay away from that.

2339
03:52:57,001 --> 03:52:58,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the same should apply here.

2340
03:52:59,201 --> 03:53:04,163
[SPEAKER_01]: The perception is going to be that you have a conflict of interest in some of these matters.

2341
03:53:04,943 --> 03:53:08,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And the committee really did not have conflict of interest.

2342
03:53:09,245 --> 03:53:10,625
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my two main points.

2343
03:53:11,466 --> 03:53:11,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Districts

2344
03:53:12,786 --> 03:53:23,416
[SPEAKER_01]: are not set up, we're not set up for the city council, they're set up for the school committee, making sure there's a school in each district, because a lot of the wards don't have schools.

2345
03:53:24,517 --> 03:53:27,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the conflict of interest.

2346
03:53:27,259 --> 03:53:28,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my two main points.

2347
03:53:28,481 --> 03:53:28,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2348
03:53:29,659 --> 03:53:30,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2349
03:53:31,159 --> 03:53:37,420
[SPEAKER_13]: On the conflict of interest point, I mean, I think the city council is built into the process for a reason.

2350
03:53:38,641 --> 03:53:47,442
[SPEAKER_13]: There are things that we're considering that the Charter Study Committee, I think has said that they haven't considered and these aren't necessarily political.

2351
03:53:48,762 --> 03:53:50,383
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my understanding of it.

2352
03:53:50,803 --> 03:53:56,664
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm moving to Zoom, Jess H. Name and address for the record, please, once we get you unmuted.

2353
03:54:01,697 --> 03:54:03,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Jessica Haley, Four Lock Road.

2354
03:54:05,178 --> 03:54:07,838
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in favor of the different wards being represented.

2355
03:54:07,858 --> 03:54:19,221
[SPEAKER_12]: I think what we may also see is if each ward has a person that they're interested in voting for, that they'll come out and actually vote.

2356
03:54:19,861 --> 03:54:30,843
[SPEAKER_12]: I think what we may be seeing is we have a lot of people running on one slate, and if people are not in line with their views, they're not going to bother voting for them.

2357
03:54:31,357 --> 03:54:33,879
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're not gonna show up to vote.

2358
03:54:34,379 --> 03:54:49,570
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this would also help with not everyone just running together and people actually interested in certain parts of the city that they're in and they can make a bond with the people in their neighborhood.

2359
03:54:50,250 --> 03:54:53,933
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm definitely in favor and I appreciate what the charter did.

2360
03:54:54,674 --> 03:54:58,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you should follow their recommendation with all the work they did.

2361
03:54:58,797 --> 03:54:59,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2362
03:55:02,168 --> 03:55:02,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2363
03:55:02,928 --> 03:55:03,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any more people?

2364
03:55:07,731 --> 03:55:08,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

2365
03:55:09,952 --> 03:55:12,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, could... Okay.

2366
03:55:13,674 --> 03:55:18,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Andrews-Holland, can we unmute him?

2367
03:55:19,817 --> 03:55:20,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2368
03:55:28,742 --> 03:55:29,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

2369
03:55:37,604 --> 03:55:37,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello?

2370
03:55:41,729 --> 03:55:42,671
[SPEAKER_13]: You're on, we can hear you.

2371
03:55:42,751 --> 03:55:43,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

2372
03:55:45,214 --> 03:55:45,734
[SPEAKER_13]: You can hear me?

2373
03:55:47,356 --> 03:55:48,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we can hear you.

2374
03:55:48,798 --> 03:55:51,261
[SPEAKER_23]: Anthony Antriotola, 75 Lawrence Road.

2375
03:55:54,686 --> 03:55:55,006
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2376
03:55:56,857 --> 03:56:21,551
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been a long night and I just wanna say, I also was a member of the charter study committee and our committee did a lot of work, but I must say that I am someone who participated in a number of the listening sessions and I got a lot of information from

2377
03:56:23,366 --> 03:56:27,051
[SPEAKER_23]: My neighbors and people I met along the road.

2378
03:56:27,131 --> 03:56:32,398
[SPEAKER_23]: And when we talked about ward representation, we never talked about the number 11.

2379
03:56:33,920 --> 03:56:38,526
[SPEAKER_23]: And I also want to just say that districts are wards.

2380
03:56:39,472 --> 03:56:41,273
[SPEAKER_23]: they're two wards combined.

2381
03:56:42,013 --> 03:56:45,935
[SPEAKER_23]: So district representation is ward representation.

2382
03:56:46,255 --> 03:56:56,399
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is something I brought up early in the process that my colleagues had no interest in exploring anything other than the number 11.

2383
03:56:57,159 --> 03:57:04,622
[SPEAKER_23]: The number 11 came from a model that was used was the city of Lowell, who has eight wards and three districts.

2384
03:57:05,595 --> 03:57:11,479
[SPEAKER_23]: three at-large Councilors, but their wards are double the size of Medford's.

2385
03:57:11,499 --> 03:57:15,482
[SPEAKER_23]: And what makes sense in Lowell doesn't necessarily make sense in Medford.

2386
03:57:15,942 --> 03:57:31,973
[SPEAKER_23]: And something that Chairman Zhang, that you brought up, when we talked about marginalized communities and getting more participation from groups that are underrepresented in Medford, when we talked about wards,

2387
03:57:32,952 --> 03:57:52,453
[SPEAKER_23]: we never really looked at something that you brought up about if we go look at wards that are more, have a greater minority, are we in fact giving them more representation and power or are we kind of,

2388
03:57:54,825 --> 03:58:03,173
[SPEAKER_23]: leaving them in one area where they may be able to get a little bit of representation instead of being represented throughout the city.

2389
03:58:04,014 --> 03:58:17,226
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's something that needed exploring, which I brought up early in the process, which, again, my colleagues chose not to explore and were

2390
03:58:18,543 --> 03:58:33,497
[SPEAKER_23]: The three and eight was the number from the beginning and no other discussion of any other configuration was entertained.

2391
03:58:34,277 --> 03:58:51,311
[SPEAKER_23]: In some of the listening sessions that I participated in with the community, especially one with the Mystic Valley double NAACP, the discussion really was how do we get ranked choice voting.

2392
03:58:52,652 --> 03:58:53,233
[SPEAKER_23]: in the city.

2393
03:58:53,633 --> 03:59:01,418
[SPEAKER_23]: And when I mentioned it to my colleagues, it was something that they had no interest in even talking about.

2394
03:59:02,059 --> 03:59:17,389
[SPEAKER_23]: So I know I've also been, I've been getting emails, got an email saying that, you know, I shouldn't even come and state my position or my views and what I've experienced.

2395
03:59:17,469 --> 03:59:21,252
[SPEAKER_23]: But I felt they needed to because Medford's real important to me.

2396
03:59:22,143 --> 03:59:24,064
[SPEAKER_23]: And my neighborhood is very important.

2397
03:59:24,204 --> 03:59:28,266
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think our government is important.

2398
03:59:28,446 --> 03:59:31,747
[SPEAKER_23]: And you have a big responsibility.

2399
03:59:32,027 --> 03:59:35,289
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think it's important for you to consider five and four.

2400
03:59:36,229 --> 03:59:40,671
[SPEAKER_23]: That's something that I thought would work best for the city.

2401
03:59:40,871 --> 03:59:43,512
[SPEAKER_23]: And I really wanted my colleagues to take a look at it.

2402
03:59:44,213 --> 03:59:49,015
[SPEAKER_23]: And like I said, I was the only one that thought of

2403
03:59:50,419 --> 03:59:51,380
[SPEAKER_23]: of a different number.

2404
03:59:52,841 --> 03:59:55,522
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just wanted to say that out loud.

2405
03:59:56,363 --> 04:00:15,296
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't usually come and talk at city council meetings and I don't articulate my feelings well on Zoom, but I just wanted to come and use my voice because people told me I shouldn't and that didn't sit well with me.

2406
04:00:16,189 --> 04:00:17,711
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think you're on the right path.

2407
04:00:18,312 --> 04:00:26,622
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's your responsibility as City Council to explore other options than what was presented to you by the Charter Study Commission.

2408
04:00:27,082 --> 04:00:34,992
[SPEAKER_23]: They did a lot of work and great people, and I give them a lot of credit, but they didn't look

2409
04:00:37,240 --> 04:00:39,141
[SPEAKER_23]: they didn't take a big look.

2410
04:00:39,942 --> 04:00:58,053
[SPEAKER_23]: It was very, and I think it was such important work and people wanted to get it right and they wanted to get right where they should, that they neglected to really kind of take some of this stuff into consideration.

2411
04:00:58,193 --> 04:00:59,974
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just wanted to

2412
04:01:03,313 --> 04:01:14,885
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to say one other thing about what you said earlier about commissions and other groups and having a residency requirement.

2413
04:01:15,305 --> 04:01:24,595
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted you to realize that some of the commissions and boards have employees of the city, like the police chief,

2414
04:01:25,996 --> 04:01:28,098
[SPEAKER_23]: who is a non-city resident.

2415
04:01:28,618 --> 04:01:35,283
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you go in that route, there are some changes you would need to make to allow for that.

2416
04:01:36,044 --> 04:01:42,889
[SPEAKER_23]: And there were so many things that I wanted to say and so many points I wanted to make.

2417
04:01:43,309 --> 04:01:50,274
[SPEAKER_23]: And waiting, I've lost my chain of thought.

2418
04:01:51,195 --> 04:01:52,276
[SPEAKER_23]: But I just wanted to say,

2419
04:01:54,191 --> 04:01:59,295
[SPEAKER_23]: please consider everything.

2420
04:01:59,735 --> 04:02:09,983
[SPEAKER_23]: And the pressure from the community about 11 is something that you should take on.

2421
04:02:10,043 --> 04:02:22,152
[SPEAKER_23]: It's your responsibility as elected officials to do what's best for the city, even if you do get some negative blowback, because our city deserves

2422
04:02:23,793 --> 04:02:25,014
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, the best change.

2423
04:02:25,034 --> 04:02:26,435
[SPEAKER_23]: I think someone else said it today.

2424
04:02:27,076 --> 04:02:32,600
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, I believe that's a city council that's larger, but it's balanced.

2425
04:02:33,321 --> 04:02:34,982
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'll just leave it at that.

2426
04:02:35,042 --> 04:02:35,523
[SPEAKER_23]: It's late.

2427
04:02:35,663 --> 04:02:38,205
[SPEAKER_23]: And thank you for listening to me ramble.

2428
04:02:39,926 --> 04:02:41,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Andrew Tolan.

2429
04:02:41,908 --> 04:02:44,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's go in person to Chairman Connell.

2430
04:02:46,520 --> 04:02:46,941
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2431
04:02:47,061 --> 04:02:49,082
[SPEAKER_22]: Melvin McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

2432
04:02:50,484 --> 04:02:53,486
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank Anthony for speaking and sharing his thoughts.

2433
04:02:54,987 --> 04:03:05,196
[SPEAKER_22]: I do just want to say that we all on the committee have different perceptions and different experiences, but we did consider other numbers besides 11.

2434
04:03:07,317 --> 04:03:12,161
[SPEAKER_22]: I could bore you with the details of that, but I don't feel like I have to do that.

2435
04:03:12,281 --> 04:03:14,623
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it shows up in the minutes of our meetings.

2436
04:03:15,806 --> 04:03:17,814
[SPEAKER_22]: We did not simply only consider 11.

2437
04:03:22,315 --> 04:03:28,178
[SPEAKER_22]: Other than that, I think we did take a comprehensive look and I think our final report shows that.

2438
04:03:28,278 --> 04:03:31,060
[SPEAKER_22]: So I feel like it speaks for itself.

2439
04:03:32,761 --> 04:03:47,630
[SPEAKER_22]: The one thing that I did wanna point out because there's been talk about voter turnout and numbers were given about voter turnout in particular wards and the wards with low voter turnout correlate directly with the underrepresented wards.

2440
04:03:48,530 --> 04:03:58,360
[SPEAKER_22]: When candidates run for office, they naturally go where the voters are, so it becomes a, a cycle.

2441
04:03:59,601 --> 04:04:03,204
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the hopes is that with representation.

2442
04:04:03,965 --> 04:04:07,187
[SPEAKER_22]: voter turnout could increase.

2443
04:04:07,587 --> 04:04:18,352
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanted to point that out, that the low voter turnout correlates with the underrepresented or zero represented in the last couple of decades' wards.

2444
04:04:18,973 --> 04:04:19,413
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2445
04:04:20,414 --> 04:04:22,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2446
04:04:22,354 --> 04:04:24,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Going now to Zoom, Ms.

2447
04:04:24,336 --> 04:04:29,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila Ahrens, name and address for the record, please, once we unmute you.

2448
04:04:38,876 --> 04:04:40,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, hi, it's Sheila errands.

2449
04:04:40,739 --> 04:04:43,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 19 Monuments of Monuments Street.

2450
04:04:43,863 --> 04:04:48,088
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been it's been a long evening 19 Sagamore Park.

2451
04:04:48,128 --> 04:04:49,410
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my old address.

2452
04:04:50,071 --> 04:04:50,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

2453
04:04:50,511 --> 04:04:53,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just say, can you hear me?

2454
04:04:54,723 --> 04:04:55,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we can hear you.

2455
04:04:55,704 --> 04:04:56,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2456
04:04:56,644 --> 04:05:06,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say I lived in Somerville for many years and we had ward representation there and I found that it worked very, very well.

2457
04:05:07,410 --> 04:05:20,237
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a city Councilor that I knew would be receptive to any sort of questions I had or needs that I had and I could go directly to him or her.

2458
04:05:21,057 --> 04:05:22,998
[SPEAKER_00]: and have my voice heard.

2459
04:05:23,759 --> 04:05:26,460
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was very, very effective.

2460
04:05:26,800 --> 04:05:30,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank the folks on the committee.

2461
04:05:30,823 --> 04:05:33,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they put in so many hours.

2462
04:05:33,544 --> 04:05:36,406
[SPEAKER_00]: I was initially involved before they

2463
04:05:37,746 --> 04:05:40,949
[SPEAKER_00]: weaned down the number of people on the council.

2464
04:05:41,009 --> 04:05:48,216
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite honestly, I would have never been as dedicated as they are as far as the amount of time that they spent on it.

2465
04:05:48,316 --> 04:05:49,557
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, thank you.

2466
04:05:50,297 --> 04:05:55,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was really done because they care about the city and want what's best for it.

2467
04:05:57,224 --> 04:06:00,787
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just trying to think of what my other thoughts are, because it is late.

2468
04:06:02,167 --> 04:06:18,053
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I guess basically that it worked very well in Somerville and it's really wonderful to be able to make a connection with someone who represents your ward and that you can feel like you can get

2469
04:06:18,965 --> 04:06:25,548
[SPEAKER_00]: have changes made and have a voice as opposed to having just at large Councilors.

2470
04:06:25,968 --> 04:06:37,514
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend that the city council look at that and put their support behind all of the work that the committee did.

2471
04:06:37,614 --> 04:06:38,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

2472
04:06:40,415 --> 04:06:40,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2473
04:06:42,076 --> 04:06:44,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Going to Zoom, Eileen Lerner.

2474
04:06:45,396 --> 04:06:49,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, can you give us your name and address for the record once we unmute you?

2475
04:06:50,219 --> 04:06:50,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2476
04:06:53,261 --> 04:06:54,722
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Eileen Lerner.

2477
04:06:55,363 --> 04:07:04,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway, and I want to say that I really support the work of the Charter Commission.

2478
04:07:04,469 --> 04:07:10,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just so impressed by their public service, their commitment, and the result.

2479
04:07:11,193 --> 04:07:13,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's, um,

2480
04:07:14,708 --> 04:07:18,393
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a great example of democracy in action.

2481
04:07:20,056 --> 04:07:28,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And just for that one argument alone, I recommend that every city councilor pass

2482
04:07:29,497 --> 04:07:44,647
[SPEAKER_07]: this, the new charter resolution on to the state house, because you can't, it would be so awful to have this great demonstration of democracy that went on in our community.

2483
04:07:45,187 --> 04:07:54,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Albeit it wasn't perfect, nothing is ever perfect, but it's a first step, you know, and improving things.

2484
04:07:55,153 --> 04:07:58,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And as has been pointed out, there's,

2485
04:08:00,118 --> 04:08:05,362
[SPEAKER_07]: in this charter itself is provision for periodic reviews.

2486
04:08:05,482 --> 04:08:10,265
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not anything that's cast in stone, it can be improved on.

2487
04:08:10,946 --> 04:08:22,574
[SPEAKER_07]: But as people said, the main thing is ensuring more representation than has ever happened before in Medford to the people that live in Medford.

2488
04:08:23,074 --> 04:08:23,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems like

2489
04:08:25,090 --> 04:08:39,733
[SPEAKER_07]: in view of what happened in Washington the other day, that we ought to be cognizant of giving people more representation and encouraging community because we're all gonna need it.

2490
04:08:40,253 --> 04:08:42,393
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all gonna need it a whole lot.

2491
04:08:43,273 --> 04:08:45,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you to the committee.

2492
04:08:45,514 --> 04:08:49,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I'm in awe of all of you.

2493
04:08:49,634 --> 04:08:50,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

2494
04:08:50,935 --> 04:08:52,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the city council, please,

2495
04:08:53,788 --> 04:08:56,731
[SPEAKER_07]: put your support in back of this fine work.

2496
04:08:57,632 --> 04:08:58,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2497
04:09:00,555 --> 04:09:01,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Eileen.

2498
04:09:03,599 --> 04:09:09,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any more folks either on Zoom or in person who wish to comment on this publicly?

2499
04:09:13,029 --> 04:09:15,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, are there any Councilors who wish to speak?

2500
04:09:22,100 --> 04:09:38,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, I just wanted to reiterate that I think that this has been, for the most part, for 99% of this discussion, a good faith discussion about the merits of the different proposals that we have on hand.

2501
04:09:39,696 --> 04:09:45,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's important to recognize that the critiques that we might have as councillors of any system

2502
04:09:47,820 --> 04:10:01,029
[SPEAKER_13]: and from the residents are based in good faith efforts to try to understand how politics works, period, but also how the decisions we make can create ripple effects and unintended consequences.

2503
04:10:02,010 --> 04:10:14,419
[SPEAKER_13]: And as Councilors, it is, I think, in our thinking, in our line of work to think through deeply about these concepts and to bring our lived experience there.

2504
04:10:16,708 --> 04:10:28,395
[SPEAKER_13]: That is to say, I really want us to hew away from personal attacks, either on this side of the rail, but especially from the public to that.

2505
04:10:30,120 --> 04:10:32,501
[SPEAKER_13]: for councillors having a difference of opinions.

2506
04:10:32,721 --> 04:10:36,662
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that there are a lot of councillors here who have very different opinions on this one topic.

2507
04:10:38,002 --> 04:10:49,785
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanted to put that out there because I know that this is a deep, rich, and oftentimes tense conversation about something that's gonna be so impactful and so meaningful moving forward.

2508
04:10:52,026 --> 04:10:56,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking from the chair, there are a number of factors that I think

2509
04:10:58,841 --> 04:11:06,783
[SPEAKER_13]: should be answered about the proposal we have right in front of us before I'm ready to support that one in full form.

2510
04:11:06,864 --> 04:11:14,666
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do think that the proposed amendments, for the most part, address those concerns.

2511
04:11:14,866 --> 04:11:19,627
[SPEAKER_13]: In particular, I'm the only person of color on this city council.

2512
04:11:20,128 --> 04:11:23,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I was elected on a platform of racial justice and diversity.

2513
04:11:24,069 --> 04:11:27,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I take that very, very heavily when I consider how I'm gonna vote on this.

2514
04:11:28,132 --> 04:11:49,581
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really important to me that the proposal that passes the city council at the final step is one that really does result in an effect of racial justice, rather than just tokenizing and saying, we have one, you know, one Councilor from the majority minority ward and that's, and we're all good.

2515
04:11:50,341 --> 04:11:52,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that is something that happens.

2516
04:11:54,003 --> 04:11:56,244
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do go back to my, this idea of,

2517
04:11:58,806 --> 04:12:14,126
[SPEAKER_13]: This idea that when politicians are accountable to more voters in general, especially from minority groups and underrepresented groups, marginalized groups, that is truly the better way, the more effective way to reach racial justice.

2518
04:12:14,226 --> 04:12:14,827
[SPEAKER_13]: That being said,

2519
04:12:16,227 --> 04:12:17,988
[SPEAKER_13]: I am still open to word representation.

2520
04:12:18,488 --> 04:12:24,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is, this is, you know, the big substantive meeting that we're going to have on this.

2521
04:12:25,291 --> 04:12:29,233
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it's the end of the discussion, and I know that Councilor Callahan

2522
04:12:29,935 --> 04:12:35,178
[SPEAKER_13]: and Councilor Leming have made it clear that they want to contribute to this conversation.

2523
04:12:35,198 --> 04:12:40,182
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, just by showing up, they've done that, but they also, I believe, want to vote on this as well.

2524
04:12:41,222 --> 04:12:48,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm afraid that voting no on this tonight would foreclose that possibility of letting them have their chance to vote on it as well.

2525
04:12:49,688 --> 04:12:54,151
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why tonight I'm gonna, I plan to vote in favor of it.

2526
04:12:55,592 --> 04:12:58,493
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just me speaking as a councilor from the chair.

2527
04:12:59,554 --> 04:12:59,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2528
04:13:09,177 --> 04:13:26,721
[SPEAKER_04]: To that end, I'd like to further amend my motion, which has been amended by Councilor Collins, to refer these recommendations to a final committee of the whole meeting to consider all of the proposed recommendations of this committee after the three meetings of the Governance Committee.

2529
04:13:28,222 --> 04:13:28,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2530
04:13:29,683 --> 04:13:31,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So, do we have a second on?

2531
04:13:32,144 --> 04:13:33,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just amending my initial motion.

2532
04:13:33,385 --> 04:13:56,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's a second on my initial motion but my initial motion was to make this proposed change and then Councilor Collins amended that to be five at large and four from districts instead of the original proposal and then my final is that this this along with everything else that this committee recommends go to committee the whole for final consideration.

2533
04:13:56,316 --> 04:13:56,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

2534
04:14:00,423 --> 04:14:04,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, do you have that?

2535
04:14:09,906 --> 04:14:16,648
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears, what I have is that you amended your motion to refer these recommendations to a final committee of the whole meeting to consider all the proposed recommendations of this committee.

2536
04:14:17,208 --> 04:14:17,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2537
04:14:26,952 --> 04:14:27,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, President Bears.

2538
04:14:31,595 --> 04:14:33,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I keep seeing my name instead of yours, and I'm like, what?

2539
04:14:34,156 --> 04:14:34,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you.

2540
04:14:34,556 --> 04:14:42,518
[SPEAKER_04]: To further clarify that we hold a committee of the whole to consider all of the recommendations voted on in this committee.

2541
04:14:42,918 --> 04:14:50,820
[SPEAKER_04]: So we voted on some recommendations, amendments earlier in the meeting, the smaller ones to the different sections.

2542
04:14:53,816 --> 04:15:07,099
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially that we, once we've gone through these three meetings where we split it up, we have a meeting where we review the amended red line draft based on the votes of this committee.

2543
04:15:07,739 --> 04:15:10,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Call, sorry, late.

2544
04:15:10,400 --> 04:15:11,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro.

2545
04:15:12,021 --> 04:15:22,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you, should we be voting throughout in that case, and then taking all of what we've voted on and bringing it to committee of the whole

2546
04:15:23,955 --> 04:15:26,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Finally, are you asking President Bears to suffer.

2547
04:15:27,297 --> 04:15:29,618
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what, how, how that would work.

2548
04:15:32,019 --> 04:15:32,499
[SPEAKER_13]: President Bears.

2549
04:15:33,379 --> 04:15:47,266
[SPEAKER_04]: So, basically what I'm just saying is that I think at least as I was understood in this process, up until this point, the recommendations of this committee would have gone directly to the regular meeting.

2550
04:15:48,348 --> 04:15:59,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it makes sense to have a committee of the whole prior to a final vote of the regular meeting so that we can hear from our two colleagues not on the committee in a committee meeting dedicated solely to this topic.

2551
04:16:00,102 --> 04:16:05,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the regular meeting vote would be based on something that the whole council had reported out of committee.

2552
04:16:07,462 --> 04:16:15,467
[SPEAKER_18]: but we should keep voting on these motions as they come up and then presenting this in committee of the whole and then that goes to regular.

2553
04:16:15,508 --> 04:16:25,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, in that committee of the whole that we take all of the motions from this committee and create a red line draft and then we can consider that in committee of the whole before it goes to a regular meeting.

2554
04:16:29,336 --> 04:16:30,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that good?

2555
04:16:31,918 --> 04:16:34,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other comments or questions from councilors before we take this vote?

2556
04:16:37,103 --> 04:16:39,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, is there a second on President Bears' motion?

2557
04:16:39,844 --> 04:16:40,224
[SPEAKER_24]: Second.

2558
04:16:41,525 --> 04:16:42,846
[SPEAKER_13]: From Councilor Collins.

2559
04:16:43,466 --> 04:16:45,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, one second.

2560
04:16:48,508 --> 04:17:01,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I urge this council to listen to the comments from the Collins Center that delaying this because Councilor Callahan and Councilor Leming haven't been heard, I think they've been heard.

2561
04:17:01,694 --> 04:17:04,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they were here, they were part of the discussion.

2562
04:17:05,573 --> 04:17:07,475
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like they haven't been here, they weren't here.

2563
04:17:08,856 --> 04:17:20,244
[SPEAKER_06]: To now move this to another meeting and then to a meeting to vote, let's make a decision, let's move forward so we're not stalling.

2564
04:17:20,284 --> 04:17:23,767
[SPEAKER_06]: This has to go to a vote, to the legislation, this has to go to the state.

2565
04:17:24,667 --> 04:17:29,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that we keep kicking this can down the road and we're gonna be exactly where we are.

2566
04:17:29,411 --> 04:17:33,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I think we entrusted

2567
04:17:36,002 --> 04:17:40,626
[SPEAKER_06]: a group of citizens to do the work for this community.

2568
04:17:41,467 --> 04:17:46,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it's been loud and clear what they've shared.

2569
04:17:47,572 --> 04:17:48,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would be

2570
04:17:49,907 --> 04:18:01,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I would disagree with what motions of forward and put forth my motion to move forward with this vote with the ward representation of eight and then the three at large.

2571
04:18:02,490 --> 04:18:05,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's get this process moving so we can move method forward.

2572
04:18:05,370 --> 04:18:05,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2573
04:18:07,271 --> 04:18:09,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2574
04:18:10,051 --> 04:18:12,332
[SPEAKER_13]: I have Councilor Lazzaro and then President Burson.

2575
04:18:13,758 --> 04:18:26,346
[SPEAKER_18]: I would disagree with the characterization of kicking the can down the road where I would call it giving it due diligence and we're just gonna have to work really hard and we're gonna have to go to a lot of meetings and I think that we will just do it quicker.

2576
04:18:26,867 --> 04:18:30,449
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll just have to meet more frequently and we'll get it done.

2577
04:18:32,270 --> 04:18:34,112
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm willing to work hard if you're willing to work hard.

2578
04:18:34,432 --> 04:18:34,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2579
04:18:37,749 --> 04:18:56,030
[SPEAKER_04]: just to outline the schedule we're scheduled again to meet on February 4th and then February 19th this would have essentially the only difference here would be considering this on February 25th or March 11th at our regular meeting

2580
04:18:57,595 --> 04:19:00,976
[SPEAKER_04]: we would need to consider it on the 11th if we tried to schedule a committee of the whole in advance.

2581
04:19:01,036 --> 04:19:05,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be a two weeks of additional consideration.

2582
04:19:05,296 --> 04:19:22,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And that does assume that we get through everything in the three governance committee meetings and we don't have to move to the governance committee scheduled for March 4th, which would have put us at March 11th anyway, which is ahead of our goal of getting this done by the end of March.

2583
04:19:24,487 --> 04:19:43,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess just to the call-in center representatives in terms of moving this through legislatively, is there a material difference of us reporting this to the mayor and the mayor submitting this to the council in early March versus late March in terms of the legislature getting this done in time for us to?

2584
04:19:43,762 --> 04:19:43,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2585
04:19:44,142 --> 04:19:47,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's in April when we'll start the budget.

2586
04:19:47,865 --> 04:19:49,587
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2587
04:19:49,647 --> 04:19:53,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to try to get this to them in early March then as we originally planned.

2588
04:19:53,790 --> 04:19:53,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

2589
04:19:54,508 --> 04:19:57,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

2590
04:19:57,869 --> 04:19:59,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other comments before we take this vote?

2591
04:20:01,230 --> 04:20:03,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

2592
04:20:14,774 --> 04:20:15,374
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears?

2593
04:20:15,655 --> 04:20:15,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2594
04:20:16,835 --> 04:20:17,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins?

2595
04:20:17,935 --> 04:20:18,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2596
04:20:19,416 --> 04:20:20,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro?

2597
04:20:27,734 --> 04:20:30,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, three in favor, two opposed, motion passes.

2598
04:20:34,457 --> 04:20:38,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have any final words or motions?

2599
04:20:44,181 --> 04:20:45,882
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a motion adjourned from President Bears.

2600
04:20:47,057 --> 04:20:47,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a second on that?

2601
04:20:47,998 --> 04:20:49,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

2602
04:20:50,479 --> 04:20:55,602
[SPEAKER_13]: As I give the clerk time to type, I want to thank everyone for staying on so late into this meeting.

2603
04:20:55,723 --> 04:20:58,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you to the Collins Center for answering so many questions.

2604
04:20:58,865 --> 04:21:01,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you to the members of the Charter Study Committee.

2605
04:21:01,947 --> 04:21:03,408
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we really grilled you.

2606
04:21:04,728 --> 04:21:12,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And especially a deep thank you to Chair McDonald for the hard work, the difficult answers that you gave to us as well.

2607
04:21:14,587 --> 04:21:16,849
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, looking forward to the next few meetings on this.

2608
04:21:17,130 --> 04:21:18,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we can get a lot, a lot done.

2609
04:21:19,512 --> 04:21:19,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2610
04:21:20,833 --> 04:21:23,115
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're ready to motion to adjourn.

04:21:23,135 --> 04:21:23,236

It's a lack of.
